\n\nBecause members of the White House press corps all think and act in unison, as if they are members of a guild, they’ve already lost the argument.\n\nConsider that none of them saw any sign of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline — until it jeopardized his chances of beating Trump.\n\nInstantly, they all joined the call for Biden to step aside and anoint Kamala Harris as the Dem nominee.\n\nIndependence daze\n\nStill, the vague claim of “independence” is the only argument they have and it’s not a coincidence that both the Times and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting used the word to defend their perks and declare themselves holier than thou.\n\nIn a recent article that covered nearly two full pages in the print edition, the Times sneered at White House attempts to broaden access to the president in the Oval Office and briefing room by making space for newcomers, including bloggers and podcasters.\n\nTo the Gray Lady, letting in upstarts who don’t subscribe to leftist pieties is an affront to all that is good and decent.\n\n“Longtime White House reporters say the result has been an erosion of their independence,” the Times sneered, without defining what independence it was referring to.\n\nIt went on to claim that adding newer media outlets “has undercut the briefing as a space to relay accurate information to the American public and hold the president to account.”\n\nIt offers no evidence of those claims, except to show that the newer outlets sometimes get to ask questions of the press secretary that are different from the ones the Times thinks should be asked.\n\nHeaven forbid!\n\nThat’s the left in a nutshell: Diversity is a good idea as long as everybody thinks alike!\n\nNPR reacted with the same don’t-you know-who-we-are arrogance.\n\nIt said Trump’s executive order defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn funds PBS and NPR, is “an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR . . . and locally owned and operated the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information.”\n\nSo let’s get this straight: By saving taxpayers $500 million a year by pulling the funding, Trump is violating the First Amendment rights of both recipients and listeners.\n\nIs there a lawyer in the house?\n\nFree speech gatekeepers\n\nThe sense of entitlement perfectly captures the arrogance of the leftist outlets. \n\nThey not only want a monopoly, they also demand that taxpayers fund it.\n\nWhat they really fear is that breaking their stranglehold will lead to the public hearing different perspectives and that will be the end of their cookie jar.\n\nThink about the implications: These are the supposed guardians of the First Amendment, yet they try to squelch the free flow of information because it threatens their sinecures and control of what the public knows about its government.\n\nBad as it is, the position would be more defensible if the legacy media didn’t distort everything by putting their leftist spin on all news and commentary. \n\nTheir lack of fairness and balance is the ultimate reason why they should lose their dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the second Trump White House sees the pattern and is determined to throw open the doors.\n\nMoreover, the administration is wise to the grifters’ false claims of being independent and is now insisting they actually live up to the word.\n\nIn his Friday executive order ending funding for PBS and NPR, Trump cited why the outlets should be forced to do without government money.\n\n“Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,” the president wrote.","summary":"When there is a Republican president, the leftist-dominated White House press corps likes to gang up and try to put him on defense.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/03/opinion/michael-goodwin-the-left-wing-media-creates-false-allegations-with-trump-back-in-the-oval-office/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/u-s-president-donald-trump-103579181-e1746319677271.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 01:11:20","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":317564924,"title":"Photos and Video Show Bernie Sanders Crowd Size in Swing State Trump Won","text":"A roaring crowd of thousands filled Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Saturday to hear progressive Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders blast President Donald Trump and what he called the billionaire class gripping the nation's politics. Organizers estimate the crowd numbered between 5,000 and 6,000.Newsweek reached out to Sanders' spokesperson via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersPennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, was critical to Trump's 2024 presidential victory and has reemerged as a decisive swing state heading into the 2026 midterms.Trump's surge in support in smaller cities like Allentown and Scranton helped secure the state over Kamala Harris in November, flipping several counties that leaned more Democratic in prior elections.Sanders' rally in Bethlehem, located in Lehigh County, which swung over 5 percent more Republican compared to 2020 — highlights progressive efforts to reclaim lost ground among working-class voters in the Rust Belt. His populist economic message appears aimed at those same disillusioned constituents who have drifted away from the Democratic Party in recent years.What To KnowLehigh University's sports arena hosted the 83-year-old independent senator as he made his third Pennsylvania stop in just three days on his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour.Speaking just miles from Gettysburg, Sanders invoked Abraham Lincoln's vision of government \"of the people, by the people, for the people,\" contrasting it with what he called a modern system run by billionaires.Sanders name-checked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying all three tech tycoons stood behind Trump at his 2025 inauguration and represent the consolidation of wealth and power undermining democracy.\"Right now, we have a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, and we are not going to accept that,\" Sanders said, drawing thunderous applause from the crowd.As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has led the charge on cuts to federal spending, and as the owner of X, formerly Twitter, has made himself a top advocate for the administration's policies through his prolific social media activity.Sanders criticized both Trump and Democratic leadership, saying the latter's failure over the past half-century to stand up for working Americans helped pave the way for Trump's rise. He condemned cuts to Medicaid, threats to Social Security, and growing corporate influence in Washington.What People Are SayingSenator Bernie Sanders took to X, formerly Twitter on Saturday: \"More than 5,000 people came out in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to stand up for the needs of working families against the billionaire class, against powerful special interests, against enormous corporate greed, and against Trump's authoritarianism.\"He added: \"That's what this movement is about.\"Anna Bahr, director of communications for Sanders, told Newsweek in an email on Friday: \"The arrogance, selfishness, greed, and exploitation of the current oligarchic regime – as personified by Elon Musk, but also by many other billionaires like Zuckerberg, Bezos, etc – have generated a period of populist revolt that unites working people across the political spectrum.\"Billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk on Sanders' recent Denver, Colorado rally in a March 23 X post: \"The Dems just move around the same group of paid 'protesters.'\" In a separate post on April 11, Musk wrote: \"Bernie is just fully communist.\"Sanders told rallygoers at Saturday's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" event in Bethlehem: \"The Democratic Party is going to finally have to say, 'We're going to stand with those people.

The party has been plagued with infighting and finger pointing following Democrats' loss to President Donald Trump and Republicans in last year's election.Ocasio-Cortez, 35, is floated by many analysts as a possible 2028 contender. Meanwhile, she and Sanders, 83, have held a series of massive rallies as part of \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour across the country, including in states and districts won by Trump. Due to Sanders' age, most analysts do not believe the progressive senator is a likely 2028 contender.What to KnowMcCarthy, a Trump ally who resigned from Congress in 2023, appeared on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday. During the show, Maher asked the former GOP congressman who he sees as the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential ticket.\"Right now? Bernie and AOC,\" McCarthy responded quickly.Maher expressed skepticism, pushing back on the assessment.\"They've got the biggest crowds,\" McCarthy said. \"It won't sustain itself, but right now they [Democrats] have no leader.\"Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are \"going to lead right now,\" the Republican added later in the segment. \"I'm just saying who's in the lead right now.

A survey by Quantus Insights carried out among 1,000 registered voters from April 21 to 23 showed Harris with 30 percent and Ocasio-Cortez in second place at 14 percent. Notably, Sanders registered at 6 percent in the same poll.What People Are SayingAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez when asked by a Fox News reporter last week about a possible presidential run: \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights.

Now, the second Trump administration is deploying that same historically loaded label to cast his opponents — from judges to educators — as threats to American identity, culture and values.\n\nWhy? Trump himself explained the strategy last year when he described how he planned to defeat his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House election.\n\n“All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country,” he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club in August.\n\nTrump did just that — branding Harris “comrade Kamala” — and he won in November. With the assent of more than 77 million Americans who cast ballots — 49.9% of the vote — Trump is carrying that strategy into his second term.\n\nWhat he’s talking about is not actually ‘communism’\n\nIn 2025, communism wields big influence in countries such as China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. But not the United States.\n\n“The core of communism is the belief that governments can do better than markets in providing goods and services. There are very, very few people in the West who seriously believe that,” said Raymond Robertson of the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government & Public Service. “Unless they are arguing that the government should run U.S. Steel and Tesla, they are simply not communists.”\n\nThe word “communist,” on the other hand, can carry great emotional power as a rhetorical tool, even now. It’s all the more potent as a pejorative — though frequently inaccurate, even dangerous — amid the contemporary flash of social media and misinformation. After all, the fear and paranoia of the Russian Revolution, the “Red Scare,” World War II, McCarthyism and the Cold War are fading into the 20th century past.\n\nBut Trump, 78 and famous for labeling people he views as obstacles, remembers.\n\n“We cannot allow a handful of communist radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws,” Trump said Tuesday in Michigan while celebrating his first 100 days in office. The White House did not reply to a request for what Trump means when he calls someone a “communist.”\n\nThe timing of his use of “communist” is worth noting.\n\nTrump’s Michigan speech came during a week of dicey economic and political news. Days earlier, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs published a poll showing that more Americans disagree with Trump’s priorities so far than agree with them, and that many Republicans are ambivalent about his choices of focus. After the speech, the government reported that the economy shrank during the first quarter of 2025 as Trump’s tariffs disrupted business.\n\nOn Thursday, senior presidential aide Stephen Miller stepped to the White House podium and uttered the same c-word four times in about 35 minutes during a denunciation of past policies on transgender, diversity and immigration issues.\n\n“These are a few of the areas in which President Trump has fought the cancerous, communist woke culture that was destroying this country,” Miller told reporters.\n\nHis collection of words offered a selection of clickbait for social media users, as well as terms that could catch the attention of older Americans. Voters over age 45 narrowly voted for Trump over his Democratic rivals in 2020 and 2024.\n\nSmack in the middle of Miller’s sentence: “communist.”\n\n“It tends to be a term that is loaded with negative affect, particularly for older Americans who grew up during the Cold War,” said Jacob Neiheisel, a political communications expert at the University at Buffalo. “Appending emotionally laden terms to political adversaries is a way to minimize their legitimacy in the eyes of the public and paint them in a negative light.”\n\nA ‘Red Scare’-era figure influenced a young Trump\n\nThe threat that communists could influence or even obliterate the United States hovered over the country for decades and drove some of the country’s ugliest chapters.\n\nThe years after World War I and the Russian Revolution in 1917, along with a wave of immigrants, led to what’s known as the “Red Scare” of 1920, a period of intense paranoia about the potential for a communist-led revolution in America.\n\n“McCarthyism” after World War II meant the hunt for supposed communists. It’s named for Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican who conducted televised hearings at the dawn of the Cold War that drove anti-communist fears to new heights with a series of threats, innuendos and untruths.\n\nCulturally, the merest suggestion that someone was “soft” on communism could end careers and ruin lives. “Blacklists” of suspected communists proliferated in Hollywood and beyond. McCarthy fell into disgrace and died in 1957.\n\nThe senator’s chief counsel during the hearings, Roy Cohn, became Trump’s mentor and fixer in the 1980s and 1990s, when Trump rose as a real estate mogul in New York. The Cold War was more than three decades old. The threat of nuclear war was pervasive.\n\nCommunism started to collapse in 1989 and the Soviet Union was dissolved two years later. It’s now Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut communism — at least in one form — lives on in China, with which Trump is waging a trade war that could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States. By week’s end, Trump was acknowledging the potential consequences of his government stepping in: Americans might soon not be able to buy what they want, or they might be forced to pay more. He insisted China would be hurt more by the tariffs.\n\nThe real modern debate, Robertson says, is not between capitalism and communism, but about how much the government needs to step in — and when. He suggests that Trump is not really debating communism vs. capitalism anyway.\n\n“Calling people who advocate for slightly more government involvement ‘communists’ is typical misleading political rhetoric that, unfortunately, works really well with busy voters who do not have a lot of time to think about technical definitions and economic paradigms,” he said in an email. “It is also really helpful (to Trump) because it is inflammatory, making people angry, which can be addictive.”","summary":"the second Trump administration is deploying that same historically loaded label to cast his opponents — from judges to educators — as threats to American identity, culture and values.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/03/trump-brands-his-opponents-as-communists-a-label-loaded-with-the-baggage-of-american-history/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump_Communism_Explainer_26532-1.jpg?w=1024&h=654","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 20:46:05","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":317534784,"title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Heckled at New York City Event","text":"A pro-Palestinian activist and constituent heckled Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during an event in Queens, New York, on Friday, repeatedly calling her a \"war criminal\" over her stance on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.Newsweek has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's press team for comment via email on Saturday.Why It Matters Ocasio-Cortez is often considered one of the moreprogressive members of the Democratic Party. She has recently been touring the country with Senator Bernie Sanders' holding rallies to mobilize and \"fight oligarchy\" and oppose President Donald Trump.The ongoing war in Gaza, which has resumed after a temporary ceasefire, remains a flashpoint in U.S. politics. Trump has voiced his strong support for Israel, floated the idea of taking over the Gaza Strip, and has condemned pro-Palestinian protests on school campuses. He has also supported the arrests of some protestors such as Mahmoud Khalil.The Democrat has accused Israel of carrying out a \"genocide,\" claims the country has dismissed, but hasn't consistently used this characterization. In the early months of the war, she called for \"conditioning aid to Israel,\" as a \"responsible course of action,\" to ensure that \"public resources do not facilitate gross violations of human rights and international law.\"She has also called out a pro-Palestinian protest in New York City as \"unacceptable and harmful\" for alleged expressions of antisemitism.Pro-Palestinian activists have confronted Ocasio-Cortez before, saying she's not doing enough for the Palestinian cause. Many progressive voters in the 2024 presidential election were frustrated with then-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over the issue, pushing that the U.S. did not do enough to halt Israel's military campaigns and provide humanitarian aid to Gazans.What To KnowAt a Friday town hall meeting, a constituent, identified as Jennifer Kings, stood up as Ocasio-Cortez was speaking, and shouted \"I am a health care worker, and I want to know what you're doing about the genocide in Gaza.\"She continued by calling the representative a \"war criminal.\" Kings has shared videos and images from the town hall on her social media account. Her account features several other pro-Palestinian posts and videos, and recent Instagram stories calling out Representative Ocasio-Cortez.Newsweek has reached out to Kings on Instagram for comment and confirmation via email on Saturday.\"At least with the Republican Party we know what we are dealing with, you're a snake,\" she can be heard saying in another video. She was escorted out of the town hall, but not before she told the congresswoman to \"stop the genocide. Do something,\" and repeatedly stating, \"Shame on you.\"Following her removal, Ocasio-Cortez said: \"I more than welcome people who disagree or are super pissed off at me for any issue to come, but we have some ground rules here. Please wait for the Q&A because we don't want to deprive all of our neighbors of the ability to have information and hear them respond to it.\"Kings' posted an Instagram Story of the town hall with the words, \"Do you notice how Gaza isn't even on the agenda???? Shame on these fascists.\" She has over 53,000 followers on the social media platform.The most recent conflict in Gaza, which began after Hamas launched a fatal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 people hostage. The war has since spread across multiple fronts in the Middle East. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza reports more than 52,400 people have been killed. Israel has repeatedly bombed and blockaded the enclave, and aid trucks have reportedly not entered the area since early March.Israel has been repeatedly withheld and blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. In May 2024, Ocasio-Cortez wrote about the U.S.'s hold on ammunition to Israel, \"The United States has an obligation to uphold its own laws and to respect human rights globally. Amidst the Israeli gov's siege on Gaza, blocking humanitarian aid, and threats on Rafah, withholding US military aid is a major development towards ceasefire.\"In November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in part finding him guilty of \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare.\"What People Are Saying Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post on Saturday morning: \"Thank you to all our neighbors who joined us for yesterday's town hall—it was our largest district town hall ever! NY-14, I love you and I'm fighting for you.\"Tom Fletcher, the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and relief coordinator said in a statement on Thursday: \"Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip. Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope. It inflicts a cruel collective punishment. Blocking aid kills.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X on April 30: \"Israel is waging a just war with just means against Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization, that murdered 1200 innocent people on October 7 and still holds 59 innocent people hostage.\"What Happens Next?Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled. Israeli media has reported that the country's security Cabinet has approved plans for an expanded operation in Gaza.Ocasio-Cortez's current term ends on January 3, 2027.

The move comes at a time of mounting economic pressures for Amazon, which continues to navigate volatile global trade dynamics under U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff regime.Share Sale Plan RevealedThe online retail giant, in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, said Bezos may sell as much as 25 million shares over a period ending on May 29, 2026, subject to certain conditions. At Amazon's current stock price, this would amount to nearly $4.75 billion in value, as mentioned in a report by Newsweek.Bezos, who retired as CEO in 2021 but still serves as executive chair, now owns around 909 million shares—around 8.58% of Amazon's outstanding stock, as per Yahoo Finance. Even after the planned sale, he would still maintain considerable control and influence over the company he founded in 1994.Trade Tensions Add Economic HeadwindsAmazon's news comes amidst ongoing trade volatility ignited by President Trump's tariff initiatives, which have been admitted to be directly affecting the company's business. In its latest quarterly report, Amazon identified unpredictable fluctuations in global trade and tariff policies as a pending issue.The site is a key point of entry for Chinese vendors in Western economies and is greatly dependent on China-based suppliers for finished products and parts. With retaliatory tariffs still playing out between the U.S. and its trading partners, the specter of rising costs for goods hangs over Amazon and its customer base.Tariffs and Pricing Transparency ControversyEarlier this year, news broke that Amazon was mulling showing tariff prices in addition to product prices on its Haul platform, a feature that is distinct from its core site. This provoked a sharp reaction from the White House, which branded the suggestion a hostile and political act. President Trump then said that he had spoken directly to Bezos about the matter. Jeff Bezos was very good. He was great. He quickly fixed the problem, Trump said to the press. He did a great thing, and he is a good person. The incident reflects the political delicacy that encircles communications relating to tariffs and the careful balancing act performed by companies while trying to provide customers with openness without provoking the wrath of the government.Inflation Fears and Industry ConsequencesWidely persistent import taxes will tend to push consumer prices up and further increase inflationary forces, economists warn. Other big-box retailers, such as Amazon rivals Temu and Shein, have already blamed tariffs for prices going up.As per Rob Lalka, a Tulane University professor, the quick response of the administration to Amazon's pricing strategy shows concern about companies channeling customer discontent. Tariffs inject uncertainty, and businesses like Amazon are supposed to take the hit while keeping consumers in the know, without crossing political red lines, Lalka said, as quoted in a report by Newsweek. Bezos Aligns Closer With TrumpIn recent weeks, Jeff Bezos has gone out of his way to try to repair his relationship with President Trump. After a few months of tense interactions, Bezos congratulated Trump on his election victory, invited him to Mar-a-Lago for a private dinner, and even held off on a scheduled editorial endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris by The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.Bezos also showed up at Trump's inauguration last month, sitting in a prominent seat behind the president with other tech leaders. The rest of the business community is still skeptical, however, as the administration's take-it, take-it-again approach to tariffs keeps investors scrambling to adjust market predictions.FAQsHow many Amazon shares is Jeff Bezos planning to sell?Jeff Bezos may sell up to 25 million Amazon shares by May 29, 2026, as disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.How much money could Bezos make from this sale?At Amazon’s current stock price, the sale could bring in an estimated $4.75 billion.","summary":"Jeff Bezos is set to sell up to 25 million Amazon shares, worth nearly $4.75 billion, according to a recent SEC filing, signaling a major financial move amid ongoing global trade instability.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/why-is-jeff-bezos-planning-to-sell-up-to-25-million-amazon-shares/articleshow/120858139.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120858187,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-16408,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 19:02:00","author":"Global Desk","authors":["Global Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.066},{"id":317509782,"title":"Donald Trump's Approval Rating Underwater in Every Swing State—Poll","text":"President Donald Trump's approval rating is underwater in every swing state, as his approval rating has also plunged nationwide, new polling shows with registered voters.Why It MattersThe president's approval ratings in swing states offer an early snapshot of how voters in critical battlegrounds are responding to his second term—and how his political strength may be starting to crack.With the 2026 midterms on the horizon, regional shifts in support could reshape campaign strategies, influence down-ballot races and determine which states become critical.What To KnowThere are six states that have become the key swing states in recent presidential elections: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. All of these states went for former Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2020 election but flipped to Trump in the 2024 election.Most of these states—including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—had also been won by Trump in the 2016 election, before Biden flipped them in 2020. North Carolina has also been viewed as a key battleground in recent presidential cycles, however Trump carried the state in 2016, 2020 and 2024.Here's a closer look at what the polling shows in these critical battleground states.ArizonaAn online tracking poll by Civiqs shows 49 percent of Arizona respondents disapprove of Trump, while 47 percent approve. An additional 4 percent said they neither approve nor disapprove of the president.In the 2024 election, Trump carried Arizona with 52.2 percent of the vote compared to the Democratic candidate former Vice President Kamala Harris' 46.7 percent.The Civiqs online poll is updated regularly and has been running since January 20, 2025, the first day of Trump's second term. Nationwide it includes nearly 23,000 responses.GeorgiaIn the southern state of Georgia, Trump's approval rating is even further underwater. The Civiqs data shows 51 percent in the state disapprove of the president and 45 percent approve—a margin of negative 6 points against Trump. An additional 4 percent said they neither approve nor disapprove.Trump won Georgia with 50.7 percent of the vote last year, compared to Harris' 48.5 percent.MichiganThe president is 4 points underwater in Michigan, with 50 percent of the state disapproving and 46 percent approving. An additional 4 percent of Michiganders neither approve nor disapprove.Trump carried the Midwestern state by 1.4 percent in 2024, winning 49.7 percent compared to Harris' 48.3 percent.NevadaTrump's approval rating in Nevada stands at 47 percent while his disapproval rating is 2 points higher, at 49 percent. As with the previously mentioned states, 4 percent of respondents neither approve nor disapprove.Trump flipped Nevada in 2024, which was the first time a Republican presidential candidate had won in the state in two decades. He secured 50.6 percent of the state's votes compared to 47.5 percent that went to his Democratic opponent.PennsylvaniaIn Pennsylvania, Trump is underwater by 6 points, with 51 percent disapproving and 45 percent approving. Again, 4 percent neither approve nor disapprove.The president won the Keystone State with 50.4 percent of the vote in 2024, as his Democratic rival received 48.7 percent.WisconsinIn Wisconsin, 51 percent approve of Trump and 46 percent disapprove, a negative margin of 5 percent. An additional 3 percent neither approve nor disapprove.Trump carried the Midwestern state by less than 1 percent in 2024. He won 49.6 percent of the vote and Harris won 48.7 percent.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social last week: \"The Polls from the Fake News are, like the News itself, FAKE! We are doing GREAT, better than ever before.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, when asked by CNN last week if he was worried about Trump's approval rating: \"No, I'm not worried at all. I just had a great meeting with the president at the White House and he's in good spirts, and we are as well... We're very bullish on it [2026] ... We are playing offense.\"Jack Dozier, the deputy director at Yale Youth Poll to Newsweek this week: \"Polls now are gauging only the first 100 days of Trump's nonconsecutive administrations, so any potential lasting damage has yet to be revealed. This is something we'll better have a grasp of as a polling community about a year into the presidency. At this point of the Biden-Harris administration, approval ratings were through the roof! So, only time can tell.\"Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday: \"Let me explain to you why Donald Trump's sinking approval ratings matter. His enablers and backers will get cold feet as they feel the country turning against him. And it's proof that our activism and our protest is working.\"What Happens Next?The elections later this year in Virginia and New Jersey will be the first major bellwether of how voters are feeling under Trump's leadership. Analysts will be watching the results to see if Republicans or Democrats make gain.Then the 2026 midterm elections will be a major test for the two major parties, as control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs. Historically, the sitting president's party loses seats in the midterm, with Democrats aiming to capitalize on this trend to take back control of Congress.","summary":"The president's approval rating has plunged nationwide, including in critical battleground states.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-rating-underwater-every-swing-statepoll-2067663","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638142/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 18:00:15","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":317493444,"title":"Trump’s attacks on the press threaten a critical check on government","text":"No president of the United States has ever loved the American news media. \n\nMost have barely tolerated the institution that our Founding Fathers called the Fourth Estate. The press were to be a watchdog of the government, which the Founding Fathers distrusted. \n\nIf the news media are doing their job, print, broadcast and digital media are holding politicians accountable for their actions, educating the public about government at all levels and uncovering wrongdoing when they find it. \n\nThe last president who seemed to enjoy the give-and-take with the media was John F. Kennedy. He would privately have drinks after work with reporters and was a close friend to Ben Bradley, who became editor of the Washington Post. \n\nBut no president—not even Richard Nixon —has openly hated the news media and acted on it as much as President Donald J. Trump. During his second campaign for the presidency, President Trump labeled the news media “the enemy of the people.” \n\nOnce elected, retaliation by the president was swift. There has been a full-out assault on the news media. With actions, not just rhetoric.\n\nHe personally sued CBS’ “60 Minutes” for $20 billion claiming a filmed interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris was edited in such a way as to make her look better. Trump called it election interference. CBS’ parent company, Paramount, needs the Federal Communications Commission’s permission to finish the sale to Skydance, an entertainment company.\nThe White House banned the venerable Associated Press (AP) from access to various events and activities because The AP refused to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in stories, which Trump demanded. The federal courts have reversed the full ban, but the wire service has still not regained the same level of access it previously had.\nThe Administration, with the support of Republicans in Congress, has threatened to defund both the independently-run Public Broadcasting System (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) because they are allegedly “left leaning.” Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission is investigating whether NPR and PBS stations are broadcasting “underwriting” announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements. \nTrying to crack down on leaks from within the administration, the Justice Department will once again use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make “unauthorized disclosures” to journalists. The action reverses a Biden administration policy that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations — a practice long decried by news organizations and press freedom groups.\nThe administration is shuttering or dramatically cutting back on staffing the Freedom of Information Act offices of nearly all federal agencies. These are the staffers who are required to review and release government documents—with exceptions of course—to the media and the public upon request.\n\nAnd these are only a few examples. \n\nPresident Trump has every right to criticize the news media, and he has plenty of company. Over the last three decades, public confidence in the accuracy and credibility of the media has plummeted, though support for the First Amendment continues.\n\nHowever, the right of free speech extends not just to individuals. It also applies to the news media, which remain a primary source of news to Americans. Neither the news media nor individuals should be punished for what they say, unless their words break a law. Examples are our libel laws, which protect against defamation, or laws prohibiting speech that incite panic or violence, such as yelling fire in a crowded theater. \n\nBut punishing news media he doesn’t like is exactly what Trump is doing. \n\nA functioning democracy is dependent on an open exchange of ideas. If people are afraid to openly express their views, and I know many who are increasingly fearful of government retaliation, it is our country that is the loser. \n\nBob Rawitch is a former L.A. Times editor and former chair of the First Amendment Coalition","summary":"Punishing news media he doesn’t like is exactly what Trump is doing. ","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/03/trumps-attacks-on-the-press-threaten-a-critical-check-on-government/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25121506088685.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 16:31:46","author":"Bob Rawitch","authors":["Bob Rawitch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":317495634,"title":"Trump Posts AI Photo Of Himself As The Pope After Joking He Would Like To Be The Next Pontiff","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPresident Donald Trump posted an AI-generated photo of himself as the pope Friday evening, sharing the image a few days after he jokingly suggested he would like to be the next head of the Catholic Church, which will soon vote on the late Pope Francis’ successor.\n\nTrump posted the photo Friday night.

In February, Trump shared an AI video showing him, Tesla chief and presidential adviser Elon Musk and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu vacationing at a Trump-branded resort in the Gaza Strip, which Trump has expressed interest in taking from the roughly two million Palestinians who live in the region. The president also shared AI-generated images suggesting pop star Taylor Swift supported his presidential campaign. However, Swift later endorsed former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump has made some outlandish proposals during his first 100 days in office. The president recently said he is not joking about possibly running for president a third time despite Constitutional restrictions against three terms, claiming there are “some well-known loopholes” that could get him another four years in office. Trump’s official store even started selling “Trump 2028” hats last week. However, the White House said Trump was “trolling” when it came to running for a third term. Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Friday he would let Trump speak to his political future, noting the president “loves to have a good time with the American media.” Trump has also proposed making Canada the 51st state, an idea first taken as a joke that the president later confirmed was a legitimate idea. Trump has claimed Canada “would be much better off” as a U.S. state—an idea outright rejected by Canada, and a taunt that helped secure Prime Minister Mark Carney’s election victory last month.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Confirms He’s Serious About Wanting Canada As 51st State (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

They’re great on border security but on the economy and overall approval, it’s a little underwater,” Baier said, before asking how the vice president interpreted that.\n\n“I’m a firm believer that in the modern era, 2025, opinion pollsters don’t know how to capture most Americans,” Vance said. He then pointed to “every mainstream media pollster” who predicted Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election.\n\n“If you do a good job, you worry about the polls later, the politics will take care of itself,” Vance said. “I really am skeptical of these polls. I also don’t really care that much about the polls, even if they were accurate.”\n\n“If we do a good job, if people see the results, then in three years people will be talking about what a great job President Donald J. Trump and JD Vance did, then that’s all I care about,” he added.\n\nSocial media users roasted the vice president’s response.\n\n“Not sure that attitude will help in 2028,” one X user wrote.\n\nAnother mocked: “‘Polls not great? Don't care.’ – the groundbreaking political strategy of simply deciding reality is irrelevant when it's unflattering.”\n\n“Oh, you don’t care about public opinion? Bold stance for someone hired by the public,” another chimed in.\n\nYet another remarked that if the administration had received favorable poll numbers, he would definitely care: “Of course you don’t…bet you if they were the opposite direction, y’all would be all over it [and] praising it! Clowns in the White House!”\n\nVance’s remarks come after a month of a turbulent stock market. Wall Street has seen record lows and highs as Trump announced an across-the-board tariffs, only to pause the policy for the most part for a 90-day span while the president raised China’s levies to 145 percent. The tariffs on other nations are set to take effect in early July. \n\nThe administration has also taken controversial steps to execute its mass deportation plan, removing dozens of immigrants, including children, without, as judges have said, “meaningful” due process.","summary":"‘I’m a firm believer that in the modern era, 2025, opinion pollsters don’t know how to capture most Americans,’ the vice president said on Fox News","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-fox-news-polls-b2744326.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/03/14/12/Vice-President-JD-Vance-dismissed-the-low-approval-ratings-in-recent-polls-saying-he-doesnt-care-spa.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mkdy67q9-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-03 16:02:58","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.223},{"id":317488536,"title":"Running influencer under fire for interview with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Mackz chats to Leavitt about her role within the Trump administration. \n\nLeavitt had previously began working in the White House as an intern during Trump’s last term. Now, the 27-year-old has been made the head of press and communications within the administration.\n\nInside Leavitt’s office, the press secretary points out a meme she has pinned to her corkboard that shows an image of a man holding his hand up in refusal at a brain being offered to him, saying ‘No thanks. I won’t be needing that. I believe everything the legacy media shows’.\n\n“So look, we want critical thinking around here,” Leavitt says. \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing at the White House in Washington, DC.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nMackz captioned the video, “From being at the White House last year speaking on a mental health panel and meeting President Biden, to being back again this year – [Karoline Leavitt] – thank you for having us. Truly surreal to walk through a place with so much history and meaning.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMackz previously conducted one of her running videos with senator Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s running mate in presidential election. \n\nWalz’s daughter Hope posted a video criticising Mackz for her platforming of Leavitt. \n\nSpeaking on how she was raised to view running as a “privilege”, Hope Walz said, “I don’t really understand how platforming an administration that cuts mental health services, cuts funding and shipments to food banks, is hurting the climate, sending people away without due process, villainising minorities… all those things are preventing people from getting into the running community, which is what I thought Kate’s platform was for.”\n\nShe continued to say that she wasn’t telling anyone how to run their social media page, but that it was “insulting” to her father Tim Walz to leave the video that Mackz had made with him pinned on the top of her page. \n\n“You don’t get to both sides this. It’s not both sides.”\n\nWalz said that she had met Mackz when she had filmed the video with Tim Walz in the lead-up to the election, and that she was “very impressed” with her at the time. \n\n“This is just extremely disappointing.”\n\nThe Trump administration has utilised influencers in the past to promote its ideals to younger audiences.

Now, the second Trump administration is deploying that same historically loaded label to cast his opponents - from judges to educators - as threats to American identity, culture and values. Why? Trump himself explained the strategy last year when he described how he planned to defeat his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House election. All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country, he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club in August. Trump did just that - branding Harris comrade Kamala - and he won in November. With the assent of more than 77 million Americans who cast ballots - 49.9 per cent of the vote - Trump is carrying that strategy into his second term. 'What he's talking about is not actually communism' In 2025, communism wields big influence in countries such as China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. But not the United States. The core of communism is the belief that governments can do better than markets in providing goods and services. There are very, very few people in the West who seriously believe that, said Raymond Robertson of the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government & Public Service. Unless they are arguing that the government should run US Steel and Tesla, they are simply not communists. The word communist, on the other hand, can carry great emotional power as a rhetorical tool, even now. It's all the more potent as a pejorative - though frequently inaccurate, even dangerous - amid the contemporary flash of social media and misinformation. After all, the fear and paranoia of the Russian Revolution, the Red Scare, World War II, McCarthyism and the Cold War are fading into the 20th century past. But Trump, 78, and famous for labelling people he views as obstacles, remembers. We cannot allow a handful of communist radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws, Trump said Tuesday in Michigan while celebrating his first 100 days in office. The White House did not reply to a request for what Trump means when he calls someone a communist. The timing of his use of communist is worth noting. Trump's Michigan speech came during a week of dicey economic and political news. Days earlier, The Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs published a poll showing that more Americans disagree with Trump's priorities so far than agree with them, and that many Republicans are ambivalent about his choices of focus. After the speech, the government reported that the economy shrank during the first quarter of 2025 as Trump's tariffs disrupted business. On Thursday, senior presidential aide Stephen Miller stepped to the White House podium and uttered the same c-word four times in about 35 minutes during a denunciation of past policies on transgender, diversity and immigration issues. These are a few of the areas in which President Trump has fought the cancerous, communist woke culture that was destroying this country, Miller told reporters. His collection of words offered a selection of clickbait for social media users, as well as terms that could catch the attention of older Americans. Voters over age 45 narrowly voted for Trump over his Democratic rivals in 2020 and 2024. Smack in the middle of Miller's sentence: communist. It tends to be a term that is loaded with negative affect, particularly for older Americans who grew up during the Cold War, said Jacob Neiheisel, a political communications expert at the University at Buffalo. Appending emotionally laden terms to political adversaries is a way to minimise their legitimacy in the eyes of the public and paint them in a negative light. 'A Red Scare'-era figure influenced a young Trump The threat that communists could influence or even obliterate the United States hovered over the country for decades and drove some of the country's ugliest chapters. The years after World War I and the Russian Revolution in 1917, along with a wave of immigrants, led to what's known as the Red Scare of 1920, a period of intense paranoia about the potential for a communist-led revolution in America. McCarthyism after World War II meant the hunt for supposed communists. It's named for Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican who conducted televised hearings at the dawn of the Cold War that drove anti-communist fears to new heights with a series of threats, innuendos and untruths. Culturally, the merest suggestion that someone was soft on communism could end careers and ruin lives. Blacklists of suspected communists proliferated in Hollywood and beyond. McCarthy fell into disgrace and died in 1957. The senator's chief counsel during the hearings, Roy Cohn, became Trump's mentor and fixer in the 1980s and 1990s, when Trump rose as a real estate mogul in New York. The Cold War was more than three decades old. The threat of nuclear war was pervasive. Communism started to collapse in 1989 and the Soviet Union was dissolved two years later. It's now Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin. But communism - at least in one form - lives on in China, with which Trump is waging a trade war that could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States. By week's end, Trump was acknowledging the potential consequences of his government stepping in: Americans might soon not be able to buy what they want, or they might be forced to pay more. He insisted China would be hurt more by the tariffs. The real modern debate, Robertson says, is not between capitalism and communism, but about how much the government needs to step in - and when. He suggests that Trump is not really debating communism vs. capitalism anyway. Calling people who advocate for slightly more government involvement communists' is typical misleading political rhetoric that, unfortunately, works really well with busy voters who do not have a lot of time to think about technical definitions and economic paradigms, he said in an email. It is also really helpful (to Trump) because it is inflammatory, making people angry, which can be addictive.","summary":"President Trump's second administration is employing the term \"communist\" to label opponents, a strategy he used successfully against Kamala Harris. Despite communism's limited presence in the U.S., the term carries emotional weight, particularly among older voters. Trump's rhetoric coincides with unfavourable economic news, while aides like Stephen Miller use the term to denounce policies on transgender issues, diversity, and immigration.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-brands-his-opponents-as-communists-label-loaded-with-baggage-of-american-history/articleshow/120853867.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120853894,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-135278,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 15:12:51","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":317483062,"title":"Trump casts himself as pope in AI-generated image","text":"The conclave to elect a new pope has yet to begin, but President Donald Trump already has a pitch for who should lead the Roman Catholic Church: himself.\n\n Apple isn't overly worried about Trump's tariffs.

We had the Eagles at the White House, Kamala Harris decided it was time she addressed the nation again, a woman in Florida thwarted a bear attack with snacks, and much, much more. So, let’s dive right in and get you up to speed on anything you missed. The Philadelphia Eagles visited the White House this week to celebrate their Super Bowl LIX victory. It was the first time the White House grounds crew had needed to make sure all the property’s poles were greased since Hunter Biden’s last birthday party. A park in Seattle has announced plans to roll out a new \"Public Masturbation Deterrent Infrastructure.\" That’s a fancy way of saying they’re going to staple the cast of The View’s headshots onto trees around the park. In her first speech since the election, Kamala Harris drew an awkward silence while talking about a viral video of elephants during an earthquake. Most people there were just perplexed as to why she was talking about Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. US Senator Tommy Tuberville said that Democrats \"don’t care\" about college sports ahead of a meeting with President Trump about NIL. He’s right… Unless there’s a dude competing with women, in which case, they’re all in. The long-awaited video game Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed yet again and is now scheduled to be released in May 2026. Developers say it will be worth the wait as it will give them time to make the hooker-punching mechanics 30% more lifelike. A woman in Florida stopped a bear attack by throwing a bag of cookies at a black bear as it charged her and her dog. It’s a tactic that survival experts say also works if you need to fend off an attack from Internet sensastion, the Rizzler. An Australian teen who was struck by a bolt of lightning that exited her body through her butt says she hopes the incident will leave her with superpowers. Unfortunately for her, having to sit on a hemorrhoid ring for the rest of her life is not a superpower. \"Fart walks\" are a new health trend that has taken social media by storm in which people walk around their neighborhood after a meal blasting gas. \"Isn’t every walk a fart walk?\" asked Rep.

It seems like it’s too early for grand pronouncements, but there is one easy measurement we know: the broadcast networks have been wildly unfair to President Donald Trump in his first 100 days – again. \"CBS Evening News\" and \"CBS Evening News Plus\" marked the occasion on April 30 with relentless gloom. White House reporter Ed O’Keefe lined up people to spin dark clouds about the future: \"But as he marks the first stretch of his second term, people we spoke to here outside Motor City fear the economy could get worse.\" This matched the trend. A Media Research Center study of ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from January 20 to April 9 found 92.2% of Trump evaluations were negative. A similar study of President Joe Biden’s first weeks in office found these same networks gave Biden 59% positive coverage. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION For example, coverage of Biden’s massive COVID-19 spending package was 86% positive. Instead of pushing back on the White House message of the day, evening news coverage consisted of a parade of citizens happy to be receiving $1,400 checks and other benefits. They barely mentioned adding to the deficit. Keep in mind that the amount of Trump coverage – 899 stories making up 1,716 minutes –translates into more voluminous negative coverage. Biden drew only 726 evening-news minutes in 2021. Networks devoted nearly 1,000 more minutes to bashing Trump or over 16 hours of coverage. Trump has granted much broader access to the press – and it looks like he has been punished for it. Clearly, Trump enjoys battling with hostile journalists, as you could see as he granted an interview to ABC’s Terry Moran, who was spinning the doom about a trade war with China: \"Moody's and other analysts say [it] is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, saying, ‘I didn't sign up for this.’\" The ending was feisty, as Moran suggested Trump has already ruined America’s standing in the world, and Trump shot back \"We had a president that was grossly incompetent. You knew it, I knew it, and everybody knew it. But you guys didn't want to write it because you're fake news. And, by the way, ABC is one of the worst. I have to be honest with you.\" In between. Moran engaged in a long back-and-forth with the president about the media’s favorite illegal alien, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who they falsely call a \"Maryland Man.\" It’s a mystery how they advocate for a man who has been identified as a member of the vicious gang MS-13 and accused by his wife of domestic violence. In the White House Briefing Room, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller rallied the Trump troops by dressing down the press for their Kilmar obsession: \"It is a sad reflection on the state of our media and many of the outlets represented in this room that you obsessively try to shill for this MS-13 terrorist\" while they ignore the Americans who’ve been murdered by illegal immigrants. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION He mentioned 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, lured out of her home to be raped and murdered by two men: \"Most of your papers never covered her story when it happened. ... President Trump forced you to cover it. ... He had to shame you into covering it.\" Jocelyn’s name only surfaces when Republicans say it. CBS hasn’t reported this murder, but it was brought up by Alabama Sen. Katie Britt and by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump’s immigration stance is pitched as \"controversial,\" but somehow women being murdered by illegal aliens is not. For example, coverage of Biden’s massive COVID-19 spending package was 86% positive. Because adjectives betray bias, I looked at how the word \"controversial\" has been used by the \"PBS News Hour\" since November. In 54 uses of the C-word on PBS in this study period, 45 of them applied to Team Trump or the Republicans. For Democrats, Biden drew one \"controversial\" on January 3 for his decision to block Nippon Steel’s attempt to buy U.S. Steel – a position he shared with Trump! That’s 45 to 1.

What should be shocking is that they almost never think anything the Democrats do is \"controversial.\" A look back at a similar period in 2020 and 2021 found Trump was still the \"controversial\" one. Trump’s pardons were \"controversial.\" Biden’s were not. It’s this kind of tilt that should underline why we don’t need to fund PBS and NPR, as they sound like taxpayer-funded versions of MSNBC.

But that same poll shows that Californians are split 50-50 on whether she should run at all. \n\nHarris hasn’t yet decided whether to run for governor of California, where she previously served as the state’s attorney general. Politico reported she’ll make the call by late summer. \n\nHilton has no fear of facing off against the former VP — or any Dem.\n\n“Any Democrat, by definition, is not the change we need in California,” he told The Post, citing 15 years of one-party rule and a slew of other problems facing the state, like high taxes, housing affordability, exorbitant energy costs and a hostile business climate.\n\n“The amazing thing about Kamala Harris is that she’s clearly learned nothing from the defeat of last year,” Hilton said. “Just as the campaign she ran last year was so empty of any substance or seriousness in terms of offering people a better life, it’s the same all over again the way she’s approaching this potential run for governor.”\n\nHe said Democrats are in for a rude awakening. \n\n“The arrogant and complacent Democrat Industrial complex, financed by the unions and ruled by activists, has gotten used to having it all their own way,” he said of the state’s machine politics. \n\n“They’re in for a big shock, because Californians are waking up and saying we’ve got to change direction, we can’t go on like this,” he added.\n\nAt least one poll shows Hilton could be correct. \n\nA March Sacramento Bee survey showed that nearly half of Californians are strongly considering voting GOP in 2026 — in a state where Democratic voters outregister Republicans nearly 2 to 1.\n\nHilton was born in the UK to Hungarian parents who escaped communism in their home country. Once a political adviser to British PM David Cameron, he moved to the US in 2012 and became a citizen in 2021, thus allowing him to meet the citizenship requirement to run for governor in California. \n\nAfter leaving UK politics, he co-founded a Silicon Valley tech startup called Crowdpac, a for-profit website that allows political candidates to raise small-dollar donations. \n\nHe parted ways with the company in 2018 after his vocal support for Donald Trump conflicted with its predominantly left-leaning users.\n\nHilton hosted “The Next Revolution” on Fox News from 2017 until 2023, and remained a paid commentator there until announcing his bid for governor last month. \n\nHe’s the second Republican to announce in the race, following Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nOn the Democrat side, the field is crowded — and growing. Former LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Orange County rep Katie Porter, and four other state Democrats so far have launched campaigns to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom when he terms out in 2026. \n\nHilton says the current governor, who has drawn ridicule for his recently-debuted eponymous podcast, is simply phoning it in with two years left on the clock. \n\n“None of it is serious,” Hilton said of the Newsom’s new attempts to diagnose Democrats’ wokism woes and trouble attracting male voters.\n\n“He’s acting as if he’s some political commentator without an actual job that has actual responsibilities, but he’s currently the governor, so he could be taking action on these things,” Hilton continued, adding that he’s hoping to make the opposite career move. \n\nCalifornia will hold its open primary race on June 2, 2026.","summary":"Steve Hilton, the tech founder turned TV commentator running on the GOP ticket for California governor next year, says Kamala Harris' aspirations to govern the Golden State are purely self-promotional. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/03/us-news/cali-gop-gov-hopeful-steve-hilton-isnt-afraid-of-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/103673192.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V2gCck1N-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-03 11:37:05","author":"Taylor Walters","authors":["Taylor Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":317422540,"title":"Kamala Harris’ 60 Minutes Interview, Trump’s Reaction, and $20 Billion Lawsuit Earn Major Award Nomination","text":"A controversial interview featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris has been nominated for an Emmy, despite President Donald Trump savaging it.\n\nThe story helmed by correspondent Bill Whitaker was nominated on Thursday for ‘outstanding edited interview.’\n\nTrump famously protested the interview during the election after it was revealed that one of the vice president’s lengthy spiraling answers on Israel was edited.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump filed a $20 billion lawsuit to challenge CBS and 60 Minutes, arguing that the show’s producers purposefully edited the interview to make Harris look better and sway the presidential election.\n\nCBS argued that their edits were part of the normal editorial process. \n\nAfter Trump became the President of the United States, the Federal Communications Commission ordered for the original video and transcripts to be made public. \n\nCBS and Paramount are in talks with President Trump to work out a settlement. \n\nTrump continues to monitor the case closely. \n\n‘The case we have against 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount is a true WINNER,’ Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ‘They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena.’ \n\nThe unearthed version showed that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking, of the total 60 minutes that were filmed. \n\nThe unedited footage opens with the former VP sneezing as she explains she is ‘allergic to mold,’ while other sections of her answers were cropped and cut out completely. \n\nIn other places Harris gave rambling answers on why she should be president, foreign policy, and Trump – all which were nixed by CBS. \n\nThe full version of the interview shows that while Harris gave a lengthy answer when asked about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CBS only aired about seven seconds on 60 Minutes.\n\nHere are the differences between the transcripts and what made it on air. \n\nHarris slamming Trump as a ‘racist’ is edited out\n\nThe long version of the CBS interview revealed that the network cut out an entire answer Kamala Harris dedicated to slamming Donald Trump as a racist. \n\nInterviewer Bill Whitaker asked the then-Vice President: ‘And talking about that person you’re mentioning right now, you have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. \n\n‘In fact, you have called him a racist, and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?’\n\nKamala Harris’ answer to this question was completely cut from the CBS episode.\n\nIn the uncut version, Harris bashed Trump for having a ‘bouquet of microphones’ at his disposal, and for his ‘most vile lies’ about people in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nThe reference is to the comments Trump made last year, about illegal migrants in the midwestern state eating people’s dogs.\n\nIn the unearthed version, Harris also made a bizarre boast about how when she was DA in California, ‘the words I spoke could move markets.’\n\nIn the deleted version of the interview, Harris then went on a strange rant about school kids’ picture day that they seemingly missed as a result of Trump’s words about Springfield, Ohio. \n\nShe responded: ‘So let’s just break down what you just talked about, and talk about it in the context of the words that Donald Trump has spoken, and the actions he has taken, and whether that is reflective of who we are as Americans, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. \n\n‘We have a former President who wants to be President again, who has a bouquet of microphones in front of him, who has said the most vile lies about a group of legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. And if I may, Bill, let me just say something. \n\n‘You know, from the time I was a prosecutor, to attorney general, to now I’m Vice President, I learned very early in my career when the voters bestow on you the authority to have these positions, you must be very thoughtful about how you use that microphone in front of you. \n\n‘And you know, when I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets. \n\n‘So the idea that the former president, who again is running to be President, would use that microphone in a way that is about vilifying and demeaning a whole population of people, you know what has happened because of that? \n\n‘One day when this happened was a school day, picture day for an elementary school. Picture day. You know what picture day is for our children. They get excited the night before when you put out the clothes they’re going to wear, they go to school making sure their faces are clean, and their hair is done, and they go to school for picture day. You know what happened to these children? They had to evacuate that day because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the words of Donald Trump.’ \n\nInstead of airing this section, the cut version on CBS was far less explosive against the Republican – and contained far fewer words.\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris was broadcasted as saying: ‘So I say that I’m glad you’re pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it’s just wrong. It’s just wrong.’ \n\nHarris’ answers on Israel are edited out\n\nThe interviewer asked: ‘What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control?’\n\nHer response, which was aired, went as follows: ‘Well, let’s start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred, 250 hostages 15 were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped. And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.’\n\nBut the next section of her answer was completely edited out of the interview, the newly-released transcripts revealed: ‘And that [the war ending] has to be our number one imperative, and that has been our number one imperative.’\n\nUnprompted, Harris then asked herself a rhetorical question – and gave a round-a-bout, lengthy, repetitive answer. This part was removed from the original broadcast. \n\nHarris said: ‘How can we get this war to end?\n\n‘Well, critical elements of that are we have got to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. We have to – we have to get aid in. We have to lay the path toward a two-state solution. I do believe that we must maintain that as an objective, no matter how out of reach it seems at the moment. And the work that we have to do is also pay attention to what is happening every day in the region and put U.S. resources into everything we can do, diplomatically and otherwise, to de-escalate what is happening in the region.’ \n\nCBS edited Whitaker’s question to Harris about Netanyahu not listening to the United States – where he cited reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the administration has repeatedly been blindsided by the Israeli PM.\n\nHarris responded by boasting about the work they have done with Israel and cropped her answer down to just: ‘We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.’\n\nHarris’ answers on Iranian threat are edited out\n\nWhitaker asked Harris a pointed, simple question about foreign policy – that was completely left out of the version CBS aired in October. \n\nHe asked the former VP: ‘Let’s hit on some more foreign policy. Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?’\n\nKamala Harris’ answer was Iran – followed by a series of rambling sentences. \n\nShe said: ‘Well, there are different reasons that we should be thoughtful about each. Most recently, I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. And look, I mean, Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? \n\n‘And what we saw in terms of just this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic 11 missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities. And that must be.’ \n\nThe interviewer pushed her further, asking a question about what she would do if she – as the hypothetical President – found out the Middle Eastern power was building a nuclear arsenal. \n\nHe asked: ‘So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?’\n\nBut instead of taking the bait, Harris turned down the question completely. \n\nShe responded: ‘I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.’\n\nThis entire conversation was edited out of the broadcast by CBS. \n\nHarris’ answer on why she should be president is trimmed\n\nWhitaker asked Harris why a quarter of voters feel they don’t know her – despite having served as the vice president for four years.\n\nThe newly-released transcript showed that CBS omitted a large chunk of Harris’ bizarre, digressive words about ‘traveling the country’ – rather than actually saying why she ought to be Commander-in-Chief. \n\n‘But Madam Vice 21 President, a quarter of registered voters still say they don’t know you, they don’t know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? I mean, you have been vice president for almost four years. You’ve been on the national scene for longer. What’s the disconnect?’ Whitaker asked. \n\nIn both the edited and aired versions, Harris started her response with: ‘It’s an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone’s vote.’\n\nHowever, CBS edited out her next few sentences. ‘And that’s why I’m traveling our country. I’ve seen you in a few states in the last couple of days. I’m talking with folks where they live. I’m listening to folks. And working to earn the vote of every American,’ Harris said.\n\nBoth versions continued: ‘This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that’s what I intend to do.’\n\nHarris’ answer on NATO and the war in Ukraine is trimmed\n\nWhen asked if she would expand NATO to include Ukraine if she were President, CBS cropped down Harris’ response and jumped to her slamming Trump. \n\n‘How about as President, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?’ Whitaker asked.\n\n‘Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression,’ Harris said.\n\nThe transcript showed Harris actually said: ‘And doing what we can to continue to build and strengthen the alliance around the support for Ukraine’s right to be an independent nation, free from having its borders forcefully taken by Russia. \n\n‘And we are going to continue to work closely with our NATO allies to continue to reinforce America’s alliance in the context of NATO. Again, in this election, there’s a real difference between me and the former president. \n\n‘I believe in reinforcing the strength of NATO, understanding again it is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known. Donald Trump would pull us out of NATO.’\n\nHowever, CBS removed her speaking about what the Biden administration was doing to support Ukraine – before just showing her blasting Trump. \n\nThe version that aired on 60 Minutes jumped to Harris stating: ‘Donald Trump, if he were President, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. Let’s be clear about that. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It’s about surrender.’ \n\nHarris’ economic plan answer is chopped up \n\nWhen Whitaker asked Harris how she intended to pay for her economic plan, CBS edited out her answer on inflation.\n\n‘It is estimated by the Nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you going to pay for that?’ Whitaker asked.\n\nCBS kept the first sentence of the former vice president’s response, ‘Okay so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent.’\n\nBut the transcript showed CBS sliced up her answer by removing the next part of her sentence.\n\n‘Because this is an election and there are two choices, everyone from Goldman Sachs to Moody’s to Nobel laureates, so on the first point, comparing my economic plan to Donald Trump’s economic plan, they have reviewed it,’ Harris continued.\n\nThe aired version pieced her first sentence with this bit she said later on. ‘And determined that my economic plan would strengthen America’s economy, his would weaken it,’ Harris said.\n\nAgain, CBS removed her repeated ranting about analyst and a portion where she where she talked about inflation. \n\nHarris said in the original transcript: ‘Sixteen Nobel laureates, Moody’s, others have determined, after reviewing what Donald Trump is proposing, that he would induce inflation, increase inflation, and bring about a recession by the middle of next year.’\n\nThey aired the last of her response, ‘My plan, Bill, if you don’t mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America’s economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America’s economy.’\n\nHarris’ answers on China and Taiwan are edited out\n\nAsking the then-VP a question about China, Whitaker said: ‘What about China? China is strongly asserting its dominance, its control of the South China Sea, especially around the Philippines. What is the U.S. responsibility for keeping China from simply taking over the South China Sea?’ \n\nHarris’ answer, which was completely cut from the broadcast, read: ‘Well, I have actually worked very closely with the leaders in the Philippines on just this very issue, and including the work that we are doing in terms of coordination between our military and training, and what needs to happen in terms of protecting the freedom of the South China Sea.’\n\nThe next section was also cut, apart from a voice over of Harris saying: ‘We must win the competition for the 21st century with China.’ \n\nThe full, unaired quote, read: ‘China, first of all, we must win the competition for the 21st century with China. We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we must operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests. What we -‘\n\nWhitaker said: ‘So say if China attacks Taiwan. Would we use military force to support Taiwan?’\n\nHarris refused to give a straight answer – and instead gave a flurried answer about fentanyl.\n\nShe said: ‘Bill, I’m not going to get into hypotheticals. But listen, we need to make sure that we maintain a one-China policy, and – but that includes supporting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait. \n\n‘But on the issue of China, we also – again, these are not – We cannot afford to have foreign policy that is myopic. We must be able to also, as it relates to China, continue to do the work that we have begun to deal with the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. That’s a real issue. Again, you talk to families around our country who have — I just, on a constant, sadly, regular basis meet parents and family members of people who have died from fentanyl, young people who have died from fentanyl. \n\n‘Are we going to stop trying to stem the flow from fentanyl? And we have to deal with that, and understand China’s role in that, and our ability to work with China to stop that flow. Which we have begun to do, and I’m going to continue to do. We need to make sure we have open lines of communication with China, in particular military to military. So these issues are all – they’re multifaceted.’ \n\nCBS cuts crucial line from Harris’ answer on the border crisis \n\nThe network cut one very crucial line from Kamala Harris’ answer about the border crisis. \n\nShe was asked: ‘You recently visited the southern border, and embraced President Biden’s recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings, and you said you would take it even further. If that’s the right answer now, why didn’t your administration take those steps in 2021?’\n\nThe answer she gave that was aired – and the one that was filmed – were nearly identical. \n\nHarris said on the CBS broadcast: ‘So we came into office, and almost hours, Bill, after our inauguration, the first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill…’\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris then went on to describe what happened next.\n\nBut the unedited version revealed that CBS left out three key words at the end of her speech about the border crisis bill. \n\n‘…Which I support.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA controversial interview featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris has been nominated&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; 60 Minutes Interview, Trump&#8217;s Reaction, and $20 Billion Lawsuit Earn Major Award Nomination first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview-trumps-reaction-and-20-billion-lawsuit-earn-major-award-nomination/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-60-Minutes-interview-sparking-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 11:14:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":317511044,"title":"GOP keeps pretending Trump has a mandate. Americans are clearly saying otherwise. | Opinion - USA Today","text":"For the first time since 2022, the economy has contracted. That means President Donald Trump inherited an economy on the rise, and instead of helping things along with good conservative policy, he opted to push us toward recession entirely on his impulses and stubbornness with tariffs.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration and its allies are covering their ears and screaming to the contrary. MAGA continues to hide behind Trump’s supposed “massive\" mandate that never existed, as much as those believers want to insist otherwise to justify Trump's radical policies. \n\nVoters aren't biting. Trump’s job approval rating is plummeting as America feels the effects of one unpopular policy after another. In fact, his 100-day approval rating is the lowest of any president in the last 80 years. \n\nTrump and his allies are overstepping the boundaries the American people gave them, but the president doesn’t care. Republicans should.\n\nMAGA thinks Trump should do whatever he wants\n\nIf the president had an overwhelming mandate, voters wouldn't be so quick to push his approval rating underwater. Polls indicate that as few as 39% of Americans approve of Trump's actions. If Americans truly elected him to implement the radical change he claims, they'd have more of a stomach for watching him do it.\n\nPoliticians almost always overextend what they were elected to do. More often than not, our presidents are elected because they’re the lesser of two evils. The concept of mandates is pretty shaky and usually only applies to Congress when Americans give one party a majority.\n\nThe funny thing is, Republicans also control Congress and are positioned to turn Trump's policies into law. Instead, they're doing nothing.\n\nTrump and Vice President JD Vance view an electoral victory as the American people’s unconditional endorsement of everything the victor believes in.\n\nIn a rather ridiculous X thread in April, Vance charged that people who object to the administration’s approach to deportations “want to nullify the results of a democratic election.”\n\nI’m not sure if he even realizes the implications of what he has said here. Vance seems to believe that if you win a democratic election, by even a slim margin, then you have a license to do whatever you want. \n\nAmericans did not elect Trump to impose his complete worldview on the country. They elected him because, at that moment in time, the country trusted Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris to fulfill the duties of the presidency. And now it appears Americans do not like how Trump fulfills those duties.\n\nThe Vance approach to elections would mean that the Supreme Court justices who told President Joe Biden he could not unilaterally cancel student loan debt were nullifying election results, or the courts that struck down Biden’s forced vaccinations campaign were going against a voter mandate. \n\nRepublicans should remember Trump is a lame-duck president\n\nWhile Trump doesn't have carte blanche to do what he wants, we must admit he is being the kind of president we knew he would be. After narrowly winning, Trump is a lame-duck president who is taking the liberty to implement his vision for America, even if it hurts his popularity or our country. \n\nNowhere is that clearer than with tariffs.\n\nOne of the few policy positions Trump has held for a long time, including his first term, was the idea that tariffs can do good for the American economy. Now that he is free of the constraints of winning elections and has been blessed with autonomy by the Republicans in Congress, Trump can finally test out how his theories on trade work in practice. \n\nSo far, his actions are destructive and antiquated. We're watching the economy contract and the stock market plummet, but soon we will also see prices on many goods rise in response to the Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's funny to say, but Americans would be far happier with first-term Trump, whom the Republican establishment contained and kept in check.\n\nIn his second term, Trump's actions are so unpopular that the likelihood of Republicans winning in the coming elections is plummeting. Republican politicians would be wise to admit that Trump is overreaching what America elected him to do, which is simply not to be Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. That is their mandate.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.","summary":"GOP keeps pretending Trump has a mandate.

According to the Cato Institute think tank, garment workers in South Carolina are paid as low as $11 an hour. For workers assembling washing machines, the pay rises to just $16 to $17 an hour. The living wage for the state, on the other hand — as defined by MIT’s calculator as the amount an individual must earn to support themselves while working full-time — is $22.15 an hour for a single adult with no children. Many of these jobs often require long hours on your feet and the ability to lift a certain amount of weight. \n\nThen there’s the notion that not only will you work in a factory; so will your children and grandchildren. This is in direct contrast to one of the defining features of the “American dream” that no matter where you come from, you have a chance of great achievements. The idea that there’s no chance for upward mobility and that generations will be bound to the same boss sounds suspiciously like feudalism.\n\nWhile Trump’s Cabinet members try to put a happy face on a shrinking economy, the president can’t decide if the economy is great thanks to him, if he should blame Biden for all the economic chaos, or if the public should suck it up. \n\n“This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th,” he wrote on TruthSocial after the report from the Commerce Department was released, urging people to be patient because soon tariffs would kick in. He’s admitting that things aren’t looking great — but claiming it’s definitely not his fault.\n\nThe day before, however, Trump was touting the amazing economy he created. At a Tuesday evening rally in Michigan, Trump bragged about all he had accomplished in his first 100 days back in office, baselessly claiming he brought prices down. \n\nAnd as for the likely shortage of goods caused by the astronomical tariffs on China, the United States’ largest trading partner? Well, maybe your kids can just go without.\n\n“You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open,’” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting after a reporter asked him about empty shelves. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s vision for the American dream: gruelling hours in a factory and no toys for your children. \n\nSince Inauguration Day, Trump has been boasting about ushering in a new Golden Age. But he probably should have been more specific about who, exactly, would be reaping the benefits. \n\nTrump largely campaigned on economic relief. He constantly attacked Biden for inflation, repeatedly vowed to bring prices down on day one, and promised tariffs would generate revenue for the country (even though economists have said that is largely not what his trade policies would do). \n\nThere’s a tacit admission in all the rhetoric about children having to go without toys and insisting that a bright future is the masses happily working in a factory for their entire lives: We know our policies will make you poorer and make life harder for millions of working people in America. We just don’t care.\n\nIn an era when every Republican is too afraid to get out of line and MAGA voters take pride in taunting liberals who are affected by Trump’s policies, attempting to frame economic woes as some greater good just might work.\n\nBut Trump loyalists aren’t the only people who will suffer in the new American dream — and they’re already giving Trump bad marks on the economy, a stunning reversal from his first term. A CNN poll conducted earlier this month found that 59% of respondents believe Trump’s policies have made the economy worse. A Reuters poll had similar findings, with 56% of Americans polled disapproving of his economic priorities. \n\nWhile many Democratic voters were skeptical of Trump’s claims about what he would do as president, there is evidence that voters whose top concerns were the economy still rallied behind Trump over Kamala Harris to send him back to the White House. \n\nBut now, as ABC’s Terry Moran explained to Trump during a wide-ranging interview this week, his own voters may already be suffering from buyers’ remorse. But there’s no indication that the Trump administration plans on reversing course. \n\n“People are worried, even some people who voted for you saying, ‘I didn’t sign up for this,’” Moran said. “So how do you answer those concerns?”\n\nTrump put it plainly. “Well, they did sign up for it, actually,” he said. “And this is what I campaigned on.”","summary":"The Trump administration released bad news about the economy on Wednesday: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the economy shrank for the first time since 2022 in what is likely the first tangible sign for everyday Americans of the impact of President Donald Trump’s policies. \n\nThe news sent the stock market into a tailspin, while business owners warned that shoppers could start seeing empty store shelves. \n\nBut even as the bad news piles up, the Trump administration has decided to reassure panicked consumers with a chilling talking point: Poverty is good, actually.\n\nLast month, as economists warned of the harm Trump’s tariff policies could cause, including drastically increasing the price of goods, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to dismiss those concerns by insinuating that being able to afford things is not important to Americans. \n\n“Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” Bessent said to a crowd of economists. \n\nIt turns out this assertion was only the beginni","url":"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-poverty-trade-war-economy_uk_6815c888e4b08215e5f6b50a","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6814ef751500002400c3cd40.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 07:45:20","author":"Nathalie Baptiste","authors":["Nathalie Baptiste"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":317364630,"title":"Fang: Are influencer opinions bought and sold?","text":"Your addictive doomscrolling on X, TikTok or Instagram may also be the latest nexus for millions of dollars in secret political corruption.\n\nOver the last month, the problem has come into sharp relief. Newly surfaced documents show that more than 500 social media creators were part of a covert electioneering effort by Democratic donors to shape the presidential election in favor of Kamala Harris.\n\nPayments went to party members with online followings but also to non-political influencers — people known for comedy posts, travel vlogs or cooking YouTubes — in exchange for “positive, specific pro-Kamala content” meant to create the appearance of a groundswell of support for the former vice president.\n\nMeanwhile, a similar pay-to-post effort among conservative influencers publicly unraveled. The goal was to publish messages in opposition to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to remove sugary soda beverages from eligible SNAP food stamp benefits.\nInfluencers were allegedly offered money to denounce soda restrictions as “an overreach that unfairly targets consumer choice” and encouraged to post pictures of President Donald Trump enjoying Coca-Cola products. After right-leaning reporter Nick Sortor pointed out the near-identical messages on several prominent accounts, posts came down and at least one of the influencers apologized: “That was dumb of me. Massive egg on my face. In all seriousness, it won’t happen again.”\n\nIn both schemes, on the left and the right, those creating the content made little to no effort to disclose that payments could be involved. For ordinary users stumbling on the posts and videos, what they saw would have seemed entirely organic.\n\nIn the influencers’ defense, they didn’t break any rules — because none exist.\n\nWe used to demand minimal levels of transparency for paid endorsements. In the 1970s, the U.S. enacted a series of reforms requiring new disclosures for those seeking to shape elections. Television, radio and print ads for political campaigns must specify the sponsors, and billboards or pamphlets sent by mail also feature small-print reminders of the groups responsible.\n\nSocial media, however, is the Wild West of advocacy. Although influencers are generally required by the Federal Trade Commission to disclose paid endorsements for products, politics are a different matter. Most election-related communications fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission. But the FEC commissioners debated the issue without resolving the problem. A proposal floated in December 2023 to enact basic rules for influencers made no headway.\n\nThere was a momentary push in 2017 for stricter social media disclosures in the political realm. The discovery of foreign influence campaigns aimed at the 2016 presidential election set off alarm bells. As a result, the major tech platforms began working to track and close so-called sock puppet accounts operated by the Russian and Chinese government. Yet few reforms were institutionalized, and as more and more Americans get their news from social media, the problem remains largely unchecked.\n\nThat has left the entire social media landscape vulnerable to hidden manipulation, where money from interest groups or corporations or even rich individuals can silently shape what appears to be authentic discourse. This corrosion of reality undermines the very foundation of democratic deliberation.\n\nDemocracy requires a minimal level of shared facts and good-faith engagement. Secret payments in support of candidates or causes destroy both, corrupting the “marketplace of ideas,” where the best arguments are supposed to naturally rise to prominence through competition. If genuine public sentiment becomes indistinguishable from manufactured opinion, we lose our collective ability to recognize the truth and make informed decisions. Everything from local zoning decisions to soda bans to presidential elections can be skewed.\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously noted that “sunlight is … the best disinfectant.” Transparency in political influencing requires regulatory action. The Federal Election Commission must act and establish clear disclosure requirements for paid political communications on social media. Congress should expand the definition of electioneering and political-payola disclosure to include influencer content. Platforms must implement more robust paid content and disclosure tools.\n\nMost importantly, we as citizens must demand reform. We should support influencers who voluntarily disclose their financial relationships and conflicts of interests, and question those who don’t.\n\nIf we fail to address the growing influence of secret money in the digital public square, the risk is dire: We will surrender our collective decision-making ability and our democracy to whoever can afford to purchase the most compelling voices.\n\nLee Fang is an independent journalist.

Since his 20 January inauguration, Trump has passed an avalanche of executive orders (139 and counting) designed to dismantle traditional constraints on presidential power, and to advance his agenda: threatening law firms, universities and media owners into compliance; authorising Elon Musk's Doge to \"cripple\" the federal bureaucracy; firing the heads of 18 federal watchdogs; \"disappearing\" innocent migrant workers; and deporting foreign students who have written anti-Israel articles.\n\nIt's \"less a new administration\", said Andrew Sullivan in The Times, and more a \"vengeful monarchy\". The \"trappings of a republic remain\", but they are increasingly mere \"facades\". And for what, asked Andrew Rawnsley in The Observer. King Donald's assault on US universities has triggered a brain drain. His attack on the global order has been \"ruinous\" for the reputation of the US. He promised Americans he would bring down costs, but his trade war is set to fuel inflation and perhaps trigger a recession. \"Make America Great Again? Trumpism doesn't do what it says on the baseball cap.\"\nTell that to Trump's supporters, said Kimberley A. Strassel in The Wall Street Journal. \"Creative destruction\" is exactly what they wanted: they're fed up of the waste and \"indolence\" of Washington elites, and they voted for Trump to tear it all up. Besides, said Harry Cole in The Sun, who says his \"manic\" approach isn't working? \"Woke and trans sacred cows have been slaughtered\" by presidential decree; wasteful spending has \"gone up in smoke\". Countries are begging for new trade deals, and illegal border crossings, according to the administration, are down by 95%.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

It's like \"a supercar with 1,000 horsepower\", while his Democratic opponents coast around on \"mopeds\". If they want to win back power, they'll need to whip up some of that élan vital.\n\nThe resistance is already building, albeit not yet in Congress, said the FT. The bond markets have forced Trump to rein in his tariffs. The Supreme Court has taken a stand against illegal deportations. American voters, fretting about their wallets and retirement plans, are starting to abandon him too: Trump has one of the lowest approval ratings of any president after 100 days, at 40%.\nIf Democrats win next year's midterm elections, said Katie Stallard in The New Statesman, he could spend his last two years in office fighting off investigations and impeachments, ensuring his authoritarian agenda is derailed. But that's assuming, of course, the midterms actually happen. On the current trajectory, we may not get \"free and fair elections in 2026, let alone a peaceful transfer of power in 2028\".\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\nRepublican Party\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nCrossword: May 3, 2025\n\nThe Week's daily crossword puzzle\n\nSudoku medium: May 3, 2025\n\nThe Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle\n\nSudoku hard: May 3, 2025\n\nThe Week's daily hard sudoku puzzle\n\nYou might also like\n\nTrump moves to gut PBS and NPR in latest salvo against the media\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nThe president's executive order targeting two of the nation's largest public broadcasters comes as the White House seeks to radically reframe how Americans get their news\n\nTrump judge bars deportations under 1798 law\n\nA Trump appointee has ruled that the president's use of a wartime act for deportations is illegal\n\nTrump ousts Waltz as NSA, taps him for UN role\n\nPresident Donald Trump removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and nominated him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nHow could Trump ending a VA mortgage program leave veterans on the streets?\n\nToday's Big Question\nVets could face foreclosure as a result of the White House's actions\n\nKamala Harris steps back on center stage\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nIn her first major speech since Donald Trump took office, the former presidential candidate took solid aim at this administration as speculation grows about her future\n\nTrump blames Biden for tariffs-linked contraction\n\nThe US economy shrank 0.3% in the first three months of 2025, the Commerce Department reported\n\nTrump's crypto 'sea change' upends Washington's finances\n\nIn the Spotlight\nBy embracing digital currency, the White House is clearing a path for a new era in dubious self-enrichment\n\n'It is not enough to simply defend the status quo'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

She described the US President's economic policies, particularly his sweeping tariffs, as the catalyst for what she labelled the “greatest man-made economic crisis” in modern history, reported CNN.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");She also warned that Donald Trump's ongoing conflicts with the judiciary were pushing the nation towards a constitutional crisis.2) Kilmar Abrego GarciaThe next image highlights Kilmar Abrego Garcia, with the text “Not a ‘Maryland Man'\".Mr Garcia, a father of three, was living in Maryland when he was deported to El Salvador, a decision that has sparked controversy. The Donald Trump administration said that Mr Garcia was a member of the violent MS-13 gang. Garcia's family and legal representatives dispute these accusations, maintaining that he is innocent with no criminal convictions in the US. He is currently being held in a prison, while his family continues to fight for his return.3) NPRThe next image shows the NPR logo, with the text “Not real news\". This reference stems from President Donald Trump's executive order signed on May 1, which sought to reduce public subsidies for NPR. Mr Trump accused the network of bias and propagating “radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news,'” reported news agency Reuters.The executive order directed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, as well as to eliminate indirect sources of taxpayer funding.4) Gulf of MexicoThe final image shows a water body on a map, with the caption “Not Gulf of Mexico\".

Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, I just wanted to check out my future plane. It's an aircraft he now knows well. In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe - family in tow - to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, soft power appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way. Diplomacy before family and cultural sights Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died. In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's America first message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine. In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark. There's been dealmaking, too. In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official. Family time follows Vance's diplomatic work Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights. The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany. Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance's office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations. You try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you're honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting, he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy. It's also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public's expense, he said. That's the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers' money, he said. Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops. Part of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential, he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance. At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office. Vance displays the habits of a millennial Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job. Generations author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation. The research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers, she said. Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany - and autographed the kegerator built by one airman - after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India. Some of the Vances' activities have been unwelcome Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump's tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there. On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries. A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint. In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports. American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it's not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours. The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public. Such trips have a long history Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well. As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too. Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world. Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there. In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the trip of a lifetime with them. It's been something that I've wanted to share with my new nuclear family, the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him. We think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope, she said. Soft diplomacy is another goal One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism. When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world. Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of Do Running Mates Matter? I wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image, Devine said. He's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance is actively involved in international diplomacy.

The United States has passed the symbolic 100-days-in-office touchstone of Donald Trump‘s second term. As of this weekend, the countdown clocks will show that there are just 1,357 days of Trump’s presidency remaining. \n\nNeither Trump’s fervent Maga base nor the May Day crowds who gathered across the country to protest against the administration can reasonably guess as to the state of their nation when the day-counter hits zero, and the 48th presidentinaugurated.\n\nThe week offered an unsettling reprise of the choice that Americans made last November. After months of invisibility, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris gave her first consequential political speech since the crushing night when a resigned silence presided over the election party headquarters at Howard University.\n\n“Some people are describing what has been happening in recent months as absolute chaos, and, of course, I understand why and it‘s certainly true of those tariffs,” she told her audience in San Francisco.\n\n“But, friends, please let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. What we are in fact witnessing is a high-velocity event. Where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.”\n\nAs ever with Harris, opinion was split on the quality of the performance. \n\nHer supporters could point to the calmness, her poise, the essential optimism. Those who believe that Harris was the wrong candidate will once again shake their heads at the slow-paced delivery during a time when her party colleagues – and she herself – are shouting “fire!” and warning of a constitutional crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, a day after Harris’s address, Trump gave a commencement speech for graduate students at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. It was the same day as he relieved Mike Waltz of his role as national security adviser, quickly naming him as UN ambassador while handing Marco Rubio yet another portfolio to juggle. \n\nOn Thursday night, Rubio made an appearance on the Sean Hannity show to discuss, among other matters, the looming realities of the US trade tariffs stand-off with China.\n\n“They’ve been ripping off the world,” Rubio said of the Chinese. \n\n“People forget that the factories where all these shirts and shoes and clothing and all that stuff that comes from China – those are all Chinese jobs. When they say that the containers, that the factories are not going to be sending things to America, that means they are out of a job. This is hurting the Chinese economy badly. \n\n“I think there’s two questions. Can we reach some sort of short-term accommodation with them? That‘s what they want. ... But I think there is a broader question... that we truly need to be a country that can make more things in America and not be as dependent on China.”\n\nIf Rubio watched the show back, he would find himself confronted with the disconcerting fact that Trump muted is a more eye-catching performer than he himself is at full volume. \n\nBut circumstances were extenuating. As Rubio spoke, the split screen showed Trump break from his standard podium-posture into an animated and, while silenced, alarming type of physical mime. He grimaced, bared his teeth and raised his hands to convey a person struggling under a great weight – the world itself, perhaps – and then quitting, with a shrug. \n\nA few seconds later, he repeated the gesture, but this time he raised his arms triumphantly above his head. It turned out Trump was describing, for the students, a weightlifting contest between a biological woman attempting a record lift and a transgender competitor.\n\nFor the second time in a week, Trump revelled in the adoration of a loyal crowd. Although college Democrats held a protest against his visit, the mood in the big arena, where he was introduced by revered NFL coach Nick Saban, was enthusiastic. Poking fun at the administration’s war with Harvard University, Trump told the students that “history will not be written by the Harvard Crimson but by the Crimson Tide”, the latter being a reference to the Alabama college’s sporting teams.\n\nThe line pleased Trump. He remains ebullient. The White House could point to a strong jobs performance in April, despite the tariff turmoil. Democrats will warn about a proposed $163 billion (€144 billion) cut to government funding in health research, climate change and education in the upcoming budget plan.\n\nMeanwhile, social media founding father Mark Zuckerberg, a newly pledged member of Trump’s eclectic fan club, made a bleak prediction on a podcast. He admitted that there is a statistic floating around that he considers “crazy”.\n\n“The average American has fewer than three friends – three people they consider friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more ... I think it is like 15 friends or something.”\n\nHis consolation was that while nothing tops human connection, the era of AI friendships is imminent and that his fellow Americans will “find the vocabulary as a society to be able to articulate why that is valuable and why the people who are doing these things, why they are rational for doing it, and how it is adding value for their lives”.\n\nAnd in a week when the schism in American life was more pronounced than ever, that was the good news.","summary":"One speech of condemnation and another full of braggadocio underscore where US is at after president’s first 100 days","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/05/03/across-the-great-divide-trump-rides-the-crimson-tide-in-alabama-as-kamala-emerges-to-split-opinion-again/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/SSODYGRYHNXFCMHU46CWGMX2AE.jpg?auth=138d586b5db2f4e6e90222c88dd58a9698c356a4412514f2e7a5ec051da6109f&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-03 04:00:00","author":"Keith Duggan","authors":["Keith Duggan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":317317772,"title":"CBS cancels Queen Latifah show ‘The Equalizer’ after 5 seasons. ‘Don’t worry,’ she says. ‘I’ll be back.’","text":"“The Equalizer,” the crime drama starring Queen Latifah, is coming to an end on CBS.\n\nDeadline reports that the Latifah-produced series has been canceled after more than four years on the air.\n\nThe show’s season five finale, “Decisions,” will serve as the series finale on Sunday (May 4).\n\nThe reimagined reboot of the 1980s series “The Equalizer,” which filmed in Latifah’s native New Jersey, premiered in 2021 after the Super Bowl and became a hit for CBS.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Latifah is ‘The Equalizer’\n\nLatifah, 55, an Emmy-winning Newark native who grew up in East Orange, stars in the show as former CIA agent Robyn McCall.\n\nMcCall, a single mother, uses her skills to defend and protect those who have nowhere else to turn. \n\n“The Equalizer” filmed in Jersey City, Paterson and beyond, basing production at the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford. \n\nLatifah was the first Black woman and first woman to star in an “Equalizer” story.\n\n“I think Black women have been equalizing for years and years and years,” Latifah said before the show’s debut. “And that’s from Hatshepsut to Stacey Abrams to Kamala Harris to my mother to my grandmother.

The nominations for the 46th News & Documentary Emmy Awards were announced this week and \"60 Minutes\" landed several nods, most notably in the Outstanding Edited Interview category for its primetime special featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Trump is seeking $20 billion from CBS News and its parent company, Paramount Global, for what he alleged was election interference with how the network edited its interview with Harris in the days leading up to the presidential election. \"CBS Evening News\" executive producer Guy Campanile took to social media to declare the nomination a \"mic drop,\" but one insider doesn’t believe the nomination will help things from a legal standpoint. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION \"The irony is, some folks at ‘60 Minutes’ are popping champagne over an Emmy nomination — for the same interview that landed them in legal hot water. It’s a reminder that these awards are voted on by other journalists, not the public, not their bosses — and certainly not lawyers,\" a source familiar with the inner workings of CBS News told Fox News Digital. As the two sides have entered mediation in hopes of reaching a settlement, many legal and journalism aficionados have suggested the lawsuit is bogus and would be much ado about nothing if Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone didn’t want to settle the suit ahead of a planned multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media. It is widely believed that Redstone hopes to prevent potential retribution by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which has the authority to halt the transaction. The ordeal has CBS News staffers \"on edge,\" and the source believes the company brought this on themselves. \"We are living in serious times when there are much bigger and more important issues and forces at play. The threats to a free and independent press are real, and this lawsuit is just one aspect of that. But the reality of the situation is that it wasn’t a good interview and that’s how they got themselves into this predicament in the first place,\" the source said. \"It gave Trump an opening, and he took it,\" they continued. \"It was to wedge a wrench in the gears that make the ‘60 Minutes’ clock tick.\" CBS NEWS IN CHAOS SINCE DEPARTURE OF ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCER, WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP, INSIDER SAYS The lawsuit stems from an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, when he asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when Whitaker was shown asking the same question during the primetime special the following night, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the presidential candidate from further backlash leading up to Election Day. Earlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. ‘60 MINUTES’ CALLS OUT CORPORATE OWNER PARAMOUNT ON THE AIR, SAYS PRODUCER WHO QUIT FELT INTERFERED WITH The released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who at the time refused to apologize for the Harris interview, resigned last week citing corporate pressure preventing him from maintaining editorial independence. White House communications director Steven Cheung mocked the interview at the center of the ordeal receiving an Emmy nomination. \"Of course it’s nominated for best editing because it takes some serious talent to edit Kamala’s answer into something that’s coherent and understandable, which in the end they still failed to do,\" Cheung told Fox News Digital. Emmy nominees are judged by a \"pool of more than 980 peer professionals from across the TV and streaming/digital media news and documentary industry,\" according to Deadline.

He dropped out the following month and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee. \"I'm not a doctor. Aging happens quite quickly,\" Psaki added on the Semafor podcast that was published Friday.

Or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war,\" she continued. \"I think it's a bit of a dangerous term.\" Psaki was also hesitant to criticize the media when asked if the press should've been \"more aggressive\" in covering the \"pretty big story\" about the president's health.

Psaki suggested one reason there may have been a reluctance to report on these concerns. \"While we know there were problematic things behind-the-scenes now in 2023 and 2024, there was an aggressive all-out pitching operation from the right-wing and from the Republicans about Joe Biden's age and how he was in decline….the majority of which wasn't true, in 2019-2022,\" Psaki claimed.

Losing Dems need a moderate pivot, but radical left steering for a cliff","text":"On Nov. 5, the Democratic Party received what counts in our hyper-polarized age as a comprehensive drubbing. \n\nDonald Trump swept all seven battleground states, improved over his 2016 and 2020 performances with nearly every demographic subcategory, and became the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote.\n\nIn the end, Vice President Kamala Harris’ $1 billion-plus war chest and much-praised “ground game” proved a boon to the college funds of Democratic consultants and not much else.\n\n“This was a total and complete repudiation of the Democratic Party,” one congressman told Punchbowl News on the morning after the election. “People are not buying what we’re selling. Period.”\n\nPost-election polling confirms that the party’s national brand is in the Dumpster. \n\nA late January Quinnipiac poll found that only 31% of voters hold a favorable opinion of the Democrats, versus 57% with an unfavorable one.\n\nBy contrast, Republican favorability stood at 43% — still underwater, but 12 points better — while Trump enjoyed the highest approval rating of his political career, 53%, according to a February poll from CBS/YouGov.\n\nRejection of progressivism\n\nWhile voters are undoubtedly angry at the party that gave us the Biden administration, surveys from Democratic polling firms suggest a broader public rejection of progressive cultural politics.\n\nAccording to an election postmortem by the Democratic polling firm Blueprint, published in mid-November, swing voters who broke for Trump — as 52% did, compared with only 36% for Harris — saw Democrats as being more supportive of immigrants than of American citizens (73%), wanting to “promote transgender ideology” (72%), being “too focused on identity politics” (67%), and having “extreme ideas” about “immigration” (69%) and “race and gender” (63%).\n\nThe Progressive Policy Institute’s survey of working-class voters found that 68% of respondents said that Democrats had moved too far left, compared with 47% who said that Republicans had moved too far right.\n\nThis broad-based public exhaustion with cultural progressivism, seen not merely in polling but also in Trump’s newfound status as a cultural icon, seems to suggest that the Democrats’ best path forward is to ditch “wokeness” and pivot to the center.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats have made just this argument. In a memo reported by Politico’s Jonathan Martin, Democratic donor adviser and Obama White House veteran Seth London said that his party’s rebrand should “begin with a complete rejection of race- and group-based identity politics,” a sentiment echoed by former Obama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who told Martin that “identity politics did not work electorally” and had “failed miserably strategically.”\n\nParty surrogates have been aggressive in taking aim at “the groups,” the sprawling network of progressive nonprofits and advocacy organizations that, under Biden in particular, assumed the role of the Democrats’ policy and intellectual vanguard. \n\n(As the Department of Government Efficiency has highlighted, many of these groups were not only powerful within the coalition; they were also being subsidized by taxpayers.)\n\nBlowback vs. moderation\n\nBut abandoning identity politics — and the groups — is easier said than done.\n\nShortly after the election, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts declared that the party needed to be “brutally honest” about how out of step its position on transgender issues was with the American public. \n\nAs the father of two young daughters, Moulton told The New York Times, he agreed with the eight in ten Americans who do not want schoolgirls “getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete.”\n\nThe blowback was severe. \n\nActivists, spurred on by local Democratic officials and national journalists and nonprofits, accused Moulton of “scapegoating” trans people, descended on his office for a “Neighbors Against Hate” rally, and pledged to primary him in his next election. \n\nMoulton’s campaign manager and the director of his political action committee quit in protest of his remarks, and the chairwoman of the Salem Democratic City Committee denounced him in an e-mail as a “Nazi cooperator.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee’s elections for a chairman this February, meantime, were vintage woke surrealism, straight out of 2020. \n\nThe event featured a land acknowledgment, anti-Trump slave spirituals, and an announcement by outgoing chairman Jamie Harrison explaining how “nonbinary individuals” would get counted under rules mandating gender balance among DNC officers.\n\n‘I’m too radical for America’\n\nThe DNC elected as one of its vice chairmen the Gen Z professional activist David Hogg, whose X account over the past seven years reads like an AI-generated parody of elite progressive excess.\n\nHogg had even posted in 2022 that “I’m one of the most politically toxic people in the country and I’m too radical for American politics,” suggesting that he had a more accurate view of political reality than the 2025 version of his party.\n\nIdentity politics has sway within the Democratic Party for a reason.\n\nIdeologically, as Christopher Caldwell has argued, identity politics — or “civil rights, broadly understood,” in his terminology — is the glue of the modern Democratic coalition, binding together its highly educated and affluent urban professional wing with its mass electoral base of minorities.\n\n“The groups” are not external to the party but a critical element of its machinery. \n\nThey help write Democratic policies, train and supply staffers for Democratic administrations and congressional offices, and register and organize voters during election season. \n\nThey provide patronage — Hogg, before becoming DNC vice chairman, served for years as the secretary of March for Our Lives Action Fund — and money, deciding which campaigns, issues, and even entertainment gets funded.\n\nWhen the Biden administration declared, as it often did, a “whole of society” commitment to ending this or that injustice, what this meant in practice was deputizing the groups as coequal government partners in implementing the administration’s goals.\n\nWhen Biden defied the groups by refusing to break publicly from Israel, they helped organize mass protests against him and fomented resistance to the policy within his own administration.\n\nPerhaps the most important obstacle for Democrats’ attempt to buck their activist wing is that the groups reflect the preferences of party donors. \n\nThe Democratic donor class ranges from family foundations like Ford and Rockefeller to newer philanthropic and grantmaking organizations based on finance and tech fortunes, such as George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, the various branches of Pierre Omidyar’s empire, and the San Francisco–based Tides Nexus.\n\nThese donors back not only much of the organized progressive movement but also the vast external support apparatus that wages political warfare on the party’s behalf.\n\nTo take one small but telling example: The campaign to remove Trump from the presidential ballot under the 14th Amendment was spearheaded by a 501(c)(3) called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), part of the nonprofit and advocacy machine run by longtime Democratic operative David Brock.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, CREW received $2.85 million from Soros’ Foundation to Promote Open Society — part of the same philanthropic empire that, in 2020, announced $220 million in funding for “efforts to achieve racial equality.”\n\nMaybe a charismatic new party leader could defy this infrastructure and pivot to the center, the way Trump defied a powerful GOP constituency, the institutional pro-life movement, during his 2024 campaign.\n\nAbsent that, however, the Democrats’ path of least resistance in the near term will be to drift in the opposite direction — toward a further embrace of the millennial and Gen Z left.\n\nPopulist pivot\n\nThe framework would likely be what party leaders have started calling “economic” or “authentic” populism, defined by a Bernie Sanders–esque criticism of “oligarchy” that de-emphasizes cultural politics rhetorically without actually abandoning the party’s cultural commitments.\n\nThe clearest example of this populist pivot comes from Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who, since the election, has emerged as a leading voice in an otherwise demoralized and disorganized Democratic opposition.\n\nIn memos, interviews, and X posts, Murphy has argued for the party to coalesce around a message targeting specific billionaire villains, including Elon Musk.\n\nWhen elements of the radical left (including former New York Times and Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz) openly celebrated the December murder of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, Murphy was quick to discern a political opportunity. \n\nNo, one shouldn’t assassinate executives in Midtown Manhattan, Murphy conceded in an X video posted shortly after the killing — but he felt compelled to acknowledge the country’s anger about the “thousands of people who die often anonymous deaths every single day at the hands of a health care industry that mostly doesn’t give a s–t.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren similarly spoke of the “visceral response from people across the country who feel cheated, ripped off, and threatened by the vile practices of their insurance companies.”\n\nWhile Warren and Murphy have played footsie with the far left, others in the Democratic aristocracy have made more open overtures. \n\n“Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by three former Obama speechwriters that acts as a clearinghouse for the party leadership’s conversations with itself, enthusiastically backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s unsuccessful bid to become the ranking Democratic member on the powerful House Oversight Committee and then lamented her loss to 74-year-old Gerry Connolly as a victory for the “gerontocracy.”\n\nAmid chatter about the need for a “Democratic Joe Rogan,” “Pod Save America” invited the leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker for a discussion of where the Democrats went wrong in 2024. \n\nA popular influencer who straddles the worlds of elite progressive media (his uncle is Cenk Uygur of “The Young Turks”) and the communist-adjacent milieu of a newly radicalized millennial/Gen Z left, Piker has the potential to play a major role in the Democrats’ future.\n\nA widely shared Slate profile of the “hot” and “dangerous” Piker observed that his “access” — he has hosted Ocasio-Cortez and Biden FTC chief Lina Khan on his stream — is “evidence of a fledgling effort to make him more central to Democratic messaging.”\n\nThe electoral prospects of this rebrand seem dubious. \n\nIn a post at the Liberal Patriot, the disaffected Democratic strategist Ruy Texeira notes that it is “magical thinking” to believe that voters will suddenly forget about Democrats’ cultural radicalism and inept governance if the party focuses on class war. \n\nMuch of Trump’s populist appeal, he observes, comes from working-class resentment of progressive cultural politics — “soak the rich” messaging will do nothing to address it.\n\nBut a pivot to the left would have at least one advantage: delaying any reckoning with the party leadership that brought the Democrats to this point. \n\nIt was, after all, the Obama administration that oversaw the rise of the new identity politics and its nationwide implementation through the coercive power of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nIt was the outgoing Obama administration and the Hillary Clinton campaign that cooked up Russiagate and tried to use the resulting hysteria to consolidate the national security establishment against Trump.\n\nAnd it was the Biden administration that pushed an economic agenda that pundits described as “economic populism” and “social democracy” and inspired regular comparisons of Biden with FDR.\n\nThat agenda yielded the inflation that voters last November cited as a key reason for giving Democrats the shove.\n\nIt was the Obama and (contrary to myth) Biden administrations that oversaw the tilt in American foreign policy away from Israel and Saudi Arabia and toward Iran, paving the way for the Gaza war that, ironically, ended up inflaming the left against Biden and serving as an electoral millstone around his neck.\n\nIn the Italian novel “The Leopard,” set during the 19th-century movement for national unification, a young Sicilian nobleman urges his uncle, a powerful conservative landowner allied with the Bourbons, to flip his allegiance to Garibaldi’s nationalists to avoid being caught on the losing side. \n\nAs the young man explains, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.”\n\nDemocratic leadership seems to be thinking similarly. \n\nWhat advocates of the pivot to the left are suggesting, in effect, is a rehash of what they have pushed as party leaders over the past decade and a half — albeit with fresh young faces and “radical” new antiestablishment branding to “meet our moment.”\n\nGiven the institutional strength of the party, they may succeed.\n\nBut as Donald Trump proved in 2016, a party exhausted of ideas, with a leadership class sporting a record of failures, makes a prime target for a hostile takeover.\n\nPark MacDougald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and editor of The Scroll, Tablet’s daily newsletter.

The order is the latest attempt by Trump to limit or intimidate institutions he does not agree with, including law firms, universities and media companies such as CBS, which is being sued for $20 billion over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign. The CPB immediately fired back Friday, with a statement asserting that the president does not have the power to cut off its funding — Congress does. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,\" the CPB said in a statement. The White House is likely aware of that fact as it reportedly is expected to go to Congress with a formal request to claw back the $1.1 billion currently allocated for the CPB over the next two years. But the president's executive order will not help if the White House is taken to court over the issue, which appears likely. A representative for the CPB did not comment on whether it will pursue legal action, but PBS President Paula Kerger said in a statement that the service is \"exploring all options.\" \"The president’s blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle of the night, threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years,\" Kerger said. NPR Chief Executive Katherine Maher said, \"we will challenge this Executive Order using all means available.\" She called Trump's order \"an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities.\" Both executives were pounded by Republican legislators in March at a hearing in the Capitol where a large photo of drag queen Lil Miss Hot Mess appearing on a PBS kids show was displayed behind committee chair Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). Jeffrey McCall, professor of communication at DePauw University, said there is a case to be made that government funding of public radio and TV outlets needs to be revisited as the media landscape provides a wide array of information sources that didn't exist when the CPB was founded in the 1960s. Instead, the White House is \"shooting itself in the foot\" with political attacks. \"If they go to court over the issue, the first thing CPB lawyers are going to say is this is viewpoint discrimination and they will probably be right,\" McCall said. \"The way the Trump administration is going about this is a little clumsy because they are making this a political football.\" One reason for forming the CPB in the late 1960s was to prevent the government from using funding to exert editorial control over programming. The president's announcement of the executive order — titled \"President Trump Finally Ends the Madness of NPR, PBS\" — came with a litany of stories described as \"examples of the trash that has passed for 'news.'\" The examples included an NPR story on eating human placentas, a practice that has been around for decades, and a 2017 documentary about a transgender teen on PBS. If the battle goes to Congress, public media could have the upper hand. As NPR and PBS executives have often pointed out, most of the CPB funding goes to local public radio and TV stations that are often the lone sources of journalism in their communities. PBS cites data that shows 58% of all TV households tune into one of its member stations over the course of a year and that 60% of its audience lives in rural communities. While the internet is cited as a reason to end public media funding, PBS noted that its programming is viewed in 87% of non-internet homes and 56% of low-income households. Republican politicians in red states who don't get a lot of face time on Fox News like having local outlets where they can reach their constituents. Such thinking has helped preserve public media funding in the past. While Los Angeles outlets have a larger population to draw on for financial support from listeners and local underwriters, the loss of federal dollars would be significant. LAist KPCC-FM (89.3) would lose about $2 million, a relatively small portion of an overall budget of roughly $45 million, but substantial enough that it could have an impact on staffing and programming, said a person familiar with the station’s operations who was not authorized to speak publicly. KCRW-FM (89.9), stands to lose $1.3 million from a budget of $24 million, slightly more than 5%. Times staff writer James Rainey contributed to this report.","summary":"An executive order by President Trump aims to end funding to NPR and PBS, but the Corporation for Public Broadcasting says not so fast.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-05-02/cpb-says-trump-has-no-authority-over-its-funding","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6753bce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8344x4381+0+28/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd4%2F9c%2Fb361d09a4206b48d8b9c347e2077%2Fgettyimages-220701230","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 21:54:45","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":317291878,"title":"Sources close to Kamala Harris say she is considering a political comeback","text":"Sources close to Kamala Harris say she is considering a political comeback\n Sources say former Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a bid for California governor or the White House again.

That was evident this week in Maine, where English teacher JoAnna St. Germain of Waterville Senior High School called upon the Secret Service to kill Trump and his supporters.”\n\nMeet JoAnna St Germain, a teacher in Waterville Public Schools in Maine. She just called on the secret service and the military to “take out” Trump supporters.\nThese are the people teaching your kids https://t.co/0iiaDVGYAN pic.twitter.com/96liOMSBb8\n— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) April 30, 2025\n\nEnglish teacher JoAnna St. Germain is under fire this week after calling on the Secret Service to kill Trump and his supporters. We have seen an alarming increase in political violence on the left. Ironically, many do so in the name of democracy. https://t.co/a0Yh11mTbV\n— Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) May 2, 2025\n\nShe wrote, “I believe Trump and every sycophant he has surrounded himself with (this is not you – if you’re reading this, this doesn’t apply to you. You are beneath his notice and mine) needs to die. I believe this with the same forceful belief that Hitler and his sycophants needed to die, before they murdered 6 million innocent Jewish persons.”\n\nTurley explained, “These faculty members have normalized violent speech.”\n\n“After losing the last election, some on the left are turning to calls for violence or committing political violence. Ironically, they do so in the name of democracy. That is precisely why rage is so addictive and contagious. It gives you license to do things that you would ordinarily never do,” Turley said.\n\nWND reported just days ago on comments from Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat billionaire, of Illinois.\n\nHe said, “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on a soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”\n\nThe Federalist explained, “The language is all too familiar and can only be described as assassination prep – carefully cloaked in moral outrage – designed to incite the most egregious acts of political violence. His words follow the same formula of other leftists: frame the political opposition as not merely wrong, but evil and tyrannical, then justify any means to defeat them. Such language is meant to dehumanize their opponents and provide moral permission for violence.”\n\nWOW! Governor JB Pritzker just called for mass protests against Trump and Republicans “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace.” Powerful. pic.twitter.com/ZPYFuA3kr8\n— Harry Sisson (@harryjsisson) April 28, 2025\n\nIn fact, there have been two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump in the last year.\n\nThe comments follow a long tradition of Democrats demanding violence.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., in 2021 for protesters to be “confrontational,” a follow to her demand that people harass Trump administration members.\n\n“Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. . ..And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, at one point stood at the Supreme Court and threatened Justice Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh: “You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you.”\n\nJust last year, Joe Biden complained to donors on a private call it was “time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye,” the report said.\n\nAnd, it confirmed, Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., said Trump “has to be eliminated.”\n\nShe had claimed in multiple ways that Trump would be a dictator if elected.\n\nAnd other Democrats long have been part of the campaign.\n\nFor instance, Del. Stacey Plaskett, the Democrat non-voting delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands, said, “He needs to be shot … stopped.”\n\nWHOA! Listen to top Harris surrogate Rep.

That’s a fact.”\n\n“Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?”\n\n“I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”\n\nThe Trump campaign itself released a compilation of some of the threats, and identified those making the threats. They mostly are political or media figures or political operatives:\n\nKamala Harris: “Trump is a threat to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.”\n\nHarris: “It’s on us to recognize the threat (Trump) poses.”\n\nHarris: “Does one of us have to come out alive? Ha ha ha ha!”\n\nJoe Biden: “It’s time to put Trump in a bull’s-eye.”\n\nBiden: “I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Trump is a threat to this nation!”\n\nBiden: “There is one existential threat: It’s Donald Trump.”\n\nBiden: “Trump is a genuine threat to his nation … He’s literally a threat to everything America stands for.”\n\nBiden : “Trump and MAGA Republicans are a threat to the very soul of this country.”\n\nBiden: “Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. … and that is a threat to this country.”\n\nTim Walz: “Are (Republicans) a threat to democracy? Yes … Are they going to put peoples’ lives in danger? Yes.”\n\nGwen Walz: “Buh-bye, Donald Trump.”\n\nNancy Pelosi: “(Trump) is a threat to our democracy of the kind that we have not seen.”\n\nJasmine Crockett: “MAGA in general – they are threats to us domestically.”\n\nDan Goldeman: “He is destructive to our democracy and … he has to be eliminated.”\n\nDisgraced Harris staffer TJ Ducklo: “Trump is an existential, urgent threat to our democracy.”\n\nLiz Cheney: “Trump presents a fundamental threat to the republic and we are seeing it on a daily basis.”\n\nSteve Cohen: “Trump is an enemy of the United States.”\n\nMaxine Waters: “Are (Trump supporters) preparing a civil war against us?”\n\nWaters: “I want to know about all of those right-wing organizations that (Trump) is connected with who are training up in the hills somewhere.”\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz: Trump is an “existential threat to our democracy.”\n\nAdam Schiff: Trump is the “gravest threat to our democracy.”\n\nGregory Meeks: “Trump cannot be president again. He’s an existential threat to democracy.”\n\nDan Goldman: “Trump remains the greatest threat to our democracy.”\n\nJake Auchincloss: “What unifies us as a party is knowing that Donald Trump is an existential threat to Democracy.”\n\nAbigail Spanberger: “Trump is a threat to our democracy … the threats to our democratic republic are real.”\n\nAnnie Kuster: “Trump and his extreme right-win followers pose an existential threat to our democracy.”\n\nBecca Balint: “We cannot underestimate the threat (Trump) poses to American democracy.”\n\nJason Crow: “Trump is an extreme danger to our democracy.”\n\nMichael Bennet: Trump is “a threat to our democracy.”\n\nSteven Horsford: “Trump Republicans are a dangerous threat to our state.”\n\nGave Vasquez: “Remove the national threat from office.”","summary":"'If I had the skill set required, I would take them out myself'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/05/teacher-calls-for-the-assassination-of-trump-supporters/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/joanna-st.-germain-fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 21:02:37","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":317253120,"title":"Andy Beshear's Chances of Being 2028 Democrat Nominee, According to Polls","text":"Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has signaled openness to run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028.On Kentucky's WDRB \"Mornings at the Backside\" segment at Churchill Downs, Beshear spoke about tossing his hat in the ring.\"If you'd asked me a couple years ago if this is something I'd consider, I probably wouldn't have,\" he said. \"But I don't want to leave a broken country to my kids.

Prominent Democrats are beginning to position themselves for the 2028 race, seeking to redefine the party's direction.Beshear's popularity as a Democratic governor in the predominantly Republican state of Kentucky underscores his bipartisan appeal.

That numbers makes him the highest approved Democratic governor, and the second-highest approved overall, trailing just behind Vermont Republican Phil Scott, who had a 75 percent approval rating of registered voters surveyed.National polling for the 2028 Democratic primary does not place him in the top tier just yet.Political forecasting site Race to the WH tracks the latest presidential primary polls for the 2028 election. Their national polling average puts him at 2.3 percent.Kamala Harris leads the projections with 27.1 percent, trailed by Pete Buttigieg at 16.1 percent. Beshear falls just above Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, both at 2.0 percent.What Happens NextBeshear is not the only Democrat who has suggested a possible 2028 presidential bid.Former Rhode Island governor and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo this week said to David Axelrod that she would consider running.Other possible contenders, including Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have yet to state whether or not they will pursue White House bids.In 2020, the last election not featuring a Democratic incumbent, more than two dozen candidates explored White House bids or entered the primaries.","summary":"Democratic Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has said he \"would consider\" a 2028 presidential bid.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/andy-beshear-presidential-election-democrat-polls-white-house-2067533","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2637987/kentucky-governor-andy-beshear.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 20:57:47","author":"Kate Nalepinski","authors":["Kate Nalepinski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":317269654,"title":"Black People M.I.A from Anti-Trump Protests, But Maybe It's Time to Start Showing Up","text":"As protests continue to rage across the country against President Donald Trump’s administration, there seems to be one group of Americans no where on the front lines: the Black community. Black folks always show up and out for past social and political causes, but now that we’ve taken a collective step back, our absence is being felt big time.\n\nEvery single day since Trump took office there’s been protests in one city or the next, according to The Washington Post. And in the sea of demonstrators, it’s been hard to spot many Black faces. Trump’s return to office marks a new age in America, and Black people are fed up. But should we be doing more?\n\nWhy Aren’t Black People Protesting?\n\nBlack folks have always been champions of civil rights for all, way before Trump took office. And history shows us we haven’t always gotten the credit we deserved for it. Now, our community is reluctant to help — and for good reason.\n\nMore than 86 percent of Black voters casted their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to CNN exit polls. But not only did the voice of the Black community go unheard with Harris’ loss, but since Trump 2.0, attacks on Black history, gouging of government agencies and even threats to social security have all been a collective slap in the face of Black voters... So why would they join the fight now?\n\nAre We Making a Mistake?\n\nDespite Black people having more than enough reason to sit out this round, we’re living through events for the future history textbooks. These national protests will go down as powerful examples of Americans exercising their rights and taking a clear and direct stand against the acting president. But just as the demonstrations will be documented, so will Black folks’ absence from them. \n\nThere’s power in the Black community, and there’s even more power in mobilization. Many Black leaders including Harris, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett and William J. Barber praised folks for taking to the streets all while encouraging Black people to hold down the fort. “What we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage,” Harris said during her first major speech since leaving office. “Courage is contagious.”\n\nAre Protests Even Working?\n\nShort answer? Yes and no. Protesting against Trump doesn’t promote policy change because Trump is the one making said changes. But as thousands of folks continue to hit the streets, one thing is certain: this is a new age of America. \n\nAmericans haven’t banded together like this since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and we all remember just how impactful George Floyd’s death was. The New York Times estimated anywhere between 15 and 26 million people protested in honor of Floyd. Directly following the tragic murder, several laws like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act aimed to address issues like police misconduct, racial profiling and excessive force. So if you need a recent example of protests influencing real change, well there you go!\n\nIs Rallying the Only Way to Protest?\n\nJust because Black folks put their foot down when it comes to joining demonstrations doesn’t mean we’re laying down for the next four years. Rev. Al Sharpton and other leaders have led their own boycotts and called out the president.\n\nBetween Sharpton’s “buy-cott” of Costco— the grocery store giant who famously doubled down on their commitment to diversity— and politicians like N.J. Rep. Cry Booker’s 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, Black folks are finding new ways to show our solidarity. We have a long four years and beyond to buckle up for, so Black folks, it might be time to rethink how our chapters will read in the new history books.","summary":"As protests continue to rage across the country against President Donald Trump’s administration, there seems to be one group of Americans no where on the front lines: the Black community.

There were no riots in Harlem. They definitely didn’t go from the non-riots to protest Harvard,” Kosta said. “And none of that had anything to do with Stephen A’s question about academic freedom. It’s almost like he’s talking about Black stuff because Stephen A. Smith is Black.”\n\n“The Daily Show” production continued to play the clip from Trump’s interview, during which the president suddenly shifted to boasting that he had “a very high Black vote.” The number of Black male voters for Trump roughly doubled in the 2024 presidential election. However, former Vice President Kamala Harris won 80% of the Black vote, per an exit poll by the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m starting to think that maybe Trump should not be choosing the curriculum for the smartest college in the world,” Kosta said. “The answer was so dumbfounding that Stephen A., who is a professional interrupter, was left speechless for the first time in his life.”\n\nAfterward, Kosta moved on to Smith’s “General Hospital” cameo appearance, but he had to throw in one more Trump bit to seal the comedic deal on his segment.\n\n“I can’t wait to tune in next week to see if he has an evil twin Stephen B. Smith,” Kosta said, making light of Smith’s character, who fatally shoots a nurse in the episode. “I guess I got to start watching ‘General Hospital,’ or as Trump calls it, ‘General Harlem.’”\n\nYou can watch “The Daily Show” clip in the video above.","summary":"\"It's almost like he's talking about Black stuff because Stephen A.

The kind of week that requires a drink, or several, to forget about. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nThey say it’s easy to start a war, harder to finish one. David Hogg, the Democratic National Committee’s current Vice Chair (and we’ll see how long that lasts), is trying to trigger a war within his party, threatening to launch a massive primary campaign against older incumbent Democrats. But with each passing day, it’s becoming less clear how he will seize his victory.\n\nOn Tuesday, Semafor reported that Kalyn Free, a Native American attorney whom Hogg defeated in the vice chair election, is challenging the results of the race.\n\nThe DNC plans to hold a meeting on May 12 to hear Free’s challenge. Free, of course, claims the “fatally flawed election … discriminated against three women of color candidates.”\n\nBig yikes. Those are not words you want to hear if you are a straight, white male.\n\nMeanwhile, Hogg is vowing to continue being a petulant goofball. Or, to borrow his words, “fight.”\n\nF This, F That\n\nIlhan Omar has a sailor’s mouth. And bad political instincts, too.\n\nDaily Caller News Foundation reporter Myles Morrell asked Omar if more Democrats should jet off to El Salvador and advocate for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member deported by the Trump administration.\n\nSimple question, right?\n\nIn fact, Omar didn’t even have to answer it. She could have simply walked off in silence. Politicians do that literally every day.\n\nInstead, she made a mockery of herself, and, without answering the question, repeatedly told Morrell to “fuck off.”\n\n“Do you think more of your Democratic colleagues should be traveling to El Salvador to advocate on behalf of Abrego Garcia?” Morrell asked.\n\n INSANE: Rep. Ilhan Omar tells Daily Caller News Foundation reporter @MylesMorell to “f*** off” 🚨 pic.twitter.com/cZdn6BmgWj — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 1, 2025\n\n“I think you should fuck off,” Omar said.\n\n“I’m sorry, what, congresswoman?” Morrell asked.\n\n“You should fuck off. You,” Omar said.\n\nYes, what a fantastic look for Democrats. Way to keep it classy, Ilhan.\n\nKamala, Why?!\n\nIt’s a huge night for Kamala on Wednesday. This is her first major speech since her blow-out loss to Donald Trump.\n\nAll she has to do, frankly, is not say something ridiculous. That’s a tough ask for Kamala, but not an impossible one.\n\nAh, but what does she do? Kamala encourages Democrats to act like elephants, referencing a recent viral video of elephants at the San Diego Zoo huddling together amid an earthquake. She called it a “powerful metaphor,” encouraging fellow Democrats to “find and connect with each other.”\n\n“Please allow me, friends, to digress for a moment. Okay, it’s kind of dark in here, but I am going to ask for a show of hands. Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago? The one of the elephants at the San Diego Zoo during the earthquake. Google it if you have not seen it,” Harris said.\n\n“So, that scene has been on my mind,” she added. “Everybody has been asking what are you thinking about these days. For those who haven’t seen it, here those elephants were, and as soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet, they got in a circle and stood next to each other to protect the most vulnerable. Think about it. What a powerful metaphor.”\n\nPowerful, indeed.\n\nCrockett Loves Borders\n\nShe’s back. The queen of dark woke.\n\nIt may comes as a shocker, but Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett is a fan of secure borders. And on Wednesday, expressed such support while accidentally indicting her own party’s open border policies.\n\nCrockett posted an Instagram video complaining about Trump and the GOP’s agenda to deport illegal aliens. However, she accidentally called for, yes, closed borders.\n\n“How would [the Trump administration feel] if some other country decided they were gonna just start throwing people randomly in our country. That is absolutely insane. All I gotta say is you need to get these fools out of here,” Crockett said.\n\n Jasmine Crockett on deportations: “This is insane. How would it feel if countries sent people to our country!?” pic.twitter.com/3RuovIWJVP — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) May 1, 2025\n\nJasmine arrived at her conclusion that borders are good, in a roundabout way. But, hey, that has to count for something.\n\nWalz Admits He Was A DEI Hire\n\nDemocrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz admitted Monday that was a DEI hire, and guess what happens when you hire someone solely based on their race or ethnicity?\n\nAs was the case with Waltz in the 2024 election, DEI hires tend to be failures, because they were never cut out for the job in the first place — except for the fact that they had the correct skin color.\n\nAt a Harvard Kennedy School forum, Waltz said that Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate to “code talk to white guys.”\n\nBrilliant strategy, I must say.\n\n“I also was on the ticket, quite honestly, because I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that, then I could put them at ease. I was the permission structure to say you can do this and vote for this, and you look across those swing states, with the exception of Minnesota, we didn’t get enough of those votes,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nWell, it clearly didn’t work. Walz was far better at code-talking to white liberal women than to any man — black, white, gay, straight, orange, or purple.\n\nTrump Trumps The Polls\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s poll numbers aren’t looking too hot at the moment. But Democrats might not have a reason to celebrate.\n\nAccording to a new CNN poll, 45% of registered voters believe Trump is doing a better job than former vice president Kamala Harris would have. Forty-three percent believe the same of Harris.\n\n “These numbers should be a major wake-up call for Democrats.” Even now, Trump still does well when matched against Democrats. -Trump 45%-Harris 43% on who’d be doing a better job as president -Trump 40% to Dems in Congress’ 32% on who can better deal with the main U.S. problems pic.twitter.com/P5Fg4KdLqG — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) May 1, 2025\n\n“If Democrats think that at this particular point, just because Donald Trump is unpopular, that they’re going to run away with it like a Heisman Trophy winner – that is not necessarily the case. These numbers should be a major wake-up moment for Democrats,” CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten said.\n\n“When you match Donald Trump against his actual competition, Donald Trump comes out ahead…and that is why Democrats, in fact, cannot count their chickens just yet, because those eggs have not cracked at this particular moment,” he continued.\n\nSign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!
