I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't even apply to one... it's all theatrics,' one critic said.\n\nAnother added: 'In other words, I don't want to go to grad school, but I can pose as a social Justice warrior and then get hired by dad's buddies think tank.'\n\nA third wrote: 'If virtue signaling paid well, she'd be a millionaire.' \n\nAnother warned that she was so 'brainwashed' that she was inadvertently 'screwing herself out of an education.'\n\nHope shared her 'life update' on her TikTok account, telling her followers: 'I got into grad school. I will not be attending starting this fall though, and I will no longer be attending the university that I originally applied for.\n\n'I applied for one school. I kind of had my heart set on one school and that's what I wanted to do. \n\n'I'm not going to name the institution but after recent events I decided I am not going to give my money, go into debt for, support institutions that don't support their students and the right to protest and speak out for their communities.\n\n'Students deserve to be protected. I'm not worried about if I were to be protected or not at said institution, I'm a privileged white woman, but I'm not going to put myself in a position where I'm giving money or supporting institutions that don't support their students.'\n\nWhile Hope did not name the school, several Ivy League institutions have been in the spotlight over protesting.\n\nColumbia University agreed last week to put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhaul its rules for protests and student discipline, in a move seen as bowing down to to an extraordinary ultimatum by the Trump administration.\n\nAs part of the sweeping reforms, the university will also adopt a new definition of antisemitism and expand 'intellectual diversity' by staffing up its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, according to a letter published Friday by the interim president, Katrina Armstrong.\n\nThe announcement drew immediate condemnation from some faculty and free speech groups, who accused the university of caving to President Donald Trump's largely unprecedented intrusion upon the school's academic freedom.\n\n'Columbia's capitulation endangers academic freedom and campus expression nationwide,' Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding over the university's handling of protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. \n\nAs a precondition to restoring those funds - along with billions more in future grants - federal officials last week demanded the university immediately enact nine separate reforms to its academic and security policies.\n\nOn March 8, federal immigration officials arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist and permanent resident in his university-owned apartment building.\n\nHe vowed it would be the 'first of many' attempted deportations. The case is ongoing. \n\nWhile Trump has made Columbia the most visible target of his crackdown on higher education, he has put other universities on notice that they will face cuts if they do not embrace his agenda.\n\nHis administration has announced investigations into 52 universities for their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And it has suspended approximately $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nAnd in the comment section of Hope's video, she was inundated with current and former students who said their schools' stances 'broke their hearts.' \n\n'It's sad when these institutions don't support their communities,' one former student at John Hopkins said.\n\n'University of Michigan broke my heart,' another added.\n\nThe State Department has revoked more than 300 student visas connected to college students who protested in support of Palestine. \n\nHope said her criticism of the school she had been accepted into 'has nothing to do with students that currently go there, a lot of the faculty.'\n\n'But the people at the top are making these decisions and I decided that I'm not going to do that. \n\n'I'm going to do a little bit more research going forward, making sure I'm going to schools that align with my values and then maybe start in a year, which is okay. I'm not really in a rush.","summary":"Her comments sparked outrage among critics who said she was acting 'performatively' and 'setting feminism back 50 years.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14553073/tim-walz-daughter-hope-grad-school.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/31/00/96731699-0-image-m-37_1743378643368.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 00:40:20","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":305895662,"title":"Despite making up just 1% of the US population, transgender individuals face intense political scrutiny.","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — On the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people’s access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt’s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board — particularly Trump’s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies — along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges — it’s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president’s spotlight is giving Monday’s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump’s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women’s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said. But “I don’t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.”\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

Roosevelt’s unprecedented four elections, states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nPressed to clarify whether he had been presented with any specific plans to bypass the limit, Trump replied: “There are – not plans – but there are methods which you could do it, as you know.”\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump added, though he noted that “it is far too early to think about it.”\n\nAsked about a hypothetical scenario in which Vice President J.D. Vance could run for president and then hand over the office to him, Trump confirmed, “That’s one.”\n\n“But there are others too,” he hinted, without elaborating further.\n\nWhile Trump’s allies have often dismissed his previous third-term remarks as jokes or trolling, Sunday’s comments suggest a more serious consideration. His political adviser Steve Bannon recently told NewsNation that Trump could “run and win again in 2028,” hinting at possible legal maneuvers.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow a president to serve three non-consecutive terms, though it has so far gained little traction. Amendments to the Constitution require approval by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-quarters of US states.\n\nTrump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then–Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has told NBC News he is “not joking” about potentially seeking a third term in office \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/614989-trump-third-term-not-joking/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67e9cca885f54007ac29f7a7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:01:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":305885776,"title":"Anti-Trump UAW president backs tariffs on foreign-made cars: ‘They could bring work back in very short order’","text":"WASHINGTON — United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain said Sunday that President Trump’s looming 25% tariff on foreign-made cars could swiftly boost American manufacturing jobs.\n\nFain, a prominent anti-Trump campaigner ahead of last year’s election, said that the levies could benefit workers and use remarkably similar language as the White House on how carmakers could onshore jobs.\n\n“We have excess capacity” at manufacturing plants, Fain said, using near identical framing as the White House. “They could bring work back in very short order.”\n\n“Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers,” Fain said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nTrump’s stiff auto tariffs are set to take effect Wednesday and could trigger upheaval in the car industry.\n\nWednesday is also the advertised launch date for Trump’s 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods and his “reciprocal” tariffs on other major trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.\n\nAbout half of vehicles sold in the US are foreign-made, mostly in Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Germany.\n\nFain wasn’t entirely uncritical of his longtime political foe — emphasizing that he wants union membership to grow as a result of a potential influx of auto jobs.\n\n“It doesn’t do any good if they’re going to locate them in places and they’re not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns,” the union boss said.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s 2025 challenger, were closely aligned with the UAW — going so far as to snub non-unionized Tesla from a promotional electric vehicle showcase on the White House lawn.\n\nTrump and Fain have exchanged insults publicly, with the president calling on auto-union members to oust Fain, who on Sunday offered critical words about other Trump actions, calling him “deplorable” for moving to strip federal workers of union eligibility. \n\nThe auto tariffs were announced last week, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stressing that they also would apply to car parts.\n\nCanadian and Mexican car imports will be tariffed based on the percentage of parts that are US-made. If half of its parts are Americans, for example, the levy would be 12.5% rather than 25%.\n\n“Half of the roughly 16 million cars, SUVs and light trucks Americans bought in 2024 were imports,” Navarro said last week. “Of the remaining 8 million units, more than half of these cars were assembled from foreign parts. So what that means is less than 25% of the cars sold in America contain US content on average. That stops right now with the Trump auto tariffs.”\n\nThe idea of a 25% tariff on cars was previously studied by the US International Trade Commission, which said in a report last year that “[a] new 25% tariff on U.S. imports from outside of North America would reduce vehicle imports by 73.9%, increase average prices of vehicles in the United States by 5.0%, and increase variable profits from domestic production by 5.2%”\n\nThat report did not assess the effect of tariffing Canadian and Mexican imports, meaning the impact may be even greater.\n\nTrump has aggressively adopted tariffs during his second term after largely using the threat of tariffs during his first term to score trade reforms from other countries.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump slapped an additional 25% tariff on China, citing fentanyl smuggling, and in Februar,y he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum, without exceptions for major importers that previously were in effect.\n\nTrump has teased plans for tariffs on computer chips, copper, pharmaceuticals and other products — arguing it would boost the US economy, though critics say it could fuel inflation by making goods more expensive.","summary":"\"We have excess capacity\" at manufacturing plants, Fain said, using near identical framing as the White House. \"They could bring work back in very short order.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/anti-trump-uaw-president-backs-tariffs-on-foreign-made-cars-they-could-bring-work-back-in-very-short-order/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-b0jvh4q39-1743363480204.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743349097&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uSNqoSFL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-30 22:52:22","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":305885594,"title":"Antonio Brown and disgraced rapper Sean Kingston release bizarre 'Elon Musk' song","text":"Antonio Brown and disgraced rapper Sean Kingston release bizarre 'Elon Musk' song\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-NFL star goes on wild live-stream rant over incest and rape case\n\nBy ISABEL BALDWIN\n\nPublished: 23:31 BST, 30 March 2025 | Updated: 23:34 BST, 30 March 2025\n\nFormer NFL star Antonio Brown has seemingly found creative inspiration in his political passions. \n\nThe former wide receiver has collaborated with Sean Kingston, who was found guilty in federal court of over $1 million in fraud this week, to release a new song titled, 'Elon Musk.' \n\nThe single dropped on Friday -

I do think he’s taken inappropriate liberties with women and gotten handsy with them in a way he’s owned himself years ago when he was a celebrity, and it is what it is. That’s the past. \n\n“I don’t give a s--- about Trump getting handsy with someone 20 years ago. I want someone who will close the border, which he has. I want someone who will keep boys out of my daughters’ sports, which he has. I want someone who will stand up to the insane DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies so that white kids will stop hearing in school that they’re born with some original sin from which they cannot recover, which he has.”\n\nKelly said that as far as the accusations brought against Trump by E. Jean Carroll, which resulted in a jury in a civil trial finding Trump liable for sexual abuse, “I don’t believe one word of that. Not one word.”\n\nKelly, who now hosts a popular podcast and YouTube show, famously clashed with Trump when she moderated a 2015 Republican presidential debate, when Kelly asked him about comments he’d made in the past calling some women “fat pigs” and “dogs.” In an interview after the debate, Trump criticized Kelly’s questions, saying “There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”\n\nKelly said that she has put that incident behind her.\n\n“Trump was trying to win a presidential election, and ... it was useful for him to have me as a foil,” she said in the Times interview. “Look, you have to separate when you’re in this business, you the person and you the professional. Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand, and they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game.”\n\nBut Kelly’s relationship with Trump has improved over the years, and Kelly went as far as to publicly endorse Trump on the eve of the 2024 election – an unusual move for a journalist.\n\n“Yes, I’m still a journalist, but I’m in this new ecosystem where the old rules don’t apply,” she said.\n\nWhen Garcia-Navarro pointed out to Kelly that many people saw her endorsement as “caving” to Trump, Kelly said she saw it a different way.\n\n“I don’t think it was me caving. It was me rising. It was me answering something I truly felt called to do. I’m thrilled Trump won. I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won, and in the end, I had no qualms about going out there for him whatsoever.”\n\nKelly was born in Syracuse and attended Tecumseh Elementary School in the Jamesville-DeWitt school district before her family moved to the Albany are when she was 9. She later returned to Central New York to get a degree from Syracuse University.","summary":"\"I'm thrilled Trump won,\" she said.

Republicans, meanwhile, saw significant electoral success, with President Donald Trump returning to office after winning the popular vote and the Electoral College.Trump and his allies have repeatedly teased the idea of him seeking a third term, despite most legal analysts agreeing it would violate the U.S. Constitution as all presidents are limited to two terms in office.​Democrats will have to mount a strong campaign in 2028 to regain lost seats in Congress and reclaim the presidency, and Moore is a rising voice within the party.What To Know During a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, host Dana Bash and Moore spoke about the state of the Democratic Party, Maryland, and Trump policies.At the end of the conversation, Bash asked Moore, \"Are you ruling out a 2028 run for president?\"Moore laughed and said, \"I am not focused on anything, except for making sure this is Maryland's decade, no.\" He continued to detail a new tax cut in the state, adding that he's \"really proud of what Maryland is doing and I'm focused on making sure we keep that progress going.\"Bash responded: \"That certainly sounds like something that would fit on a national platform campaign bumper sticker.\"Moore's press team pointed to his past comments and interviews on the subject, with director of communications David Turner telling Newsweek, \"He's said 'no' plenty\" when asked about a presidential run.Moore previously told Bloomberg in January when asked if he was contemplating running for president: \"No. I've got the best job around. And I love the momentum we're actually seeing in the State of Maryland.\"Earlier this month at the annual Gridiron Club dinner, Moore pushed back the speculations: \"If I actually wanted to be president, I wouldn't do any of this. Instead, I would take my case directly to the people who are in charge of our democracy: the Kremlin.\"Although the governor backed former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaigns in 2024, he has pledged to collaborate with Trump but has also called the president out over certain executive orders.\"I am very clear that I will work with this administration and find ways of finding common-sense solutions that are going to uplift Maryland,\" he said during the Bloomberg interview.Moore was elected to the top state post in 2022, with over 64 percent of the vote.

Vance would then resign to allow Trump to regain the top job.\n\n“But there are others too,” Trump said, without further elaboration.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice” — allowing for the potential loophole of Vance resigning in Trump’s favor.\n\n“I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration. I’m focused on the current,” the president said.\n\nTrump explained he’s interesting in potentially serving as president until 2033 because “I like working.”\n\n“I’m not joking,” the billionaire developer and former reality TV star told Welker. “But I’m not — it is far too early to think about it.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly mentioned potentially serving a third term, though initially the idea was perceived as a way to troll Democrats and to avoid the perception that he’s a term-limited lame duck, which would sap his influence as politicians court potential successors. \n\nThe president has been greeted at several recent public events with chants of “four more years!” in recognition of that notion.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt is the only American president elected to more than two terms — dying partway through his fourth. Presidents traditionally served just two terms, following George Washington’s example, until FDR’s presidency, which prompted the Constitution to be amended to make it a rule.\n\nTrump, the second president in US history to serve non-consecutive terms, is set to be the oldest-ever commander-in-chief when he completes his second term in January 2029 at age 82 and seven months — beating out former President Joe Biden, who left office in January at age 82 and two months.\n\nHe would be nearing age 87 at the end of a hypothetical third term.\n\nBiden was forced by fellow Democrats to abandon his quest for a second term last July as doubts were raised about his cognitive fitness, paving the way for then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ doomed campaign. She ultimately lost all seven swing states to Trump.\n\nHowever, a small handful of leaders have led major Western democracies well into old age.\n\nWest Germany’s Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was 87 when he resigned in 1963 — after 14 years in power — and is historically well-regarded for his accomplishments in rebuilding his country from the aftermath of World War II.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) in January introduced a constitutional amendment to allow Trump to be elected to a third term, though that the legislation would need to be passed by two-thirds of the House and Senate and then be ratified by three-fourths of states — likely an impossibility due to Democratic opposition.","summary":"WASHINGTON — President Trump said he&#8217;s &#8220;not joking&#8221; about serving a third term in the White House — and thinks there&#8217;s a loophole to make it happen.

Trump welcome his idea of joining the United States, but some only want Alberta and Saskatchewan to join, not all of Canada.The Western Standard probed the views of Canadian Trump supporters, mostly through questions posted on social media. In a phone interview, retired nurse Brenda Virtue of Bowmanville, Ont., said Canada joining the U.S. is a big question — even south of the border.“I was in Tulsa [Oklahoma] for two weeks in January, and that's the biggest question people asked me, ‘What [do] Canadians think about becoming the 51st state?’”Trump calling Canada the 51st state is his way of negotiating, Virtue said.“He likes to get a rise out of people. And when he says things like that, it makes people do other stuff,” she explained.Virtue, who nursed in Sacramento, California in past decades, said she has lost faith in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She might be okay with joining the U.S. depending on “how it came down.” “I'd definitely miss Canadian healthcare, except because the government's involved, it's delayed so much, people die waiting for [treatment],” Virtue explained.In Winnipeg, Cheyenne Keith said joining the U.S. is an opportunity: “Puerto Rico has been begging for statehood for decades and they’re offering it to us on a platter. Being pro-American union doesn’t make you anti-Canadian.”Edward de Vries of Esterhazy, Sask. loves the idea. “I would sign up right away, provided we could exchange our currency on a one-to-one value. Canada as we knew it is over, and it looks unlikely to ever return.”.National decline feeds openness to join U.S.Many Trump supporters said Canadian decline under the Liberal government made Trump's talk more palatable. “I don’t believe that Trump will actually make us a 51st state. I believe we are in the biggest game of chicken with the USA and Canada will lose. Everything that Trump is doing is showing our country’s weakness due to poor leadership and reckless decisions. I believe this is a strategy to get Canada to clean up its act,” said Natalie DiPietra Cudmore, a real estate agent in Spruce Grove, Alta.Mark Wong, a real estate broker in Toronto wants more \"business mobility\" between provinces and \"a greater economic union in North America.\"“Canada has already made itself the 51st state with all its anti-energy, anti-investment, and anti-growth policies. We might as well make it official so the people could get a tax break,” Wong said. “I hope Trump’s rhetoric forces us to reconsider the folly of our ways.”An Environics poll in October 2024 found that 44 percent of Canadians who intend to vote Conservative would also vote for Trump if they were American, compared to 36 percent for Kamala Harris and 20 percent undecided. However, Conservatives who were female or older than 55 were still more likely to vote for Harris.Among undecided Canadian voters, Harris supporters outnumbered Trump backers 3-to-1. This ratio was higher than 10-to-1 for Liberal voters, and roughly 13-to-1 for both NDP and Bloc voters..Rancher hopes tariff threats lead Saskatchewan to join the U.S..Teresa Wipp Docksteader, self-employed in Fort Saint John, B.C., said she is weary of paying high taxes.“The U.S. is going to just come and get us. I am waving my white flag,” Docksteader said. “If we cannot stop the corruption here I could welcome becoming part of the US. [I] just spent 10 days in Arizona. There is such a difference in how free the US is. I love it every time [Trump] calls Trudeau ‘governor.’”Andrew Brown, a music producer from Saskatoon, suspects Trump doesn’t want to annex Canada, but forge more cooperation on combating the opioid crisis, illegal immigration, and transnational gangs.“Trump has always displayed a dry, facetious sense of humor and is definitely trolling our PM. It's a tongue in cheek way of him showing everyone that nothing was getting done,” Brown said.Lorne Ridgway in Christopher Lake, Sask. would be okay with Saskatchewan and Alberta or all provinces joining the Union.“I would welcome all or any of it. It certainly doesn’t scare me. I think of all the positives that can come out of a union like this,” Ridgway said. “Canada needs to clean up our act with immigration and the border. Canada’s lack of military power is a huge issue and has left us very vulnerable.\".Take the West, Leave the RestAt a White House press conference on February 26, a reporter said unnamed government officials in Canada suggested to him that if Alberta join the U.S., Saskatchewan would follow, then possibly British Columbia.In reply, Trump said, “A lot of people in Canada are liking becoming our beautiful, cherished 51st state.” He said the U.S. did not need Canadian cars, lumber, or oil, and promised the northerners “ultimate security” as part of the U.S.A survey of “randomly recruited” members of Leger’s online panel in October 2024 found 57 percent of Albertans would vote for Harris, and 23 percent for Trump, with the remainder undecided.In comments to the Western Standard, some western Trump supporters cited western alienation, wanting Uncle Sam to come only for them.“I like Trump and support what he's doing for America,” said Tony Ollenberger of Saskatoon, Sask. “However, he can lay off the 51st state nonsense anytime–unless he's interested in just taking Alberta and Saskatchewan.”.Regina, Sask. resident Dane Melby questions Trump’s intentions but welcomes his region joining the U.S.“I don't actually know what to believe about his remarks on Canada becoming the 51st state. Part of me thinks he's joking, part of me thinks he's serious. I will say this though, I would rather have Trump in charge of Canada than Trudeau,” Melby said, prior to Trudeau's departure.“Western Canada has been subsidizing Eastern Canada in the form of equalization payments for decades. I am in favor of Western Canada becoming the 51st state. Eastern Canada can suffer without Western Canada,” Melby added.Medicine Hat, Alta. resident John Wurtz uses the iconic image of Trump with his fist raised rising from his assassination attempt as his Facebook profile picture.“Not never ever should Canada become the 51st state. Alberta and Sask should become the 51st state, and then Canada should have a 50 percent tariff slapped on everything. And anyone entering Alberta and Saskatchewan from the rest of Canada should have to pay a $500 entry fee,” Wurtz said. .Other Trump Supporters Mildly or Stridently OpposedBradley Ollerhead, a photographer in Victoria, said he lost confidence in Canadian governments during the pandemic and values freer trade. However, “As far as being a state goes, that might be a step too far,” he said.Inez Huber, Pilot Butte, Sask. likes Trump’s stances on many things, just not Canada.“I think he should just worry about his own country. He's got a lot of states there that he's got to set straight and get under his belt,” Huber said in an interview. “He's got an agenda in his head, and he thinks that if he absorbs us, he's going to absorb everything that we have–all of our resources, our minerals.”Huber said ultimately, “We need to better Canada and better our province alone.\"Erma Rea of Foam Lake, Sask. says Trump has done a good job as 47th president. \"In the short time that he's been in there, the things he's done have made a big difference. That needed to be done, and no one else would stand up and do it,\" she said.Still, Rea thought the U.S. would become the bigger beneficiary of taking over Canada.\"If we become part of the States, he's going to have our resources, and then what are we going to have?\" she asked. \"The States is going to own that, not us. We'll just be another state of the United States.\"But Lafleche, Sask. resident Lee Tallon says, better America's shadow than another's.\"I do not want to see us become the 51st state, but I do believe that we need a very healthy relationship with the US in order for us to be the strongest Canada that we can be. However, I also believe that we are better off being the 51st state and having that happen publicly, rather than being taken over quietly by any number of other nations that view us as a way to expand their land base and access our minerals, energy, and agricultural products,\" Tallon said.","summary":"Many Canadian supporters of Donald J.

Noem also went on “numerous” trips to Trump’s then-home in Palm Beach, Florida as she continued to rise up the MAGA movement’s ranks.\n\nThe news agency also reported Noem spent roughly $2,200 on a visit to a Texas dental clinic.\n\nShe refused to say what the trips were costing taxpayers but, in the weeks since Noem became Trump's Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem's political and personal activity and not South Dakota business.\n\nMost of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, the AP's analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor's office.\n\nThe expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.\n\nThe revelations come at a time when federal spending is under the spotlight, with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency making mass cuts.\n\nThe spending \"offends a lot of people,\" said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem's ambition for higher office could've been paid with campaign funds.\n\nTaffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. \"It seems like an incredible amount of money,\" Howard said.\n\nA spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There's no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses — even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.\n\n\"Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,\" Murtaugh said. \"When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\"\n\nMurtaugh then questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"They maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\" Murtaugh wrote in an email.\n\nJosie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem's gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were \"a matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.\"\n\n\"The scope of that security is not up to the governor,\" Harms added.\n\nDuring her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing the travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.\n\nThis is not the first time Noem's travel and finances have come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.\n\nBack in 2021, she came under fire for allegedly using underpaid prison labor to create a hand-carved wooden desk worth $9,000.\n\nAdditional reporting by the Associated Press","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/taxpayers-had-foot-kristi-noem-164704284.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8e5d2e566cd15a835a52ce2dafbe6c69","video":"","publish_date":"2025-03-30 18:37:10","author":"Andrew Georgeson","authors":["Andrew Georgeson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":305842002,"title":"Maryland governor Wes Moore stuck for words explaining why youth abandoned party","text":"One of Democrats' biggest rising stars is just as baffled as others on why younger male voters are abandoning the party.\n\nThe 2026 midterm elections are gearing up and Democrats are desperate to gain back a majority in the House or Senate to stop Republicans railroading through every nomination and policy proposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, however, struggled to give insight into why Democrats think they lost ground with specific demographics over the last few elections. But he said it probably had a lot to do with their messaging coming off as lecturing.\n\nAsked whether the Democratic brand is 'toxic,' Moore deflected and said 'this is not a new thing' because there are policies that have not worked for people throughout time.\n\n'We have got to make sure that it's not about a talking point. It's not about what's the right slogan. It's about delivering results,' Moore explained during an interview on Sunday with CNN's State of the Union.\n\n'I think about the foundation for our race in the first place,' he went on. 'It was young people. And a lot of it was young men, because I think we were speaking to them and not speaking at them.'\n\nBut then, the 46-year-old governor got into a confusing line of reasoning where he made mention to the male suicide rate and how that might relate to a drop off in support for Democrats.\n\n'I think we were bringing them in, because if you look at the data that we have about young men in our society, there is a fall off,' Moore went on. \n\n'The level of suicide rate for young men has exploded,' he said. 'When you're looking at the fact that the employment rate and the job participation numbers have not grown for young men in this country since 1964.'\n\nDemocrats over the last several weeks have been floundering and struggling to explain the direction of the party.\n\nIt especially took a turn this month when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer joined a group of other Democrats who voted for the continuing resolution that would pass the Republicans' six-month budget to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nMore progressive members of the party were unhappy with Schumer's vote – and it even prompted calls for the New York Democrat to step down from his leadership role.\n\nAnd a CNN poll on which figures represent the future for Democrats, no one emerged a clear winner, further exhibiting the unsteadiness within the party.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did come out on top with 10 percent support while 9 percent said former vice president Kamala Harris, who lost against Trump in 2024.\n\nSchumer and several others sat at an insignificant 2 percent when Democratic voters were asked which member of the party best represented their 'core values.'\n\nMore than half of male voters under the age of 30 supported President Trump in the November election – a shift from 2020 when Joe Biden won a similar share up against Trump.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 young white men voted for Trump, but the Republican leader also pulled a significant number of votes from Hispanic and young black men, who previously were more supportive of Democrats, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nCNN host Dana Bash noted to Moore how he was able to improve support among young male voters at the state level in the last election and asked if that was a promising sign for the party at the national level.\n\n'I think everybody needs to address the fact that if you look at the data and what happened, and the reason that we've really gotten here, is if you just look at the data – that 30, 40 years ago, there was a real fall off with young women and there was a big push, a policy push towards making sure that we're directing more support towards our young women,' Moore explained.\n\n'Now what's happened is a pendulum has swung,' Moore added, making it clear that the party needs to focus more of their messaging on winning more male voters back.","summary":"One of Democrats' biggest rising stars is just as baffled as others on why younger male voters are abandoning the party.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14552449/maryland-governor-wes-moore-stuck-explanation-youth-party.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/30/18/96725941-0-image-m-30_1743355989706.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 17:56:34","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":305841994,"title":"Virginia parents' fury as school puts up ABCs display... starting with 'A is for abortion'","text":"A Virginia high school is facing fierce backlash after putting up an alphabet display for Women's History Month that highlighted abortion and the transgender flag.\n\nWest Springfield High School, in Fairfax County, put up the controversial ABCs display in March, reported The Daily Signal.\n\nShocking images from the project include a poster that stated, 'A is for Abortion' and showed a pregnancy test and a coat hanger. \n\nThe first letter alone prompted sharp criticism online from concerned community members who felt the project was politicizing women's history.\n\n'Titled \"ABCs to Me,\" the letter \"A\" is not for a notable woman of history such as Aviator Amelia Earhart; rather, \"A is for Abortion,\" accompanied by an image of a coat hanger and a positive pregnancy test.

DOGE is a temporary cross-departmental organization that was established to slim down and streamline the federal government. The group will be dissolved on July 4, 2026. FEDS ON ALERT FOR TESLA 'GLOBAL DAY OF ACTION' AFTER NATIONWIDE VIOLENCE LEADS TO ARRESTS The protests on Saturday were billed as \"nonviolent\" and showcased people line dancing outside Teslas stores while holding anti-swastika and anti-Musk signs. Others protested for a couple of hours outside of Tesla dealerships, local media outlets reported, with some holding signs reading \"DON'T BUY SWASTICAR,\" or \"Nobody elected Elon.\" THE LOUDEST SILENCE: TOP DEMOCRATS REMAIN MUM AMID VIOLENT ATTACKS ON TESLA The U.S. protests on Saturday stretched from New York to Maryland to Texas to California. Many of the rallies saw dozens of protesters, while larger protests, such as one in Chicago, drew crowds of over 100 people, and another in New York drew hundreds of protesters, various media reports show. VANDAL STRIKES CYBERTRUCK, TESLA OWNER HITS BACK \"Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement. We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. This protest is a lawful exercise of our First Amendment right to peaceful assembly,\" the Action Network, a left-wing advocacy group, described the nationwide protests online. \"Rally attenders must be peaceful and nonviolent,\" another left-wing group, Indivisible, described a protest in New Jersey, which included directions on what to chant at passersby. \"No vandalism of Tesla cars or stores; or insults of Tesla drivers permitted! When Tesla drivers pass we will chant, 'Sell your Tesla, Trade it in! instead of booing. STAY OFF THE ROADWAY! It is legal for protesters to be on the sidewalk but NOT to be on the roadway or block entrances to businesses, including Tesla. STAY OFF TESLA PROPERTY! We are not allowed on any private property. Indivisible policy forbids engaging with counter protesters (and other protestors) this is for the safety of all people.\" A local news outlet, media personalities and conservative critics have speculated that the recent anti-Tesla protests are embroiled in \"astroturfing,\" which is defined by Merriam-Webster as a campaign \"falsely made to appear grassroots.\" DISABLED TESLA OWNER TARGETED IN VANDALISM, SAYS ANTI-MUSK PROTESTERS ARE JUST 'HURTING FAMILIES' \"I know when something is AstroTurf. Fun fact: I was among the first reporters (if not first) to put the concept of ‘Astro Turf’ lobbying into the pages of the Wall Street Journal as an international trade reporter,\" former Wall Street Journal correspondent Asra Nomani posted to X after reporting on a Tesla protest last Saturday in Tysons, Virginia, outside of Washington, D.C. TESLA TAKEDOWN: ANTI-MUSK PROTESTERS MOBILIZE FOR GLOBAL DAY OF PROTEST AT HUNDREDS OF TESLA LOCATIONS \"While local #TeslaTakedown protests may appear spontaneous and community-driven, they are the product of well-funded, tightly coordinated campaigns led by national political organizations like the Indivisible Project, http://MoveOn.org, and professional protest firms,\" Nomani continued. Nomani authored a piece in the Fairfax Times titled, \"Local #TeslaTakedown reveals ‘grassroots’ protests are AstroTurf.\" \"These groups use digital platforms, pre-scripted chants, pre-printed signs, and nationwide toolkits to manufacture the appearance of grassroots activism, and the messages on Tyco Road mirror the language of protests nationwide. This kind of organizing is known as ‘AstroTurfing’ – a term used to describe top-down efforts that mimic authentic, bottom-up civic engagement,\" she continued on X. Podcast host Joe Rogan, in a clip shared by Musk, speculated that protesters in past days were receiving money to take part in the anti-Tesla protests. \"For a lot of losers, a lot of people who don't have things going well in their life, and I was a loser at many points in my life, is somebody called me up and said, ‘Hey man, want to make 400 bucks an just go to this Kamala Harris rally?' I’m like, ‘Yeah, let’s go,'\" \"Joe Rogan Experience\" released on Saturday. MUSK SHOULD ‘NOT BE SURPRISED’ WHEN POLITICS ‘COME FOR’ HIS BUSINESS, DEM REP SAYS \"They were giving out $1,000 bucks for people to protest, I think it was Tesla. They had like the rules of engagement if someone comes after you… are you organizing gangs? Are you guys paying money for people and then literally saying to them, 'Here's what happens if you engage in violence?' Why is that even on the table? I thought this was peaceful protesting,\" he continued, noting he has not seen any reports of pro-Tesla individuals waging violence. Other X users took to social media to speculate and accuse the Tesla protests of being an example of astroturfing. \"ASTROTURF: Rep Jasmine Crockett is working with the Soros-backed paid protest group 'Indivisible' to organize canned protests at Tesla stores across the US. Here the Democrat congresswoman is asking for Elon to be 'taken down' for her birthday,\" popular conservative X account Amuse posted to X. \"NEW: Tesla protesters stop protesting at the Southlake Texas Tesla store the moment clock read 12 PM, according to @Carlos__Turcios. 'They all immediately left the minute it was 12:00 pm.' Odd,\" Trending Politics co-owner Colin Rugg posted to X. TESLA GROUP LEADER WARNS VIOLENT PROTESTS AGAINST CAR OWNERS ARE JUST THE 'STARTING POINT' Reports that some protesters packed their bags at exactly noon in Texas sparked further accusations of \"astroturfing,\" including one user who responded to Rugg saying, \"Paid astroturf. This entire op is fake. Follow the money.\" Seattle radio host Jason Rantz shared a photo on X showing a Tesla protester holding a sheet of scripted chants to reportedly deliver during a demonstration, which Musk called \"interesting\" in a response X post. Fox News Digital reached out to Indivisible, the Action Network and MoveOn.org regarding the astroturf speculation on Sunday morning, but did not immediately receive comment. The protests on Saturday were overwhelmingly peaceful. Department of Justice chief Pam Bondi previously vowed earlier this month that violent protesters who attack and cause damage at Tesla showrooms and other properties will face the full force of the law. \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\" A Las Vegas man was arrested earlier this month for his alleged involvement in a Molotov cocktail attack on a Tesla property. The suspect in that case faces a bevy of felony charges, including three counts of arson, three counts of possession of an explosive device, five counts of shooting into a car and four counts of destroying personal property, according to local police.

Noem also went on “numerous” trips to Trump’s then-home in Palm Beach, Florida as she continued to rise up the MAGA movement’s ranks.\n\nThe news agency also reported Noem spent roughly $2,200 on a visit to a Texas dental clinic.\n\nShe refused to say what the trips were costing taxpayers but, in the weeks since Noem became Trump's Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem's political and personal activity and not South Dakota business.\n\nMost of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, the AP's analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor's office.\n\nThe expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.\n\nThe revelations come at a time when federal spending is under the spotlight, with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency making mass cuts.\n\nThe spending \"offends a lot of people,\" said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem's ambition for higher office could've been paid with campaign funds.\n\nTaffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. \"It seems like an incredible amount of money,\" Howard said.\n\nA spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There's no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses — even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.\n\n\"Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,\" Murtaugh said. \"When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\"\n\nMurtaugh then questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"They maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\" Murtaugh wrote in an email.\n\nJosie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem's gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were \"a matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.\"\n\n\"The scope of that security is not up to the governor,\" Harms added.\n\nDuring her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing the travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.\n\nThis is not the first time Noem's travel and finances have come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.\n\nBack in 2021, she came under fire for allegedly using underpaid prison labor to create a hand-carved wooden desk worth $9,000.\n\nAdditional reporting by the Associated Press","summary":"Trump’s homeland security secretary racked up costs in her previous job as governor of South Dakota","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kristi-noem-private-jet-bill-b2724132.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/21/23/Trump_Immigration_60255.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zVZ83d6E-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-30 16:47:04","author":"Andrew Georgeson","authors":["Andrew Georgeson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":305823340,"title":"Union Leader Who Endorsed Kamala Harris Explains Why He Backs Trump Tariffs","text":"Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union, who endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, explained on Sunday why he has spoken out in favor of President Donald Trump's tariffs.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment on Sunday.Why It MattersTrump's tariffs targeting adversaries and allies of the United States alike, have faced significant criticism from Democrats, some conservatives and many economists. Critics have said the moves will worsen inflation and raises prices for consumers.The president and his supporters contend that the tariffs are necessary to bring back manufacturing and production to the U.S., which they believe will create many more American jobs. Fain, despite endorsing then-President Joe Biden and Harris when she took over the Democratic campaign in 2024, has been vocally supportive of Trump's tariffs moves.Fain's support is also notable due to his staunch criticism of Trump during the 2024 election, when he dubbed the president \"a scab.\" He famously wore a T-shirt at a Harris event reading, \"Trump is a scab, vote Harris.\"What to KnowFain sat for an interview on Sunday with CBS News' Face the Nation. During the interview, the prominent union leader who represents more than 400,000 members, was asked about his favorable views of Trump's tariffs.\"All you have to do is look at the history of the United States, especially in auto manufacturing in the last 30 years, with the inception of NAFTA [The North American Free Trade Agreement] and unfair trade laws. We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States. We've seen—in the Big Three [General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford Motor Company] alone, in the last 20-plus years, 65 plants have closed,\" Fain said.He added: \"Tariffs aren't the total solution. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here. And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working-class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"The union leader's remarks align with the views of Trump and his economic advisers. While they have said the tariffs may cause some economic disruption in the near term, they believe they will ultimately benefit the country significantly moving forward.A report by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation think tank released last week said Trump's tariffs \"will reduce U.S. GDP [gross domestic product] by 0.4 percent and hours worked by 309,000 full-time equivalent jobs, before accounting for foreign retaliation.\" Many economists have raised similar concerns, saying the tariffs will raise costs and potentially spur a recession.Fain previously praised the new tariffs last week in an official UAW statement.\"We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades. Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions,\" he said.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump to NBC News on Saturday: \"I couldn't care less if they [foreign automakers] raise prices, because people are going to start buying American cars.\"He added: \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"Stanford University economist Professors Neale Mahoney and Ryan Cumming in a January analysis: \"Economists reject tariffs as an effective tool to improve the welfare of Americans or strengthen key industries. In a survey conducted during the first Trump administration, 93 percent of economic experts disagreed that the targeted tariffs on steel and aluminum would improve Americans' welfare, and this was for a targeted policy. Recent research has only solidified economists' opposition to this policy instrument. Studies show that tariffs imposed during the first Trump administration were almost entirely borne by U.S. consumers, with disproportionately large impacts on lower-income households which spend a larger proportion of income on goods made abroad. Indeed, the tariffs did not even help the manufacturing firms they were designed to protect, with higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighing the direct benefits of the tariff policy.\"Trump adviser Peter Navarro to Fox News Sunday: \"The message is that tariffs are tax cuts, tariffs are jobs, tariffs are national security, tariffs are great for America, tariffs will make America great again.\"What Happens Next?New Trump tariffs are slated to take effect on April 2, which the president has dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"The president aims to launch a range of import taxes, including so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to match the rates charged by other countries. He has specifically discussed targeting allies, including the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries. He has announced 25 percent tariffs targeting automotive imports as well.","summary":"\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox,\" Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union, said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/shawn-fain-endorsed-kamala-harris-backs-donald-trump-tariffs-2052783","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617611/shawn-fain.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 16:38:16","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":305785292,"title":"Meet the parents putting their money where their mouths are as they flee Trump's America to Canada","text":"Many parents are seeing the 'writing on the wall' and are hurriedly leaving Donald Trump's America, and DailyMail.com can reveal their reasons why. \n\nWhen Katie Berg, her husband Ted, and their children pulled up to the US-Canada border at 3:30pm on March 3 to claim asylum, even the border agents seemed confused and informed them that Americans are rarely ever given refuge in the country. \n\nBut the Berg family was desperate and proceeded northward to London, Ontario, anyway. \n\n'It was time to leave,' Katie, who is an Army veteran and who doesn't describe herself as political, told the DailyMail.com. 'This is not a hissy fit.\n\n'If you are not white, not male, you're going to be a target,' the mom said. 'It's literally going to be Nazi Germany.' \n\nTheir biggest concerns were their kids, especially their transgender and gender-fluid children who are 13 and 12, respectively.\n\nThe Illinois family began thinking about their move in November after Trump won and Katie pulled her children from school the day after the election. \n\nThe decision wasn't easy for a number of reasons - they had just bought their 'dream home' in the blue state; they didn't - and still don't - have US passports; and they had wanted to wait until they got their tax return before picking up their lives. \n\nBut as they saw the president step into his second term and watched how the 78-year-old leader and Vice President JD Vance treated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - despite not being fully prepared to leave the country - they decided it was time to go. \n\n'Zelensky was the final straw,' Katie told the DailyMail.com. 'It was going to get really bad, really quickly.\n\n'That's basically why we left, for our kids.' \n\nTheir transgender son, Grayson, could no longer be known by he/him pronouns and he had no legal protection to remain a male as one of the president's executive orders declared the US will only recognize gender at birth. \n\nHer gender-fluid child would also face similar issues. \n\n'They're kids, but they're also people too,' Katie told the DailyMail.com. 'We're just leaving to make a better life for our children... If my children can grow up safe, that's all that matters.\n\n'My gut said I needed to leave.' \n\nSo she and her Marine veteran husband packed up five of their children, abandoned their home, one of their cars, and the very country they both served and set off for the border. \n\n'It's heartbreaking,' she said. '[Trump's] just trying to protect the rich, not American citizens.' \n\nNow, they face the asylum process and neither have any idea if their request will be granted, despite being expedited for being Americans, nor do they have a backup plan. \n\nThey've already undergone 'deep' background checks even to be allowed into the country, as well as, been fingerprinted and undergone medical exams. \n\nThey are currently waiting to go before the Immigration and Refugee Board to present their case and prove to the Canadian government that they are not safe anywhere in the US. \n\n'It's a lot,' Katie, who said they are looking into getting an immigration lawyer, told DailyMail.com. \n\nEven those seeking work visas don't have it much easier and one Kentucky family is worried Canada might not stay safe enough for them as Trump continues to suggest making his northern neighbor the 51st state. \n\nPsychotherapist Randall Cole, 55, took his 15-year-old son, Sam, who is autistic, and his partner Wyatt to Ottawa in June 2024, leaving behind their 18-year-old son Ben, who choose to stay behind in Louisville, Kentucky. \n\nDespite 'feeling pretty safe' in Louisville - which is one of the rare blue areas in the 'ruby red conservative ocean' that is the Southern state - they decided to move before the election. \n\n'We saw the writing on the wall,' Randall told the DailyMail.com, admitting that despite his hope, he didn't see Kamala Harris winning the election. \n\n'As a gay family with kids, it began feeling unsafe,' he said in a phone interview. \n\nAs a skilled worker and fluent in French, Randall was able to obtain a work visa in Ontario and took his family with him. \n\n'I'm just tired of it,' Randall, who is a dual US-British citizen, said. 'I just want to live my life in peace with my family. \n\n'Everyone has their own sense of what they can tolerate.' \n\nHe admitted the process wasn't cheap, nor was it was it easy, but 'we absolutely don't regret it.' \n\nThey decided Canada was their best option as Wyatt is American and the 'values of the country match us as individuals.' \n\nRandall and his son are dual citizens, and his two children spent most of their lives growing up in the United Kingdom. \n\nWhen they returned to the US, Sam struggled in school and they were offered little help. His son also found active shooter drills traumatizing, and Randall was tired of having to practically jailbreak his children out of school for appointments. \n\n'It's like breaking into Fort Knox to take your kid to a dental appointment,' he told the DailyMail.com. \n\nRandall, who grew up in Indiana, also believes Americans were 'really naïve' when it came to electing Trump a second time. \n\n'It was very clear on what he believes,' Randall told the DailyMail.com. \n\nThe father-of-two also doesn't like the 'toxic masculinity' he sees playing out in the States, and even went as far as saying that the 'epitome of this is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,' the White House. \n\n'Canada doesn't have that,' he said. '[And] I don't have to worry about my kid being shot.' \n\nDespite creating a safe haven in Canada, Randall and his family are beginning to worry the North American country won't stay safe for long. \n\n'I have plan B, C and D in the works,' Randall admitted. 'It's even crazy that we have to think of [this].\n\n'This isn't Trump being a joke,' the father-of-two said. \n\nThe Midwestern father said his family is considering a move back to the UK if need be, but he would be unable to practice psychotherapy there. They are also considering Ireland, but they're grasping onto hope Canada will be their home.\n\nAfter his three-year work visa expires, the family will try for permanent residency, he told the DailyMail.com, as long as Trump keeps his hands off Canada. \n\nOne thing they're not considering is moving back to the US. \n\n'Oh God, no!' Randall told the DailyMail.com when asked. 'I wouldn't move back.' \n\nHe believes the US has been 'forever changed' by the recent political events and said Americans 'kind of sleep-walked into this.' \n\nAs for Jay Dupuis - who declined to share his political affiliation - his children were his main priority when he and his British wife, Jodie, packed up their bags and moved to Northern England in July 2024.\n\n'It's not about me anymore, it's about my family,' the Louisiana native, who performs as an Elvis impersonator, told the DailyMail.com. \n\nThe turning point for him was the Nashville shooting at Covenant Christian School, where six students and three teachers were killed by Audrey Hale. His son, who did not attend the school, would have been in first grade at the time. \n\n'This is kind of crazy that this happens so much,' he remembered his wife, who lived in the States for eight years, telling him. \n\nHis own son's school near Myrtle Beach went into lockdown not long after and it 'freaked' the parents out, leaving Jay hurriedly pulling his child, now eight, out of class. \n\n'Things like this don't get better with time,' he told the DailyMail.com. 'It was going to get worse... But I don't know what the government can do.' \n\nJay didn't feel like the Joe Biden Administration was doing enough to solve the issue, and although he thinks Trump's camp is 'trying to do something,' he said he still would have left the country even if that decision was made today. \n\n'Not enough has changed,' he said. 'It's not like that here in England. You can run from a knife, but you can't run from a gun, you know?' \n\nThe father, who grew up near New Orleans, was tired of worrying about his son's safety and what the state of education would be like when his three-year-old daughter entered school. \n\n'That's why I moved, I wanted a better life for my children,' he told the DailyMail.com. \n\nHe also wanted more parental control over his children's education and questioned certain practices, such as drag queens reading to children. \n\n'It doesn't take much to change a kid's mind,' he said in a phone interview. '[It should be] up to parents how you're going to teach my son.' \n\nHowever, he said he would be fine with it if the majority of Americans approved of it and believes US citizens should get to vote on these issues. \n\nHe also felt that the US education system was 'dumbing down' America and his son was depressed in school. Now, in the UK, his son is 'thriving' and has many friends and 'loves' attending classes. \n\nJay's son also got more individualized help in England, especially when he transferred schools and needed to catch up. \n\nHis wife is happier too as she is closer to family, and seeing his brood happy 'makes me happy.' \n\nJay immigrated to the country under a spousal visa, which he said wasn't hard to get, while his children applied for British passports under their mother's citizenship. \n\nAll they did was fill out a form before the hopped on a cruise from New York to England to make it 'adventurous for our children.'\n\nOverall, Jay said he has no plans on moving his family back to the US - despite growing up there - unless the country 'drastically' changes both in education and safety. \n\nAmerican Immigration in the Trump Era \n\nSo far, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency has received a total of 10,575 asylum applications in January at the border, data shows. \n\nThe majority of claims come through Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. \n\nIt is unclear how many of those applications stem from Americans fleeing the US. \n\nCanada has 'not seen a notable change in overall asylum volumes so far this year,' the IRCC told the DailyMail.com. \n\nAsylum seekers have to prove a 'real fear of persecution or face serious harm, such as torture or cruel treatment, in their home country or where they usually live,' to be granted refuge in Canada, the IRCC said. \n\nCanada will individually judge each case based on protection needs, including based on 'race, religion, political opinion, nationality, or membership in social groups, including LGBTQI+.' \n\nIn 2024, the UK received 108,000 asylum applications, an 18 percent increase compared to the year before, according to government statistics. \n\nThe number of people claiming asylum has nearly doubled since 2021 in the UK. \n\nIt is unclear how many Americans this includes. \n\nHowever, a record number of US citizens applied for UK citizenship after Trump's win.\n\nMore than 1,700 of the 6,100 Americans who applied in 2024 requested UK citizenship in the last three months of the year.","summary":"Many parents are seeing the 'writing on the wall' and are escaping the US with their kids in hopes of giving them a better life outside of Donald Trump's America, and DailyMail.com can reveal their reasons why.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14512513/democrat-parents-ditching-trump-win-real-reason-canada.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/20/20/96409047-0-image-m-105_1742502713029.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 13:11:58","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":305792832,"title":"‘Revenge is his number one motivation’: how Trump is waging war on the media","text":"On Tuesday 4 March, Donald Trump stood in the House of Representatives to issue a speech to a joint session of Congress, the first of his second term.\n\nNear the beginning of what was to be a marathon address, the president declared: “I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It’s back.”\n\nWhat Trump did not mention was that less than three weeks earlier he had barred Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office, because the news agency refused to use his preferred nomenclature for the Gulf of Mexico. He did not mention that he was waging lawsuits against ABC and CBS, nor that the man he appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission had ordered a flurry of investigations into NBC News, NPR and PBS.\n\nThe president ignored entirely what has become an all out attack on the media and other institutions, something that media experts have described as a “broad, systematic assault” on free speech, a vendetta that threatens “the essential fundamental freedoms of a democracy”.\n\nSince that speech the situation has only got worse. The anti-media rhetoric has ramped up from Trump officials, Trump has suggested some media groups should be “illegal”, funding has been cut from organisations like Voice of America and last week the White House lambasted journalist Jeffrey Goldberg and the Atlantic magazine for breaking a scoop about national security lapses on a Signal messaging app.\n\n“Revenge is Trump’s number one motivation for anything in this second term of office, and he believes he has been treated unfairly by the media, and he is going to strike out against those in the media who he considers his enemies,” said Bill Press, a longtime liberal political commentator and host of The Bill Press Pod.\n\n“He’s going in the direction of really curtailing the freedom of the press, following the pattern of every autocrat ever on the planet: they need to shut down a free and independent press in order to get away with their unlimited use of power.”\n\nTrump was critical of the media in his first term. But as Press pointed out, that was more verbal attacks: the never-ending accusations of “fake news”, the encouragement of anti-CNN chants at rallies. Two months into Trump’s second term, he has already taken it further. Associated Press, one of the world’s premier news agencies which is relied upon by thousands of news outlets, remains banned from the Oval Office and Air Force one: the president angered by the agency’s refusal to use the term “Gulf of America” to refer to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump is suing the owner of CBS News for $10bn, alleging the channel selectively edited an interview with Kamala Harris, which the network denies, and the Des Moines Register newspaper, which he accuses of “election interference” over a poll from before the election that showed Kamala Harris leading Trump in Iowa.\n\nThe FCC investigations, led by the hardline Trump appointee and Project 2025 author Brendan Carr, are ongoing, while in February Trump ejected a HuffPost reporter from the press pool – which refers to a rotating group of reporters allowed close access to the White House – and denied reporters from the news agency Reuters access to a cabinet meeting.\n\nAt various times Trump and rightwing groups have accused each of the outlets of bias or of presenting negative coverage of his presidency. By contrast, the White House has allowed rightwing news outlets, including Real America’s Voice and Blaze Media and Newsmax, to be included in the press pool.\n\n“It’s designed to shut down criticism, and I think that the danger of that is that there is this effort to make it look like everyone approves of the government and of the Trump administration,” said Katie Fallow, deputy litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, a non-profit which seeks to preserve and advance first amendment freedom rights.\n\n“It’s a threat to the ability of the of the press to critically cover the president, but perhaps more importantly, the function of the press is to inform the public about the workings of government, and allow the public to decide whether or not it wants to vote for these people again, or whether it approves. And so it’s more than just its effect on the media, its effect on the general public.”\n\nIn recent days the Trump administration’s attack-the-media playbook has been on show in the way senior officials have sought to discredit Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic who was invited into a secret Signal group where a coming US attack on Yemen’s Houthi militia was being discussed.\n\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Trump himself have criticized Goldberg: Waltz described him as “the bottom scum of journalists”, while Trump called the reporting “a witch-hunt” and described the Atlantic as a “failed magazine”.\n\nTrump has also appeared to flirt with using law enforcement to target the media, including a speech to federal law enforcement officials in March. “As the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,” Trump said.\n\nHe disparaged certain lawyers and non-profits, before later adding: “The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and MSDNC, and the fake news, CNN and ABC, CBS and NBC, they’ll write whatever they say.”\n\nTrump continued: “It’s totally illegal what they do,” adding: “I just hope you can all watch for it, but it’s totally illegal.”\n\nThe war on free speech has not just been limited to the media. Trump’s efforts have increasingly also focussed on areas including education, law and charitable organizations, as the government seeks to bring key aspects of society into line.\n\n“You have to look at this as part of a broad, systematic assault that the president and his administration have been waging since he returned to office on every other power center that impacts politics in any way,” said Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, a watchdog group.\n\n“All the sort of liberal, civil society institutions: big law firms, universities, the government itself, the courts and the press have come under fire, and as part of that, we have this really unprecedented multifront attack on media institutions.”\n\nTrump has been aided in this endeavor by the owners of some media organizations. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon co-founder and owner of the Washington Post, pulled an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris during the campaign and recently overhauled the newspaper’s opinion pages.\n\nAmazon donated a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration, and Bezos’ space company Blue Origin competes for federal government contracts. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, also blocked the newspaper from endorsing Harris, while Mark Zuckerberg dismantled Facebook’s factchecking network after Trump won the presidency. (Like Bezos, Zuckerberg donated to, and attended, Trump’s inauguration.)\n\n“What makes the situation so worrying is that for the last several years, Donald Trump himself and the leading lights of the rightwing media and political movement: from Tucker Carlson to Kevin Roberts at the Heritage Foundation, have cited as their exemplar Viktor Orbán of Hungary. That’s what they want to accomplish,” Gertz said.\n\n“And what Orbán did with the press was squeeze different media corporation owners until they agreed to either make their press more palatable to him, or sell their outlets to someone who would. I think that is basically, by their own admission, what the Trump administration is trying to bring about in this country.\n\n“I think the hope is that we have more guardrails than Hungary did to prevent that from happening. But it’s unnerving that the president of the United States is trying to follow in those footsteps.”","summary":"The president – who believes he has been treated unfairly by the press – is squeezing the media in different ways than his first term\n\nOn Tuesday 4 March, Donald Trump stood in the House of Representatives to issue a speech to a joint session of Congress, the first of his second term.\n\nNear the beginning of what was to be a marathon address, the president declared: “I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.

(Photo by Katie McTiernan/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nAnadolu via Getty Images\n\nEminem has dozens of massive hits under his belt and one of the most impressive chart legacies of any rapper in history. This week, he adds another win to his ever-growing résumé — but not with a new release. Instead, it’s an older track that’s making music again. “Shake That,” the collaboration with the late Nate Dogg, is back on the Billboard charts, and it’s bigger than ever on several rankings.\n\n“Shake That” Returns as a Bestseller\n\n“Shake That” reappears on a pair of Billboard tallies this week. It doesn’t manage to break onto all-genre tallies like the Hot 100, but it’s once again a bestseller, appearing on two genre-specific lists.\n\nThe Eminem cut returns to the Rap Digital Song Sales chart at No. 9. That’s the highest it’s ever ranked on that list. “Shake That” also finds space on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales tally, where it enters at No. 12. Though slightly lower, that’s another all-time best showing for the single.\n\nA New Peak for Eminem’s Old Hit\n\nOver the course of its lifetime, “Shake That” hasn’t been a consistent performer on these two rosters. In fact, as of this frame, it has only spent two weeks on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales ranking, and just one other turn on the Rap Digital Song Sales list.\n\n“Shake That” Was a Smash When it First Arrived\n\n“Shake That” was originally featured on Curtain Call: The Hits, a compilation that Eminem dropped in 2005. That set was largely a collection of previously-released smashes, but it did include a few brand new tracks. “Shake That” was one of just three original cuts created for the project.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNSA Warning—Change Your iPhone, Android Message Settings\n\n‘Nobody Is Safe’—Shock Fed Trump Warning Could Suddenly Trigger Bitcoin Price Chaos\n\nMicrosoft Warns 1 Billion Windows Users—Do Not Use Password\n\nWhen it was released, the track quickly became another win for the rapper. It peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100, extending his streak of high-charting singles at the time and giving Nate Dogg one of his biggest mainstream successes.\n\nEminem’s Only Hit Right Now\n\n“Shake That” stands as Eminem’s only current hit on the U.S. charts. His track “Without Me” is still performing well globally, though it’s on the decline across Billboard’s international rankings. This time around, “Without Me” drops to No. 146 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. and No. 170 on the Billboard Global 200.\n\nCurtain Call: The Hits Is Rising as Well\n\nWith “Shake That” becoming a bestseller once more, it’s not shocking that Curtain Call: The Hits is enjoying a boost in performance as well. The compilation appears on four Billboard charts this week, and it’s climbing on three of them.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Eminem’s “Shake That” re-enters Billboard’s genre charts, hitting new peaks on both the Rap and R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales rankings nearly 20 years after release.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/03/30/eminems-decade-plus-old-smash-hits-new-peaks-on-multiple-charts/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e6ba02ba7811436d2c2834/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=663,441,x226,y115,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 12:45:00","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Katie McTiernan,Senior Contributor","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Katie McTiernan","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.128},{"id":305776002,"title":"The creepy truth behind JoJo's biggest hits: Singer shot to stardom age 13 with 'inappropriate' songs written by men - before she disappeared from the limelight","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Mar 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle 'disrupted' Sentebale polo game by turning up at short notice with 'very famous friend' - before Prince Harry 'demanded' charity's chair issue public statement defending her\n\nHorrific bachelorette party drama means glamorous bride-to-be will no longer be able to smile on her big day\n\nFormer SAS hero says Britain 'can't trust' the United States with top secret intelligence after 'moronic' war plan leak\n\nREVEALED: The 'evil' YouTube sleuth cashing in on tragedy by spreading sick rumours about one of America's most brutal murders\n\nDEAR JANE: I've discovered my partner's Pornhub search history.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:13:39 BST, 30 March 2025 |Updated:13:40 BST, 30 March 2025 \n\nNoughties sensation JoJo shot to stratospheric levels of fame aged just 13 after becoming the youngest ever artist to secure a No.1 hit in the U.S.\nHer debut single Leave (Get Out) became an instant hit and she appeared perfectly set up for a long career in the music industry, but 'inappropriate lyrics' for a teenager by male writers have left her rise to stardom feeling a little creepy.\nHowever, despite her record label initially feeling like a 'family', things quickly turned and she became locked in a years-long legal battle over control of her own music.\nLooking back now, JoJo's shiny fresh-faced image was just the surface of something slightly more sinister simmering underneath.\nWhile her catchy pop tracks have proved a long-lasting hit with fans, some of the inappropriate lyrics about satisfying a woman and barhopping seem deeply unsuitable for a teenage girl to sing.\nJoJo does have writing credits on some of these tracks - including How To Touch A Girl - but they were largely penned by a male writing team.\nIt should be noted that it is common for songwriters to pen songs and then tout them around various artists before they are picked up - so they may not have known who they were writing for.\nShortly after JoJo's initial run of success, she realised she was trapped in a contract that didn't work for her career and she tried to get out.\nHere, MailOnline takes a look behind the scenes of JoJo's path to stardom and her personal struggles as she disappeared from public view... \n\nNoughties sensation JoJo shot to stratospheric levels of fame aged just 13 after becoming the youngest ever artist to secure a No.1 hit in the U.S (2004)\n\nHer debut single Leave (Get Out) became an instant hit and she appeared perfectly set up for a long career in the music industry (pictured in 2024)\nINAPPROPRIATE LYRICS\nJoJo's debut single Get Out (Leave) has gone down in history as a noughties classic, however there is a more sinister tone to the catchy track.\nLooking back, it doesn't seem like a romantic relationship is an appropriate topic for a 13-year-old to be covering and hinted at content way beyond her young years.\nThe track, which was penned by four different men, Soulshock, Kenneth, Alex Cantrell, Phillip 'Silky' White, paved the way for more suggestive lyrics.\nThe opening verse to the song reads: I've been waiting all day here for you bae // So won't you come and sit and talk to me? And tell me how we're gonna be together, always // Hope you know that when it's late at night //\n'I hold on to my pillow tight // And think of how you promised me forever.'\nArguably one of the most risque topics covered by JoJo was in her track How to Touch A Girl, which she has writing credits for alongside Billy Steinberg and Josh Alexander.\n\nJojo's debut single Get Out (Leave) has gone down in history as a noughties classic, however there is a more sinister tone to the catchy track\nThe track was released in 2006 when JoJo was just 16 years of age and written when she was even younger, the song included lyrics which alluded to satisfying a woman.\nFeel somethin' happening // Could this be a spark? To satisfy me, baby // Gotta satisfy my heart.\n'Do you know how to touch a girl? // If you want me so much //First I have to know/'.\nThe same could be said for another of JoJo's songs - Not That Kinda Girl (2004), co-written by Neely Dinkins, B. Cola Pietro, Muhammad, Jordan.\nDespite being written and released when she was just 14 years old - 7 years under the legal age limit for drinking alcohol in America - JoJo sang about barhopping.\nThe lyrics read: 'I'm not your everyday, 'round the way // Don't go bar-hoppin', chillin' on the block // On a cell phone frontin' Never that, 'cause I'm not that kinda girl.'\nSHOT TO STARDOM AGE\nShe was catapulted to stardom after signing a deal with record labels Blackground Records and Da Family Entertainment at age 12 in 2003.\nJoJo - whose real name is Joanna Noëlle Levesque - was scouted by the label after performing on the television show America's Most Talented Kids.\nThe singer's debut single Leave (Get Out) reached No.1 in U.S. Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart, making her the youngest solo artist to ever top the charts age 13. \nThe youngster was driven and ambitious from the get-go and has since spoken about how all she wanted to do was succeed in her career.\nSpeaking on Q with Tom Power, she said: 'Some kids had really ambitious stage parents who wanted to milk them dry and didn't really care about their well-being.\n'That wasn't my experience…. All I wanted to do from a young age was work.'\nDuring her childhood, JoJo's parents - who are divorced - struggled with mental illness, addiction and financial issues.\nAt age 11, JoJo asked her mother if they could move to Los Angeles because she believed it would be the best way to seek a better life for them.\n\nShe was catapulted to stardom after signing a deal with record labels Blackground Records and Da Family Entertainment at age 12 in 2003 (pictured 2004)\n\nJoJo - whose real name is Joanna Noëlle Levesque - was scouted by the label after performing on the television show America's Most Talented Kids (pictured in 2004)\nShe said: 'Maybe that was where the impulse to just work as much as possible came from. I did not want to be with my emotions. I did not want to be with my discomfort. \n'So that seed was planted really young. I learned how to numb myself through work or distraction or boys or writing songs in my journal all day.'\nJoJo signed a major recording contract with the late R&B singer Aaliyah's uncle, Barry Hankerson. Aaliyah tragically died age 22 in an aeroplane crash.\nIn her memoir, Over the Influence, JoJo wrote that the day she met Hankerson, he told her he saw Aaliyah over her shoulder. \nShe said: 'It seemed that he meant that Aaliyah's spirit was in the room with us and that she was guiding him toward the direction of signing me.\nRecalling how they quickly worked on her debut album, she said: 'Barry had worked on Aaliyah's album when she was 13.\n'Then they put out her first album with R. Kelly when she was 14. And so he had experience with defying the odds and working with artists who were very young.'\nFELT LIKE FAMILY\nAt the time, JoJo said that the label treat her well as she lived the dream, flying in private jets and living in luxury apartments with her mother.\nDespite being based in Los Angeles, the label soon moved JoJo and her mum Diana to New Jersey - she now realises because child labour laws were more lax.\nHowever, unbeknown to the genuine motive behind the move, JoJo recalled how it felt like the enjoying 'the wildest thing ever'.\nThe American native told Uproxx in a 2020 documentary: 'Suddenly I was on a private plane... I was a little girl from nowhere.'\nSuggesting they were initially treated well by the label, she said: 'My label got my mum [Diana] a car. Got us an apartment. I had my own room for the first time. \n\nAt the time, JoJo said that the label treat her well as she lived the dream, flying in private jets and living in luxury apartments with her mother (pictured with her mother Diana)\n'They felt like family to us, and I think that's what both my mum and I were really longing for. Deep down, both of us come from very unstable family situations and they really appealed to that within us,' she told Uproxx in a 2020 documentary.'\nBefore moving to LA, JoJo and her mother Diana had lived in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where they lived off her mum's modest cleaning wage.\nHowever, now she was flying high and juggling school by day and the studio at night, something she had dreamed of since she was six years old.\nBut it wasn't all plain sailing for the singer, who has since revealed that the fame game also came with mounting insecurities and pressures.\nShe said: 'I had to learn how to conduct myself, how to make people like me. This was perfect because I had been trying to figure that one out since first grade.\n'The media trainer was tasked with teaching me how to sound charming in sound bites and anticipate how I might deal with certain questions so that I wouldn't accidentally offend anyone.'\nCOURT CASE \nJoJo was riding high on her first ever tour, where she opened for rapper Usher.\nHer first track had been a phenomenal success and her second single, Too Little, Too Late also proved to be hugely commercially popular.\nShe previously detailed how those early days 'felt like the beginning of the rest of her life,' but she quickly learned she'd been trapped by her label.\nThe label had control over JoJo's voice for the next seven years and refused to release new music while also trying to stop her attempts at any other work.\nRevealing she wrote 'hundreds' of songs that never came out, she said: 'It felt like I was banging my head against a wall because I was like, is anyone ever going to hear this?'\n\nHer first track had been a phenomenal success and her second single, Too Little, Too Late also proved to be hugely commercially popular (pictured in 2009)\nIn 2013, JoJo filed a lawsuit against her label company, alleging because she'd been a minor when she'd signed, she couldn't be bound to the contract for seven years.\nBut Blackground asked for the case to be dismissed and were planning to 'bleed her dry' until she gave up.\nBlackground stopped functioning and was being sued from several different angles and JoJo became intent on setting herself free from their choke-hold.\nJoJo revealed that her mother was worried that her plan to break free of their control would 'kill her' as she looked for other work in films.\nThe star would also release mixtapes which offered her a loophole to be able to tour.\nJoJo previously revealed she was invited to Taylor Swift's house by her friend Selena Gomez for Galentines Day, where they dined on In-N-Out and did arts and crafts.\nThe star said while superstar Taylor was 'so sweet and complimentary' she could see everyone 'felt bad for me.'\nShe wrote: 'Taylor mentioned deepcut songs of mine she loved and kept saying how f***ed up the lawsuit was, the fact that I couldn't put out music. \n'I don't remember if she already knew what was going on from social media or if I'd told her about the situation, but she was — in no uncertain terms — letting me know she was on my side and believed in me.\n\nThe label had control over JoJo's voice for the next seven years and refused to release new music while also trying to stop her attempts at any other work (pictured 2009)\n'I appreciated Taylor's kind words, but I thought I could see in the eyes of everyone else at the party that they felt bad for me. Maybe they thought I was never going to get out of this limbo. Or that it was too late for me even if I did. \n'Maybe they could tell I didn't have the money or the parents who could help dig me out of any holes I might find myself in. Maybe they saw the imposter in my eyes. Then again, perhaps that was all my own projection.'\nDuring the bitter legal battle, the Too Little Too Late singer claimed she was being held hostage by the label because she was not allowed to leave or release new music commercially.\nThe feud led to her fans taking up a #FreeJoJo campaign on social media at the time.\nIn 2014, after a multi-year battle against the label, she was finally released from her contract and she signed with Atlantic Records.\nAlmost immediately, she released a slew of singles and embarked on a tour, which was followed by the release of her third studio album Mad Love in October 2016.\nHer fourth album, Good to Know, came out in 2020. It was followed by her fifth, Trying Not to Think About It, in 2021.\nDISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC VIEW\nOn the outside, it looked to the public like JoJo was as happy as could be. \nBut she has now revealed that behind her picture perfect smile she was secretly plagued by immense insecurities and struggled to withstand the growing pressure that was put on her.\nIn her extremely honest new memoir, Over the Influence, which hits stands next Tuesday, JoJo, now 33, spoke in detail about the demons that she battled in secret.\nLike many child stars, JoJo eventually descended on a downward spiral that saw her turn to alcohol and drugs to combat the years she spent feeling like she didn't belong.\nThings only got worse when her booming career came to a screeching halt amid ongoing legal problems with her label.\nShe fought tirelessly to release her third album, but the label kept delaying it, leaving her feeling once again like she wasn't good enough.\nThe star tried everything to impress the record's executives, even turning to pills to try to lose weight in the hopes that they would get behind her music again if she looked the part.\n\nLike many child stars, JoJo eventually descended on a downward spiral that saw her turn to alcohol and drugs to combat the years she spent feeling like she didn't belong (pictured 2018)\nIn 2008, JoJo moved to Boston and took a step back from the industry as she decided what she wanted to do next.\nShe contemplated leaving singing behind for good to instead go to college, but she ultimately decided to continue on with her music career.\nShe began to get to work on her third album, but unfortunately, soon found that she had lost momentum during her break.\nAnd when the singer began to prepare for her comeback, she started to face immense pressure from her label to lose weight.\nAs a self-proclaimed 'binge-eater,' JoJo said she struggled to fit into the persona that they envisioned for her - and eventually started taking Adderall to try to curb her appetite.\n'It wasn't uncommon for those in power [at the label] to be constantly critiquing their female artists' looks and bodies and sex appeal,' she stated.\n'I wanted to do whatever I could to get back on top, and if that meant trimming down, fine. I'd heard Adderall could help me lose weight, so I added that into the mix using a friend's prescription.\n'I hadn't deferred from college to settle. From now on I would do whatever they needed me to do if it meant I could get my train back on track.'\nShe recalled 'staying in a constant state of sucking her stomach in.'\n'This was fine for looking slim from a side angle but not so good for proper breathing technique for a singer,' she wrote.\nWhile JoJo said she didn't drink much for years after the night she blacked out and peed on the carpet, she also started partying regularly after she turned 18.\n'I felt like I'd waited my whole life to be initiated into this adults-only club of liquid chill,' she wrote.\n'Alcohol made me not give a f**k. Without it, I gave so many f**ks that it physically hurt. There was just no better free-er state than totally out of my mind.'\nShe also said she became addicted to 'being desired' by men, and dated a slew of sleazy, much older partners in quick succession who one by one broke her heart by cheating on her or treating her badly.\nShe said sex became her 'favourite outlet of escapism' and would 'dissolve all her worries and fear.'\n'I felt pretty self-conscious day to day and longed for male validation,' she professed. 'Being desired was like a drug to me.'\nTo make matters worse, JoJo's third album kept getting delayed by the record label.\nHer partying became more and more frequent as she sat in limbo waiting to find out when her music would come out.\n'When my career stalled and it felt like everything I'd been working toward from childhood was going up in smoke, I turned elsewhere - to alcohol drugs, sex, love, food, self-loathing. It was never enough,' she recalled.\n'The drinking helped dull down my emotions, and whether it was alcohol or weed, I stayed in an intoxicated state as much as possible, even during the day - which made me care less about everything.\n'But I continued the cycle, drinking to escape reality and then making decisions that were ultimately embarrassing (at best) or had horrible consequences (at worst).\n'Alcohol was quickly proving itself to be the perfect fuel whenever I needed to fill up my bottomless pit of insecurities and satiate my craving for validation.'\nShe recalled one time that she attended an industry party in December 2009 and got 'unintentionally wasted in front of everyone.'\nVOICING HER TRUTH\nAt 33, 20 years after first finding game, JoJo opened about her time as a child star, detailing the betrayals and label issues that derailed her career.\nIn her extremely honest memoir, she poke in detail about the demons that she battled in secret away from the intense spotlight of fame. \nJoJo confessed that she struggled immensely with feeling like she didn't belong, especially due to her young age.\n'People were starting to pay attention and compliment me on my talent and original music, and yet whenever I went to shoots or industry events, I honestly felt just as ostracized as when I was in elementary school,' she said in her book.\n'It seemed like no one wanted to sit with me. Everyone for the most part was polite and kind, but what 17-to-21-year-old wants to hang out with a 13-year-old?\n'It doesn't really matter how mature that 13-year-old is - or thinks herself to be. She's still 13.'\nShe said 'self-doubt' soon crept in - and after she did her first photoshoot, she started partaking in self harm.\n\nAt 33, 20 years after first finding game, JoJo opened about her time as a child star, detailing the betrayals and label issues that derailed her career\nShe recalled looking at the images and feeling like an 'alien.'\nJoJo remembered thinking, 'Was my forehead really that big? My nose that crooked and wide? My lips that small?'\n'I had never really seen myself like this before. It was like a twisted exaggeration of what the mirror reflected,' the star said.\n'And if people were seeing what I saw, why were they lying and saying I looked great?... These photographs seemed to confirm my fears that I would never look the part.\n'The spiral was quick and rapturous. I went back to our hotel room and climbed into the bathroom sink, my bare feet flat against the empty basin, and started digging into my skin with mom's tweezers in the mirror.\n'Anxiety expanding with every breath, I couldn't stop picking and squeezing the bumps on my skin until I bled, working all the undesirableness out of my pores.'\nShe embarked on her first tour and dropped her debut album, JoJo, in 2004, but as her career took off, she also had a hard time adjusting to her new, fast-paced lifestyle - while also yearning for more.\n'I felt the treadmill underneath my feet picking up and moving faster. Every day, there was a new schedule of interviews and obligations,' she recalled.\n\nIn her extremely honest memoir, she poke in detail about the demons that she battled in secret away from the intense spotlight of fame (pictured 2024)\nDesigners who wanted me to wear their clothing or attend their fashion show next season. I was living all the stuff I saw on TV. I lapped up all the drama and excitement like a kitten with milk.\n'There were always so many people around me now: an ex–White House personnel bodyguard when I was in NYC, more folks from the labels, people trying to get me to take pictures with their products, my publicist nearby to tell them no, new producers who wanted to meet me, random folks who wanted to get a closer glimpse of the whole thing.\n'It was all so much and yet I couldn't get enough. How could we expand this further, get more, go higher?'\nShe said she became obsessed with trying to fill a 'predisposed emptiness' inside of her with 'external validation.'\n'There was just nothing more thrilling than impressing the adults around me, nailing an audition for a show or talent competition, or hearing the roar of applause from a big audience,' she said.\n'No matter how \"successful\" I got, no matter how many songs hit the charts or movies performed well at the box office, my ghosts just got hungrier and hungrier.'\n\nBecoming a big star at such a young age meant JoJo had access to alcohol extremely early on.\nShe admitting in the book that she experimented with alcohol for the first time at age 14 while on her debut tour.\nThe singer said her dancers and crew would often party on the tour bus after shows, but she would 'never get invited' because she was 'too young.'\nFinally, she 'snuck onto the bus' one night and 'asked the chillest dancer to make her a drink.'\n'Up until then, I'd only ever had sips of drinks here and there, but alcohol always tasted disgusting to me,' she revealed.\n'Seeing how relaxed and cool everyone looked on the bus, dancing and socializing without a care in the world, I wanted to get on their level.\n\n Former child star JoJo recounts how she became a sex addict hooked on drugs and booze \n'So the dancer poured me a red cup filled with Captain Morgan and CocaCola, and I was off.\n'One minute, I was excitedly cheers-ing everyone... and the next thing I knew I was falling face-first out of the bus onto the carpet of the hotel's entrance. My first blackout.'\nShe said her mom 'picked her up off the ground and carried her lifeless body into her hotel room.'\n'I woke up in the middle of the night thinking the toilet was in the center of the room. It was very much not,' she added.\n'I peed on the carpet, and mom and her [boyfriend] woke up to the sound of me relieving myself.'\nShe also lost her virginity that year to her then-boyfriend, soccer player Freddy Adu.\nAfterwards, she longed to be treated like an adult, despite still only being 14 years old, and her relationship with her mom soon became 'strained.'\n'I hated the idea of anyone treating me any differently than the real adults. It didn't help that the power dynamics had already started shifting,' she continued.\n'I was now providing for both mom and myself. Plus, I wasn't a virgin anymore. It irritated the s**t out of me that mom didn't realize that she was in the presence of a woman now.\n'The closer I got to my 15th year, the further I pulled away from mom. I felt like she was always disapproving of something or mad at someone (often me), hating everything about the music industry and threatening to pull me out of it and make me go back to public school...\n'I think, in many ways, she wanted it to stop, but felt we were in way too deep.'\nShe said her mom would often become volatile with her when she drank, which was becoming more often as JoJo's career grew.\nShe recalled how her mom would launch blistering attacks against her, which left her feeling like she wasn't good enough.\nJoJo said her mom would tell her things like, 'You're acting like a disgusting, ungrateful, spoiled brat,' and, 'This industry has sucked all the goodness out of you.'\n'Vitriolic verbal jabs like these were increasingly common, and they hissed out of her mouth even more easily when she was under the influence,' wrote the star.\n'I knew she loved me. I never doubted that. But she also deeply resented - and possibly even hated - me now. I hated her, too.'\nShe said she once got into a physical fight with her mom in the lobby of a hotel, which resulted in them fiercely 'shoving one another.'\nAnd one time when she asked her mom to leave the studio whilst she was recording her second LP, her mom threatened to end her life.\nJoJo said she received a series of harrowing texts from her mother that said she would be better off without her, worried, she rushed to her hotel room.\n'The door to her room was locked and dead-bolted. I was banging and yelling through the wood that divided us,' JoJo said.\n'After what felt like a long time, she finally opened up and stood in front of me: naked, tiny, and soaked from tears. The bathwater was running and she had the hair dryer turned on.'\nJoJo said she held her mom and 'begged her to stay alive' for a long time, and she ultimately calmed down.\nAll the while, JoJo's career continued to soar. She starred in her first movie, Aquamarine, in 2006 alongside Emma Roberts and Sara Paxton, which was followed by the film RV starring Robin Williams later that year.\nHer second album, The High Road, dropped in October 2006, and it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe creepy truth behind JoJo's biggest hits: Singer shot to stardom age 13 with 'inappropriate' songs written by men - before she disappeared from the limelight\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Sorry its taken me a while to post this but I've taken some time out to be with those closest to me.\n'I want to deeply apologise to my wife and family for putting them in this situation.\n'I love then so much and we'll continue to deal with this privately.\n'I love you guys, thank you for you patience, understanding, and support. See you all soon, Danny.'\nDespite his grovelling apology, a source told MailOnline that Georgia took some time away from her husband as she stayed over at her and Danny's best friends' house.\nGeorgia is said to have stayed with her friend for some 'girly time' to distract herself from everything that has been going on.\nHowever the source insisted Georgia only left the family home temporarily and the couple are 'working on things behind closed doors'.\nSeann Walsh\n\nWhile he was taking part on the 2018 series of Strictly Come Dancing, Seann kissed his professional dance partner Katya Jones outside a pub\nWhile he was taking part on the 2018 series of Strictly Come Dancing, Seann, 39, kissed his professional dance partner Katya Jones, 35, outside a pub.\nA photo of the pair kissing caused a media firestorm as the infamous Strictly curse reared it's ugly head once more.\nSeann was in a relationship with then girlfriend Rebecca Humphries at the time, while Katya was married to fellow Strictly professional Neil Jones.\nDespite the controversy, Seann and Katya carried on with the show and were ultimately eliminated in the fifth week.\nFollowing the incident, Seann's actress girlfriend Rebecca released an impassioned statement in which she revealed he called her 'psycho' and 'nuts' for questioning his friendship with Katya, who he kissed on Rebecca's birthday. They soon broke up.\nWhile Katya was supported by her husband Neil after the 'drunken mistake', their marriage did not last as they announced their split in August 2019.\nThe dancers confirmed they were splitting in joint Instagram statements, but despite writing they had mutual 'respect' and 'love', a source claimed Katya's infidelity was something her husband couldn't get over.\nThe pair have remained friends since the split and continue to be professional dancers together on Strictly.\nDominic West\n\nIn October 2020, co-stars Lily, 35, and married Dominic, 55, were caught enjoying what appeared to be a racy weekend in Rome - which made headlines around the world\n\nFollowing the snaps emerging, Dominic put on a public display of unity with his wife Catherine FitzGerald (pictured in 2020)\nIn October 2020, co-stars Lily, 35, and married Dominic, 55, were caught enjoying what appeared to be a racy weekend in Rome - which made headlines around the world. \nThe pair didn't seem to mind who saw them as they cuddled up to one another and shared a ride on a scooter while taking in the sights throughout the day. \nAt the time he was still married to Catherine - and no split had been publicly announced - but he was not wearing his wedding ring. \nFollowing the snaps emerging, Dominic put on a public display of unity with his wife Catherine FitzGerald, with the couple releasing a statement about their marriage saying they were 'very much still together'.\nCatherine also said at the time to have banned Dominic from speaking with the actress, 35, as part of a peace deal struck between the couple.\nZara McDermott\n\nZara cheated on Sam Thompson five years ago with music executive Brahim Fouradi while appearing on the X Factor\n\nSam initially ended his relationship with Zara in the wake of her affair in September 2019.

The ex-TV presenter describes this as 'unwise but not illegal'.\nSchofield further confessed that he lied to his employer ITV, to his colleagues, his friends and his agents at the management firm YMU.\nHe also lied to The Mail on Sunday, the Daily Mail's sister paper, which first exclusively described his relationship with the younger man earlier this month.\nIn his grovelling apology, Schofield said: 'I am making this statement via the Daily Mail, to whom I have already apologised personally for misleading, through my lawyer who I also misled, about a story [sic] which they wanted to write about me a few days ago.\n'The first thing I want to say is: I am deeply sorry for having lied to them, and to many others about a relationship that I had with someone working on This Morning. I did have a consensual on-off relationship with a younger male colleague at This Morning.\n'Contrary to speculation, whilst I met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television, it was only after he started to work on the show that it became more than a just a friendship. That relationship was unwise, but not illegal. It is now over...\n\n'I am painfully conscious that I have lied to my employers at ITV, to my colleagues and friends, to my agents, to the media and therefore the public and most importantly of all to my family. I am so very, very sorry, as I am for having been unfaithful to my wife...\n'I am resigning from ITV with immediate effect, expressing my immense gratitude to them for all the amazing opportunities that they have given me.\n'I will reflect on my very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it.'\nPhillip admitted his wife was 'very, very angry' when he confessed to her about his affair.\nStephanie Lowe, the mother of the presenter's two grown-up daughters, had no idea he was in a relationship because Schofield previously denied rumours about the affair to her when she had asked, calling them 'b*****ks'.\nA source told the Mail: 'Steph is absolutely devastated, she had no idea of any of this. She is a trusting woman who has supported Phil for many, many years so this has been a real shock to her.\n'Phil always positioned the man as a friend so that has prompted a fair bit of anger, to put it mildly.\n'It is literally the most heartbreaking thing that could have happened to Steph, it isn't just the relationship but the deceit.'\nDave Grohl \n\nThe Foo Fighters rocker, 56, shocked fans in September when he confessed to cheating on Jordyn Blum, 48, and welcoming a baby girl with another woman (pictured in 2024)\n\nIn his cheating confession on September 10, Grohl directly addressed his family while revealing he is now father to a baby girl, who was conceived outside of his marriage to Blum \nThe Foo Fighters rocker, 56, shocked fans in September last year when he confessed to cheating on Jordyn Blum, 48, and welcoming a baby girl with an as-yet unnamed woman - revealing he was fighting to regain the trust of Jordyn and their three daughters. \nWeeks later, Dave hired a divorce lawyer but quickly called it off in the hopes of 'working things out' with Jordyn, who he's been married to for 21 years.\nIn his cheating confession, which he published to social media on September 10, Dave directly addressed his family while revealing to fans that he is now father to a baby girl, who was conceived outside of his marriage to Jordyn. \n'I've recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage. I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her,' he announced to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram.\n'I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.'\nHe concluded: 'We're grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved, as we move forward together.'\nGrohl did not share any information about his fourth child's mother in the post.\nFollowing his announcement that he had fathered a secret love child, his two older daughters - Violet and Harper - both took down their social media accounts.\nDays later his alleged relationship with porn publisher Annaliese Nielsen, 40, was brought to light, with her former friends telling DailyMail.com that she had a 15-year affair with the front man.\nBlum reportedly 'turned a blind eye' to Grohl's behavior throughout their 21-year marriage.\n'Close friends believe she has turned a blind eye to Dave's indiscretions for a long time,' the insider told DailyMail.com at the time.\n'Now he has humiliated her in front of the world with his baby bombshell, she can no longer hide behind the facade of a perfect marriage.'\nKristen Stewart \n\nIn 2012, she shocked the world when pictures emerged of her kissing married director Rupert Sanders while dating Hollywood hunk Robert Pattinson (pictured in 2011)\nIn 2012, she shocked the world when pictures emerged of her kissing married director Rupert Sanders while dating Hollywood hunk Robert Pattinson.\nRupert was married at the time to model-actress Liberty Ross, with the couple divorcing in 2014.\nDuring an interview with Howard Stern in 2019, Kristen shared:'I did not f**k him.

It got to the point where I felt I could hardly breathe.\n'Les proved to be my saviour. Ironically. So the person I’d hurt the most in the world was the one who was there for me.'\nIn 2013, Amanda opened up about her affair with Neil, telling Good Housekeeping: 'I don't believe women have affairs for no reason.\n'Neil rightly or wrongly got loads of stick. I feel like it was my fault - I was the one who was married.\n'I want to change the general perception of him, as he was very caring and very loving and very worried about me because I lost so much weight.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR\n Published:13:35 BST, 30 March 2025 |Updated:13:36 BST, 30 March 2025 \n\nA father-of-three has revealed how he locked himself inside a developer's show home after his family spent years living with severe mould and damp at their newbuild.\nGary Prince, 33, and his wife bought their dream home for £178k in 2016, but they have spent years battling developer Persimmon Homes over the 'inhabitable' conditions they have been forced to live in alongside their three young girls.\nThe hotel manager said the stress of living at the grim newbuild in Yeovil, Somerset, has left all of his family with 'medical and mental health challenges' and nearly caused him and his wife to divorce.\nHe claims that on top of the mould, the house was plagued with inadequate fire safety measures and dangerous electrical systems. They have been unable to sell the two-bed house since having children and are therefore all cramped into a tiny home.\nAt breaking point, Mr Prince last month packed his bags and moved into the Persimmon Homes show home, locking the door behind him until someone agreed to take action after spending seven years trying to get help.\nDuring his protest on February 28, Mr Prince highlighted his plight by sharing photos of the glossy showroom, decorated with high-end furniture and Louis Vuitton coffee table books, in comparison to the mould and fire safety issues in his house. \nMr Prince found himself locked in a dramatic standoff with the developer, who sent their managing director to talk him out of leaving the show home before agreeing to inspect the house himself.\nMr Prince, who is temporarily living in a single room with his wife and three children at the hotel where he works, told MailOnline: 'It's been a gradual build up over the years, but on February 28, I was broken. I couldn't put up with it anymore. \n\nGary Prince, 33, and his wife bought their dream home for £178k in 2016, but they have spent years battling developer Persimmon Homes. They are pictured with their three young girls\n\nMailOnline has been shown several pictures of black mould inside the newbuild in Yeovil \n\nThe conditions became so bad that Mr Prince locked himself in a Permisson Homes show home (pictured inside)\n\nPictured is the Permisson Homes newbuild (left) that Mr Prince and his wife bought in 2016\n'I was just done with everything. I wasn't sleeping at night. I was really struggling mentally. I just couldn't cope with everything.\n'I didn't even tell my wife I was going to the show home until the morning. She still didn't believe me until I rang her when I was in the in the show home.'\nMr Prince says he warned Permisson Homes that he would stage this protest so when he didn't hear back, he moved himself in.\nIt was here that on-site staff sympathised with his plight and offered him cups of tea and refreshments.\nAround two-and-a-half hours later, the managing director showed up and Persimmon have finally launched an investigation into the house after years of Mr Price's complaints. \nThey say they are 'sympathetic' to the situation and 'remain committed' to assisting the family, but that Mr Prince has not agreed to a follow-up meeting, despite 'multiple requests'.\nMr Prince said it was a 'massive relief' when the managing director inspected the house and saw the grim conditions, adding: 'I'd been telling them this for years.'\nHe added: 'The last year has been horrendous. 2024 was probably the hardest year I've ever encountered in my life. Relationship wise, health wise, my mental state.\n'I just wouldn't want to go home. I'd even sit in my car for hours on end when I got home at night because I didn't want to go in the house. All that made me feel was even more guilty for making my family live in that house.'\nThe family first moved into the house in 2016, but by the end of 2017 and early 2018, they were already experiencing several issues with mould. \n\nThe furious homeowner shared photos of how the water pipe has multiple bends and is stuck to beams with duct tape\n\nMr Prince claims that he and his family's health has deteriorated and believes the mould will have played a part\n\nMr Prince did not want to come home after work because there was damp and mould everywhere\n\nHe says that every time he tried to get help, nothing was done to sort the growing issues\nA contractor came to treat the mould but did not look at the 'root cause', Mr Price claims, as the extraction fan stopped working and water was dripping out of it.\nMr Price claims that another contractor was reported as saying the home 'should not have been signed off' as the construction fan system had not been installed correctly.\nThe furious homeowner shared photos of how the water pipe has multiple bends and is stuck to beams with duct tape. He told how water would build up and spread across the bathroom ceiling, forming mould.\nMr Price claims it took eight months for someone to come and look at the house, but despite it allegedly being fixed, the same issues arose in 2019.\nIt wasn't until 2020 that a Permisson Homes contractor came out again, all this time the house filled with mould and damp in multiple rooms.\nThe same year, Mr Price claims they were told that there were no records of fire cavity barriers being installed, which resulted in an inspection that led to even further problems.\nThe Princes say the 'mould growth went crazy', adding: 'We were washing the walls every week, washing the ceilings to the point where we stripped back the paint off the ceiling off the walls.\n'It's just incredible. We were complaining the whole time and it's just so frustrating.'\nIn 2021, Permisson inspected the property to look at the mould and damp issues and repaired the extraction fan.\nBut year by year, Permisson would claim to have fixed problems but the house is still in disarray, according to Mr Prince.\n\nWhen Mr Prince moved into the show home, on-site staff gave him cups of tea and biscuits\nIn November 2024, Mr Prince says he threatened to stop paying the mortgage as his daughter was hospitalised and his whole family's health was deteriorating. \nPermisson sent someone to carry out a report of the house that month, but it was only returned to him three months later in February. \nAfter the report concluded there was serious mould and the moisture was over 20 per cent, Mr Prince emailed Permisson to say he would be protesting inside the show home until someone came around to sort everything out. \nSpeaking about why he carried out the protest, Mr Prince said: 'I want people to do what I did to get the attention of Persimmon Homes, because you spend your life savings, it's your biggest investment you'll make in your life.\n'You want to buy a safe and secure environment for your family to grow up in and it's a place where your family should thrive. \n'It's a place that your family should have fun but I just didn't want to go home at night. I would stay here at the hotel till late and then I'd get back as late as possible.\n'I didn't like sitting there and watching TV because on the wall behind the TV was just coated in mould.\n\nAfter the report concluded there was serious mould and the moisture was over 20 per cent, Mr Prince emailed Permisson to say he would be protesting inside the show home until someone came around to sort everything out\n\nA dossier of photos shows the level of mould in different rooms, plus on the back of the sofas\n'Right next to my bed, the wall was all damp. The back of where the headboard was all damp, and above the bed was just thick mould growing off the ceiling. I just thought that's what I've got to look forward to after 16-hour working days.'\nDiscussing the impact it's had on his family, he said: 'It's caused huge relationship issues between me and my wife. Several times I couldn't stay there due to the friction it caused between us.'\nMr Prince said he 'felt like a broken father' by February 28, explaining: 'I was literally at the end of my patience with everything, so I just packed up a bag, took my laptop and my charger. \n'I went down to the show room and I just locked the door.\n'I just called Permisson Homes in Exeter and I said, 'Look, I'm in your show home in Agusta Park, I'm not moving from here until I speak to someone who's actually going to do something about my house.'\nMr Prince said that he also threatened to move his family into the show home unless someone came to inspect the house.\n'They were obviously a bit shocked on the other end and within two-and-a-half hours, the managing director of the southwest came up and saw me.'\nThe family are now living in the hotel Mr Prince runs, which he says is losing the company £150 a night on a room for guests.\n'We're here and it's five of us in one room. Everything in our life has got dramatically worse in the hope that it gets a lot better.'\nA spokesman for Permisson Homes said: 'We have been actively engaging with the customer in recent weeks, conducting a thorough assessment of the property and providing advice, guidance, and an offer of assistance to help address the issues they are experiencing.\n'We are very sympathetic to the situation the homeowner is facing and remain committed to assisting them; however, a date for a follow-up meeting has not yet been provided by the customer, despite multiple requests and offers of our availability.\n'Our priority is to meet with the customer to assist them in understanding what is causing the issue at the property and examine any necessary work in consultation with them.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI locked myself in a Persimmon show home because developers refused to deal with our black mould infestation... here's what happened next\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The Ukrainian party system is extremely unstable while the US equivalent consists of two major parties which have dominated politics for more than 150 years. Many other distinctions could be listed.\n\nNotwithstanding these differences, the US of 2025, under newly elected President Donald Trump, and Ukraine in 2010, under then newly elected President Viktor Yanukovych, bear similarities in several striking ways. Nine years ago, US and Ukrainian politics became strangely linked through the notorious political figure of Paul Manafort. A prolific campaigner and manipulator for authoritarian rulers across the world, Manafort had been a relevant actor in Kyiv in 2004-10, and six years later shot into the limelight in Washington. He played a role in the rise of both controversial figures – Yanukovych in Ukraine, and Trump in the US. Manafort’s engagements with Yanukovych (over several years) and Trump (over several months) preceded their spectacular victories in the presidential elections of 2010 and 2016 respectively.\n\nMoreover, the political advances of Yanukovych and Trump have also become similar with both having received support from Russia during critical electoral campaigns. For sure, Moscow’s involvement in both Ukrainian and US pre-electoral politics saw differing levels of intensity and results. In Ukraine, the Kremlin was always a crucial participant of domestic affairs until 2014, and Moscow employed a multitude of secret as well as not so secret agents and instruments. Nevertheless, the Kremlin’s constant subversion of Ukraine’s polity was insufficient to secure pro-Russian Yanukovych’s victory in the presidential elections of 2004, in whose conduct Moscow was deeply involved.\n\nIn the US, in contrast, it was the 2015-16 presidential bid of Trump and his public appeal to Russia “to find the 30,000 emails [of his Democratic competitor Hilary Clinton] that are missing” which motivated the Kremlin to intrude in the contest between Trump and Clinton. While the Kremlin directly and openly interfered in Ukrainian domestic affairs, Moscow’s engagement with Trump was more secretive and indirect. It did not – as far as we know –amount to a full-blown political collusion between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin, unlike the many occasions of collaboration between Moscow and pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians.\n\nNevertheless, the meddling of Russia’s special services in the 2016 US electoral campaign was massive, as documented in a five-volume report of the US Senate’s Select Committee on Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 US Election published in 2019-2020. Whether Russia’s activities of 2016 altered the narrow result of that year’s presidential election or not, and whether Trump thus owes his political rise to Moscow, we will never know for sure. What is clear is that the 2016 US electoral campaign would have developed differently without Russian involvement. Something similar can be said about the entire history of domestic Ukrainian politics until 2022.\n\nIntriguing congruencies between Yanukovych and Trump\n\nThe biographies of Yanukovych and Trump reveal similar patterns. Both men’s approaches to politics are transactional, cynical, patriarchal, and not burdened by the constraints of values, norms and ideology. When elected presidents in 2010 and 2016 respectively, Yanukovych and Trump were both convicted felons whose known infringements of the law did not – as would have been the case in most other democracies – prevent a nomination for head of state, by their political organizations, i. e. Ukraine’s Party of Regions and the US’s GOP. Moreover, there are certain parallels in the ways Yanukovych and Trump tried to gain and keep power.\n\nIn 2004, then being Ukraine’s prime minister, Yanukovych attempted to become president via large scale electoral fraud in the second round of Ukraine’s fourth presidential elections since 1991. This attempted illegal power grab was prevented by Ukraine’s Supreme Court which declared the election results invalid and ordered a repeat of the voting – which Yanukovych predictably lost. In early 2021, as the outgoing 45th US president, Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential elections by, among other things, instigating a mob to storm Washington’s Capitol Building and prevent Congress to formalize the victory of Joe Biden. This attempted coup was prevented by Washington’s police and Congress, which went on to validate the election results. In the aftermath, Moscow has publicly supported Yanukovych and Trump in their non-recognition of their electoral defeats of 2004 and 2020. \n\nIn spring 2010, former PM Yanukovych eventually won Ukraine’s presidential elections against an incumbent female prime minister with less than 50% of the vote. While Yanukovych received 49.3%, Yuliia Tymoshenko collected 46.0%. Fourteen and a half years later, Trump won the 2024 US presidential elections against an incumbent female vice president, also with less than 50% of the vote. While Trump received 49.8% of the popular vote, Kamala Harris collected 48.3%.\n\nBoth Yanukovych’s and Trump’s victories in 2010 and 2024 were, at these points in time, less helped by Manafort and/or Russia. Instead, they were both mainly a result of the ineptitude of Ukrainian and US democratic electoral strategists and campaigners. These two momentous votes could arguably have been won by the two democratic female contenders had their political allies and managers behaved more cooperatively.\n\nIn particular, the two incumbent presidents, Ukraine’s Viktor Yushchenko and the US’ Joe Biden, did not help Tymoshenko and Harris sufficiently to win their respective contests. Yushchenko refused to endorse Tymoshenko in the second round of Ukraine’s 2010 presidential elections whereas Biden withdrew far too late his candidacy from the US presidential race of 2024. Yushchenko and Biden thus became partly complicit in the fateful electoral triumphs of the anti-democrats Yanukovych and Trump.\n\nThe biggest similarities between Yanukovych and Trump are, however, their close ties to some of their countries’ plushest tycoons as well as both men’s readiness to disrupt their countries’ domestic orders and foreign relations. Yanukovych in 2010 and Trump in 2024 had both the open and manifest support from their countries’ respectively richest men, Rinat Akhmetov and Elon Musk, respectively, as well as from a number of other super-rich oligarchs.\n\nIn 2010-2013, Yanukovych tried to recreate the Ukrainian plutocracy that had emerged in the 1990s, after the break-up of the Soviet Union. In contrast, Trump is currently engaged in installing a type of isolationist oligarchy that would seem to be entirely novel to the contemporary US (or, in some ways, take it back to the 19th century).\n\nIn 2010-2013, Yanukovych undermined Ukraine’s fledging democracy, Western integration and emancipation from Russia’s tutelage with a series of political turnabouts. Among others, he initiated, in 2010, a change of the Constitution to his advantage, and deleted the aim of Ukraine’s NATO membership from the Law on the Fundamentals of National Security. In late 2013, he refused to sign an already-initialed Association Agreement with the EU.\n\nAs is well-known, this last-minute delay to the start of Ukraine’s European integration triggered a protest on Kyiv’s Independence Square that became known as the “Euromaidan” (European square). Yanukovych tried to violently suppress this dissent and thereby turned the, at first, small-scale protest into a country-wide uprising, with millions of participants. The Euromaidan grew into a bloody stand-off and eventually the historic Revolution of Dignity which resulted in the flight of Yanukovych from Kyiv, his removal from the post of president by Ukraine’s parliament, the restoration of the Constitution amended under Yanukovych, and the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU.\n\nIt should be noted that Russia’s occupation of Crimea and war against Ukraine had already started on Feb. 20, 2014. Moscow’s military attack on Ukraine, with regular Russian troops, began thus before all of the latter events happened, and not, as is widely believed, in reaction to them).\n\nHow Trump’s presidency might play out\n\nWhat is currently happening and may soon happen under Trump’s presidency in the US is distinct from Ukraine’s trajectory of development under Yanukovych. As the polities and societies of the US and Ukraine are dissimilar, these differences should be of no surprise. Yet, on an abstract level, the 47th US President is currently making an attempt to change the direction of American domestic and foreign affairs in a way that is similar to what Ukraine’s fourth president tried to do in his country in 2010-13. Under Trump, US political institutions and international relations are, it appears, currently experiencing transitions whose depth is increasingly rivaling that of Ukraine’s redirection under Yanukovych.\n\nThe million-dollar question, becoming more salient with every passing week, is whether the finale of Trump’s presidency may eventually look like that of Yanukovych’s. To be sure, a full impeachment of Trump that would be equivalent to the Ukrainian parliament’s removal of Yanukovych from the office of President of Ukraine in late February 2014 will have a politically different result.\n\nTrump would be merely replaced by Vice-President J.D. Vance, who is ideologically close to Trump. In contrast, Yanukovych was, for three months, replaced by Parliamentary Speaker Oleksandr Turchinov who had been opposed to Yanukovych. Turchinov became Ukraine’s interim president until the newly elected regular President Petro Poroshenko, also a politician who had been opposed to Yanukovych, took over in June 2014.\n\nDespite these and many other distinctions, the future trajectory of US political developments could resemble that of Ukraine in 2010-14. Increasingly anti-democratic, disrupting, pluto- or/and autocratic as well as ultimately unpopular policies by the Trump administration could lead to mass demonstrations reminiscent of Ukraine’s uprising against Yanukovych’s policies and behavior, in late 2013. In a worst-case scenario, the stand-off between the Trump administration and a country-wide protest movement could turn violent, and lead to clashes as bad, worse or even far worse, than those of Ukraine, in early 2014.\n\nThe international repercussions of such a domestic escalation in the US could be significantly greater than the tragic aftereffects of Ukraine’s internal destabilization 11 years ago. Based on earlier prepared plans, the Kremlin in February 2014 swiftly took advantage of Kyiv’s reduced ability to react to Russian miliary expansion. When Russia annexed the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in March 2014, it started, according to Jakob Hauter, a delegated inter-state war in mainland Eastern Ukraine, in April 2014.\n\nBeing the world’s most potent military super-power, the US does not have to fear foreign invasion, occupation and annexation by a foreign country, as long as the US does not break apart. Yet, US mass protests like those in Ukraine in late 2013 and their escalation as in early 2014 would have repercussions far beyond the US. Should the Trump administration’s current disruption of political institutions, economic relations, and foreign ties continue, American civil society may sooner or later react, in some ways, similar to Ukraine’s in 2013.\n\nWhether this will also lead to deep changes within the US government, constitution and foreign affairs, as happened in Ukraine in 2014, remains to be seen. Domestic turmoil in the US will, even if tumultuous and violent, not make it as vulnerable as Ukraine became in early 2014. What nevertheless seems certain is that internal destabilization in the US would have far-reaching international repercussions which could eventually be even more tragic than those of Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity eleven years ago.\n\nDr. Andreas Umland is an analyst at the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (SCEEUS) of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs (UI).\n\nThe views expressed are the author’s and not necessarily of Kyiv Post.","summary":"Whilst the two countries are in many ways different, the political tide in the US today is churning up some stark similarities to that in Ukraine 15 years ago.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/49853","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/01/30/0ccb01f41037bc9a2c6341efe7136427.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 12:22:48","author":"Andreas Umland","authors":["Andreas Umland"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":0.2},{"id":305767028,"title":"Dan Osborne sends sweet message to Jacqueline Jossa on Mother's Day after they 'spent secret night together at his home' amid battle to save their marriage","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Mar 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle 'disrupted' Sentebale polo game by turning up at short notice with 'very famous friend' - before Prince Harry 'demanded' charity's chair issue public statement defending her\n\nRetired police officer, 63, assaults IT consultant neighbour, 41, during blazing row outside £500k home in their quiet cul-de-sac over loud hobby\n\nI was devastated when my husband died... then a mystery phone call 20 YEARS later left me stunned\n\nREVEALED: The 'evil' YouTube sleuth cashing in on tragedy by spreading sick rumours about one of America's most brutal murders\n\nDEAR JANE: I've discovered my partner's Pornhub search history.

by turning the Obamas' endorsement of Harris into a shareable video clip rather than a simple tweet or major campaign event.' \n\nThe problem, the authors claim, is that O'Malley Dillon didn't articulate that. \n\n'Harris aides were taken aback when they heard what they believed was a demand from the Obamas,' Allen and Parnes wrote. 'The former first couple was purportedly insisting on a campy behind-the-scenes video of Harris taking their call.' \n\n'She would be on camera, but not the Obamas, and Harris would have to clear her calendar to align with theirs,' they wrote. \n\nOne aide told the authors: 'It was like, \"Here's the window of time that Michelle and Barack have for you to take this call, and it can't be on video because Michelle's not going to be camera-ready.\"' \n\nAt the same time, Harris' aides were confused about why they needed to make a video.\n\n'Harris’s longtime advisers pushed back, asking why the Obamas wouldn’t just put out a paper statement or a tweet,' Allen and Parnes wrote. 'A bewildered Obama aide replied that the video was the Harris campaign's idea.' \n\nThe source who warned about the payroll problem spelled it out.\n\n'Jen wanted a video because we were hard up for cash,' the person said. 'But she didn't tell anybody. She wasn't transparent about it. Logistically, it was a pain in the butt.' \n\nO'Malley Dillon did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nHarris filmed the video spot on Wednesday, July 24 while she was in Indianapolis to address the Zeta Phi Beta sorority. \n\nIt was released the following Friday morning. \n\n'To seem real, Harris had to fake surprise and enthusiasm about what should have been an obvious endorsement from both Obamas,' Allen and Parnes wrote. \n\nThe final script had Harris feigning surprise that both Obamas were on the line.\n\n'Ohh hi, you're both together. It's good to hear you both,' Harris said, after being handed a phone by an aide. \n\nBoth Barack and Michelle said they were proud of Harris, as she told them, 'We’re going to have some fun with this too, aren't we?' \n\nFor Harris, Allen and Parnes wrote, 'the optics of unity had taken on the utmost importance. So the quality and authenticity of the endorsement moment took a back seat.' \n\n'It took days of intense negotiations to strike a deal on the simplest act in politics,' they continued. 'The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing.' \n\n'This was typical bulls***,' the authors said.","summary":"Just three days after President Joe Biden left the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris had to get her acting chops ready.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14544415/video-obamas-endorsing-kamala-harris-president.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/16/96679937-0-image-a-14_1743179844322.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 11:54:58","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":305757184,"title":"Tim Walz Demands Answers After University Student Detained by ICE","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is demanding answers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after a student at the University of Minnesota was detained by federal immigration authorities.\"The University of Minnesota is an international destination for education and research,\" Walz wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"We have any number of students studying here with visas, and we need answers,\" he added.Newsweek contacted the office of Walz and DHS for further comment outside of office hours.Why It MattersPresident Donald Trump has vowed to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the country as he looks to fulfill his campaign vow of mass deportations. The Republican leader has granted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the authority to conduct arrests in or near sensitive locations such as schools and universities.The incident surrounding the University of Minnesota student detained by immigration authorities has raised concerns regarding enforcement operations near educational institutions. Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate, lost the presidential election to the Trump-JD Vance ticket. Immigration played a key role in the 2024 election.What To KnowICE agents detained the graduate student from the University of Minnesota earlier this week, the university said in a statement on Friday, describing the incident as \"deeply concerning.\"The student was arrested on Thursday at an off-campus residence, according to a statement from the university's president, Rebecca Cunningham.\"The university had no prior knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred,\" the statement reads.The University of Minnesota has not publicly disclosed any details about the detained student, except that he was enrolled in the Carlson School of Management.Jake Ricker, a university spokesperson told Newsweek that the \"university is providing support to the student.\"Last month, the Justice Department announced that Minnesota was one of 10 schools that investigators would visit to assess whether they \"failed to protect Jewish students and faculty members from unlawful discrimination.\"It comes amid a flurry of targeted enforcement operations directed at Pro-Palestine supporters.The case of Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and recent graduate of Columbia University who had his green card revoked, has gripped the nation.In the nearly three weeks since Khalil's arrest at Columbia University, other students who took part in pro-Palestinian protests or activities have been detained by federal agents and had their visas revoked. The Trump administration argues that they showed support for Hamas, going against U.S. foreign policy.Federal agents detained Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, on Tuesday which was recorded on surveillance footage while she was walking down a street in Somerville, Massachusetts. Plainclothes officers approached and handcuffed her, though the reason for her detention remains unclear.Another doctoral student, Iranian Alireza Doroudi who was studying at the University of Alabama, was detained earlier Tuesday. It was not clear why he had been detained.What People Are SayingGovernor Tim Walz on X: \"I just spoke with Homeland Security to get more information and I will share when I learn more.\"The University of Minnesota said in a statement: \"The university had no prior knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities before it occurred.\"It is important to note that our campus departments of public safety, including UMPD, do not enforce federal immigration laws, and our officers do not inquire about an individual's immigration status. Their focus remains on public safety, fostering trust and maintaining strong relationships across the university community.\"Minnesota State Senator Doron Clark said in a social media post: \"I am saddened and angered that ICE is operating around the University of Minnesota. Our campuses should be a safe place for all students, staff, and visitors. I am monitoring the situation closely, and encourage you to stay vigilant and well-informed.\"What Happens NextAs the student's identity remains unknown further updates are expected.","summary":"\"We have any number of students studying here with visas, and we need answers,\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-university-minnesota-student-detained-ice-immigration-2052731","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617547/tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 11:25:00","author":"Billal Rahman","authors":["Billal Rahman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":305759020,"title":"Although transgender individuals make up just 1% of the U.S. population, they remain a focal point in political debates.","text":"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people’s access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt’s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board — particularly Trump’s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies — along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges — it’s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president’s spotlight is giving Monday’s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nThe focus on transgender people is part of a long-running campaign\n\nTrump’s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women’s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMany voters think transgender rights have gone too far\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nThe full political fallout remains to be seen\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said. But “I don’t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.”\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

For a decade, he has covered Donald Trump and the Republicans. In March 2015, an Isenstadt dispatch blared: “GOP hopefuls rush toward starting gates.” The story made no mention of the man who would win the 2016 election, lose in 2020, then win again in ’24.\n\nBut like all political reporters, Isenstadt has now mentioned Donald Trump plenty.\n\nRevenge, Isenstadt’s first book, is aptly titled. In office only two months, Trump has already made settling scores and torching enemies a hallmark of his second term.\n\nAt a speech to a joint session of Congress, he used Joe Biden as punching bag and foil. Now, he declares that pardons issued by his predecessor are “void” because Biden maybe used an autopen. Whether Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general, brings charges against recipients of those pardons – Hunter Biden, Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci – remains of course to be seen.\n\nBondi once said, as Isenstadt recalls, that if Trump won, “the prosecutors will be prosecuted” and the “investigators will be investigated”. In that spirit, Ed Martin, acting US attorney for DC, unsuccessfully attempted to push a federal grand jury to indict Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, for remarks made in 2020 about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, two of Trump’s picks to the supreme court.\n\nTrump and his followers claim to be committed to freedom of speech. In reality, it’s not just graduate students with green cards who labor under the gun.\n\nRevenge is a delectable smorgasbord of scoop, dish and bile. A luridly fascinating read, it jauntily describes the efforts of Trump and his minions to gut, fillet and disembowel Ron DeSantis, Florida’s humorless governor whose short-lived bid for the 2024 Republican nomination quickly morphed into a joke.\n\nBeyond beating DeSantis, Trump strived to humiliate him. And succeeded.\n\n“To anyone who listened, Trump would tell the tale – and who the hell knew how much of it was true,” Isenstadt writes. “DeSantis came to the Oval Office, ‘tears in his eyes’ to plead for his endorsement.\n\n“‘He was like a beggar,’ Trump told people aboard Trump Force One in June 2023, as he blasted Sinéad O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U from a portable speaker … ‘I could have said, Drop to your fucking knees, Ron.’”\n\nYou’ve got to love seeing Trump, DeSantis and Sinéad O’Connor in the same sentence.\n\nIsenstadt also captures the Trump campaign rehashing a litany of the governor’s stranger moments: shoving chicken fingers into his jacket, clipping his toenails in the back of his security vehicle, or “the time he had a bathroom mishap aboard an airplane”. Revenge does not elaborate on that last item, which is probably a good thing.\n\nSnack food emerged as Ron’s achilles heel. In the same nausea-inducing spirit as Senator Amy Klobuchar reportedly eating a salad with her comb, DeSantis was said to have snarfed pudding with his fingers during a flight in 2019.\n\n“I don’t remember ever doing that,” DeSantis told Piers Morgan. “Maybe when I was a kid.” Pro tip: if you’re running for president but denying you’re an awkward slob, you’re losing.\n\n“Trump didn’t just want to stop DeSantis from winning the Republican nomination,” to quote Isenstadt. “He wanted to destroy him and make it impossible for him to run for anything ever again.”\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nIsenstadt also examines the on-again-off-again relationship between Trump and Rupert Murdoch. According to Isenstadt, their interactions were moored in profit and convenience. During Trump’s bid for the nomination in 2016, the New York Post, Murdoch-owned, denied Trump the respect he craved. When DeSantis vied for the nomination in 2024, Murdoch appeared to be in his corner. That wounded Trump’s ego.\n\n“That Rupert is such a piece of shit, he’s so cold,” Isenstadt captures Trump thundering, privately. He castigated Murdoch in public too, accusing him of “aiding and abetting the DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA”. As for James Murdoch, Rupert’s son? “He’s a crazy fucking liberal,” Trump complained to Tucker Carlson.\n\nOther sources bolster Isenstadt’s take on Murdoch and Trump. According to Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s first bestseller that birthed a genre, Murdoch called Trump “a fucking idiot” after the two men ended a call. In The Fall, Wolff’s Murdoch book from 2023, Wolff wrote that Murdoch frequently wished Trump dead, despite the fact he was a monster Murdoch helped create, and who made him even richer.\n\n“Of all Trump’s implacable enemies, Murdoch had become a frothing-at-the-mouth one,” Wolff wrote. “Trump’s death became a Murdoch theme: ‘We would all be better off … ?’ ‘This would all be solved if … ’ ‘How could he still be alive, how could he?’ ‘Have you seen him? Have you seen what he looks like?’”\n\nFast forward. Trump is living large, while Murdoch’s life mirrors Succession, the HBO hit about vicious family rivalry that was based squarely on … the Murdochs.\n\nIn conclusion, Isenstadt argues convincingly that “revenge” remains the byword for the second Trump administration. He reviews ABC’s $16m settlement of a Trump defamation suit, and the consumer fraud complaint Trump filed against Ann Selzer, the Des Moines Register and its parent company, Gannett. Selzer’s pre-election Iowa poll “so angered him” – because she had Kamala Harris ahead. Defendants have moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Trump’s opposition is due by 28 March, with briefing by all parties by mid-April.\n\nIsenstadt also recalls that House Republicans released a report calling for Liz Cheney, once their own congresswoman from Wyoming, to be investigated by the FBI for her work on the January 6 committee.

The school told Fox News' Laura Ingraham that \"The ABCs to ME\" display \"is a student-led history project that is part of an elective Women's History class.\" The \"A is for Abortion\" section of the display featured an image of a coat hanger and a positive pregnancy test, as well as a description of the project, which was first reported by The Daily Signal. EXCLUSIVE: RED STATE SUING SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR ILLEGALLY TEACHING CRITICAL RACE THEORY According to the project description, the display is for Women's History Month, and the Women’s History class is \"celebrating and bringing awareness to what it means to be a young woman today at West Springfield High School and in the world.\" \"A\" wasn't the only letter that turned heads, with former Vice President Kamala Harris being the focal point of the \"H is for Hope\" display. For the \"J is for Justice\" display, students were shown an image of the Statue of Liberty holding a female sign instead of a torch, surrounded by transgender, Ukrainian and Palestinian flags. Prominent female Democratic Party members such as Kamala Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Michelle Obama were featured in the \"L is for Leadership\" section of the alphabetic display. The \"ABCs to ME\" display also had a spot reserved for men, seemingly criticizing them with \"M is for Mansplain,\" a reference to the derogatory term for a man explaining something to a woman in a condescending manner. TRUMP BLASTS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS ‘CON JOB,’ SAYS HE WANTS IT CLOSED 'IMMEDIATELY' \"N is for NOW\" highlights the progressive women's advocacy group, the National Organization for Women (NOW). In a May 2022 blog post on its website, NOW railed against the decisions made by several states to ban biological males from competing against females in sports. The post asserted that it is \"simply dehumanizing and sexist to assume that because a person is AMAB* [assigned male at birth] they must have some sort of athletic advantage over cisgender women.\" Two letters of the alphabet were dedicated to the LGBTQ community. \"Q is for Queer\" and \"T is for Trans Women\" were shown in the display, with a transgender flag inside the circle of the female symbol being the image featured for \"T.\" The mother of a male student attending West Springfield High School, Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, spoke with \"The Ingraham Angle\" on March 18, sharing a story of one of the students at the high school who allegedly ripped down the \"A is for Abortion\" display. ILLITERATE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES SUING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS IVY LEAGUE PROFESSOR WARNS OF 'DEEPER PROBLEM' \"I just found out, a mom called me, and she told me that her son had actually ripped down the ‘A is for Abortion’ sign. He was upset, and he was brought into the principal’s office, and they counseled him, and they said, ‘Well, you had such a visceral reaction to this,’ and I think that's just absurd. I mean, how could you not have an emotive reaction to this, even if the adults do? So I’m proud of the students who are stepping up and saying, 'This isn’t right. This isn’t the kind of school we want to be in. This is indoctrination, it's not education,'\" Lundquist-Arora alleged. An email exchange between the Superintendent of Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS), Dr. Michelle Reid, and Lundquist-Arora, was provided to Fox News Digital by the concerned parent. Lundquist-Arora, a chapter leader for the conservative Independent Women's Network, asked Reid via email why the \"obscene display\" continued hanging in the school's history hallway, despite the fact that it seems to violate the district's own \"controversial issues policy.\" The concerned mother also highlighted President Donald Trump's Executive Order, \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,\" which she felt was violated by the school's \"ABCs to ME\" display. Trump’s aforementioned executive order seeks to remove federal funding for schools that teach Critical Race Theory (CRT). 'EDUCATORS WILL BE FIRED': REPUBLICANS CHEER TRUMP ORDER DISMANTLING EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AS DEMS SEETHE When faced with these concerns, the superintendent made no concessions regarding the appropriateness of the display, and supported the school's decision to keep the display up. \"Often, women’s history is excluded from traditional history texts and instruction. I respect the right of our students to respectfully share their honest, comprehensive historical perspective that is relevant to them as young adults and in keeping with the assignment guidance and expectations. This is critical thinking -- an integral part of our educational experience for our soon-to-be graduating high school students,\" Dr. Reid asserted in her email. The response continued, \"Finally, let me be clear that our schools will remain focused on achieving a world class education for each and every student in a safe environment that values critical thinking, problem solving and creative thought provoking work. I see this student display as an example of student work that explores ideas and perspectives in a thoughtful manner and trust that this matter has been appropriately handled by school based staff – who have my full confidence.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked for comment by Fox News Digital, Lundquist-Arora responded, \"The ABCs to Me display is what happens at the intersection of politicized teaching and biased district leadership.

Who will step up and lead them?","text":"Democrats are furious. And they want their leaders to get mad, too.\n\n“I wish you’d be angry,” a constituent told representative Gil Cisneros, a Democrat of California, at a recent town hall. At an event in Minnesota featuring a panel of Democratic attorneys general, an activist voiced a similar sentiment: “Get angry, man,” punctuating the message with a profanity.\n\nThe anger roiling the party, slow to build, is now a forceful current coursing through the electorate and pulling in Americans terrified that the country is descending into authoritarianism. Democrats – with no leader to guide them and little power to wield in Washington – are scrambling to harness the sudden fury.\n\nAt rallies, town halls and protests, voters are venting their fury with Donald Trump and his empowerment of Elon Musk’s full-frontal assault on federal agencies, stoking what progressive activists believe are the embers of a populist backlash against the president – and the Democratic leaders they believe are not meeting the moment.\n\nTens of thousands of left-leaning voters flocked to “Fight Oligarchy” rallies hosted by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez across three western states last week. Democratic members of Congress spoke to packed crowds at events in House districts held by Republicans, who have been advised not to hold town hall meetings in this climate. And the Arizona senator Mark Kelly joined the Tesla Takedown movement, offloading his electric car after a public spat with Musk.\n\nDespite the rising tide of anger, Democrats still have no clear strategy to confront Trump or the chainsaw-wielding Musk, who said in an interview on Thursday that his mission to slash federal spending by $1tn could be completed within weeks. Their popularity is cratering and they remain divided over policy and messaging.\n\nThe deep discontent among Democrats has some wondering whether they are on the verge of their own Tea Party-style, grassroots revolt.\n\n“What if we didn’t suck?” Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old progressive TikTok star said in a campaign video launching her bid this week for a safely Democratic Illinois House district that is currently represented by the long-serving representative Jan Schakowsky.\n\n“This isn’t a referendum on Schakowsky,” Abughazaleh said in an interview. “We need to try something different and I am sick of waiting around for someone to do something. There is no mythical, perfect candidate that’s coming out of the woodwork to save us.”\n\nThere is near universal agreement that the party needs a post-election reset. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times​ on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom, the Democratic leader of the largest blue state, said his party’s brand had become “toxic”.\n\n“People don’t think we make any damn sense,” he said.\n\nRecent polling reflects the grim state of affairs. Just 40% of Democrats approved of the way their leaders in Congress were handling the job, compared with 49% who disapproved, according to a Quinnipiac University poll last month. The survey, which marked what the university’s polling analyst Tim Malloy called a “sobering slap-down of historic proportions for the Democrats in Congress”, was conducted weeks before the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer provided the votes to pass the Republican-drafted government funding bill that ignited a furious backlash and led to calls for new leadership.\n\nA survey released this week by the progressive polling firm Data for Progress showed that 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below, with 21% assigning a failing grade.\n\nA strong majority of respondents expressed a desire for new leadership in the party, with 69% agreeing that older leaders should retire and pass the torch to the next generation: Democrats with the skill and instinct to compete in a more hostile political – and media – landscape. “What if we came out strong, metaphorical guns a-blazing?” Abughazaleh said.\n\nAnger can be a powerful electoral force, said Steven W Webster, political scientist at Indiana University and the author of American Rage: How Anger Shapes Our Politics.\n\n“An angry voter is a loyal voter,” he said, but there is a risk for Democrats if they fail to match the anger in their base, he said: “They run the risk of having their voters turn on them.”\n\nThe progressive group Indivisible is leading a campaign demanding Schumer step aside as leader – though Schumer remains defiant. Leftwing groups are also ramping up efforts to challenge Democratic incumbents in next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“The thing that I’m finding, frankly, pretty disconcerting right now is Democrats sticking their heads in the sand and not responding directly to the moment that we’re in,” Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, said on an organizing call this week.\n\nTheda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist and political scientist who studied the Tea Party, said the conservative movement was the wrong blueprint for Democrats.\n\n“What the Tea Party did to the GOP, it cannot be done to the Democrats, and if it were, it would relegate them to four decades of minority status,” she said. Skocpol, who also studied the anti-Trump resistance that emerged in response to his 2016 election, said her research showed that engagement at the state and local level helped save the Affordable Care Act and turn the tide for Democrats in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. That was a better model, she argued, and it could begin with the upcoming special elections in Wisconsin and Florida on Tuesday.\n\nAn upset victory by the Democrat James Malone for a Pennsylvania state senate seat in a district that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump in November provided a beacon of hope for the party. Vincent Hughes, a Democratic state senator, said Malone’s victory was a “referendum on the chaos Washington Republicans have brought to our state”, adding: “Voters are fed up.”\n\nPart of the challenge Democrats face is leading a resistive movement without a clear leader.\n\nAsked in an open-ended CNN poll to name the Democratic leader they feel “best reflects the core values” of the party, 10% of the respondents said Ocasio-Cortez, followed by Kamala Harris at 9% and Sanders at 8%, while 30% did not provide a name.\n\n“No one,” one respondent told the pollster, according to CNN. “That’s the problem.”\n\nFar lower on the list – or missing entirely – were the Democrats most often cited as potential presidential contenders in 2028: Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Chris Murphy and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSarah Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark and a prominent anti-Trump Republican pollster who addressed House Democrats at their closed-door retreat in Virginia earlier this month, said she left disillusioned by the state of the opposition’s leadership.\n\n“Nobody knows what time it is. Nobody seems to be ready to meet this moment,” she told an audience in Phoenix during a live taping of her podcast The Next Level.\n\nAmong the few exceptions, ​the conservative host conceded, were Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez ​​because they were actively mobilizing overflow crowds against the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, his attempts to dismantle the Department of Education and the threats to overhaul social security and cut Medicaid and Medicare.\n\n​I​f Americans continue​d to show up and speak out​, ​L​ongwell predicted, Trump’s popularity would ​eventually fall so low that Republicans would start “figuring out a way to offload him” and Democrats would “stop acting like people who are scared of their shadows”.\n\nAs their agitated base searchers for fighters, the party is still searching for answers. There is widespread agreement on the diagnosis: that the party must rebuild trust with the working class and win back the cohorts of young people, Latinos and Asian voters who defected to Trump in 2024.\n\nA post-election analysis by the pollster David Shor found that naturalized citizens swung sharply from Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, meaning they chose a candidate who promised to close the very same doors they walked through to enter the country. Perhaps most worryingly for the party was their sharp turn toward Trump among young people, especially men.\n\nA growing faction of Democrats favors a populist economic message to recapture these voters.\n\nOn Capitol Hill this week, an ideologically mixed group of House Democrats called on their party to embrace a “fighting spirit of patriotic economic populism”.\n\n“Democrats need to wake up and stop defending elites and the establishment,” the representative Chris Deluzio, who represents a competitive Pennsylvania district, said in a floor speech.\n\n“This embrace of economic patriotism might sound and look different depending on where in this country and who the messenger is,” he continued. “But we agree that the era of a spineless Democratic party must end.”\n\nThe speech matched the party’s fighting mood since Trump’s re-election. But the party’s identity crisis runs deeper, spanning ideology, policy and messaging.\n\nAccording to new data from the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, nearly 80% of Democrats want the party to take a more combative approach to the president, including 50% who say they want the party to be “much more” combative. It also found Democrats were twice as likely to say they wanted the party to move toward the political center – 42% – rather than to the political left – 20%.\n\nThe path forward, according to Ruffini, is what he calls “combative centrism” – candidates who take on Trump and his administration but hold moderate positions on key social and economic issues.\n\nMatt Bennett, a founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, agrees strongly that the party needs a rebrand, particularly in its approach to working-class voters. But he isn’t convinced that a billionaire-centered critique, championed by leftwing populists like Sanders, is the right approach.\n\n“It isn’t clear that a country that just elected a billionaire whose best friend is the richest guy on Earth is demanding that we fight the oligarchy,” he said. “They’re very mad at both Trump and Elon, not because they’re wealthy, but because they’re vandals that are destroying the American republic.”\n\n“That does not mean in any way that we are taking a backseat in the fight against Trump,” he added.\n\nOne lesson many Democrats drew from their 2024 defeat was that opposing Trump was not enough. But showing a willingness to fight him now might be enough to start a conversation with the voters who ​t​uned them out in November.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of opportunity to step in with some fresh leadership and some fresh ideas, and to be bold and on offense,” said Rebecca Cooke, a Democrat who is running for the chance to unseat the Republican representative Derrick Van Orden in a politically competitive Wisconsin House district. “I think we play defense a little bit too much, and I think that it’s important for us to be a little bit more uninhibited as Democrats.”\n\nRachel Leingang contributed to this report","summary":"At rallies, town halls and protests, voters are unleashing their fury with Donald Trump, stoking what some believe is a populist backlash\n\nDemocrats are furious.

No hanging out with the cast, a very, very surface level goodbye to Mikey Madison,\" one wrote.Newsweek contacted NBC and Wallen's representative for comment by email on Sunday morning, outside of standard working hours.Why It MattersMorgan Wallen's incredible rise in the world of country and pop music has been derailed by a series of controversies that surrounded him in recent years.In 2020, his planned appearance on SNL was canceled due to a viral TikTok video that showed him ignoring COVID-19 protocols and attending a house party without wearing a face mask. In the same year, he was arrested on public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges outside a bar in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.A video filmed in January 2021 in which the Tennessee-born singer could be heard drunkenly shouting the N-word at friends outside his home got his label to put him on an indefinite hiatus, and he was disqualified by the 2021 Grammys and the Academy of Country Music Awards. Wallen apologized for using the racial slur, saying there were no excuses.In December 2024, Wallen was sentenced to spend seven days in a DUI education center and be under supervised probation for two years for throwing a chair from the rooftop of a six-story bar in Nashville in April of that same year and nearly hitting two police officers.What To KnowIn the last few minutes of SNL weekend's episode, host Mikey Madison addressed the camera saying: \"Thank you so much to Morgan Wallen, I had a wonderful time, thank you all.\"Wallen, standing next to her, can be seen giving a quick smile, nodding, saluting the public, and then quickly telling something to Madison before saying goodbye to the host and walking off stage, right in front of the camera. The footage then cuts to the other guests of the show still hugging, clapping, and chatting on stage.Wallen's hasty exit has captured the attention of many on social media, who accused the singer of \"ruining\" the SNL episode with his attitude. Many also pointed out that the rest of the episode's cast was standing \"far back\" from Wallen and Madison, suggesting they did not like the singer-songwriter.During the episode, Wallen performed two songs from his new album I'm the Problem—\"I'm the Problem\" and \"Just In Case.\"What People Are SayingJournalist Nick Field wrote on X: \"Morgan Wallen is the first musical guest or host on SNL that I can recall who just walked off stage during 'goodnights' before the credits even started to roll.\"A social media user with the handle of vickygrizi wrote on X: \"Mikey Madison is such a class act to put up with such [a] guy. First musical act I can recall in the last few years storming off of stage before the credits roll.\"Another user with the account name luvthomasstan wrote: \"Morgan Wallen walking off before the SNL credits were even over... yeah, there's a special place in hell for that man.\"Another X user named MStoehrer voiced support for Wallen, writing: \"All week I was wondering why he would let a defunct show like SNL exploit him now as #1 country star in the world. He went long con and went out with figurative middle fingers blazing. Tantrums are going to get millions to download...master class.\"What's NextWhile Wallen does not usually talk about politics and did not offer his endorsement to either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in 2024, he has become a darling of the Make America Great Again movement and conservatives.His quick exit from this weekend's SNL episode is already being seen by some as sort of a political statement against the show, which is widely perceived as a liberal bastion, though it mocks all sides of the U.S. political spectrum.","summary":"After his latest appearance on the \"SNL\" stage this weekend, Morgan Wallen made a hasty exit as the credits were still rolling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/morgan-wallen-walks-off-snl-stage-2052715","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617529/morgan-wallen.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 09:00:49","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":305727660,"title":"Elon Musk is finding out why Warren Buffett steers clear of politics","text":"Elon Musk's foray into politics has put a target on Tesla, showing Warren Buffett was right to worry that speaking out could hurt his employees and shareholders.Musk threw his money and clout behind President Donald Trump's reelection campaign last year, stumping for the Republican candidate at rallies, whipping up support for him on X, and pouring more than $290 million into returning him to power.The world's richest man is now a prominent advisor to the US leader and the driving force behind DOGE's ostensible mission to reduce government fraud, waste, and abuse.Musk's central role in the Trump administration has rankled some Americans, sparking boycotts and sales of Tesla vehicles, protests outside showrooms — and even vandalism and destruction of the company's products and property.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has said he's shocked by the violence, calling it \"insane and deeply wrong\" in an X post earlier this month. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"In another post, Musk wrote: \"Has there ever been such a level of coordinated violence against a peaceful company? I understand not wanting to buy a product, but this is extreme arson and destruction!\"Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, openly supported Democrats until a few years ago. He hosted fundraisers for Barack Obama in 2011, and took the stage at a Hillary Clinton rally in 2016 to call out Trump's multiple failed businesses, refusal to release his tax returns, and cruel treatment of others. He did not endorse Kamala Harris or any other politicians last year.The billionaire investor explained why at Berkshire's annual shareholders' meeting in 2022. His previous stance was that he doesn't put his \"citizenship in a blind trust as a CEO,\" but recognized that voicing his political views could anger people and prompt them to \"take it out on our companies.\"\"I've decidedly backed off. I don't want to say anything that'll get attributed, basically to Berkshire, and have somebody else bear the consequences of what I talk about,\" Buffett said, underscoring that he doesn't want his workers and stockholders to \"pay the price\" for his political commentary.However, Musk and Buffett have starkly different goals that shape their political strategies, Sean Lux, an associate professor of practice at Texas Tech University's Rawls College of Business, told Business Insider.The Berkshire chief is focused on delivering consistent, long-term returns regardless of which party is in charge, so avoiding politics or playing nice with both sides makes sense for him, Lux said. As for Musk, his ultimate mission is to reach Mars and the US government could be a \"tremendous catalyst or impediment\" to those efforts, Lux said.\"Donald Trump's candidacy provided Elon a once-in-history opportunity to broadly influence US policy in support of his goals,\" Lux said. \"Elon is probably the greatest business strategist of his generation, and he was unlikely to miss this opportunity regardless of public backlash.\"The business guru pointed to the Federal Communications Commission's recent decision to allow SpaceX's Starlink unit to offer direct-to-cell satellite service. Lux said that \"alone was worth the cost of Elon's support to Trump's campaign.\" It's a major step toward Musk disrupting not just telecom giants but players such as Apple, Meta, and Alphabet.Steven Callander, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business, told BI the backlash against Musk for his politics actions was \"inevitable.\" He said the \"real cost to Tesla will be the lost sales and the brand damage\" — not the vandalism.New Tesla registrations in the US tumbled 11% in January — even as Ford's EV sales soared 54% — and picture was worse in Europe as sales plunged more than 40% in February, industry reports show. Tesla shares are down 45% from their December high.Callander said the public is fine with CEOs taking political stances as that's \"part of being authentic,\" but the risk is they become so enmeshed in politics that it \"overwhelms their business identity.\"\"This is Musk's fate,\" he said, adding that the benefits to Musk's companies from government contracts \"will be swamped by the damage he is doing with the millions of customers in the general public.\"Callander added that business leaders don't only have to gauge the risk of public backlash, but now the possibility of government retaliation too. That's a \"real concern for many CEOs,\" he said. \"They'd rather stay in the pack and not be the one targeted by Trump.\"","summary":"Tesla is being targeted over Elon Musk's ties to Donald Trump, showing Warren Buffett was right to worry that getting political could hit his company.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-backlash-warren-buffett-politics-trump-spacex-government-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67e54250b8b41a9673fbd616?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 08:47:02","author":"Theron Mohamed","authors":["Theron Mohamed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.552},{"id":305729872,"title":"Trans people are less than 1% of the population. Trump made them a political lightning rod","text":"Donald Trump's renewed focus on transgender issues has reignited a contentious debate, raising questions about civil rights and political strategy. During his campaign, Trump leveraged transgender access to sports and bathrooms to galvanize conservative support. Now, back in office, he's doubled down, removing references to transgender individuals from government websites and passports, and attempting to reinstate a ban on their military service.\n\nThis focus on a minority group—transgender people constitute less than 1% of the US population—highlights a significant cultural divide. Transgender individuals and their advocates view these actions as an assault on civil rights. This difference in perspective has transformed the issue into a key piece on Trump's political chessboard.\n\nTrump's actions have faced legal challenges, with several judges ruling against his administration's policies. These rulings underscore the ongoing legal battle over transgender rights and the clash between differing interpretations of equality and inclusion.\n\nThe president's spotlight is giving Monday's Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump's actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women's spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence. \n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt's not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\" Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast.

This is an unimaginable loss for the Senator and their family, and they are heartbroken,” Spearman’s family said in a statement to the outlet.\n\n“During this difficult time, the Senator and their family ask for privacy as they grieve and support one another.

I thought I'd have to wait longer for the imminent collapse. It happened even faster than I could imagine,' Carville said, with his trademark bayou drawl. \n\nCarville has spent decades dissecting the highs and lows of American politics and seen plenty of erratic behavior from politicians. \n\nBut the 'Ragin Cajun's' latest comments were rooted in his February New York Times op-ed, in which he advised Democrats to essentially play dead in to bide their time and allow the Trump administration to implode under the weight of its own dysfunction. \n\n'Sometimes the most powerful thing we can do is retreat on the immediate battlefield - and advance in another direction,' he wrote.\n\n'It won't take long. Public support for this administration will fall through the floorboard. It's already happening.'\n\nThat op-ed raised eyebrows for its tone and its total reliance on Trump's self-destruction as a political strategy. \n\nBut now Carville insists that the collapse he forecasted has already arrived - even sooner than expected.\n\n'This is a glorious opportunity for the Democratic Party to redefine itself,' he declared. 'It's the gravest crisis we've had in the United States in the last 80 years.'\n\nCarville painted the Trump administration as a constitutional disaster zone, suggesting that America had veered off the rails of legality and leadership.\n\n'We're looking at nincompoops and blockheads and buffoons running the country,' he said. \n\nCarville, who currently serves as senior advisor for the liberal Super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, has never been shy about his distaste for Trump. \n\nYet despite his insistence the administration is unraveling, the data tells a very different story with no evidence to support his sweeping claim that public support has 'fallen through the floorboard.' \n\nTrump's public support appears to be at or above where it stood during his first term.\n\nA Gallup poll of US adults covering the first three months of 2025 found Trump's approval rating at 45% - three points higher than during the same period in 2017.\n\nAnd in a Fox News national poll conducted from March 14 to 17, Trump's approval rating stood at 49%, with particularly strong numbers among independents and working-class voters. \n\nTrump's individual policy ideas are proving popular, too.\n\nNearly six in 10 Americans approve of Trump's plan to deport illegal immigrants, 54 percent support his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and a majority are on board with Elon Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy and it's out-of-control spending, according to a CBS News poll last month.\n\nIt would not be the first time Carville has been spectacularly wrong. \n\nIn an op-ed published just weeks before the 2024 presidential election, Carville declared whom he thought would be the winning candidate.\n\nIn a column headlined 'Three Reasons I'm Certain Kamala Harris Will Win,' Carville became a laughingstock among political pundits.\n\n'America, it will all be OK. Ms. Harris will be elected the next President of the United States. Of this, I am certain,' he wrote.\n\nHe cited three reasons for his certainty: Trump had lost before, Harris's fundraising advantage and his own 'emotional' feelings. \n\nOf course, Vice President Kamala Harris lost in a landslide as Trump returned to power, winning key swing states and outperforming expectations among Latino, black, and union voters.\n\nCarville's latest pronouncements have failed to spark any movement within the Democratic Party, many of whose top strategists are now wary of such overconfidence following last year's defeat.","summary":"A veteran strategist who wrongly predicted a Harris victory in 2024 now declares the Trump presidency 'a failure' less than three months in, despite polling showing otherwise.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14551637/James-Carville-consistently-wrong-claims-Trump-collapsed.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/30/06/96717533-0-image-a-25_1743311508662.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/30/8291168900963650378/1024x576_MP4_8291168900963650378.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-30 05:43:46","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":305671862,"title":"Why Transgender Individuals, Making Up Just 1% of the Population, Captivate Political Debate","text":"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump used contentiousness around transgender people’s access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds.

At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt's not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,\" Fordham’s Murib said.\n\n Many voters think transgender rights have gone too far \n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris' voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump's and Republicans' positions have given them a political edge. \n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\n The full political fallout remains to be seen \n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times. \n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said. But “I don’t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.”\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

This marks a significant shift from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who were never able to answer the question about womanhood correctly.\npic.twitter.com/YJQRfpEdOL\n— Charles R Downs (@TheCharlesDowns) March 28, 2025\n\nThe journalist then asked, “Since Democrats seem to struggle answering this question, I want to ask you, what is a woman and why is it important that we understand the difference between men and women?”\nReplying to the question, Trump confidently said that this was an “easy” one to answer.\n“A woman is somebody who, under certain circumstances, can have a baby. She has equality. A woman is a person who is much smarter than a man—I’ve always found. A woman is a person who doesn’t even give a man a chance of success,” said Trump as the room erupted in laughter.\nShifting to a serious issue, Trump then spoke about transgender athletes competing in women’s sports.\n“A woman is also someone who, in many cases, has been treated unfairly. The idea that men can compete in women’s sports is not only ridiculous but deeply unjust. It disrespects and demeans women,” the president said.\nTrump further took a dig at a Democratic lawmaker who advocates transgender athletes’ inclusion in women’s sports and said that Democrats by pushing such policies will face trouble in elections.\nTrump, in his administration, took several measures which pushed back against gender ideology. The president signed an executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” which stops educational institutions from getting federal funding for transgender athletes to compete with biological women.\nHe also sanctioned the order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” as per which only two genders are recognised at the federal level.\nAppreciating the women, Trump said, “Women are incredible people who do so much for our country.

Red-faced emoji.\n\nWhoopsie doodle.\n\nBut this scandal is more than just an opportunity for you and I to enjoy a good, long therapeutic crackle, because Chatgate (The Yemen Yeller? The Signal Bingle?) is a much bigger deal for Donald Trump than just being deeply embarrassing.\n\nIt could be a real tipping point. \n\nThis could be the first el scandalo that has some of those whatcha me-call-its. \n\nConsequences.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, no matter the scandal, nothing has affected Mr Trump’s standing with his tireless army of supporters, the former reality show host like a sort of greased up duck: everything has simply slipped off his back.\n\nHowever, unlike the 199 Trump scandals that have come before it, Chatgate is a firestorm that the MAGA-verse – and anyone between the ages of three and 103 – can immediately and simply get: War plans put in a group chat. The end.\n\nAlready, this has caused genuine mass public anger, with 74 per cent of Americans, including 60 per cent of Republicans, saying the war plans fiasco was a very or somewhat serious problem, according to YouGov polling.\n\nTrump & co have been unmasked for all to see as utter dimwits and certifiable drongos.\n\nUsing Signal was only “a few steps above leaving a copy of your war plan at the Chinese Embassy”, one Washington defence expert told Politico.\n\nThere have also reportedly been conversations among national security experts whether such handling of defence information might have violated the Espionage Act.\n\nThe people from the chat with the most egg on their faces? \n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz who added, god knows how, Mr Goldberg to the group and Mr Hegseth, who shared the specific details of the US’ bombing of Yemen on March 15.\n\nMr Hegseth’s messages were sent 31 minutes before American warplanes took off and two hours and one minute before the Yemen bombing raid began, and clearly endangered the military involved.\n\n“You’re going to kill somebody,” one air force pilot told The New York Times.\n\nAnd that’s what sets the Yemen chat mess apart – it’s a perfectly straightforward s**tshow.\n\nTheir unparalleled buffoonery could have killed military personnel, and Americans can immediately understand that.\n\nMr Waltz and Mr Hegseth might have just achieved what Stormy Daniels and reams of dogged prosecutors and Democrats have largely failed to do until now – to dent Mr Trump’s adamantium armour of a reputation among his followers.\n\nFor people in the US to fully appreciate the severity of the situation, they don’t have to be someone with an active New York Times subscription and be willing to wade into the finer points of campaign finance laws (Mr Trump’s criminal payment to Stormy Daniels) or care about him inflating the value of his real estate holdings or believe he should not have nicked classified documents from the White House and quite literally stored them in the Mar-a-Lago loos.\n\nThis is the first great crisis that might actually stick to Mr Trump, and which might penetrate the craniums of his base.\n\nBecause everyone from diehard MAGA loyalists with ‘Mar-a-Lago Or Bust’ tattooed on their bottoms to a dumbfounded Kamala Harris at her undisclosed location (restorative gong retreat with optional valium smoothies?) can immediately see just how wrong this is. \n\nIt doesn’t get any more devastatingly and blatantly unpatriotic than to risk the brave men and women of the armed services.\n\nWhat next? Mr Hegseth hunting American bald eagles for sport or bad mouthing apple pie?\n\nWhat further sets this fiasco apart from the procession of crises that preceded it is that there is no weaselling out of it.\n\nThere is no dodging of who did what and when, because Mr Goldberg has the screenshots. Literally.\n\nBob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had to meet Deepthroat in a murky DC parking garage to bring down President Richard Nixon; Goldberg just had to casually pick up his phone every time it went ding, ding, ding. \n\nHe actually found out the US was about to bomb Yemen when his phone pinged while he was sitting in his car in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nRepublicans also look like exquisite hypocrites after having mounted the “lock her up” campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016 over her use of an unsecured personal email server. \n\nNow they have been caught with their pants around their ankles doing nearly exactly the same thing.\n\n“Their personal phones are all hackable, and it’s highly likely that foreign intelligence services are sitting on their phones watching them type the s**t out,” a former White House official told Politico. \n\n“It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialled for this.”\n\nOne member of the chat was actually in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin at the time the messages were flying around.\n\nThis disaster comes at a shaky point for the President, whose approval ratings have been falling as Americans turn on him for having unleashed Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has been slashing and burning sections of government like a carving knife-wielding Freddy Kruger having a bad day.\n\nMr Trump’s numbers have also been affected by the fact that, despite his repeated campaign promises that he would whip out his magic wand and somehow fix grocery prices and cost of living pressures on “day one”, he has failed to actually do what he promised. \n\nHe has not even lazily attempted to have a bit of a crack at it, because his plate has been full, shilling for Tesla on the White House front lawn like a used Mazda salesman trying to make his quota.\n\nLet me do as Mike Waltz actually did and simply sum things up with a few emojis.\n\nLaughing emoji.

Jack Palance said, “One thing.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump is the G.O.A.T. (the greatest of all time). His first two months have been a work of art. My fans love him. But one thing is missing. One thing that matters above all else:\n\nWHERE ARE THE ARRESTS?\n\nBecause I host national TV and radio shows and a daily video podcast, I am blessed to receive thousands of emails from my fans. I am honored. I read every one of them. \n\nThat is what gives me my edge. I understand exactly what the American people are thinking, feeling and experiencing because I listen to the American people.\n\nNinety-nine percent of politicians never read a single letter or email from their constituents. They get their advice from listening to fake news media and fake pollsters. Or they listen to donors, lawyers, lobbyists, economists and fellow D.C. politicians. \n\nWhat a terrible mistake.\n\nThe American people are smart. Not book smart or Harvard degree smart but street smart. They see and feel exactly what’s going on with this country, culture and economy because they’re living it.\n\nIt pays to listen to the people like this. \n\nThe people who watch and listen to my shows remind me of my father David Root, a blue-collar butcher. He may not have had a college degree, but he was always right. \n\nMy fans are just like my dad – salt of the earth, middle-class Americans. I value their opinions more than any Wall Street hedge fund manager, Silicon Valley CEO, powerful politician or media mogul. \n\nThe American people are smarter than all of them. \n\nSo, what are all these thousands of emails I get from average middle-class Americans telling me? Here goes …\n\nThey all love and appreciate President Trump. They believe he is the greatest president of our lifetime – maybe ever. They believe he is the only politician of their lifetimes on their side. They trust he really does want to make America great again.\n\nThey all agree the deck is stacked. It’s Trump against the deep state, D.C. swamp, political establishment, our own government and pretty much the whole world. \n\nMy viewers and listeners love 99% of what Trump has done in his first two months as president (call it Trump 2.0).\n\nBut there is ONE THING Trump has not done yet that everyone wants to see happen – the one thing that they all believe needs to happen, the one thing that will make America great again. \n\nThe one thing I hear from almost everyone is …\n\nWHERE ARE THE ARRESTS?\n\nHere is what average everyday Americans know:\n\nThey know the “resistance judges” desperate to block Trump’s agenda are dirty. They are on the payroll of either the deep state or our foreign enemies. Where are the investigations? Where are the arrests? \n\nThey know the Democrat politicians and RINOs blocking Trump’s agenda are on the deep state payroll. Where are the arrests?\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on the Sunday morning shows that she will defund cities and states that block the mass deportation. But that’s not enough.\n\nWhere are the arrests of the politicians and government officials who are breaking the law, protecting the criminals and blocking the deportations?\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas was the guy who carried out the intentional destruction of America through the open border. So, why isn’t he under arrest?\n\nThey believe George Soros is a key figure behind all of this. They believe he is the guy funding the resistance. They believe he is funding this coup against Trump. They believe he was funding the open border. Soros’ Open Society Foundations offices were just raided in India. Why aren’t we raiding his offices in America? Where are the arrests?\n\nThey believe all roads lead to Barack Obama. The American people know Joe Biden’s presidency was really Obama’s third term. Obama was giving the orders. Obama ordered the weaponization of government and the spying on Trump. These are serious crimes. So, where are the arrests? \n\nThey all love what Elon Musk is doing with DOGE. He has uncovered the looting of America. It’s great he’s exposing all this theft, it’s great he’s clawing back the money, but …\n\nWhere are the arrests of all these corrupt government bureaucrats who stole the money?\n\nWe know the Biden Crime Family and Clinton Crime Family extorted and stole perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars. Where are the arrests?\n\nWe know the government censored and silenced conservatives – in conjunction with the media, social media and even Stanford University. Mark Zuckerberg confessed in writing. Where are the arrests?\n\nThey know Dr. Anthony Fauci lied about everything involving COVID research and origins. They know he covered up deaths from the vaccine, and millions are dead or badly injured because of his lies and greed. Fauci committed “crimes against humanity.” Where are the arrests?\n\nThey know USAID was the CIA’s slush fund used to fund corruption, crime, media propaganda and Democrat Party scams. Where are the arrests?\n\nThey know the Ukraine war was one big money-laundering operation. Where are the arrests?\n\nThey know Kamala Harris’ all-time-record $1.5 billion campaign war chest was a scam. Most of that money came from illegal foreign donations. Where are the arrests?\n\nThey know that a climate change organization tied to Stacey Abrams, with $100 in revenues, was given $2 billion by the Biden administration. The money has been clawed back. But where are the arrests?\n\nI could go on and on for hours. \n\nMy fans may not be Harvard educated, but they weren’t born yesterday. We all see the fraud, extortion, looting, bribery, treason, persecution and intentional destruction of America. \n\nThe question is, where are the arrests?\n\nBecause we all believe that no matter how great President Trump is, and no matter how hard he tries, without mass arrests of the bad guys, without severe punishment, without justice, the corruption will never end, and we will never make America great again.\n\nThat’s the one thing that’s missing so far.","summary":"'Without justice, the corruption will never end, and we will never make America great again'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/just-1-question-mr-president-where-are-the-arrests/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/handcuffs-arrested-police-criminal-Pexels.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 22:54:55","author":"Wayne Allyn Root","authors":["Wayne Allyn Root"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.138},{"id":305612174,"title":"Kristi Noem's Expenses Raise Eyebrows Among Republicans in Her Home State","text":"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, while serving as South Dakota governor, billed state taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars for travel as she campaigned for President Donald Trump, a move that has drawn criticism from fellow Republicans, according to the Associated Press.Newsweek has reached out to the South Dakota Republican Party and the Department of Homeland Security on behalf of Noem for comment via email on Saturday.Why It Matters The Trump administration has vowed to slash federal spending, root out waste, fraud and abuse, and cut taxes through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Republicans have supported the agenda, repeatedly pledging to return more money to taxpayers.Noem heads the DHS, which she has said needs more funds to carry out Trump's mass deportation plans, the largest in U.S. history. However, her previous fiscal actions have drawn scrutiny from members of her own state party.What To Know A lawsuit filed last month by The Dakota Scout revealed Noem's travel receipts for when she was governor, which the Associated Press analyzed and found included over $150,000 in expenses unrelated to state business, such as covering personal and political trips like visits to Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, ahead of last year's election.The Scout, a media outlet in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, filed the lawsuit against state auditor Rich Sattgast in September, seeking to gain access to Noem's state-issued credit card receipts.Much of her travel was related to various political appearances in a private capacity, such as speaking at conservative events or Trump rallies, rather than state-related business.During her time as governor, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related expenses for Noem's office, with most costs incurred as her national profile grew alongside Trump's. At the time, she did not reveal her expenses to taxpayers.A significant portion of the money went towards security for the governor, regardless of the travel's purpose.Some South Dakota Republicans are upset by the large expenses, such as former Republican South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard who told the AP that the spending \"offends a lot of people.\"Another state Republican, state Senator Taffy Howard told the AP that \"it seems like an incredible amount of money.\"The AP reported that South Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for travel expenses, and top state officials from both parties have used state funds to cover them.What People Are SayingTim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for Noem, said in an email to the AP: \"They [Democratic governors] maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\"Relating to security costs, he said: \"Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials. When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\"Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor's office, wrote to AP in an email: \"Spending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor.\"What Happens Next? The parties reached a settlement in the lawsuit earlier this year, which lead to the release of over a thousand transactions from Noem's office.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Receipts from then-Govenor Kristi Noem show high travel spending, drawing concern from some South Dakota Republicans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kristi-noems-expenses-raise-eyebrows-among-republicans-her-home-state-2052687","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617508/kristi-noem.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 22:19:49","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":305609518,"title":"Hilarious Take: NY Times Editorial Board Believes Democrats Drifted Too Far Left for 2024","text":"The Democrats Are in Denial About 2024\n\nYes, yes, they are, as we’ve reported extensively.

Disney appears to be the second. The Philadelphia-based Comcast previously said in a statement that it would be “cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.”\n\nUnder Carr, the FCC also reopened a news bias complaint against ABC News for its handling of the September debate between then-Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and other conservatives cried foul because debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis pushed back against Trump’s inaccurate statements, including that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating people’s pets. Conservatives complained that the network only fact-checked Trump, thus giving preferential treatment to the Democrat nominee, Harris.\n\nABC News has defended its handling of the debate, which was the sole matchup between the two presidential candidates.\n\nCarr’s predecessor, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel, had dismissed four open news bias complaints in the waning days of her term.\n\nCarr promptly reopened three of the complaints — against CBS News for its controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Harris, NBC for allowing Harris to appear on “Saturday Night Live” just days before the November election, and the complaint against ABC. Carr did not reopen a complaint against Fox that Rosenworcel had also dismissed.\n\nThis is not Carr’s first admonition of Disney. In December, Carr sent a letter to Iger, accusing ABC of contributing to an “erosion in public trust.” Conservatives, including Carr, say that liberal bias among the major news organizations, including ABC News, has caused viewers to lose faith in journalists.\n\nIn December, Disney settled a defamation suit that Trump had filed against ABC and its news anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nTrump had filed the lawsuit last spring against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly said on air that Trump had been found liable for rape in an encounter with author E. Jean Carroll.

Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. “The Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,” Kendi argued, and “also one of the heartbeats” of the nation at large.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.\n\n“We do not run from or erase our history simply because we don’t like it,” she said in a statement. “We embrace the history of our country – the good, the bad, and the ugly.”\n\nTrump once praised the ‘Black Smithsonian’\n\nThe African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation’s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.\n\nFormer NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups — enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans — are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.\n\n“Attempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much … and the place that we’ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,” he said.\n\nAnd, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.\n\n“I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.\n\n“I know President Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall,” Trump continued. “I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.”\n\nTrump’s war on ‘woke’ targets history\n\nTrump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.\n\nHe ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled “woke” culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of “hating our country.”\n\nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges — public and private — that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.\n\nThe Defense Department, at one point, temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.\n\nThe administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies’ celebrations of Black History Month, and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools.\n\nWarnings of a chilling effect\n\nCivil rights advocates and historians expressed concern about a chilling effect across other institutions that study Black history.\n\nKendi noted that many museums and educational centers across the country — such as San Francisco’s Museum of the African Diaspora, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration in Montgomery, Alabama, and the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina — exist with little to no federal or other governmental funding sources. Some already are struggling to keep their doors open.\n\n“To me, that’s part of the plan, to starve these institutions that are already starving of resources so that the only institutions that are telling America’s history are actually only telling political propaganda,” Kendi said.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Aaron Morrison in New York and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"Civil rights advocates, historians and Black political leaders sharply rebuked Trump on Friday for his order, entitled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.”","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/29/critics-see-trump-attacks-on-the-black-smithsonian-as-an-effort-to-sanitize-racism-in-us-history/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_Smithsonian_91526-e1743282016473.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 20:59:19","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":305576582,"title":"Plane crashes into Minnesota home, prompting evacuation","text":"A plane burst into a ball of flames after crashing into a Minnesota home on Saturday, prompting an evacuation. \n\nAn aircraft fell from the sky in Brooklyn Park Saturday afternoon near Noble Parkway, according to Fox 9. \n\nThe home erupted into flames, leaving billows of black smoke rising in the air, causing first responders to evacuate the area. \n\nNo one was inside the home at the time of the crash, according to Fox 9. \n\nIt is unclear what type of plane or how many were on the aircraft.

You Can Try It Yourself.","text":"Social Security is an essential retirement income source for most seniors today. But if you ask younger workers, many aren't sure they'll ever see a dime from the program. Their concerns aren't entirely unfounded, though they are a bit overblown.\n\nThe program is in financial distress. It's been spending more money than it's taken in since 2021, and current estimates suggest it has less than a decade until its trust funds are depleted and it can't pay out all scheduled benefits. It wouldn't go away, though. Even in the worst-case scenario, Social Security would continue on with its income from the payroll taxes that workers pay and possibly from income taxes on Social Security benefits if current law remains in place.\n\nBenefit cuts could happen, but it's more likely that Congress will find a way to reform the program so most Americans can continue to receive their benefits as scheduled -- or maybe even get more than they're receiving now. The challenge is finding a strategy most can agree upon. If you want to see what Washington is up against, you can try your hand at reforming Social Security.\n\nHow would you fix Social Security's funding shortfall?\n\nThere isn't a single strategy that will keep Social Security solvent for the foreseeable future. It'll likely to take a combination of approaches. Some of the proposed solutions involve raising payroll taxes on workers while others suggest reducing benefits for some seniors.\n\nThe Reformer tool from the Committee for a Responsible Budget lets you play out different scenarios to see what kind of effect they would have on the funding shortfall. It gives you a list of several proposed options -- everything from raising the full retirement age (FRA) to investing trust fund earnings in the stock market -- so you can see what it might take to fix Social Security.\n\nThe tool does a great job of highlighting the many paths Washington could take to fix Social Security's funding crisis. But it also forces you to make some difficult choices about who should have to pay to keep the program sustainable for future generations.\n\nSome options, like taxing all wages above $400,000 -- which are currently exempt from Social Security payroll tax -- would go a long way. The Reformer tool estimates this would eliminate about two-thirds of the estimated shortfall. The idea of forcing the wealthy to pay more is one that's gotten a lot of bipartisan support, but there are few other proposals likely to appeal to such a broad base of Americans.\n\nTo make things more complicated, the tool also gives you options like changing the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula. This is something many seniors have long hoped for to help their benefits better keep up with inflation. But doing so would actually increase the projected funding shortfall because it would increase spending. So if you hope to make reforms to increase benefits to seniors, you'd have to find a way to bring in even more revenue or else decrease Social Security benefits for some retirees.\n\nWhy hasn't Washington done anything about Social Security yet?\n\nYou may be able to come up with a Social Security proposal that works for you using The Reformer. But the challenge for Washington is finding a plan that a majority of Congress -- and the public -- can accept.\n\nRepublicans have proposed gradually raising Social Security's FRA, which would effectively cut benefits for younger workers. Yet Trump has also proposed ending Social Security benefit taxes, which would increase the money available to seniors while also increasing the program's overall spending.\n\nAs with most political issues, many Democrats approach Social Security reform differently. Former Vice President Kamala Harris previously supported bills that would have required wealthier Americans to pay more in Social Security payroll taxes. However, as mentioned above, this alone wouldn't be enough to eliminate the projected shortfall.\n\nWith Social Security now less than a decade away from possible benefit cuts, the next few years are likely to see an increased focus on reforming the program. It's not clear what Congress will decide, though it may involve a combination of strategic benefit cuts and higher taxes. Once a plan is in place, it'll be time for workers and seniors alike to review their budgets and decide how they're going to cover their retirement costs.","url":"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/03/29/fixing-social-security-isnt-easy-try-it-yourself/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=8fac792e-11c4-4b3f-8a86-02b337f98c3d","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F812634%2Fsenior-holding-laptop-and-writing-note-in-notebook.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 18:00:00","author":"Kailey Hagen","authors":["Kailey Hagen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":305567270,"title":"Megyn Kelly Melts Down at Trump Victim E. Jean Carroll","text":"Former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose sexual harassment claims were a catalyst in former Fox News CEO and Chairman Roger Ailes’s resignation, said she doesn’t believe “one word” of another woman’s sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump. \n\nThe right-wing media pundit blasted author E. Jean Carroll—who was awarded over $85 million in punitive damages in her sexual abuse and defamation cases against Trump—in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published Saturday.\n\nCarroll alleged that Trump sexually abused her in a dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s. However, Kelly said she has sided with Trump, who called the allegations “a hoax and a lie.”\n\n“I don’t believe one word of that. Not one word,” Kelly said. \n\n“The things I heard included things like he got handsy on an airplane. Now, I don’t know whether that happened or it didn’t, but do I find that a deal-breaker for a possible politician? Not really,” Kelly continued. \n\nKelly also said that she didn’t want her own sexual harassment claims against Ailes to give credence to those of former co-worker Gretchen Carlson—who sued the network and reportedly received a $20 million settlement. Kelly, who did not pursue legal action, said she didn’t want to hurt Ailes as the network’s “cult leader.”\n\n“I really cared about Roger, and we had gotten past his harassment of me, which, for the record, never led anywhere. I did not submit to any of his advances. I had forgiven him, and he had done so much for me, and I did not want to hurt him,” she told the Times. “And I didn’t like Gretchen Carlson, who was kind of looking for help in a way. The whole question was, can he be this thing who she has alleged he is? And I was really not inclined to help her and stick a knife in him.”\n\nDespite her very public endorsements of Trump and his administration, Kelly insisted that she is “still a journalist” and can play hardball when needed. She mentioned her viral exchange with Trump at a 2015 Fox News debate during his first run for president, in which Kelly took heat for asking the president about calling women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.”\n\n“Look, you have to separate when you’re in this business, you the person and you the professional. Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand, and they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game,” she said. \n\n“I had thrown a very tough ball right at Trump’s face in that debate,” said Kelly, adding that the attacks and threats following the debate led her to hire security to take her children to Disneyland.\n\nBut now Kelly is firmly in Trump’s corner, appearing at his victory rally just before the inauguration, and has rebuked suggestions that she has somehow caved into pressure to support him from his base. \n\n“I don’t think it was me caving. It was me rising. It was me answering something I truly felt called to do,” said Kelly. “I’m thrilled Trump won. I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won, and in the end, I had no qualms about going out there for him whatsoever.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Victoria Sunday/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesFormer Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose sexual harassment claims were a catalyst in former Fox News CEO and Chairman Roger Ailes’s resignation, said she doesn’t believe “one word” of another woman’s sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump. \n\nThe right-wing media pundit blasted author E.
