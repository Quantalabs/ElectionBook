Soon, however, Chicago police released surveillance images of the supposed perpetrators, identifying the men as Nigerian American brothers who worked as extras on Smollett's show \"Empire.\" Evidence that Smollett had orchestrated the attack and paid the brothers $3,500 later surfaced.\nSmollett was initially indicted on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct, but the charges were dropped. A year later, Smollett was re-indicted, and after a high-profile trial in 2021, the actor was convicted on five felony counts of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to 30 months probation, including 150 days in jail, plus fines totaling more than USD 120,000, Variety mentioned. In 2024, the conviction was reversed on procedural grounds, as the Illinois Supreme Court found that the re-prosecution violated due process. In 2025, Smollett settled with the city of Chicago, and he continues to deny that he staged the attack.\nThe project comes from All3Media-owned production company Raw, which is behind two of Netflix's weirder true-crime tales in The Tinder Swindler and Don't F**k with Cats.

When the deal was announced earlier this month, it said that it has “no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement.”\n\nRelated Stories\n\nCritic's Notebook: Ozzy Osbourne Created the Template for Reality TV Celebrity Reinvention, From Flavor Flav to Donald Trump\n\nHouse Republicans Vote to Rename Kennedy Center Opera House After Melania Trump\n\nAlso on Tuesday: Lawyers for Trump and Paramount formalized the deal, with both sides moving to dismiss the lawsuit. The filing didn’t include details of the settlement unlike when ABC News reached an agreement to resolve a lawsuit from Trump over comments from Good Morning America and This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos. Per court documents, the two sides in that case explicitly laid out the terms of the deal, including timing of the payments.\n\nThere’s not obligation to publicly disclose the details of a settlement, though the widespread belief that Paramount would settle what was widely believed to be a frivolous lawsuit to open a pathway to regulatory approval of its merger with Skydance necessitated some degree of transparency on what the agreement looked like. Those details came directly from the company when the deal was announced close to midnight on July 1 rather than court fillings.\n\nWhether a party that’s not formally a part of the litigation can participate in a settlement will be questioned. The Paramount-Skydance merger has not officially been greenlit. It’s unknown whether the deal Trump announced is actually a part of his settlement with Paramount.\n\nRather, Trump’s characterization of the deal could hint at expected concessions new Paramount will have to make for the FCC to approve the transfer of the company’s broadcast licenses to Skydance. Talks are already underway, with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its Hollywood Local 399 and the conservative public interest group the Center for American Rights playing a prominent part. The latter group has called for increased viewpoint diversity, meaning more promotion of conservative perspectives. Also in play: more ideological diversity on the company’s board of directors and a requirement that CBS have an “independent, well funded, empowered, balanced ombudsman or oversight board” that would monitor for bias. David Ellison has recently held talks about acquiring The Free Press, the online publication cofounded by Bari Weiss, reported The New York Times.\n\nThere’s already legal blowback, with more expected down the road. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has sent to Paramount a demand for information related to its decision to settle, with plans to file a lawsuit on behalf of investors against controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and the board. Related are potential investigations by lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders into whether Paramount violated anti-bribery laws, though there’s skepticism about how those legal actions will fare absent a smoking a gun.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nNiche Sports Aren’t So Niche Anymore As Networks Place More Bets\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nDoes Patrick Soon-Shiong Want to Turn the L.A.

ABC News’s settlement came after Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, claiming that his “reputation was besmirched” by Stephanopoulos during an interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC).\n\nDuring that interview, Stephanopoulos claimed that judges and two juries found Trump “liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape” in the case against E.

Only a week before, on the right-wing podcast “The Benny Show,” he had said, “It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.” This week, he changed his tune, and at a press conference, he said, “We need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing.” He allowed that should there be a “neccesary or appropriate” need for further congressional action, he would look at it. But then said emphatically, “I don’t think we’re at that point yet, because we agree with the president.”\n\nIt’s impossible to truly know what prompted Johnson’s about-face, but it’s worth noting that he has long been connected to the New Apostolic Reformation, a charismatic evangelical movement that teaches that Christians are called to take “dominion” over all aspects of society, including the government. Johnson has publicly acknowledged that NAR has had a “profound influence” on his life, according to a report issued by the Congressional Freethought Caucus last year.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that arguably the most influential and visible NAR leader, a Texas business strategist named Lance Wallnau, has been outspoken in recent weeks in his defense of Trump on the Epstein issue. On July 14, Wallnau told his 100,000 YouTube followers that he believed that Trump was acting in the best interest of the country by not releasing the files. Wallnau’s line of reasoning began with his suggestion that both the assassination of JFK and the assassination attempt on Trump last year in Butler, Pennsylvania, were inside jobs. He went on to describe Trump’s critics on the left as “demonic” people who “smell disunity” in MAGA and are using the infighting as an opportunity to tarnish Trump’s reputation. “I think they would be willing to plant information and evidence and create false trails, all kinds of booby traps,” he said.\n\nAmong Wallnau’s followers are some powerful people. As I reported last year, Wallnau has forged strong connections with GOP leaders—for example, he hosted a Pennsylvania campaign event for JD Vance last September. He also helped develop Project 19, a right-wing political initiative to win 19 key counties in swing states for Trump. Wallnau has called Kamala Harris a “Jezebel” and speculated that people on the political left may be controlled by demons.\n\nAnother prominent Christian nationalist influencer, Texas pastor Joel Webbon, has also arrived at a belief in Trump’s innocence—but from a different perspective. Webbon isn’t connected with the NAR like Johnson and Wallnau—instead, he’s a member of the TheoBros, a network of Christian nationalist millennial influencers. Many of them believe that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote, and that the Ten Commandments should replace the US Constitution. Like NAR, the TheoBros are also well-connected to Republican politicians. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth attends a TheoBros-aligned church, and Vance has socialized with members of the movement, as well.\n\nLast week, Webbon devoted an episode of his YouTube show, which has 123,000 followers, to the Epstein files. His guest was Scott Horton, a libertarian podcaster and staunch critic of the left-wing government “deep state” that Trump has consistently blamed for all of America’s ills. In the episode, Horton asserted that he didn’t believe that Trump would be implicated in the Epstein files. Moreover, he argued that Epstein was a foreign asset, likely working with the Israeli national intelligence agency Mossad to entrap Trump. \n\nHe’s not alone in believing this particular conspiracy theory; it was also put forth by right-wing broadcaster Tucker Carlson, who also hosted Horton on his show. “This isn’t just like, ‘oh my goodness, maybe we had somebody working with Israeli intelligence that was blackmailing politicians here in America,'” said Webbon. “The reality is that [US-Israeli relations have] been a toxic relationship stretching back decades.” He added, “This is becoming a massive problem that people are noticing, as the kids say.” The latter was an allusion to the antisemitic trope of “noticing,” a phrase that refers to people taking note of the fact that a powerful person is Jewish. \n\nA link between Epstein, who was Jewish, and Mossad fed neatly into Webbon’s preexisting biases. He has routinely expressed antisemitic views on social media. Last November, he posted on X, “I hate Judaism but love Jews and wish them a very pleasant conversion to Christianity.” In a podcast episode, he called Judaism a “parasitical” religion. “What it has done historically throughout the ages is typically go into other countries, other peoples with other religions, and kind of cozy up but not really for their benefit—not a mutually beneficial relationship, but where they ultimately get far more out of the deal than the Christian nation does.” In an email to Mother Jones last year, Webbon said he stands by “everything I’ve said about Judaism. It is a pernicious evil.” \n\nMeanwhile, some other evangelicals—though not Trump supporters— are pushing for the administration to release the files. Last week, Christianity Today editor-in-chief Russell Moore penned an op-ed in his magazine titled “Why We Want to See the Epstein Files.” The main reason was that “we want justice done,” he wrote. “We want to believe that our institutions—even in the present crises of credibility that most are going through—are not wholly corrupt.”","summary":"On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, in a departure from his previous calls for transparency, announced that he would not ask for a vote on whether the files pertaining to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein should be released.

More Sept. 22, 2015.\nCBS via Getty Images\n\nTrump said on Truth Social he “just achieved a BIG AND IMPORTANT WIN in our Historic Lawsuit against 60 Minutes,” confirming Paramount paid its previously announced $16 million settlement.\n\nTrump sued Paramount over “60 Minutes” and its interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, as Trump alleged CBS deceptively edited the interview to boost Harris, and the president announced earlier in July that the parties had reached a multimillion-dollar settlement.\n\nMost legal experts said Trump’s suit against CBS had little merit, but it was seen as a way for CBS to help secure approval from Trump’s FCC for CBS’ owner Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media.\n\nThe president suggested there could also be more money coming his way from Paramount after the company completes its planned merger with Skydance Media, saying Tuesday he “anticipate[s] receiving $20 Million Dollars more from the new Owners.”\n\nTrump said the $20 million would be “in Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming,” and while it’s unclear if that additional $20 million payment would be part of the original settlement, the president’s statement follows reports that Paramount could compensate Trump through advertisements “in support of conservative causes,” which had been valued at a lower $16 million.\n\nCBS has not yet responded to a request for comment, but Paramount previously denied reports that the company could compensate Trump via advertising, telling The Washington Post it “has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump.”\n\nTrump’s post comes days after CBS abruptly announced it was canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” the network’s flagship late-night program that’s been on the air for more than three decades, first with original host David Letterman and then Colbert. CBS has publicly stated the decision was made for purely financial reasons, with reports suggesting the program was losing $40 million to $50 million annually, but the timing of the announcement has raised widespread speculation, given Colbert’s frequent criticism of Trump. The announcement also came days after Colbert publicly railed against the network’s settlement with the president, describing the $16 million settlement as a “big fat bribe.” “I don’t know if anything, anything will repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said last week on his show. “But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.” The Writers Guild of America, which represents the show’s writers, has called for an investigation into the reasons behind the show’s cancellation.\n\nChief Critic\n\n“Are we still supposed to believe that canceling Colbert's show on CBS was ‘purely a financial decision’?” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on X on Tuesday in response to Trump’s Truth Social post, asking Skydance if Trump’s claim about receiving an extra $20 million is true. “This reeks of corruption.”\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump has long railed against the mainstream media, which he has decried as “fake news,” but the CBS settlement is part of a broader recent trend of news outlets and other major organizations reaching deals with the president rather than fighting his legal complaints in court. ABC News also garnered scrutiny for reaching a $15 million settlement with Trump in a lawsuit over comments made by host George Stephanopoulos, while multiple legal firms have made deals with the Trump administration in order to avoid executive orders targeting them. The $16 million CBS settlement and other payouts are being directed toward Trump’s presidential library, which a CBS’ own analysis found has already received approximately $63 million in funding through settlements with Paramount, ABC News, Meta and X.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesTrump’s War With The Media: Paramount Settles With Trump Over Kamala Harris InterviewBy Sara DornForbesParamount Agrees To Pay $16 Million To Settle Trump’s ‘60 Minutes’ Interview LawsuitBy Siladitya RayForbes‘The Gloves Are Off’: Stephen Colbert Tells Trump ‘Go F— Yourself’ After Show CanceledBy Siladitya Ray\n\nGot a tip?

But the exact impact of the tax cut, including exactly which jobs would qualify, and how much it would affect those workers’ paychecks, is still unclear.\n\nWe asked accountants, tax lawyers and others to tell us how the change will likely affect Maine’s hospitality workers. The bill was signed into law on July 4, so the specific rules and regulations governing it have not yet been issued. They’re expected within 90 days, said Hanna Wurgaft, an employment and labor law attorney at Brann & Isaacson.\n\nIn a statement, Nate Cloutier, government affairs director of HospitalityMaine, said, “For the next four years, servers and bartenders will be able to deduct (up to) $25,000 of their tips from federal taxes, while hourly employees benefit from a $12,500 deduction for premium overtime pay. This recognition puts more money back in the pockets of hard-working staff and could help restaurants and other hospitality businesses across Maine attract and retain the talent they need.”\n\nThe Maine minimum direct wage for tipped workers is currently $7.33 per hour. If tipped employees direct wage combined with their tips do not add up to the state’s standard minimum wage of $14.65 per hour, by law the restaurant must make up the difference, guaranteeing servers earn at least minimum wage. Maine cities may set their own minimum wage higher than the state does, in which case the tipped worker is owed the higher wage. In Portland, for instance, the minimum hourly wage for tipped workers is $7.75 and the city’s standard minimum wage is $15.50.\n\nIn his most recent paycheck, Rob Roy, longtime bar manager at Primo Restaurant in Rockland, said that 70% of his earnings had come from tips. “Tips are a huge part of our income.”\n\nWho is affected by the law? \n\nThe new legislation applies to workers who “customarily and regularly” receive tips, including people who serve food or beverages, as well as barbers, manicurists and estheticians. That said, the IRS has not yet released an official list of qualifying occupations. Given the importance of the restaurant industry in Maine, and the constant debate about tips, we’re focusing on restaurant employees.\n\nIn 2024, Maine had an estimated 8,500 wait staff and 3,100 bartenders, “many more than that in summer and fewer in winter, obviously,” said Glenn Mills, deputy director at the Center for Workforce Research at the Maine Department of Labor. \n\nWhat does the new law do?\n\nUntil now, the IRS has treated tips and wages identically. The new law allows “qualified” individuals to take a $25,000 deduction from the portion of their income that is earned in tips, which lowers their annual tax liability.\n\nAllen Braddock, corporate tax attorney at Pierce Atwood, compared it to deductions for retirement savings accounts, such as 401ks and Roth IRAs.\n\nTake, for example, a tipped worker whose total income is $50,000, including $25,000 in tips. The new law means the worker could deduct the $25,000 in qualified tips from gross income, and would pay federal income tax only on the remaining $25,000 of income. At a 12% rate, that would result in federal tax savings of $3,000.\n\nThe deduction phases out for individual tax filers if they earn more than $150,000 in combined direct and tipped wages from a serving job and any other job (or $300,000 total for joint filers). The deduction for a waiter earning above these amounts would decrease by $100 for every $1,000 earned over $150,000.\n\nMaine’s Department of Labor could not say whether any Maine waiters, bartenders or baristas earn over $150,000 per year. The deduction disappears entirely for a single server with total income of at least $275,000.\n\nDoes the law affect state and local taxes? \n\nNo. The deduction only applies to federal income taxes. Tipped employees must continue to pay FICA taxes to cover Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen does the law take effect? \n\nIt is retroactive to, Jan. 1, 2025, and ends on Dec. 31, 2028. According to experts, tax breaks commonly sunset after 10 years. Part of the impetus for the bill, was to make permanent the otherwise soon-to-expire tax cuts that Trump passed in his first term in office.\n\nIs it unusual for a tax regulation to target a particular employment sector? \n\n“You’re putting your finger on the political issue, right? This was a kind of a pandering political play, right? to seemingly address folks that are ostensibly making low wages,” said Bill Sheils, an attorney at Perkins Thompson who chairs the firm’s employment group.\n\nIt was widely reported during the presidential campaign that both candidates endorsed the no tax on tips policy as a way to win over voters in the swing state of Nevada, many of whom work in the hospitality sector.\n\n“I don’t want to lapse into the political here, but it is little unusual. Usually (tax breaks) would be home ownership, things like that, as opposed to specific classes of workers.”\n\nBraddock agreed. “Traditionally, you haven’t seen exemptions for certain types of ordinary income like this. It does it raise a question of a certain type of fairness.”\n\nAccountants at the Portland-based office of Baker Newman Noyes, who answered questions by email, added that “some modest” credits are given in the U.S. tax code to, for instance, educators and public safety personnel. But “it is far more common for Congress to provide benefits to employers,” they wrote. “This is so because tax code is not used simply to raise money; it is used to encourage social goals, and breaks are provided to employers to encourage them to hire employees in specific classes, like veterans, or those with a disability or criminal background.”\n\nAre back-of-the-house workers, like cooks and dishwashers, eligible? \n\nIt’s not yet clear. The new law does include “tips received under any tip-sharing arrangement.” In June 2023, Maine amended its state law to allow back-of-the-house workers to be included in tip-sharing pools. But the new federal law says that taxpayers may take this tax break only if they were receiving tips “on or before December 31, 2024.” If a Maine restaurant, bar or coffee shop was not sharing tips with the back of the house by then, it cannot change its policy now so that workers are eligible.\n\n“I would say that Maine restaurants should tread carefully and consult with counsel before changing tip-sharing or tip pool agreements,” Wurgaft wrote in an email. “Whether wages earned by back-of-house workers under new tip pools will qualify for the tax deduction is arguably an open question.”\n\nNeither HospitalityMaine nor the state’s Department of Labor has data on how many restaurants in Maine pool tips between the front and back of house. But according to data from the labor department, Maine bartenders (average wage: $26.76 per hour) and Maine servers (average wage $25.19 per hour), make more than any other job categories in food service, except for the head chef. The average wage for a cook is $21.31 per hour, and for a dishwasher, $16.85.\n\n“I’m wondering what it’s going to be like in many restaurants,” Roy said. “Unless you’re in the perfect restaurant, there’s always a rift between the two. (Cooks) almost always make less money than our incentivized positions. The one thing that bugs me about this (legislation) is it really doesn’t benefit them as much.”\n\nHe added that the overtime provision of the bill could benefit cooks. In his two decades in Maine’s restaurant industry, he’s said that he’s observed cooks often work overtime. “So they’re getting a little bit of that,” Roy said, “but I’m wondering about the culture change in restaurants as it goes forward.”\n\nWhat about mandatory service charges, such as gratuities for large parties or ‘kitchen wellness charges’? \n\nSuch fees do not qualify for the new tax break. The law specifies that tips must be “paid voluntarily.”\n\nWhen will tipped workers see this savings?\n\nNext year, when they file their 2025 tax returns. “It’s not something people are going to feel this week or in three months or six months necessarily,” Wurgaft said.\n\n“It hasn’t been much of a conversation in our place,” said Denae Mallari, operator and co-owner of Sinful Kitchen in Portland. “I feel like maybe people are waiting and trying to figure out, how does this really pertain to me?”\n\nWhat is the impact on an ordinary server?\n\nIt could vary widely. The amount of the deduction is based on a person’s overall income: A married server who files jointly is affected by his spouse’s income, and a barista with a second job in another industry needs to count those wages, too, in her overall gross income.\n\n“The law provides for the deduction, up to $25,000 in tips. But as a practical matter, that person working at the high-end restaurant, they may be making close to 150 grand if the tips are good, right? So they get to enjoy the benefit of this and they could exhaust their full $25,000 deduction,” Sheils said. “Meanwhile, the kid at the coffee shop isn’t going to come close to being able to claim 25 grand in tips.”\n\nWurgaft said the tax break will have less impact on the lowest earners as they may not have much, if any, federal tax liability in the first place. Possibly they are not earning enough to owe federal taxes — think of a college student with a summer job at a seasonal spot in Old Orchard Beach. Or perhaps other deductions they receive, for instance, child tax credits, mean they already owe no federal taxes.\n\n“I’m not an economist, but using that $25,000 number as the cap, depending on how much a person makes in a year, it may or may not be a significant change,” she said.\n\n“As far as tax cuts go, this focuses on a group of people that across the country don’t make a huge amount of money,” Roy said. “We’re not business people. We’re not lawyers. And I think it only lasts three years or so, so personally I’m seeing it as a nice little stimulus to me and those in in my profession.”\n\nHow will this tax break affect servers who don’t declare their tips? \n\nThere’s often an assumption that servers underreport their tips to avoid paying taxes. But customers pay 95% of tips today on credit cards, said Jared Dinsmore, co-owner of Lucky Cheetah and Bird & Co., both in Portland, making it difficult for servers to avoid reporting their full income. “As we all know, it’s illegal to not pay taxes on any wages, whether they be wages or tips,” Dinsmore added.\n\nWill restaurants need to make payroll changes?\n\nBoth hourly wages and tips are already listed separately on servers’ W-2 forms.\n\nThe change is so recent, Mallari said, her payroll company hasn’t yet been in touch with guidance. She herself has “just been kind of waiting. I’ve just been kind of holding steady and seeing how it plays out. I’m assuming it won’t change how I do things.”\n\n“There’s no change that I’m aware of that the restaurant owner, the employer, needs to make. They just keep doing their thing,” Sheils said.\n\nCould diners be inclined to tip less if they know that servers are getting a tax break? \n\nThe tax deduction won’t have much impact on what diners tip, predicted Erin Percival Carter, an associate professor of marketing at Maine Business School at the University of Maine, while cautioning that no research yet exists on this topic.\n\nA lot of research has been done, however, on how consumers react to taxes generally. The visibility, or “salience” of a tax is what most drives people’s behavior, she said. In this case, the tax impact is an unseen end-of-year tax break for servers so, “this is just not going to be very salient to most consumers,” she said.\n\n“The things that we know tend to drive tipping behavior are social norms, like what do people think other people think is the expected behavior here? I’m probably going to tip 20% because that’s the normal thing to do,” Carter said. She added that tipping is increasingly being done using electronic interfaces, which research also shows also strongly influences customer behavior. “There are buttons and you pick one of the buttons and you’re probably going to pick the middle button.\n\n“And then there are basic norms around reciprocity and gratitude and not wanting to feel guilty. I think all of those are going to be so much more salient and strong that this probably won’t have much of an effect.”","summary":"Experts weigh in on how this provision of President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' will work.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/07/22/how-will-trumps-tax-breaks-on-tips-affect-maine-workers/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/07/20230529_taoyuan_11.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 20:00:24","author":"Peggy Grodinsky","authors":["Peggy Grodinsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":344277712,"title":"'Go f--k yourself!': What Stephen Colbert and other late-night hosts had to say after Late Show cancellation","text":"There was a show of late-night solidarity on Monday night as The Late Show host Stephen Colbert's comrades rallied behind him after CBS said it was cancelling his program in 2026. \n\nThursday's announcement was met with shock as well as harsh criticism with many suggesting it was another concession to U.S. President Donald Trump by the network and its parent company, Paramount Global, over claims that its current affairs program 60 Minutes selectively edited an interview with his 2024 election rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nColbert has been highly critical of Trump for years and panned Paramount for agreeing to a $16-million US settlement with the president earlier this month over a lawsuit he brought against the company. The settlement came as a surprise to many legal experts, who saw the suit as having little chance of success in court.\n\nTrump said the settlement was paid to him Tuesday, though the money is to be allocated to his future presidential library.\n\nBoth CBS and Colbert announced the news of the Late Show's cancellation on Thursday, but Colbert took the opportunity in Monday night's opening monologue to question the motivation for the decision.\n\nHe joked that \"cancel culture had gone too far\" but said he could now share his \"unvarnished\" opinions of Trump. \n\n\"I don't care for him,\" Colbert joked about the president, who was a Late Show guest during his first election campaign in 2015, which was also Colbert's inaugural year on the program.\n\nThe host addressed his own \"blistering\" critique of the settlement, which he had made on air days before the cancellation was announced. Though he didn't explicitly tie the two events together, he questioned how it could possibly be a \"financial decision\" when his program was the top rated in the late-night category. (Although outlets such as the Wall Street Journal have pointed out that despite its high ratings, the show is no longer profitable.)\n\nColbert acknowledged the network's potential constraints — especially following the multimillion-dollar payout — but also mentioned how Trump, in a post on Truth Social, celebrated the show's cancellation.\n\n\"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,\" Trump wrote. \"His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the moron on NBC who ruined the once-great Tonight Show.\"\n\nColbert's response to Trump on Monday night: \"Go f--k yourself.\" \n\nStewart savages CBS, Trump\n\nAside from Colbert, The Daily Show's Jon Stewart had the harshest comments for CBS.\n\nHe admitted late-night TV was struggling: \"We're all basically operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside of a Tower Records,\" he joked. \n\nBut he said CBS \"lost the benefit of the doubt\" after the settlement, which others at the network and across the industry have criticized and tied to Paramount Global's pending merger with movie and TV studio Skydance, which needs the approval of the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\"Was this purely financial or maybe the path of least resistance to your $8-billion [US] merger?\" said Stewart, adding that Paramount Global also owns the network he works for, Comedy Central.\n\n\"But understand this. Truly, the shows that you now seek to cancel, censor and control — a not-insignificant portion of that $8-billion value came from those f--king shows,\" he said before leading a chorus of \"go f--k yourself\" aimed at companies, advertisers and law firms that \"bend the knee\" to Trump. \n\nA little love from Letterman?\n\nColbert first dipped his toes into the late-night waters alongside Stewart on The Daily Show from 1999 to 2005, before launching his own Comedy Central show, The Colbert Report, which ran for 10 years. He eventually landed his current gig after the original Late Show host, David Letterman, retired. \n\nThough Letterman has not made any official statement, he appeared to take a stance on Monday. \n\nA 20-minute video appeared on his YouTube channel, with a montage of clips featuring him mocking CBS on Late Show with David Letterman over the years. \n\nLetterman launched the venerable talk show in 1993, moving to CBS from NBC, where he had hosted Late Night with David Letterman, airing after The Tonight Show for 11 years.\n\nOver at NBC, Jimmy Fallon joked Monday night that he was still the host of The Tonight Show, \"at least for tonight.\" \n\nFallon applauded Colbert's run as Late Show host, but took a lighter tone, joking that boycotts could cause CBS to lose millions of viewers, as well as \"tens of hundreds watching on Paramount Plus.\" \n\nHost Jimmy Kimmel is currently on summer break from his show on ABC, although he reacted to the situation on Instagram last week, saying, \"F--k you and all your Sheldons CBS,\" referencing the character Sheldon Cooper on the CBS sitcoms The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon. \n\nColbert got no love, however, from one top-rated late-night (late-evening, really) host: Fox News Channel's Greg Gutfeld, whom Trump praised in his post celebrating the Colbert cancellation, and who hosts the show Gutfeld!\n\nGutfeld dismissed claims that Colbert was being censored, saying CBS is \"free to fire someone who's stinking up a market like they took a dump in the produce section.\" \n\nHe also touted that his show draws higher ratings than Colbert's (though this could also be because his show airs about an hour and a half before the major late-night programs).\n\nIt should come as little surprise that Gutfeld, a right-wing comedian and commentator, took swipes at Colbert, as Fox News Channel is generally favourable to Trump. \n\nBut as Stewart noted in his rant, Trump is also suing Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp owns both Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, over the latter publication's story about a letter the president purportedly wrote in 2003 to the now-deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.","summary":"","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/colbert-late-show-reaction-1.7590838?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7591082.1753204680!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-july-21.jpg?im=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 19:49:19","author":"Nick Logan","authors":["Nick Logan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":344235244,"title":"FCC chairman blasts 'partisan left's' reaction to 'DNC spokesperson' Stephen Colbert's cancellation","text":"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr shot back on Monday at left-wing celebrities and politicians decrying CBS canceling Stephen Colbert’s late-night show. \"The partisan left’s ritualist wailing and gnashing of teeth over Colbert is quite revealing.

CBS announced Thursday that it was canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and that the final episode will air in May 2026. The talk show’s cancellation led to widespread recriminations among progressive politicians, journalists, and celebrities. \"They just cut NPR and, you know, public broadcasting. Yes, they're trying to silence people, but that won't work. It won't work. We will just get louder,\" actress Jamie Lee Curtis told the Associated Press. STEPHEN COLBERT MOCKS HIS PARAMOUNT BOSSES FOR CONSIDERING 'SHADY' $50M TRUMP SETTLEMENT The Tiffany Network was widely accused, including by senators, of canceling Colbert for political reasons. CBS recently agreed to a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump after he accused the network of \"election interference\" over its editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The settlement came amid a pending merger with CBS parent company Paramount and Skydance, which requires administration approval. Colbert blasted the network for settling with Trump in what he deemed a \"nuisance lawsuit\" in a monologue on his show prior to being given the axe. \"Now I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It's big fat bribe,\" Colbert said. \"CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., posted on X. \"Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal, days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., posted on X. \"If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., wrote on X. CBS maintains that Colbert was canceled purely for financial reasons. Although the \"Late Show\" was regularly No. 1 in its timeslot among network television, the show lost $40 million a year in revenue. This is due, in part, to declining overall viewership among late-night shows. Colbert’s former Comedy Central colleague, Jon Stewart, cast doubt on the network’s explanation Monday.

Trump, for his part, relished in Colbert’s firing. \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired, his talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.

If this sounds like a repeat of the administration’s antics with MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, that’s because it is. We just haven’t reached the “deporting people based on their tattoos” or the “Donald Trump believing photoshopped tattoos are real” stages of attacks on Haitians yet—but give the administration time. \n\nRubio’s announcement was likely inevitable after the administration designated Viv Ansanm and another Haitian gang, Gran Grif, as foreign terrorist groups in May. Once the administration issued that designation, it was free to start deporting lawful permanent residents—also known as green card holders—whom it alleges support Viv Ansanm. \n\nWould you like to know how the administration plans to identify these individuals, or what exactly would constitute a deportable offense? Well, you can’t. While Rubio is big on bellicosity, he’s light on details so far. \n\nThis is all part of a larger deportation push against lawful immigrants. Not only is the administration carrying out a massive, mistake-ridden deportation campaign against supposed gang members, it’s also mid-trial over its attacks on pro-Palestinian students. In that push, the administration has frequently detained people for such nefarious crimes as writing op-eds critical of Israel, with Trump’s team claiming that counts as some sort of material support for Hamas. \n\nUnfortunately, it was inevitable that the deportation fervor would come for Haitians. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance spent the 2024 presidential campaign spewing horrifically racist lies about Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio, leading to dozens of bomb threats by Trump supporters. Vance even declared that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status, which gives legal status to immigrants from designated countries considered too dangerous to return to, were still not here legally.\n\n“If Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I’m still going to call them an illegal alien,” Vance said in North Carolina last September, despite that vice presidents are not responsible for TPS designations. But facts would ruin his flow. \n\nEarlier this year, Trump revoked a different program that granted temporary legal status, known as humanitarian parole, for Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. A lower court blocked the order, but no worries—the Supreme Court made sure to let Trump go ahead. \n\nRubio won’t say how many people the administration is planning on deporting under the rubric of this new gang panic. That lack of detail is no doubt deliberate since it gives the administration the flexibility to say that anyone it wants to deport are gang members, based on whatever things the administration declares signify gang membership. So expect some more photoshopped tattoos or something equally nonsensical. \n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to remove protections from Haitians is racist—and very dangerous for Haitians. Sending people back to Haiti poses a great risk, per Rubio’s own State Department, which advises Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the risks of kidnapping, terrorist activity, and civil unrest. \n\nGiven the humanitarian crisis in Haiti, the United Nations has even been begging the U.S. to stop deporting people to the nation. And speaking of the U.N., the U.S. in February also froze funding to the international security force combating armed gangs in Haiti, so it doesn’t seem like we care much about those gangs—save using them as a way to justify deportations. \n\nExpect the administration to do exactly what we’ve seen with allegations of support for Hamas or MS-13 or Tren de Aragua—an ever-expanding rationale that not just allows swift deportation action but also requires it. The administration is telling us this will keep us safe, but it’s actually what is putting us all in peril.","summary":"Another day, another breathless statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio about how he’s keeping us safe by forcibly deporting our friends and neighbors on the flimsiest of pretexts. \n\n\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration moved to strip permanent lawful status from Haitians it alleges are collaborating with Viv Ansanm, the gang controlling most of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince.

Thankfully, as we’ll see, co-host Tony Dokoupil provided a much-needed reality check.\n\nAfter closing the first hour’s Eye Opener with a slew of soundbites from Colbert and other liberal late-night hosts, co-host and Democrat donor Gayle King gushed that Colbert will “have lots of jobs and lots of offers” plus “lots of friends and people are really cheering him on.”\n\nCo-host Nate Burleson was also laudatory: “He seems like he’s dialing it up a little bit. Shoutout to Colbert.”\n\nFeatured co-host Vladimir Duthiers — whose wife is the Emmy Award-winner showrunner for another extremely partisan comedy show, HBO’s Last Week Tonight with John Oliver — took the assignment to celebrate Monday’s late-night group therapy sessions for liberals.\n\n“With 10 months left on the iconic Ed Sullivan Theater stage, Stephen Colbert wasted no time taking on a frequent target...making it clear that his attacks on President Donald Trump are here to stay until next May,” he began.\n\nHe then played more anti-Trump soundbites (click “expand”):\n\nCOLBERT [on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, 07/21/25]: I don’t care for him.\n\nDUTHIERS: That line may have been diplomatic, but it was his reaction to reading back the President’s Truth Social post where he relished CBS’s decision to cancel the show that was anything but.\n\nCOLBERT [on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, 07/21/25]: [IN TRUMP VOICE] “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.

Go [EXPLETIVE] yourself. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]\n\nDUTHIERS: The cancellation comes two weeks after Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement with Trump in which he alleged CBS News deceptively edited an interview with Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris before last year’s presidential election, an accusation Paramount has always said was completely without merit. Colbert fiercely criticized the settlement at the time.\n\nOLBERT [on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, 06/14/25]: Now, I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s big fat bribe.\n\nDUTHIERS: Paramount, the parent company of CBS said the decision to cancel the show was purely financial against a challenging backdrop in late night, but that decision continues to be sharply criticized. All while, Colbert’s talk show brethren sat in solidarity by lampooning the now infamous Coldplay jumbotron incident.\n\nCOLBERT [on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, 07/21/25]: I want to thank you so much for being here. You know, on my last show.\n\nWEIRD AL YANKOVIC [on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, 07/21/25]: Steve, you’re here for 10 more months.\n\nThe show returned to Colbert as part of their “What to Watch” block. Duthiers led off with the comical declaration that “the media world that is still reeling from the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and boasting of the “huge support from his fellow late night hosts.”\n\nHe cued up two clips of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart blasting CBS and, with a f-bomb, arguing The Daily Show and The Late Show have contributed to parent company Paramount’s $8 billion value and thus the latter shouldn’t be rewarded with what he saw as an act of censorship.\n\nIt was here that Duthiers dubbed these shows part of America’s “cultural Zeitgeist”:\n\nDokoupil gave a succinct counter to this, emphasizing both the largesse of the show and the previously ignored fact that late-night comedy shows are no longer unifying:\n\nKing summarily dismissed all that: “I hear you, but I think many people feel there is another way to do it. You know, it’s just — it’s a very difficult position to be in. But to disagree with something that a company is doing, but also still loving your job and loving what you do, I feel — I really feel for Stephen Colbert.”\n\nTo make sure he wasn’t celebrating people being laid off (or might be, in The Daily Show’s case), Dokoupil made clear he “feel[s] for the whole staff of both of those shows and whatever comes next for everybody.”\n\nAnd yet, the show had more to say. King closed the second hour’s “Eye Opener” by gushing of “Colbert’s late-night rivals gather[ing] with other stars in musical support over CBS’s controversial decision” and hyping it’ll “be an interesting 10 months.”\n\nCBS Mornings Plus also played the role of corporate stooge, down to reairing much of Duthiers’s piece from the first show.\n\nBack live afterward, Duthiers referenced the “very robust discussion about what this means on the 7:00 show and the political landscape has shifted, but certainly the economics have shifted when it comes to linear television and that is behind the decision here.”\n\nHe added he’s “a child and a student of television and so, there’s a certain nostalgia associated with these shows.”\n\nDokoupil added more welcome perspective. Conceding “it’s all I hear about from people on social media” and that “many things are true in this case,” he called out those who cut the cord:\n\n[P]eople keep complaining and it’s like, you moved out of town and then they closed the old park in town and they’re upset and it’s like, well, you left the tax base, right? You weren’t supporting the park, so the park shut down...If all — if all the people that are complaining about the cancellation were actually watching in a linear fashion, the money situation would be a whole different one.\n\nNBC’s Today was more of the same, minus the personal connection. Co-host Savannah Guthrie boasted in a tease of the “show of support” with “[s]tars and fellow late-night hosts make a surprise appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show in the wake of his cancellation by CBS...Straight ahead, how they came to rally behind Colbert.”\n\nCorrespondent and NBC News NOW host Joe Fryer was again given the task of shoveling this liberal drivel: “The tone was light, but they were there delivering a serious message of support. Overnight, a star-filled show of unity as Stephen Colbert reflected on last week’s stunning cancellation of The Late Show.”\n\nIn between a blow-by-blow of the celebrity cameos, Fryer touted Stewart “bash[ing] the decision, saying it’s politically motivated after Colbert criticized the Trump administration” plus Oliver, who told NBC it’s “heartbreaking” “many future comedy writers” won’t be “raised on Stephen has done.”\n\nStill not offering an ideological label to this entire industry, Fryer closed by throwing a bone to Paramount executives, saying they’ve maintained the cancellation wasn’t due to content.\n\nNBC’s 3rd Hour of Today followed CBS’s lead with resurrecting the voice-over portions of their report.\n\n“A parade of comedy legends and late-night hosts making a surprise appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following its sudden cancellation. All the laughs and highlights from a star-studded night,” co-host Al Roker boasted in a tease.\n\nTo see the relevant transcripts from July 22, click here (for CBS Mornings), here (for CBS Mornings Plus), here (for NBC’s Today), and here (for NBC’s 3rd Hour of Today).","summary":"Despite having already spent nearly 12 minutes (11:38) on Friday morning decrying the stunning news of CBS cancelling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in May 2026, CBS Mornings and NBC’s Today returned to do more pouting Tuesday about this show as one of many (far-left) late-night comedy as part of both media “institutions” and the “cultural Zeitgeist” as evidenced by Monday’s “star-filled show of unity.”\n\nThis time, they added eight minutes and five seconds to the pile (excluding teases and their third-hour editions) with CBS featuring not one, but two segments bemoaning this as though Colbert himself, not the show, had passed away.

In a three-hour, expletive-filled online interview with Andrew Callaghan of Channel 5, he directed ire toward actor and Democratic Party donor George Clooney for his decision to call on the elder Biden to abandon his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nHe also ranted against longtime Democratic advisers he accused of making money off the party and trading off previous electoral successes, but not helping candidates' current efforts.\n\nThe lengthy screed made plain the younger Biden's feelings that his father was mistreated by those around him in the waning days of his candidacy and administration. He also laid bare critiques of the party's operation and operatives that, he says, aren't well-serving its opposition to Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the moments in Hunter Biden's interview:\n\nHe blasted George Clooney\n\nHunter Biden spared no feelings in his assessment of the actor, questioning why anyone should listen to the “Ocean's Eleven” star.\n\nClooney supported Joe Biden’s bid for a second term, even headlining a record-setting fundraiser for the then-president, but changed his stance after Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024.\n\nClooney made his feelings known in an opinion piece in The New York Times, adding his voice to mounting calls for the then-81-year-old president to drop his presidential bid. Biden ended up leaving the race a few weeks later and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who went on to lose to Trump.\n\n“What right do you have to step on a man who’s given 52 years of his f——— life to the services of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out basically a full page ad in the f——— New York Times to undermine the president,” Hunter Biden said before he trailed off to talk about how Republicans are more unified than Democrats.\n\nLos Angeles-based representatives for Clooney did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nScreed against longtime Democratic advisers\n\nThere were also weighty critiques of a number of longtime Democratic advisers.\n\nAnita Dunn, a longtime Biden senior adviser, has made “$40 to $50 million” off of work for the Democratic Party, Hunter Biden said. James Carville, adviser to former President Bill Clinton, “hasn't run a race in 40 f——— years.”\n\nFormer Obama strategist David Axelrod, Hunter Biden said, “had one success in his political life, and that was Barack Obama — and that was because of Barack Obama.” Other former Obama aides who now host “Pod Save America,\" are “four white millionaires that are dining out on their association with Barack Obama from 16 years ago,” he said.\n\nOne of the four, Tommy Vietor, Monday on social media applauded Hunter Biden's decision “to process the election, look inward, and hold himself accountable for how his family’s insular, dare I say arrogant at times, approach to politics led to this catastrophic outcome we’re all now living with.”\n\nIn a message Tuesday, Axelrod told The Associated Press, “Never have the words ‘no comment’ felt more appropriate.” Dunn did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nBiden's debate performance and Ambien effects\n\nAs for the debate performance, the fallout from which ultimately led to the calls for his father to step down from the 2024 presidential campaign, Hunter Biden said his father may have been recovering from Ambien, a medication that he had been given to help him sleep following trips in the weeks before the debate to Europe, as well as the Los Angeles fundraiser at which Clooney said his interactions with Biden made him feel the president wasn't mentally capable.\n\n“He’s 81 years old, he’s tired as shit,” Hunter Biden said. “They give him Ambien to be able to sleep, and he gets up on the stage and he looks like he’s a deer in the headlights.”\n\nA spokesperson for Joe Biden declined to comment on the interview.\n\nAnother podcast with Jaime Harrison\n\nHunter Biden also appeared Monday in an episode of “At Our Table,” a new podcast hosted by former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison.\n\n“Yeah, Joe Biden did get old. He got old before our eyes. ... But you know what? A few changes does not mean that you do not have the mental capacity to be able to do your job.”\n\nIn that interview, Hunter Biden also talked about the calamitous presidential debate.\n\n“And then they saw him at that debate. It was awful, and it was truly horrible,” he said, saying he was opposed to holding it, given Trump's recent convictions on 34 felony charges in a New York hush money case.\n\nTo Harrison, Hunter Biden also addressed Clooney, saying, “I love George Clooney's movies, but I don't really give a s—- about what he thinks about who should be the nominee for the Democratic Party.”\n\nAsked by Harrison about his father's decision to quit the 2024 race, Hunter Biden said “I think that he could have won” but still made the right choice for Democrats broadly.\"\n\n“I know that it wasn't a mistake in that moment,” Hunter Biden said, adding that his father “chose to save the party” over saving himself.\n\nWhy are these podcasts coming out now?\n\nThe podcast drops come just days ahead of the expected beginning of court proceedings in a Los Angeles federal court.\n\nHunter Biden is suing Patrick Byrne, alleging that the former CEO of Overstock.com falsely claimed that Hunter Biden was reaching out to the Iranian government in the fall of 2021 and offering to have his father Joe Biden “unfreeze” $8 billion in Iranian funds “in return for $800 million being funneled into a numbered account for us.”\n\nIn the waning days of his administration, Joe Biden pardoned his son, sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\n\nThe Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move came weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before Trump returned to the White House.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden's son Hunter, seen by some as the problem child of the Democratic Party for legal and drug-related woes that brought negative attention to his father, is lashing out against Democratic 'elites' and others over the way he says his father was treated during last year's presi...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/562684/Hunter-Biden-lashes-out-at-George-Clooney-other-Democrats-over-Joe-Biden-s-2024-campaign","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/cp/2025/7/0eb723cb6d8e2adeeb43ad867524b1ba0b55e637c995f1c9bbfeff98abb51f5c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 19:19:00","author":"Meg Kinnard And,The Canadian Press","authors":["Meg Kinnard And","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":344235648,"title":"Billionaire LA Times owner announces he's taking the newspaper public","text":"Billionaire Los Angeles Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong announced on Monday that he would be taking the newspaper public sometime in the next year, calling it a move to democratize the paper. \"It&apos;s important for the paper to have the voices of all, and that&apos;s what I wanted to do, right?\" he said on \"The Daily Show.\" \"Whether you&apos;re right, left, Democrat, Republican, you&apos;re an American, so the opportunity for us to provide a paper that is the voices of the people, truly the voices of the people, so I&apos;m going to announce something to you tonight… we&apos;re literally going to take the L.A.

Trump has said he'd like to see Republicans gain five new seats from the process.Democrats are now responding by warning they could redraw Congressional lines in blue-leaning states. California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the state could retaliate, and Murphy has not ruled it out, he told reporters this week. These redistricting battles could have key implications for the midterms, when Democrats are hoping to win back a House majority.What To KnowMurphy said on Monday there are no current plans to alter New Jersey's district lines but that it is \"too early\" to make a definitive statement on the matter, reported The New Jersey Globe. He also said it could be a conversation for Democratic governors in upcoming meetings.\"I suspect as the Democratic governors get together for a drink or a coffee, this will be high on the agenda,\" he said.However, Democrats would have needed to have already started the process of changing the law if they wanted to redraw their boundaries by next November, Cassino said.\"Of course, this is Jersey, so the fact that something wouldn't be strictly legal hasn't always stopped folks from trying things in the past, but this would also require gutting the bi-partisan committee that redraws the districts, so it's not something that could be forced through easily or without a great deal of controversy,\" he said.It could also be risky to Democratic incumbents, he said.\"Moreover, while you could draw one more Dem-leaning district in the state, you could only do so by making some existing districts a lot more competitive: the exact opposite of what Democrats proposed in 2020, when they shored up Dem districts, at a cost of making one district more friendly to Republicans. That would be dangerous, if not in 2028, then in later elections, where it would leave Democrats vulnerable to a wave election,\" he said.Currently, Democrats hold nine of the state's 12 Congressional districts and are targeting New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, a battleground held by Republican Representative Tom Kean.Additionally, Democratic Representative Nellie Pou represents a Trump-won district based around Paterson, which was once a Democratic stronghold but shifted to the right last November. Democratic Representatives Herb Conaway, Josh Gottheimer, Frank Pallone and Mikie Sherrill all represent seats that former Vice President Kamala Harris won by a single-digit margin last November.Redistricting 'Arms Race' Ahead of MidtermsTexas Governor Greg Abbott called for a special session that began on Monday to address several topics of concern, including redistricting.Republicans are hoping to thwart losses in the midterms. Historically, the party in the White House loses seats during the midterms. In 2018, Democrats gained 41 seats to reclaim control of the House.Newsom responded to the news about Texas' redistricting in an X post earlier this month, writing, \"Two can play this game.\"However, California has an independent redistricting committee, passed by the state's voters in 2010, so it's not clear if the state could legally do so. Many Democratic-leaning states similarly have independent commissions, limiting the party's ability to respond to the move from Texas.There are other potential redraws in Ohio, where Republicans are hoping to make a few Democratic-held seats more conservative, and Utah, where Democrats are hoping to see a newly drawn Salt Lake City seat that would lean to the left.What People Are SayingDan Cassino told Newsweek: \"I don't think that there is going to be any serious attempt to redraw the districts before 2030, but I don't think any such attempt would make much of a difference in the gubernatorial election. These sort of process issues rarely resonate with New Jersey voters, and anyone who is paying attention right now is paying a lot more attention to the news out of Washington\"Lakshya Jain of Split Ticket wrote on X on Sunday: \"This is some of the most speculative cope I've seen. Democrats don't have a House majority in Minnesota right now and would likely require amendments in California, New York, New Jersey, and Washington.\"What Happens NextWith the Texas special session underway, blue states will continue exploring ways to counter the redraw effort. Any attempt to alter New Jersey's map faces significant legal barriers, however.","summary":"If New Jersey Democrats move to redraw the state's Congressional boundaries, they are likely to face legal challenges.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/phil-murphy-does-not-rule-out-new-jersey-redistricting-2102531","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2688165/new-jersey-governor-phil-murphy.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ec0ff7d845f34067770374f2b9c517d1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 18:50:02","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.648},{"id":344227774,"title":"Chabria: 3 things that should scare us about Trump's fake video of Obama","text":"On Sunday, our thoughtful and reserved president reposted on his Truth Social site a video generated by artificial intelligence that falsely showed former President Obama being arrested and imprisoned. There are those among you who think this is high humor; those among you who who find it as tiresome as it is offensive; and those among you blissfully unaware of the mental morass that is Truth Social. Whatever camp you fall into, the video crosses all demographics by being expected — just another crazy Trump stunt in a repetitive cycle of division and diversion so frequent it makes Groundhog Day seem fresh. Epstein who? But there are three reasons why this particular video — not made by the president but amplified to thousands — is worth noting, and maybe even worth fearing. First, it is flat-out racist. In it, Obama is ripped out of a chair in the Oval Office and forced onto his knees, almost bowing, to a laughing Trump. That imagery isn't hard to interpret: America's most esteemed Black man — who recently warned we are on the brink of losing democracy — forced into submission before our leader. The video comes as Trump claims that Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, has uncovered a “treasonous conspiracy in 2016” in which top Obama officials colluded with Russia to disrupt the election. Democrats say the claim is erroneous at best. If you are inclined to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, right before this scene of Obama forced to kneel, a meme of Pepe the Frog — an iconic image of the far-right and white supremacy — flashes on the screen. Not subtle. But also, not the first time racism has come straight from the White House. On Monday, the Rev. Amos Brown, pastor of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church and a student of Martin Luther King Jr., reminded me that not too long ago, then-President Woodrow Wilson screened the pro-KKK film \"The Birth of a Nation\" at the executive mansion. It was the first film screening ever held there, and its anti-Black viewpoint sparked controversy and protests. That was due in no small part to a truth that Hollywood knows well — fiction has great power to sway minds. Brown sees direct similarities in how Wilson amplified fictional anti-Blackness then, and how Trump is doing so now, both for political gain. \"Mr. Trump should realize that Obama hasn't done anything to him. But just the idea, the thought of a Black person being human, is a threat to him and his supporters,\" Brown told me. Brown said he's praying for the president to \"stop this bigotry\" and see the error of his ways. I'll pray the great gods give the reverend good luck on that. But, on the earthly plane, Brown said that \"the more things change, the more they remain the same.\" Trump courted the Black vote and has his supporters among people of all colors and ethnicities, but he's also played on racist tropes for political success, from stoking fear around the Central Park Five, now known as the Exonerated Five, decades ago to stoking fear around Black immigrants eating cats and dogs in Ohio during the recent election. It's an old playbook, because it works. Reposting the image of Obama on his knees is scary because it's a harsh reminder that racism is no longer an undercurrent in our society, if it ever was. It's a motivator and a power to be openly wielded — just the way Wilson did back in 1915. But the differences in media from back in the day to now are what should raise our second fear around this video. A fictional film is one thing. An AI-generated video that for many people seems to depict reality is a whole new level of, well, reality. The fear of deepfakes in politics is not new. It's a global problem, and in fairness, this isn't the first time (by far) Trump or other politicians have used deepfakes. Trump last year reposted an image of Taylor Swift endorsing him (which never happened). Also last year, during the election and the height of the Elon Musk-Trump bromance, the billionaire posted a fake photo of political challenger Kamala Harris dressed in what looked like a communist military uniform. Trump himself has not been immune. In 2023, Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, said he was toying with an AI tool and created images of Trump being arrested, never thinking it would go viral (especially since one image gave Trump three legs). Of course it did, and millions of people looked at these fake pictures, at least some assuming they were real. The list of deepfake political examples is long and ominous. Which brings us to the third reason Trump's latest use of one is unsettling. He clearly sees the effectiveness of manipulating race and reality to increase his own power and further his own agenda. Obama on his knees strikes a chord all too close to the image of Latino Sen. Alex Padilla being taken to the floor by federal authorities a few weeks ago during a news conference. It bears chilling resemblance to the thousands of images flooding us daily of immigrants being taken down and detained by immigration officers in often violent fashion. Videos like this one of Obama are the normalizing, the mockery, the celebration of the erosion of civil rights and violence we are currently seeing being aimed at Black, brown and vulnerable Americans. There is nothing innocent or unplanned about these kinds of videos. They are a political weapon being used for a purpose. Because when repetition dulls our shock of them, how long before we are no longer shocked by real images of real arrests?","summary":"The president is known for his prolific posting of misinformation and disinformation.

She alleges that this operation was intended to “subvert the will of the American people.”“No matter how powerful, every person involved must be prosecuted,” Gabbard wrote on X. “We are turning over all documents to DOJ for immediate action.”Trump responded by praising Gabbard, calling her findings “irrefutable proof” and labeling Obama the “ringleader” behind what he dubbed “the crime of the century.”Obama’s guilty of treasonDuring an Oval Office press conference with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday, Trump pointed directly at his predecessor:“If you read the papers, Obama started it. He orchestrated it. Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, they were all in the room. This was treason,” Trump declared. “Barack Hussein Obama, have you heard of him? Guilty. It’s not a question anymore.”\"They tried to rig the election, and they got caught. Then they rigged the election in 2020. I knew I won that election by a landslide. I did it for the third time and won by a huge margin. Every swing state was won by votes. But I won just the same in 2020. And look at the damage that was done,\" the US president said.The president added that “thousands” of additional documents would soon be released, allegedly supporting his claims.Legal experts, however, note that no formal charges have been filed against Obama, nor has the DOJ confirmed any active investigation into the former president.The AI video quickly went viral, with “Arrest Obama” trending on X and public debate erupting over the ethical limits of synthetic media in politics. Media watchdogs and fact-checkers were quick to label the video as manipulated content, warning of its potential to shape public opinion dangerously.“This deepfake is political disinformation at its worst,” said Nina Jankowicz, disinformation analyst and former executive director of the US Disinformation Governance Board. “It erodes public trust, damages reputations, and poses serious threats to democratic stability.”Platforms like Meta, X, and YouTube have pledged to flag or remove synthetic content that misleads voters, but enforcement remains inconsistent.Despite Trump’s insistence on guilt, legal scholars across the board confirm that no charges have been brought against Barack Obama, and the material cited by Gabbard has yet to undergo public or legal vetting.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onKamala HarrisJoe BidenDonald TrumpBarack ObamaObama treason allegationsTulsi GabbardFBI arrest video ObamaTruth Social videopolitical disinformation\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The moment she sat down, Oh declared that she had something to say before their interview began.\n\n “Can I just start by saying something that I feel like probably everyone here and everyone who is so supportive outside wants to say — that I am so sorry and saddened and properly outraged for the cancellation of late night here,” the Smurfs star said to host Stephen Colbert, garnering applause from the live audience. “Not only for yourself and for this entire family who are here, but for what it means for what it is of where we are in our culture and what it means for free speech.”\n\n “So I just want to say sorry, and also if I can have your hand, to CBS and Paramount, a plague on both of your houses,” she continued, holding Colbert's hand in hers. \n\n He then interjected to note, “I am very grateful,” but Oh said she had one more thing to add. “And also a pox on all those they serve,” she said.\n\n “That’s very nice of you to say,” Colbert, 61, replied. “Very kind.”\n\n Oh isn’t the first celebrity to speak out after the announcement that The Late Show will be ending in May 2026 after 10 seasons. \n\n While the network said it was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” many speculated there was another reason.\n\n The cancellation came just three days after Colbert criticized CBS’ parent company, Paramount, over its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump after he alleged that CBS News’ 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount is seeking a merger with Skydance, which requires approval from Trump’s administration.\n\n Like Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, the host of Jimmy Kimmel Live, has been a vocal critic of Trump’s administration and Trump even predicted Kimmel, 57, would have his show canceled next. In response to Colbert's cancellation news, Kimmel reacted in an Instagram post, writing, “Love you Stephen. F— you and all your Sheldons CBS.”\n\n The Tonight Show’s Jimmy Fallon also took to social media to share his reaction.\n\n \"I'm just as shocked as everyone. Stephen is one of the sharpest, funniest hosts to ever do it,\" Fallon, whom Trump referred to as “the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show,” wrote on Instagram on July 17. \"I really thought I'd ride this out with him for years to come. I'm sad that my family and friends will need a new show to watch every night at 11:30. But honestly, he's really been a gentleman and a true friend over the years — going back to The Colbert Report, and I'm sure whatever he does next will be just as brilliant.\"\n\n Jon Stewart commented on the role politics plays in late night television. \n\n On the July 21 episode of The Daily Show, Stewart shared his thoughts on the impact that Colbert's comments about Trump had on the cancellation.\n\n “I understand the corporate fear,\" he said. \"I understand the fear that you and your advertisers have with $8 billion at stake, but understand this, truly, the shows that you now seek to cancel, censor and control, a not insignificant portion of that $8 billion value came from those f------ shows. That’s what made you that money.\"\n\n “Shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid,\" Stewart continued. \"Believe me, this is not a ‘We speak truth to power’. We don’t; we speak opinions to television cameras, but we try. We f------ try every night. If you believe as corporations or as networks, you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king’s radar, [firstly] why will anyone watch you and you are f------ wrong.”\n\n Colbert kicked off the July 21 episode of his show by reading Trump's July 18 Truth Social post celebrating his cancellation. \n\n “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,\" Trump wrote on the platform.\n\n \"How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?” Colbert responded before turning to appear in an on-screen frame that said “Eloquence Cam” and telling the camera, \"Go f--- yourself.”\n\n The audience broke out in cheers and chanted, “Stephen! Stephen! Stephen!”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Colbert’s tenure on The Late Show will end its 10-year run in May 2026.

That’s a 35 percent drop from the previous quarter alone,” the outlet said on Tuesday, noting it happened amid “regulatory upheaval” and “tariff pressure.”\n\nGM has been trying to win over President Donald Trump’s administration even though some of the company’s initiatives that include trying to keep EV mandates and subsidies do not align with his agenda, Breitbart News reported in June.\n\n“When Trump first announced tariffs on imported cars to the United States market, GM CEO Mary Barra jumped to seemingly support the tariffs despite the automaker importing millions of foreign-made cars every few years,” the article said.\n\nRepublicans recently passed Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” that cut consumer subsidies for EVs and changed corporate fuel economy targets, per the Mail report.\n\nHowever, Barra has held on to the company’s EV strategy, reportedly telling shareholders in a recent letter that the company is growing in EVs because people love what they have to offer.\n\n“Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our north star,” Barra said.\n\nIn 2024, Barra remained committed to taking the company fully electric by 2035 even though third-quarter earnings showed EVs were not profitable, according to Breitbart News:\n\n“That is the plan we’re still executing,” Barra told the New York Times of GM’s plans to fully transition to EVs by 2035 regardless of who is in the White House.\nBarra first made the commitment in 2021 after President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office. The commitment, though, has not made EVs any more profitable.\n\nMeanwhile, GM recently announced plans to expand production of gas-powered vehicles in Michigan.\n\n“While GM has seen a surge in EV sales recently, overall customer demand for EVs has not met expectations,” the Breitbart News article said.","summary":"General Motors (GM) has experienced a dive in profits, the news coming as its leadership continues touting electric vehicles (EV).\n\n\nThe post General Motors&#8217; Profits Drop 35 Percent as CEO Clings to EV Strategy appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/07/22/general-motors-profits-drop-35-percent-as-ceo-clings-to-ev-strategy/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/10/GettyImages-2147840445-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 17:47:17","author":"Amy Furr","authors":["Amy Furr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":344250576,"title":"Jeff Daniels issues pointed seven-word message for Trump voters","text":"Actor Jeff Daniels has again lashed out at President Donald Trump’s supporters, this time with a seven-word message.\n\nThe 70-year-old Emmy-winning actor, who on numerous occasions has criticized Trump and the GOP, spoke to MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace on the latest episode of her The Best People podcast about the current political climate under the Trump administration, including tariffs and the state of the Republican party.\n\n“When Mitch [McConnell] started stacking the courts 25 years ago, I said it on your show once, they can see it coming,” Daniels told the host. “And Mitch and company could see it coming. They were going to be the minority, so they just started and then here we are, and now you got it.”\n\nIssuing a pointed seven-word message to Trump supporters “who thought this would be ok,” Daniels said: “I hope you’re losing tons of money.”\n\nWallace responded in agreement. “I mean, the tariffs are going to hurt your neighbors.”\n\nDaniels further concurred, saying: “Which I think, at the end of the day, that’s what’s going to do it. ‘Wait a minute, the grocery bill is what? $180 more? I can’t get that car that we have to have unless I pay another $8,000. What? Who do I blame for that? Who do I see about that?’ One person.”\n\nWhen approached for comment, White House Spokesman Kush Desai told The Independent: “Wow, another washed up, out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown is wishing harm on everyday Americans because they disagree with his opinions. Unfortunately for Jeff and fortunately for the American people, under President Trump bond and stock markets are rallying, Joe Biden’s inflation crisis is over, and real wages are rising.”\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Wallace opined that America has experienced a “loss” in decency over the desire for more affordable goods.\n\n“Well, I think at the end of the day it would be about just the price of eggs, did it go up or down, because that’s what he told me he was going to lower the price of eggs or my grocery bill,” The Newsroom alum replied, branding the president a “snake oil salesman.”\n\nDaniels also lamented Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 presidential election, admitting he still thinks about her and how “she would have been a good choice. I don’t care what they say, because she would have done what [Abraham] Lincoln did.”\n\nExplaining how exactly he thought the former Vice President would have governed like Lincoln, Daniels said Lincoln “surrounded himself with the people who would disagree with him, not the people who would, you know, take a knee and go, ‘Yeah, more tariffs, sir, more.’”\n\nDaniels shot to fame for his leading role in 1994’s cult classic comedy, Dumb and Dumber, and its 2014 sequel, Dumb and Dumber To. He’s additionally featured in the beloved family comedy Because of Winn-Dixie (2005), George Clooney’s 2005 political drama, Good Night, and Good Luck, and 2016’s Allegiant, the final film in the Divergent dystopian trilogy. \n\nBesides film, he’s also starred in numerous TV shows, including HBO’s The Newsroom, The Looming Tower, and Godless.

They were going to be the minority, so they just started and then here we are, and now you got it.”\n\nIssuing a pointed seven-word message to Trump supporters “who thought this would be ok,” Daniels said: “I hope you’re losing tons of money.”\n\nWallace responded in agreement. “I mean, the tariffs are going to hurt your neighbors.”\n\nDaniels further concurred, saying: “Which I think, at the end of the day, that’s what’s going to do it. ‘Wait a minute, the grocery bill is what? $180 more? I can’t get that car that we have to have unless I pay another $8,000. What? Who do I blame for that? Who do I see about that?’ One person.”\n\nWhen approached for comment, White House Spokesman Kush Desai told The Independent: “Wow, another washed up, out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown is wishing harm on everyday Americans because they disagree with his opinions. Unfortunately for Jeff and fortunately for the American people, under President Trump bond and stock markets are rallying, Joe Biden’s inflation crisis is over, and real wages are rising.”\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Wallace opined that America has experienced a “loss” in decency over the desire for more affordable goods.\n\n“Well, I think at the end of the day it would be about just the price of eggs, did it go up or down, because that’s what he told me he was going to lower the price of eggs or my grocery bill,” The Newsroom alum replied, branding the president a “snake oil salesman.”\n\nDaniels also lamented Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 presidential election, admitting he still thinks about her and how “she would have been a good choice. I don’t care what they say, because she would have done what [Abraham] Lincoln did.”\n\nExplaining how exactly he thought the former Vice President would have governed like Lincoln, Daniels said Lincoln “surrounded himself with the people who would disagree with him, not the people who would, you know, take a knee and go, ‘Yeah, more tariffs, sir, more.’”\n\nDaniels shot to fame for his leading role in 1994’s cult classic comedy, Dumb and Dumber, and its 2014 sequel, Dumb and Dumber To. He’s additionally featured in the beloved family comedy Because of Winn-Dixie (2005), George Clooney’s 2005 political drama, Good Night, and Good Luck, and 2016’s Allegiant, the final film in the Divergent dystopian trilogy.\n\nBesides film, he’s also starred in numerous TV shows, including HBO’s The Newsroom, The Looming Tower, and Godless.

(Now try saying that twice.) On Tuesday night, the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican singer will make two back-to-back appearances on late-night television shows: \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" on CBS and \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" on NBC. The 31-year-old artist is in the midst of his historic No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan. The 30-night concert series is expected to generate $200 million to the local economy, according to the island’s promotional agency, Discover Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny, who moonlights as an actor, is also promoting the long-awaited “Happy Gilmore 2,\" a sequel to the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy, which will premiere July 25 on Netflix. He will play a golf caddy to Happy Gilmore (played by Sandler), an aggro-ex-hockey player turned golf phenom. Both Sandler and Bad Bunny are expected to appear on “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” It’s an unusual move by the two competing networks to book the same guest on a single night, but as evening newscasts clash with fast-paced content on social media sites like YouTube or TikTok, perhaps the rules can be relaxed for a superstar. Camaraderie across the TV aisle has grown in recent days, with multiple late-night hosts decrying the cancellation of Colbert’s program for what CBS has cited as financial reasons. News of this cancellation came days after Colbert criticized CBS' parent company, Paramount, over the $16-million settlement of President Trump’s lawsuit stemming from a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. \"And now for the next 10 months, the gloves are off,\" said Colbert on Sunday night. His decade-long show will end May 2026. Earlier this year, Bad Bunny co-hosted \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" to promote his hit album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” which remains on the Billboard 200 chart since its January debut. During the program, the two disguised themselves while busking in a New York Subway station, first performing a cover of the Backstreet Boys' \"I Want It That Way,\" then Bad Bunny's single \"Nuevayol.\" For those wondering how Bad Bunny will pull off this New York showdown, fear not: \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" films its Tuesday program on Monday.","summary":"For one night only, Bad Bunny will appear as a guest on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,' followed by 'Late Night With Seth Meyers'","url":"https://www.latimes.com/delos/story/2025-07-22/bad-bunny-late-night-stephen-colbert-seth-meyers-happy-gilmore-2","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bdc0dc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1080x1350+0+0/resize/1080x1350!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd5%2Fd3%2F5d0511e74ea69291e21fccfbc09c%2Fbadbunnylatenight.pn","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 17:35:37","author":"Andrea Flores","authors":["Andrea Flores"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.475},{"id":344190264,"title":"Stephen Colbert curses out Donald Trump in savage response after The Late Show gets canceled","text":"Stephen Colbert has a simple message for Donald Trump, who celebrated the cancellation of The Late Show.\n\nThe veteran comedian, actor and TV host didn't mince his words in his monologue on Monday (July 21) night, stating that the 'gloves are off' for the rest of the show as it winds down in the next 10 months.\n\nThe top-rated late-night talk show host appeared in his first broadcast since The Late Show announced it would be cancelled, and chose to directly address the POTUS.\n\nIn a Truth Social post last week, Trump wrote: \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nThe president also pointed fingers at the iconic Jimmy Kimmel, writing that the Jimmy Kimmel Live host was 'next' and has 'even less talent than Colbert.'\n\nTaking aim at the post, Colbert said: \"How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?”\n\nThen looking into the 'Eloquence Cam,' he said simply: \"Go f*** yourself.\"\n\nHe also jumped to the defense of Kimmel, adding: \"Nope, no, no. Absolutely not. Kimmel, I am the martyr. There’s only room for one on this cross. And the view is fantastic from up here. I can see your house!”\n\nHis comments come as CBS confirmed it would be axing the show in 2026, alleging 'financial decisions'.\n\nBosses said ending the show after more than three decades comes down to dwindling ad revenues and high production costs, however, others believe the move has been politically motivated.\n\nNot only does the decision, coincidentally, come at the same time Paramount is planning a $8.4bn merge with Skydance, a production company funded by pro-Trump billionaire Larry Ellison, but sources told The Independent that the cancellation is part and parcel of the 'Trump shakedown'.\n\nThey claim it all started when the channel's parent company Paramount settled a $16m lawsuit for its interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes, which Trump claimed was 'election interference'.\n\nColbert commented on the legal action last week, stating it amounted to a 'big fat bribe', and joked it was his dream to have a sitting president cheer for the end of his career.\n\n\"They’re pointing out that last Monday, just two days before my cancellation, I delivered a blistering monologue in which I showed the courage to have a moustache,\" he said. \"I mean, obviously, CBS saw my upper lip and boom, cancelled. Coincidence? Oh, I think not. This is worse than fascism. This is stachism.”\n\nAn anonymous leak over the weekend revealed CBS allegedly tried to suggest the show had lost $40 to $50 million last year, reports The Guardian, to which Colbert joked he could account for a $24m loss before adding: \"Where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16m?... Oh yeah.”\n\nThe star also said since the network was 'killing off' the show, while he is still standing, he vowed to speak 'unvarnished truth to power.'\n\nColbert's fellow hosts also jumped to his defense, with Jon Stewart denouncing Paramount for trying to 'censor and control' the team.\n\nOn The Daily Show, Stewart said: \"The fact that CBS didn’t try to save their No 1 rated late-night franchise that’s been on the air for over three decades is part of what’s making everybody wonder, 'Was this purely financial, or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8bn merger?'”\n\n\"If you believe – as corporations or as networks – that you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavourless that you will never again be on the boy king’s radar … Why would anyone watch you? And you are f***ing wrong.”\n\nHe then led the audience to break out into a chat of 'go f*** yourselves' aimed at corporations who toe the Trump line.","summary":"![CDATA[The TV host slammed the POTUS in a blunt message]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/stephen-colbert-curses-donald-trump-535726-20250722","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltd5afe14905bf88b6/687fc5668b1dabc4fd832e78/stephen-colbert.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 17:24:01","author":"Liv Bridge","authors":["Liv Bridge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":344184268,"title":"“Treated like a national tragedy” — Matt Walsh calls Stephen Colbert the most “overtly political” late-night host after show’s cancellation","text":"Matt Walsh recently called out Stephen Colbert for being the most \"overtly political\" and \"left-wing\" of all the late-night hosts, following CBS's announcement of the cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.For those unfamiliar, during the taping of The Late Show on July 18, Colbert announced that CBS would be ending his show in 2026 after 10 seasons.\"Before we start the show, I want you to know something that I found out just last night. Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May,\" Colbert stated.Reacting to the announcement, Matt Walsh, in the July 22 episode of the Matt Walsh Show, claimed that the cancellation of Colbert's show was treated like a national tragedy by the media and Democratic politicians.\"Now, naturally that the cancellation of Stephen Colbert was treated like a national tragedy by the media and Democrat politicians. Colbert was the most overtly political and left-wing of all the late-night hosts, which is saying a lot,\" Walsh stated.Walsh also seemingly pointed to a narrative circulating among the \"right wing\" that the show's cancellation may have stemmed from Colbert's criticism of the recent settlement between President Trump and CBS.For the unversed, in October 2024, President Donald Trump filed a $10 million lawsuit against CBS News for deceptively editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on 60 Minutes, per the BBC.After months of legal back-and-forth, CBS's parent company, Paramount, settled the lawsuit for $16 million on July 3, with the funds reportedly directed to Trump's presidential library.However, during his July 14 monologue on The Late Show, Stephen referred to the settlement as a \"big, fat bribe,\" prompting speculation among viewers about whether his public criticism of both President Trump and the network played a role in the cancellation.\"I am offended. I don’t know if anything — anything — will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help,\" Colbert stated.Also read: 10 best ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ episodes that are a must-watchMatt Walsh suggests the reason behind the public outrage over Stephen Colbert's show ending View this post on Instagram Instagram PostElsewhere in his podcast, Matt Walsh claimed that the intense outrage from the \"left wing\" and \"democrats\" over the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show is driven by their connection to him.He explained that Colbert gave a platform to these Democratic politicians, journalists, and news anchors on his show and treated them like \"celebrities.\" This, he claimed, fueled their frustration, as without the show, they would lose a platform to speak.\"Look at any of them. Every single one of them has been on Stephen Colbert's show. He would have them on his show. He treated them like celebrities, and that's why they're really so upset about it. This was their one opportunity to sit, you know, to go on a late-night show and be treated like a celebrity,\" Walsh stated.Supporting his argument, Matt Walsh pointed out that American Democratic politician Elizabeth Warren, one of the first prominent figures to tie Colbert's show cancellation to his remarks on the $16M Paramount-Trump settlement, had been a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert \"multiple times.\"\"Elizabeth Warren had been on The Late Show interviewed by Colbert like 14 times or something crazy. I don't know. A bunch of times. Elizabeth Warren has been on this late-night comedy show, not just once, but multiple times,\" Walsh stated.Meanwhile, in a statement to Variety published on July 17, CBS executives clarified that the cancellation of the show was purely a financial decision, made \"against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"","summary":"Matt Walsh recently called out Stephen Colbert for being the most \"overtly political\" and \"left-wing\" of all the late-night hosts, following CBS's announcement of the cancellation of The Late Show Wit","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/news-treated-like-national-tragedy-matt-walsh-calls-stephen-colbert-overtly-political-late-night-host-show-s-cancellation","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/25381-17531867517761-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 17:20:26","author":"Vaishnavi Sah","authors":["Vaishnavi Sah"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":344191352,"title":"Roy Cooper's Chances of Flipping North Carolina's GOP Senate Seat—Polls","text":"A new poll of North Carolina voters showed that former Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, would be tied with a generic Republican in the state's 2026 Senate race.Matt Mercer, communications director for the North Carolina GOP, told Newsweek the poll \"confirms former Gov. Roy Cooper can't run away from his record of failures in North Carolina.\" Mallory Payne, spokesperson for the North Carolina Democratic Party, told Newsweek the Republican candidate will have to \"answer for gutting health care for more than 650,000 North Carolinians.\"Why It MattersNorth Carolina, a state that has delivered Republicans' narrow victories in recent federal elections, is expected to be home to one of the most competitive Senate races in 2026 as Democrats hope to flip a handful of seats in Congress's upper chamber. Incumbent Republican Senator Thom Tillis is not running for reelection, leaving the competitive seat open next November. Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in the midterms, so Democrats view North Carolina as a top flip opportunity as they face a potentially challenging Senate map.Democrats are hoping Cooper, who was fairly popular in the state during his tenure in the governorship, will jump into the race and bolster their chances of winning. But the new poll from co/efficient suggests the race could be competitive even with a Cooper candidacy.What to KnowThe poll asked respondents about who they would support between Cooper and a Republican candidate, without asking questions on specific matchups. It found that 48 percent would support both Cooper and the Republican, with 4 percent remaining undecided.On the other hand, Cooper held a lead in a hypothetical matchup against Tillis. It found that if Tillis decided to run, he would have 31 percent of the vote, while Cooper received 49 percent support; 20 percent were undecided, according to the poll.The poll surveyed 694 likely voters from July 10 to July 14, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.71 percentage points.Steven Greene, a professor of political science at North Carolina State University, told Newsweek confirms the race will be competitive.\"Cooper is a popular former governor with a good brand. I think if Cooper chooses to run, you would have to consider him a slight favorite (this really is a baseline 50-50 race) to win. If Cooper does not run, I think Jeff Jackson is a very strong candidate, but he lacks the statewide name recognition and support that Cooper has,\" he said.Jackson, the state's Democratic attorney general, has said he would support Cooper if he chooses to run in an interview with WRAL earlier in July.The Democratic candidate, whether it's Cooper or another candidate, will need to get \"across that plurality where they just keep narrowly falling short,\" and President Donald Trump's approval rating could key, he said.\"We are pretty close to a 50-50 state, but one in which Republican Senate candidates keep narrowly winning closely-contested races. I think the key for the Democratic candidate is just how much the political environment may have turned against President Trump in 2026. If inflation is a problem and Trump's approval has fallen into the 30's, a Democrat would be the favorite,\" he said.North Carolina was a key battleground in 2024, but Trump still narrowly carried it with 51 percent of the vote, compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris' 47.8 percent. Democrats have made federal races competitive but have come up short in recent years, though Republicans have struggled in gubernatorial elections.A Change Research/Carolina Forward poll from earlier this year showed Cooper with a lead over Tillis before he opted against running. Forty-six percent of respondents said they planned to back Cooper, while 44 percent said they were inclined to support Tillis. That poll surveyed 867 likely voters from March 31 to April 4, 2025.What People Are SayingMallory Payne, spokesperson for the North Carolina Democratic Party, told Newsweek: \"The GOP's toxic Medicaid cuts will be at the forefront of the U.S. Senate race in 2026, especially after Thom Tillis chose to retire rather than have to run on a plan that will devastate North Carolina families. No matter who jumps into the GOP primary, they will have to answer for gutting health care for more than 650,000 North Carolinians – and voters will hold them accountable at the ballot box and flip this seat next November.\"Matt Mercer, communications director for the North Carolina GOP, told Newsweek: \"This poll confirms former Gov. Roy Cooper can't run away from his record of failures in North Carolina. A 40-year career politician isn't what voters are looking for from their next U.S. Senator. Worse for Cooper, this race will be a referendum on his handling of hurricane response in eastern and western North Carolina. We look forward to holding this seat and continuing to work with President Trump for America First policies that benefit North Carolina families.\"Steven Greene, a professor of political science at North Carolina State University, told Newsweek: \"If the economy is doing pretty well and Trump's approval remains in the mid-40's, that's a much tougher environment for the Democrat. Obviously, this national context will very much affect the Republican nominee as well. The additional interesting issue on that side is will the Republicans be able to nominate the most electable general election candidate, or will their primary saddle them with a less electable figure. We have seen Republicans lose many winnable Senate races in the past 10-15 years due to extreme candidates winning primaries.\"What Happens NextBoth Democratic and Republican candidates could announce in the coming months. Currently, the Cook Political Report classifies the race as a pure toss up.","summary":"A new poll showed Tillis tied with a generic Republican in the critical 2026 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/roy-cooper-chances-flipping-north-carolina-gop-senate-seat-polls-2102465","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2688090/roy-cooper-poll-north-carolina-senate-race.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=0095d16b102768efbce1fd1477796b03","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 17:15:33","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":344193002,"title":"Hunter Biden Criticizes George Clooney and Fellow Democrats Over Joe Biden’s 2024 Presidential Bid","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hunter Biden, son of former President Joe Biden and often seen as a controversial figure within the Democratic Party due to legal troubles and substance abuse issues bringing unwanted attention to his father, is expressing frustration with Democratic “elites” and others regarding their treatment of his father during the previous presidential election. \n\nIn recent interviews, Hunter Biden shared his perspective on last year’s election, during which Joe Biden ended his campaign, and Donald Trump emerged victorious. During a lengthy, expletive-laden online interview with Andrew Callaghan of Channel 5, he criticized actor and Democratic donor George Clooney for urging his father not to pursue a 2024 reelection campaign. \n\nHunter also criticized longstanding Democratic consultants whom he accused of profiting from the party and relying on past electoral achievements while failing to support current candidates effectively.\n\nThe lengthy screed made plain the younger Biden’s feelings that his father was mistreated by those around him in the waning days of his candidacy and administration. He also laid bare critiques of the party’s operation and operatives that, he says, aren’t well-serving its opposition to Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the moments in Hunter Biden’s interview:\n\nHe blasted George Clooney\n\nHunter Biden spared no feelings in his assessment of the actor, questioning why anyone should listen to the “Ocean’s Eleven” star.\n\nClooney supported Joe Biden’s bid for a second term, even headlining a record-setting fundraiser for the then-president, but changed his stance after Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024.\n\nClooney made his feelings known in an opinion piece in The New York Times, adding his voice to mounting calls for the then-81-year-old president to drop his presidential bid. Biden ended up leaving the race a few weeks later and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who went on to lose to Trump. \n\n“What right do you have to step on a man who’s given 52 years of his f——— life to the services of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out basically a full page ad in the f——— New York Times to undermine the president,” Hunter Biden said before he trailed off to talk about how Republicans are more unified than Democrats.\n\nLos Angeles-based representatives for Clooney did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nScreed against longtime Democratic advisers\n\nThere were also weighty critiques of a number of longtime Democratic advisers.\n\nAnita Dunn, a longtime Biden senior adviser, has made “$40 to $50 million” off of work for the Democratic Party, Hunter Biden said. James Carville, adviser to former President Bill Clinton, “hasn’t run a race in 40 f——— years.” \n\nFormer Obama strategist David Axelrod, Hunter Biden said, “had one success in his political life, and that was Barack Obama — and that was because of Barack Obama.” Other former Obama aides who now host “Pod Save America,” are “four white millionaires that are dining out on their association with Barack Obama from 16 years ago,” he said.\n\nOne of the four, Tommy Vietor, Monday on social media applauded Hunter Biden’s decision “to process the election, look inward, and hold himself accountable for how his family’s insular, dare I say arrogant at times, approach to politics led to this catastrophic outcome we’re all now living with.”\n\nIn a message Tuesday, Axelrod told The Associated Press, “Never have the words ‘no comment’ felt more appropriate.” Dunn did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\n\nBiden’s debate performance and Ambien effects\n\nAs for the debate performance, the fallout from which ultimately led to the calls for his father to step down from the 2024 presidential campaign, Hunter Biden said his father may have been recovering from Ambien, a medication that he had been given to help him sleep following trips in the weeks before the debate to Europe, as well as the Los Angeles fundraiser at which Clooney said his interactions with Biden made him feel the president wasn’t mentally capable.\n\n“He’s 81 years old, he’s tired as shit,” Hunter Biden said. “They give him Ambien to be able to sleep, and he gets up on the stage and he looks like he’s a deer in the headlights.”\n\nA spokesperson for Joe Biden declined to comment on the interview.\n\nAnother podcast with Jaime Harrison\n\nHunter Biden also appeared Monday in an episode of “At Our Table,” a new podcast hosted by former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison. \n\n“Yeah, Joe Biden did get old. He got old before our eyes. … But you know what? A few changes does not mean that you do not have the mental capacity to be able to do your job.”\n\nIn that interview, Hunter Biden also talked about the calamitous presidential debate.\n\n“And then they saw him at that debate. It was awful, and it was truly horrible,” he said, saying he was opposed to holding it, given Trump’s recent convictions on 34 felony charges in a New York hush money case.\n\nTo Harrison, Hunter Biden also addressed Clooney, saying, “I love George Clooney’s movies, but I don’t really give a s—- about what he thinks about who should be the nominee for the Democratic Party.”\n\nAsked by Harrison about his father’s decision to quit the 2024 race, Hunter Biden said “I think that he could have won” but still made the right choice for Democrats broadly.”\n\n“I know that it wasn’t a mistake in that moment,” Hunter Biden said, adding that his father “chose to save the party” over saving himself.\n\nWhy are these podcasts coming out now?\n\nThe podcast drops come just days ahead of the expected beginning of court proceedings in a Los Angeles federal court. \n\nHunter Biden is suing Patrick Byrne, alleging that the former CEO of Overstock.com falsely claimed that Hunter Biden was reaching out to the Iranian government in the fall of 2021 and offering to have his father Joe Biden “unfreeze” $8 billion in Iranian funds “in return for $800 million being funneled into a numbered account for us.”\n\nIn the waning days of his administration, Joe Biden pardoned his son, sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\n\nThe Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California.

Tourists and well-known faces are nothing new to anyone, but this is something else.According to reports, Eve, 27, and Harry, 26, who we disclosed became engaged in September of last year, are organizing a lavish four-day celebration that will begin tomorrow.What makes this wedding so over the top?Eve and Harry are going all out for their wedding, a four-day party at a private estate in Oxfordshire near the Cotswolds. Expect a lot of security, helicopters, secret service agents, private jets at Oxford airport, and trucks bringing in staging and lighting for Elton John's show. Planners like Stanlee Gatti, who is known for planning events like those in Hollywood, are working on every detail, from the decorations to the downtime options, as per a report by The US Sun.Who's coming to the party?This isn't just a party for famous \"It Girls\"; it's a gathering of people who have power.

Harry, a British Olympic gold medalist, competed in Tokyo and Paris, where their relationship grew stronger. Eve is a modern \"It Girl\" who went to Stanford and is a talented rider and former model.

None of those facts made the interview.\n\nCo-host Adriana Diaz provided the lead-in, filled with all the standard talking points from her fellow liberal journalists:\n\nPublic media stations are bracing for the impact of Congress’s decision to slash more than $1 billion in federal funding. Last week, the Republican-led House approved the cuts for the corporation for public broadcasting, ending all federal support for NPR, PBS, and local member stations. By the way, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been around since 1967. Yep, that’s when television stations still broadcast in black and white. It’s helped fund more than 1500 local public radio and TV outlets across the country. President Trump said a key reason for the — for the — for the budget cut was because he — he says PBS and NPR are politically biased, but public media executives say some of the hardest hit stations will be radio outlets that provide critical news and information to rural communities. \n\nShe predictably led off with a softball to said interim general manager, Dina Polkinghorne: “So, walk us through how this budget cut affects your station. In particular, how much will you lose in terms of dollars and what will be the impact?”\n\nPolkinghorne said government funding covers “about 25 percent of our annual operating revenue” and thus devastating to “a staff of five — about five people” that in turn “don’t have, like, a news team.”\n\nCo-host Tony Dokoupil tried to have her say more, asking “what kind of services does your station provide to listeners.”\n\nIncredibly, Polkinghorne could only name one show and predictably picked the most innocuous sounding one before insisting they’re there and rolling whenever bad weather strikes:\n\nYou know, a whole — a whole variety of things. You know, on — in — in good times, we have a show called Trading Time where people can call in and say, I’ve got some extra wood from my deck project. I’d like to trade with somebody for, you know, a new nail gun, but in bad times, and, you know, this is an area prone to natural disasters. We provide a lot of emergency information, breaking news. We, you know, we — we’re a small community. We don’t have a lot of big donors on speed dial, but we have the sheriff on speed dial, and we have the, you know, the local office of emergency services personnel on speed dial. It’s a large county divided north to south with a mountain range on one side. It’s very dry and prone to wildfires. And on the other side, we just some pretty, pretty violent winter storms, sometimes with lots of redwoods in between that fall across the road, so our listeners need to know what roads are open, you know what — what areas are flooded, things like that.\n\nDiaz offered the token question about bias: “And what do you say to President Trump’s view that public broadcasting stations are politically biased?”\n\nPolkinghorne showed the utter pomposity of the government-funded media crowd: “Oh, goodness. We are so far removed from the hyper political things happening in D.C...[W]e don’t ask people what party they belong to when we’re interviewing them...[T]he boots on the ground folks just do not care. They’re not interested.”\n\nBased on the programming lineup and the additional reality that the county went 61 percent for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election (and is in a D+24 House seat), it’s a one-party show and thus it’s easy for her to say everyone agrees.\n\nAs he usually does, Dokoupil took a hot second to admirably and genuinely present the opposing view.\n\nHe first wondered whom is the source of Polkinghorne’s frustrations with the funding fight, but then added the possibility it might be “the NPRs of the world which, you know, the President’s point, there’s some data supporting the idea that they’re mostly Democrats working there, and the coverage hasn’t been down the middle.”\n\nSee, liberal journalists, it’s not that hard.\n\nBy offering the opposing view (albeit in a compacted fashion), it triggered a telling response illustrating more arrogance from the public media crowd and thus why their fear-mongering didn’t work.\n\n“You know, I honestly don’t have time. I don’t have time to think about that. I mean, we — we our fiscal year started July 1. We had to prepare for these cuts. We passed a break even budget and the only way we get there is by, like I said, laying off the staff person, some other cuts and some really ambitious fundraising goals,” she huffed.\n\n“[I]f we don’t want to burden the taxpayers with paying for NPR, that’s one thing. But a — a provision in this rescission effort included something called the community services grant, which many of these small rural stations receive...[W]e all have emergencies in rural areas. We all have to provide this. You know, critical information to people..[W]e’ve got work to do here on the ground to keep our listeners safe and informed,” she concluded.\n\nOur Tim Graham has repeatedly torn this “community services grant” talking point to shreds. For example, he explained in February what it actually means: “The vast majority of NPR stations receive ‘community service grants’ from CPB, and then turn around and send money back to D.C. for ‘programming costs’ for the nationally distributed shows.”\n\nTo see the relevant CBS transcript from July 22, click here.","summary":"Tuesday’s CBS Mornings Plus gave a spotlight to last week’s passage of a rescission package to take back $1 billion in taxpayer funding for far-left propaganda outlets NPR and PBS by commiserating with the interim news director for KZYX, the NPR affiliate in Mendocino County, California, a coastal and wooded area north of the Bay Area.

Kimmel notably teared up following Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris last year, saying it was a “terrible night” for several groups, including women, journalists, immigrants, and NATO. \n\nTuesday’s post echoed what the president said last Friday, when he posted that he heard Kimmel was “next” to go. \n\nThat post followed CBS announcing on July 17 that it was ending “The Late Show” in May 2026. CBS said it was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” and had nothing to do with Colbert’s criticism of the president.\n\nMany of Colbert’s fans were skeptical of that claim, and pointed out his show was canceled just days after the host derided Paramount’s $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump. Colbert called the deal a “big fat bribe” to ensure the Trump administration’s FCC approves Paramount’s upcoming merger with Skydance Media.\n\nColbert remained the top show in the CBS-ABC-NBC late night battle during the second quarter, averaging 2.42 million viewers between April and June. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 1.77 million viewers, and Fallon’s “Tonight Show” on NBC averaged 1.19 million viewers.

Six people briefed on the review’s progress tell The New York Times it is expected to mostly steer clear of digging into whether former President Joe Biden should have run for reelection, whether he should have dropped out of the race earlier, and whether Kamala Harris was the right replacement.\n\nTo quote The Times, “party officials described the draft document as focusing on the 2024 election as a whole, but not on the presidential campaign, which is something like eating at a steak house and then reviewing the salad.”\n\nI want to bring in Senior Adviser to Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign and former Campaign Manager for Julian Castro's presidential bid, Maya Rupert. Basil Smikle is here with me and MSNBC Political Analyst, Democratic Strategist and former Executive Director of the New York State Democratic Party.\n\n12:33:55 p.m.\n\nJANSING: Every Democrat, Maya, that I've talked to has an opinion about what went wrong and what needs to be done differently going forward. My colleague Alex Witt actually spoke to the DNC Chair, Ken Martin, on Sunday. Here's what he said Democrats need to do and why.\n\n[Cuts to video]\n\nKEN MARTIN (DNC chairman): We actually have to stiffen our spine and stand up and fight for what we believe in, right? You know, the question I ask people all the time is if you're not willing to fight like hell for what you believe in, do you really believe in it at all? And that's what's left with in the minds of not only huge portions of our base, but the American people, which is they don't believe we're authentic. They don't believe that our party is willing to stand up and use the power we have to actually make a difference in their lives, to improve their lives, to make a difference in their communities. And that's the biggest challenge we have. We've lost the trust of so many parts of our coalition for so many years now.\n\n[Cuts back to live]\n\nJANSING: Is that the biggest problem, Maya? Do you think Democrats have an authenticity problem, and if so, what exactly does that mean and how do you solve it?\n\nMAYA RUPERT: I definitely think that is a big part of what we're dealing with. I think for a very long time, Democratic candidates have really been concerned with saying, “Listen, you know, things have gotten too chaotic. We can bring things back to normal.” Right? This sense of we can bring things back. And what that started to do is make people think that Democrats aren't trying to fight forward, aren't standing for things, but rather can revert us to the status quo. When people are this unhappy with the status quo, that message falls really flat with people. And so I think what we're seeing is a desire.\n\nAnd I think Ken's exactly right. We have to see candidates who are willing to unequivocally say what they are for. Not sound like this has been message tested over and over again. Not be afraid of being called woke or being, you know, standing up for what they believe in and doing it consistently. And I think that's what we're going to see in ‘26 and ‘28, successful candidates are going to be speaking plainly and clearly, but having a driving set of values. And that's what voters are responding to.\n\nJANSING: I'm honestly, Maya, do you think that Democratic candidates have been wimping out? Do you think that they have been too overly message tested? I'm just going to say again and again, it's anecdotal, but when I was out in the 2024 campaign, when I was out in many campaigns, I see those candidates going door to door, maybe not a presidential candidate, but I see them going door to door. I hear them answering people's questions. [Long pause] Is this an excuse? Is this an excuse for maybe something larger?\n\nRUPERT: I listen, I hear you, I think when we're talking about individual candidates, I have seen people campaigning and I think what works on the ground, what people are doing, is what needs to happen. But I think that there is also a national information ecosystem where the Democratic message has gotten watered down and it has sort of turned into people saying things that don't for a lot of people don't mean something, right? We need to reconnect those values to what they actually mean to people.\n\nSo yes, I definitely think that this isn't a problem of an individual campaign or candidate. It's a much, much larger issue, and it's not going to be solved by a single campaign or single candidate. But I do think we have to be realistic about the way people hear the Democratic message right now. There is something that needs to be fixed. People aren't connecting rhetoric with what people are, what, what any candidate is actually going to do for people.\n\nJANSING: You know, if only it was as simple as Crispen the cat saying, “Mom, I want attention and I want food.”\n\nRUPERT: We would get it immediately, if that's all it was.\n\nJANSING: Rupert, Basil Smikle to be continued.","summary":"As the Democrat Party continued to reflect on their loss to President Trump in the 2024 election, the liberal media and Democrats may need to do a full factory reset.

The president has denied having anything to do with it.\n\nOn Monday, the White House said it was removing a Journal reporter from the pool covering the president’s trip this weekend to his golf courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen in Scotland. The Journal’s Tarini Parti had been scheduled to cover him on the trip.\n\n“Due to the Wall Street Journal’s fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe Journal declined comment on the action.\n\nAggressiveness with the press is in the Trump playbook.\n\nIt’s a tactic the Trump White House has used before. It restricted the access of journalists from The Associated Press to press events when the news outlet would not change its style guidelines to reflect Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. That launched a legal battle that is wending its way through the courts.\n\nThe defamation lawsuit is another tool Trump has used against media outlets. He has sued CBS News for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former opponent Kamala Harris; ABC News for a false statement made by George Stephanopoulos in a story regarding a New York writer who had accused Trump of sexual abuse; and Meta after it removed Trump’s social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nIn each of those cases, Trump won multimillion-dollar settlements. But in those instances, news was only one part of a major corporation’s business. In the case of Murdoch and News Corp., news is the chief part of his business. The Journal has vowed to fight.\n\nIt’s also the first time Trump has sued for defamation as a sitting president, and it’s not clear whether any president has done that in the past.\n\n“There’s nothing inherently wrong with a president bringing a libel suit,” said noted free speech attorney Floyd Abrams. “But this claim certainly seems like nothing more or less than an effort to suppress speech that our president finds discomforting. That’s not why we have libel law. It’s why we have a First Amendment.”\n\nNews organizations have reacted in varied ways.\n\nIt’s all part of a broader pattern of trying to intimidate news organizations that report stories Trump does not like, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\n\n“These are lawsuits that have no hope of actually succeeding as lawsuits, but nevertheless have the potential to chill media organizations from doing what all of us need them to do,” Jaffer said.\n\nNot every news organization has bowed down; “60 Minutes,” in fact, did some notably tough stories about the early days of Trump’s second administration. But it’s impossible to quantify stories that weren’t done because of fear of a fight with the White House, he said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal leans conservative editorially, but hasn’t been afraid to take Trump on in both its opinion and news sections. Other Murdoch outlets — Fox News Channel and the New York Post — are much friendlier to him.\n\nEver since the administration announced that it would not be releasing additional government files from the case against Epstein, factions of Trump’s base supporters have turned on him. That has put some normally supportive news outlets in a difficult position.\n\nFox News largely avoided the story after Trump suggested his allies stop wasting time on it. But Fox’s Howard Kurtz reported on The Wall Street Journal lawsuit on his “Media Buzz” show Sunday, saying that by doing so, “the president has drawn extra attention to the Journal’s reporting.”","summary":"","url":"https://www.mvariety.com/lifestyle/banishing-a-reporter-trump-escalates-battle-with-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-story/article_cee8b9ce-43d5-4224-a99d-45116bb49f96.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mvariety.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/2b/e2bff658-af66-43ab-90a9-74c8f7500ceb/687f7cf7b243c.image.jpg?crop=1219%2C640%2C30%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 16:00:00","author":"Blox Content Management","authors":["Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","source_country":"mp","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":344237894,"title":"Trump’s Wall Street Journal suit over Epstein story faces timing hurdle","text":"(Reuters) — Donald Trump's legal case against the Wall Street Journal over a story about the U.S. president and Jeffrey Epstein could face hurdles, one of which is that it does not appear to comply with Florida state rules over the timing of defamation lawsuits, legal experts said.\n\nIf the case proceeds, Trump would need to clear a demanding \"actual malice\" standard that must be met by public figures to win in U.S. defamation cases. The standard means Trump must prove the paper knew the article was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal lawsuit is the latest in a series of cases Trump has filed against news outlets, and experts said his demonstrated willingness to sue could have a chilling effect on coverage of his administration even if the suit was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nTrump sued the Journal and its owners including Rupert Murdoch in Miami federal court on Friday, seeking at least $10 billion on each of two defamation counts. He said the newspaper defamed him in a July 17 report that said Trump's name was on a 2003 birthday greeting for Epstein that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to secrets they shared.\n\nA spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's parent, said on Friday the company was confident in the accuracy of its reporting and would vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty and the case was dismissed after his death.\n\nBackers of conspiracy theories about Epstein have urged Trump to release investigative files related to the disgraced financier and sex offender.\n\nTwo lawyers with experience in defamation law said Trump did not appear to have complied with a Florida law requiring anyone bringing a defamation case against \"a newspaper, periodical, or other medium\" to notify the defendant at least five days before filing suit.\n\nThat means the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Darrin Gayles, would have no option but to dismiss the case if the Journal asked him to do so, though Trump may be able to re-file it, the experts said.\n\nThe Journal published its story on Thursday. In his lawsuit on Friday, Trump's lawyers said the Journal informed Trump about the forthcoming article last Tuesday, and they sent the paper an email that same day asserting that the article would be false and defamatory.\n\nThat timeline does not appear to comply with Florida's five-day notice law, said Marc Randazza, who said he had been practicing defamation law in Florida for more than 20 years.\n\n\"I don't even need to look at the merits of the case. The game is over,\" said Randazza of law firm Randazza Legal Group in Las Vegas. Randazza said Trump's case was \"at least colorable\" on the merits.\n\nThe White House deferred comment to Trump's lawyer in the case, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDow Jones declined to comment.\n\nTrump must clear high bar\n\nIn addition to the five-day notice hurdle, Trump would likely struggle to prove that the Journal acted with \"actual malice,\" said Andrew Fleischman of law firm Sessions & Fleischman in Atlanta.\n\nTo back Trump's claim that the Journal knew the story was inaccurate, his complaint says the president informed the Journal before publication that the reporting was false.\n\nFleischman said a disagreement about the truth of an assertion is not enough to prove actual malice. Instead, Trump would need to demonstrate that the paper was deliberately lying.\n\nThe billions in monetary damages Trump was seeking is a \"PR figure\" designed to attract attention, said Fleischman, who frequently defends clients against defamation claims.\n\nThe figure would far exceed the largest defamation judgments and settlements in recent history, including a $1.3 billion judgment against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Fox News' settlement with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million.\n\nTrump, a Republican who has pledged to \"straighten out the press,\" has a mixed record in the numerous lawsuits he has filed against media outlets.\n\nJudges have dismissed cases he brought against CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post. More recently, television network ABC and CBS parent company Paramount have opted to settle cases brought by Trump.\n\nWalt Disney-owned ABC News in December paid $15 million and publicly apologized for comments by anchor George Stephanopoulos, who inaccurately said Trump had been found liable for rape. Trump had been found liable of sexually abusing, but not raping, the magazine writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nParamount's $16 million settlement came as the company seeks approval from U.S. regulators for its merger with Skydance Media. Trump had initially sought $10 billion in his lawsuit, which alleged CBS deceptively edited an interview with Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris to favor her rival presidential bid.\n\nEven if the Journal prevails, Trump's willingness to file claims against news organizations could have a chilling effect on journalists given the costs of defending against them, experts said.\n\nBongino case dismissed\n\nTrump would not be the first member of his administration to run up against Florida's five-day notice provision.\n\nIn 2019, podcaster Dan Bongino — who is now the deputy director of the FBI — sued online news outlet the Daily Beast for defamation over a story about his departure from the National Rifle Association's online video channel.\n\nThe case was dismissed the next year. U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez in Miami sided with the Daily Beast in finding that Bongino did not comply with the provision, but said the basis of his decision was that Bongino's case lacked merit.\n\nNeither the FBI nor Bongino's personal lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment.","summary":"","url":"https://www.mvariety.com/news/national/trump-s-wall-street-journal-suit-over-epstein-story-faces-timing-hurdle/article_6f1a58c9-da95-42b9-8f55-e8fd48ff248f.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mvariety.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/53/453dbe05-7b66-4625-ae9a-e1782d000c2e/687f73b0bf1e8.image.png?crop=1008%2C529%2C0%2C71","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 16:00:00","author":"Blox Content Management","authors":["Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mp","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":344198826,"title":"Senate Dems Question Potential “Secret Side Deal” in Trump Paramount Settlement","text":"A trio of Democratic U.S. senators on Monday launched a probe into reports that President Donald Trump’s legal team struck a secretive side deal with Skydance — the prospective owner of CBS — that includes millions of dollars worth of “broadcast transmissions” supporting right-wing causes.\n\nIn a letter to Skydance CEO David Ellison, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote that Trump himself appeared to confirm the existence of the side deal in comments to reporters about his $16 million settlement with Paramount, the current owner of CBS that is seeking federal approval for its pending merger with Skydance.\n\nTrump suggested the settlement was worth twice as much as the publicly reported figure, saying, “We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million—or maybe more than that in advertising… So it’s like $32 to maybe $35 million. I think that’s what they did.”\n\nThe senators described the alleged side deal as a “potential secret Trump payoff.”\n\n“This admission appears to corroborate reporting that claims you reached a ‘side deal’ with the president, the terms of which involve CBS airing public service announcements ‘and other broadcast transmissions’ worth between $15 million and $20 million that ‘support conservative causes supported by President Trump.’ The nature and existence of this arrangement are uncertain, with at least one anonymous source calling the reports ‘false.'”\n\nThe president’s comments aligned with a New York Post story published earlier this month alleging that Ellison vowed to “run between $15 million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes supported by the president” once the Skydance CEO takes over CBS.\n\nParamount denied having any knowledge of a side deal.\n\nThe Democratic senators wrote in their letter to Ellison that the president’s comments and related reporting “raise fresh questions about corruption in the Trump administration and President Trump’s willingness to accept payments from entities with significant policy interests before agencies he controls.”\n\nThe senators demanded that Ellison provide answers to seven questions, including whether there is “currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other administration officials” and whether Ellison has “personally discussed with President Trump, any of his family members, any Trump administration officials, or presidential library fund personnel any matters related to the Paramount-Skydance transaction.”\n\nThe letter was sent days after Ellison met with Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr — a Trump loyalist — to discuss the pending merger with Paramount.\n\nThe meeting, according to Skydance’s counsel, included a discussion of “Skydance’s commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS‘ editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.”\n\nAs Variety noted, “That’s significant because Carr, appointed by Trump, had reopened an agency probe into a ‘news distortion’ complaint against CBS over the allegedly deceptive editing of a ’60 Minutes’ interview with Kamala Harris segment — the same interview that Trump sued Paramount and CBS over.”\n\n“The application of the FCC’s ‘news distortion’ policy in this way was highly unusual, according to former agency officials,” Variety reported.","summary":"Trump has suggested that his $16 million settlement is worth twice as much as the publicly reported amount.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/senate-dems-question-potential-secret-side-deal-in-trump-paramount-settlement/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2215126708-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 15:44:33","author":"Jake Johnson","authors":["Jake Johnson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":344161370,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres fled the States – now she must acknowledge her privilege","text":"Let’s not risk that by becoming a sanctuary of celebrity convenience (Picture: Brooks Kraft/Getty Images)\n\nEllen DeGeneres has officially joined the expat celebrity club.\n\nIn a conversation with broadcaster Richard Bacon in Cheltenham last weekend, she confirmed that she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, decided to stay in the UK after waking up to the news of Donald Trump’s re-election last year.\n\nIt’s not hard to understand why.

A teaser for the new season featured Rudolph’s Molly Wells gently caressing a giant crystal, before the camera moved to her coworker/love interest Arthur (Nat Faxon) in her kitchen, a promising sign of their relationship status after the Season 2 finale left it on a cliffhanger.\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\n“Loot” centers around billionaire Molly Wells, who sets off on a mission to do good in the world after her high-profile divorce leaves her with an exorbitant amount of money — recruiting the team at her Wells Foundation, led by Sofia (Michaela Jaé Rodriguez) to help her use her riches to help others. Season 2 ended with a big question mark after Molly and her trusted assistant Nicholas (Joel Kim Booster) boarded her private jet for an unknown destination, after facing blowback from her fellow billionaires about her philanthropic efforts and an awkward love confession to Arthur in front of his current girlfriend.\n\nSeason 3 will feature the return of Rudolph, Faxon, Booster and Rodriguez, alongside series regular Ron Funches. Guest stars also include Stephanie Styles, D’Arcy Carden, Adam Scott, Zane Phillips, Henry Winkler, X Mayo and more.\n\nThe show scored a Season 3 renewal last year, weeks after its May 2024 finale aired. Production on the series was delayed from its initial fall 2024 start time to accommodate Rudolph’s return to “Saturday Night Live” to play Kamala Harris upon her presidential bid against Donald Trump.\n\n“Loot” is created and executive produced by MAtt Hubard and Alan Yang. Rudolph and Danielle Renfrew Behrens executive produce via Banana Split, along with Dave Becky of 3 Arts, Dean Holland and Natasha Lyonne. Hubbard serves as showrunner on Season 3. The series is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.

Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden are investigating whether Skydance Media CEO David Ellison may have cut a secret side deal with President Donald Trump following his $16 million settlement with Paramount. \n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the payment will cover Trump’s legal fees and a donation to a future presidential library. It also included a commitment to share future transcripts of “60 Minutes” interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after they have aired, but stopped short of an apology or statement of regret from CBS about the editing of its Oct. 7 interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump has since suggested that the deal’s value could actually be worth north of $30 million when including additional funds for public service announcements. An individual close to the settlement negotiations previously told TheWrap there was anticipation there could be an additional “low-to-mid eight-figure allocation” set aside for PSAs for “conservative causes.” Paramount has denied that the settlement includes PSAs, while Skydance has declined to comment. \n\nIn a letter on Monday, the trio of senators said Trump’s remarks “raise fresh questions about corruption” as Paramount and Skydance await regulatory approval from the FCC for their pending $8 billion merger. The lawmakers also questioned whether Skydance may have been involved in the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” after the late night host knocked the settlement as a “big fat bribe.”\n\nWarren, Sanders and Wyden are seeking responses to the following seven questions by Aug. 4: \n\n1. Is there currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other Administration officials? a. If so, what is the nature of this arrangement? What will you or Skydance provide, and what have you discussed receiving in return from the Trump Administration? b. Have any Skydance board members been involved in any of these discussions, or have you been involved in these discussions only in your personal capacity?\n\n2. Have you personally discussed with President Trump, any of his family members, any Trump Administration officials, or presidential library fund personnel any matters related to the Paramount-Skydance transaction? If so, what was the nature of these discussions?\n\n3. Were you or any other Skydance executives involved in discussions about settling President Trump’s lawsuit against CBS? If so, please provide information regarding the timing, nature of, and participants in these discussions, including whether the pending transaction with Paramount was discussed. \n\n4. Has Skydance agreed or have you personally agreed to make changes to Skydance’s content or Paramount’s or CBS’s content at the request of the Trump Administration, to facilitate approval of the transaction? If so, please describe those requests. \n\n5. Were you or other Skydance executives involved in discussions about canceling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert? If so, please provide information regarding the timing, nature of, and participants in these discussions, including whether the pending transaction with Paramount was discussed. \n\n6. Does Skydance have any policies, procedures, or guidance related to compliance with 18 U.S.C. 201 or any other laws governing public corruption? If so, please provide a copy of those policies and procedures. \n\n7. Does Skydance conduct any trainings for its staff or executives related to compliance with 18 U.S.C. 201 or any other laws governing public corruption? If so, please provide details regarding these trainings.\n\nA Skydance spokesperson declined to comment on the letter. \n\nThe letter follows a previous warning from the trio that Paramount settling with Trump could violate federal anti-bribery laws. \n\nIt also comes after Warren and a group of Democratic lawmakers unveiled the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act of 2025. The proposed legislation would require presidents to wait until after leaving office before fundraising or accepting donations, except for 501(c)(3) organizations who would be limited to a contribution cap of $10,000 total. It would also prohibit donations from foreign nationals or foreign governments, registered lobbyists, federal contractors and/or individuals seeking presidential pardons for two years after a president leaves office.\n\nAdditionally, it would prohibit straw donations, in which someone makes a donation under someone else’s name, ban the use of presidential library donations for personal expenses or unrelated financial obligations, and require all donations of $200 or more to be disclosed to the National Archives each calendar quarter during the president’s time in office and five years thereafter. Donor information, including name, employer and date and amount of the donation, would be published online in a searchable, downloadable format.\n\nIn addition to Warren, Sanders and Wyden, Sens. Edward Markey and Ben Ray Luján have called out the Paramount settlement and have urged the FCC to hold a full commission vote on the Skydance merger rather than approving the deal through its media bureau. Markey and Chuck Schumer have also asked commission chairman Brendan Carr to end the agency’s “partisan attacks” on CBS and to “cease interfering with the judgement of independent news organizations.”\n\nThe FCC’s review, which is required due to a transfer of broadcast licenses, is currently on day 248, per the agency’s website. The FCC typically makes decisions within an informal 180-day timeline, though that is not a strict deadline. FCC chairman Carr has previously said the Trump settlement talks were unrelated to the merger review. \n\nCarr and Ellison recently met on July 15, where the latter “emphasized the public interest benefits” of the merger and expressed a commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints. Ellison also committed to promoting “non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity” at New Paramount and said its planned governance structure would “not be subject to any Chinese or other foreign influence” following concerns about Tencent Holdings’ minority stake of less than 5% in Skydance.\n\nAfter triggering its second automatic 90-day extension, the Paramount-Skydance deal’s closing deadline has been pushed to Oct. 6. If the deal is not closed by then, the parties would have the option to terminate the deal, which would not be subject to the agreement’s $400 million breakup fee.","summary":"Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden also question whether Skydance was involved in discussions to cancel \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\"\n\n\nThe post Senators Investigate Whether David Ellison Cut Side Deal With Trump After $16 Million Paramount Settlement appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/david-ellison-trump-skydance-side-deal-paramount-settlement-investigation/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/David-Ellison-and-Donald-Trump.jpeg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 14:48:06","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34}]}
