The Packers legend spoke at one of Trump’s rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before the election took place. Trump eventually defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election, carrying Wisconsin on to the win. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Favre said in a recent interview with sports personality Sage Steele that he took a \"common sense\" approach when it came to his decision to support Trump. I thought about the rally in Green Bay when he asked if I would come talk. There were those that said, ‘You know, people throw daggers at you anyway, they’re really gonna throw daggers at you.’ So, I thought about it. I weighed the pros and cons. I really thought I don’t know if I’m going to influence it at this point,\" he said. \"There’s been a hard line drawn in the sand and you’re either on one side or the other. I thought about if you persuade five voters, and who knows, it may be a five-vote difference. Then, I would be beside myself if I didn’t take advantage of that. \"It wasn’t my cup of tea. I’m not a public speaker. I’m certainly not a political public speaker. But it was an honor that I was asked. And, do I agree with everything President Trump says or does? No. Does he agree with everything that I do? No. Nor with anyone on the other side. But from a common sense perspective, do you really think boys should compete in girls’ sports and that’s fair? No. The illegal (immigration), the crime, the border, the things because of it – how can you think that’s OK? I’m all for doing the right thing for the people, but we have to protect our own first.\" EAGLES' NOTORIOUS TUSH PUSH SET TO RETURN IN NFL SEASON OPENER AFTER SURVIVING BAN VOTE He said he also wondered whether supporters on the left thought about whether the country’s direction was really something they wanted to further support. He said he couldn’t be one of those supporters who rested on his laurels, hoping things would get better. \"Some of the things that you’re, on the left, are saying is normal, do ever not look in the mirror when no one is looking and it’s just you and you go, ‘Are we out of our damn mind?’\" he said. \"So, I felt like the conservative crowd in general sits on our hands, and I think at times I was like you just expect people to do the right thing and to make common sense decisions. \"So, you sit on your hands and you expect that and it doesn’t happen and it continues to get worse. And the left has no problem talking. They don’t shut up, and they blame it all on everyone else. And I’m thinking, you know, like, if we don’t start standing up and defending ourselves, not that we should have to, it is what it is, if we don’t start taking a stand, we’re gonna get dominated.\" Favre said he had no plans to run for office but wasn’t going to tone his voice down either.

Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced a Senate resolution Thursday condemning socialism as a failed ideology as New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani (D) campaigns on socialist policies.\n\nScott announced the resolution in a press release and reiterated his stance in a post on X, writing, “Socialism NEVER works. It’s destroyed countries, crushed economies and robbed millions of their basic human rights. I’m proud to lead a resolution condemning this failed ideology and reminding the far-left that Americans will ALWAYS reject it.”\n\nThe resolution, titled Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism, declares that socialism “collapses into communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships,” and cites historical examples in the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. It asserts that socialist policies have led to famine, repression, and mass killings, pointing to figures including Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Hugo Chávez, and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn his statement, Scott emphasized his experience representing Florida communities with ties to countries ruled by socialist governments. “Just look at Cuba and Venezuela, or talk to any of the thousands of families in my state who fled those regimes after evil dictators stripped them of every opportunity,” he said. “Time and time again, socialism has led to the same, inevitable outcomes: misery, poverty, and oppression.”\n\nRep. María Elvira Salazar (R-FL) brought forward a companion resolution in the House. \n\nShe remarked:\n\nHistory is clear: from Stalin’s gulags and Cambodia’s killing fields to Castro’s firing squads in Havana, socialism has always ended in misery, suffering, and death. Entire nations have been destroyed and millions of lives shattered, including many in my own community who fled its brutality.”\n\nThe resolution follows Scott’s letter to the Wall Street Journal in July, where he criticized Mamdani and other socialists for vilifying capitalism while benefiting from it. In the piece, Scott wrote that capitalism made the American Dream possible for him, noting his own rise from public housing to founding a business and later running the nation’s largest healthcare company.\n\nMamdani, a member of the New York State Assembly who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor earlier this summer, has drawn national attention because of his socialist platform. In recent years, he has advocated for government-run grocery stores, the abolition of private property, and what he called the “end goal” of “seizing the means of production.” The Democratic Socialists of America have described Mamdani as one of their strongest allies in elected office, and party leaders openly acknowledge their role in shaping his platform.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) put forth the “MAMDANI Act” earlier this year to examine the effects of city-run grocery stores, warning the plan could disrupt food prices and supply chains nationwide. Lawler said Mamdani’s proposals were “straight out of the Marxist playbook.”\n\nEven within his own party, Mamdani has drawn mixed reactions. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) defended him under the “big tent” banner of the Democratic Party, saying in July that “the bigger the tent, the more likely it is that we can reach the greatest number of Americans.” But other Democrats, including Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY), have distanced themselves. Suozzi suggested Mamdani and other socialists “create their own party” and warned that socialism has “failed everywhere throughout the United States of America.”\n\nScott has positioned himself as one of the Senate’s leading opponents of socialism. In past statements, he called Vice President Kamala Harris’s push for price controls “pure socialism” and warned against left-wing movements like the teachers’ union-backed “RedforEd” campaign.","summary":"Sen.

The controversial music manager rumoured to be dating Sydney Sweeney","text":"Former music manager Scooter Braun is rumoured to be dating actress Sydney Sweeney.\n\nThe couple ignited relationship rumours in June, when they were both among the several famous guests at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding in Venice, Italy.\n\nBraun and Sweeney also bonded outside of the wedding festivities, as evidenced by photos of them hanging out at Harry's Bar with Karlie Kloss and other celebrities.\n\nSydney's relationship with Scooter, who is well-known for his public conflict with Taylor Swift, is her first romantic relationship since she broke up with her fiancé and seven-year partner, Jonathan Davino. \n\nBraun is well-known for ‘discovering’ Justin Bieber back when he was a 12-year-old sharing covers on YouTube as an aspiring singer. As well as managing Bieber, his entertainment and marketing company, SB Projects, represents acts such as Black Eyed Peas, Ava Max, Tori Kelly, and Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\nSo, who is Scooter Braun, and what are his biggest controversies?\n\nBorn in New York, Scooter Braun started out putting on parties as a student at Emory University in Atlanta, quickly transforming into a full-fledged promoter. After organising five after-parties for Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach and Eminem’s Anger Management tour, he dropped out of uni to go and work at the Atlanta-based record label So So Def, becoming the label’s executive marketing head when he was just 20.\n\nAfter spotting a young, pre-fame Justin Bieber singing covers on YouTube, Braun signed him to the record label he’d founded with Usher in 2008. In 2013, Ariana Grande signed to Braun’s management company. Though he was briefly fired by the singer in 2016, they later reunited.\n\n“It allowed me to know that I can be fired — I had never been fired before,” Braun told Variety.\n\nBraun’s management roster also included Carly Rae Jepsen, David Guetta, Black Eyed Peas, Dan + Shay, Psy, and Tori Kelly. \n\nThe 44-year-old announced his retirement from music management in June 2024 to focus on his family and his role at Hybe America. Here’s a closer look at controversies that engulfed Braun’s career.\n\nThe departure of both Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato from SB Projects within the same week raises questions about the timing of both artists’ exit, though little detail is known about why each decided to part ways with Braun. A source close to the situation told Billboard that “it was time for Lovato to go in a new direction, even though she was thankful for her time with SB Projects” and added that she doesn’t yet have new management.\n\nLittle is known about why Grande has opted to split from Braun after originally signing to his management company back in 2013, and no details have been made public. However, a source told Variety: “They are friendly but she’s outgrown him and is excited to go in a different direction,” the source continued. “Yes, there are negotiations [with Braun] happening because of contracts. But this is her choice. It’s time for something new.”\n\nAnother source told Variety that Grande intends to build her own team, and “has a model in mind similar to that of Taylor Swift and other major artists, whereby management personnel are paid a healthy annual salary rather than by commission.”\n\nGrande and Lovato’s exit come weeks after rumours swirled around Justin Bieber also leaving Braun’s stable, though representatives for both sides later denied the reports when approached for comment by Billboard.\n\nBesides his role in discovering Justin Bieber, Braun is perhaps best known for his public dispute with Taylor Swift. The manager has owned the masters for Swift’s first six records since he bought her former record label Big Machine in June 2019, and the singer has been recording definitive new Taylor’s Versions of her earlier albums in a bid to devalue Braun’s masters and take back control of her work (though Braun sold the master rights on to an investment fund less than 18 months later in a deal reported at the time to be worth more than $300million). In a Tumblr post written on June 30, 2019, Swift alleged that Braun had subjected her to “incessant, manipulative bullying”.\n\n“Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” she wrote. “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.”\n\nShe has never clarified exactly what this refers to, but as well as owning Swift’s masters, Braun managed Kanye West during the period in which the rapper released his song Famous. The track reignited a feud that began at the 2009 VMA awards, where West interrupted an early-career Swift in the middle of her acceptance speech. The track includes the lyric: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that b**ch famous”.\n\nSwift now has complete ownership over her discography for the first time after purchasing the master recordings of her first six albums in May. \n\n“After 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to her followers on social media “I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen. But that's all in the past now.”\n\nIt seemed like the feud between the pair was semi-dissolved around September 2024 when Braun posted an Instagram Story in support of Kamala Harris, referencing Swift’s hit song Shake It Off. He captioned it with, “Shake it off Donald. Kamala 2024,” seemingly supporting Swift.\n\nBraun has since stated that he was “shocked” by Swift's response when he obtained the master recordings of her first six studio albums, even though he had anticipated that purchasing Swift's former company in 2019 would be a “exciting thing.”\n\nBraun told The Diary Of A CEO podcast in June: “When I bought Big Machine, I thought I was going to work with all the artists on Big Machine, I thought it was going to be an exciting thing,”\n\n“She (Swift) and I had only met three times, I think. In my life, three or four times, and one of the times, it was years earlier.”\n\nBraun mentions that they both “respected each other” and that he thinks the problem between them began with him managing both Kanye West and Bieber.\n\n“I had a feeling – this is where my arrogance came in – I had a feeling she probably didn’t like me because I managed them. But I thought that once this announcement happened, she would talk to me, see who I am, and we would work together.\n\n“And the announcement came out and I’m calling Scott Borchetta (chief executive of Big Machine Records) and saying, ‘Hey, send me her number… and I just talked to this person and they’re excited’… and then this Tumblr (post) comes out and says all this stuff. And I was just like, shocked.”\n\nIn 2021, Scooter Braun sold his company Ithaca Holdings to HYBE - the music company formerly known as Big Hit Entertainment, who manage K-Pop superstars such as BTS, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, and SEVENTEEN. According to Billboard, Bieber, Grande, and Lovato were among the 39 individuals set to split shares with an overall total value of about $161 million following the sale.\n\nBraun stepped away from his role as CEO of HYBE America in July.\n\nElsewhere, HYBE was subject to controversy around BTS’ sudden split in 2022. According to the Korean Economic Daily, three anonymous employees at HYBE stand were accused of insider trading after allegedly offloading shares in the company ahead of BTS’ break-up going public. The paper writes: “The regulatory Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said the three unidentified employees avoided a total of 230 million won ($174,000) in losses by unloading the stock ahead of the news about BTS’s solo career launch plans.”\n\nNews of BTS’ split sent shares in HYBE plummeting by 24.8 per cent. The FSS accused HYBE’s employees of violating the capital markets act, and the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office launched an investigation amid speculation that news of BTS’ split leaked before it was revealed publicly.\n\nOn June 15, 2024, HYBE formally announced the BTS break, stating that while the members would be concentrating on personal endeavours, they would still continue to be “active as a group.”\n\nThree former HYBE employees were found guilty of insider trading pertaining to BTS member enlistments by a Seoul court, and they were sentenced to suspended prison terms and fined.\n\nSinger Madison Beer, who was managed by Braun, opened up in a Cosmopolitan cover story in April 2025 about her early career. When she was discovered at age 12 and taken under the wing of Braun, she claimed her life changed overnight. But by age 16, everything came crashing down: she said she was dropped not just by Braun, but also by her lawyer and record label—all in the same day. \n\nShe described it succinctly: “Everything in my life went away within 12 hours.”\n\nThe 26-year-old claimed she was dropped by everyone because she allegedly wasn’t meeting success benchmarks.","summary":"The former music manager has been linked to a few controversies over the course of his career","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/who-is-scooter-braun-music-manager-controversies-taylor-swift-justin-bieber-b1102276.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/06/09/13/09124524-c2fea4a1-e940-4180-b172-7dfdd9503e32.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 17:38:28","author":"El Hunt","authors":["El Hunt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.439},{"id":357486686,"title":"Transcript: How Trump Is Screwing Michigan—and What Democrats Can Do","text":"Bacon: Let me ask about two different groups. You mentioned the diversity of the state. So what are you hearing from people in Detroit, who I assume mostly voted for Kamala Harris? And then what are you hearing when you go to rural areas? Any regret from the people’s vote? Any rethinking about voting for Trump? ’Cause I assume in most rural areas, Trump did win.\n\nGilchrist: Yeah. In the city of Detroit, people want results—and frankly, that’s true across the board. If we go back to 2024, what I saw is a group of people, called the voters, who were really frustrated with the status quo and wanted Democrats to be as pissed off as they were about the status quo, or the lack of progress, or the lack of pace of progress. That remains true. I think what people are seeing, now that this Trump regime is beginning to calcify, is that this guy’s not getting us to progress. He’s putting money in his own pocket, whether it’s through a crypto scam—and I’m not necessarily anti-crypto, but he’s putting money in his pocket and putting the money in his family members’ pocket—whether it is him saying, You know what? I want to give tax cuts to people who are as rich as I am but actually take money out of the pockets of working people, and I want to give tax cuts to gun silencers rather than making communities safer. That’s what they’re seeing. And so I think people across the board—in urban and rural communities—are saying that. In Detroit specifically, look, people want better outcomes. People want better education outcomes. And they see that cutting the Department of Education ain’t going to get you better outcomes. It’s the wrong answer to the right question, as I think columnist David Brooks said, which I think is right.\n\nIn the rural communities, people have urgent needs for housing and health care. When I’m talking to people, they say, You know what? We need more affordable housing because without it, our community’s not going to survive. I went and toured a high school in Northern Michigan. I’m walking through with the principal, and he was telling me about how they’ve been looking for a chemistry teacher for three years at this school—three years with no chemistry teacher. They had two people who would accept the job offers to become the chemistry teacher. But when they came to the community, they brought their families, and they looked around, they said, OK, let me see if I can find a home that can house me and my husband and my two children that I can afford on this salary. They couldn’t find it. And they gave them back the job offer. So what does that mean? That means another family did not move to the community. That means that another school year went by where kids didn’t have a certified chemistry teacher to be able to graduate.","summary":"The following is a lightly edited transcript of the September 4 episode of Right Now With Perry Bacon.

The FCC approved the deal after Ellison agreed to install an ombudsman to monitor bias, dismantle DEI programs, and promote “viewpoint diversity.”However, these changes have already caused unease within CBS News. One insider told Fox Business that the new ombudsman acted like a “hall monitor,” while former anchors warned that CBS News’ tradition of independent reporting could be at risk.Ellison’s strategy to modernise CBS NewsThe timing aligns with Ellison’s goal to modernize CBS News and reverse years of ratings decline. The merger was promoted as a strategy to revitalize Paramount’s content pipeline, but CBS News became a key focus during regulatory review. FCC officials conditioned approval on creating the ombudsman position and eliminating DEI mandates.The merger was also approved after Paramount settled a lawsuit brought by former President Trump against CBS News regarding a “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount and Weiss have not publicly commented on the ongoing talks.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/free-press-acquire-paramount-to-buy-bari-weiss-venture-for-up-to-200mn-appoint-her-to-cbs-news-role/articleshow/123702178.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-123702289/123702289.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 15:24:48","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":357423244,"title":"Who is Bari Weiss? Rebel journalist set to storm CBS News; and why staff are already in revolt","text":"CBS News, long considered the “Tiffany Network” of American journalism, may soon be run by one of its fiercest critics: Bari Weiss. Paramount, fresh off its $8 billion Skydance merger, is reportedly preparing to buy Weiss’ buzzy media startup The Free Press for as much as $200 million. The deal, first reported by Puck and The Wrap, would install Weiss in a top editorial role at CBS News, a move insiders say has left the newsroom “apoplectic.”From New York Times rebel to Free Press founder Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.” In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity. She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.” The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.Why Weiss matters at CBS Her potential arrival comes at a time of seismic change. As part of the Skydance-Paramount merger, new boss David Ellison has promised regulators to scrap diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at CBS News and install an ombudsman to monitor bias. Weiss, a critic of progressive orthodoxy, fits neatly into that promise of “viewpoint diversity.” But not everyone’s convinced. One CBS insider compared the ombudsman’s office to a “hall monitor,” while another journalist warned they’d resign if Weiss took charge. A biting remark making the rounds sums up the mood, “Good night, and bad luck”, a dark twist on CBS legend Edward R Murrow’s sign-off.The bigger political backdrop This isn’t just a newsroom shuffle. Trump has accused CBS of deceptive editing in a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, and his lawsuit against Paramount was quietly settled ahead of the merger. CBS has also axed Stephen Colbert’s Late Show, a frequent Trump critic, citing cost cuts. For critics, putting Weiss, pro-Israel, anti-woke, and proudly contrarian, at the helm is proof of a conservative pivot. For Ellison, it’s a gamble that Weiss’ brand of disruption can save CBS News from a ratings freefall. Paramount hasn’t confirmed the deal. Weiss hasn’t commented. But inside CBS, the tension is real - one of America’s most storied newsrooms may be about to hand the mic to its loudest outsider.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-bari-weiss-rebel-journalist-set-to-storm-cbs-news-and-why-staff-are-already-in-revolt/articleshow/123702114.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-123702235/123702235.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 15:21:25","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.092},{"id":357431338,"title":"Los Angeles police 'pulled from working cases' to give Kamala Harris elite 24/7 protection","text":"Los Angeles police have been slammed by taxpayers for offering round the clock protection to Kamala Harris after President Donald Trump yanked her security detail.\n\nOfficers with an elite LAPD division have been pulled from working cases to provide protection to the former Vice President's Brentwood home 24/7, FOX 11 reported.\n\nMany LA residents, including reality star Spencer Pratt, took to social media to slam the city's Democratic government for using resources to protect Harris.\n\nPratt wrote on X: 'NEWSOM AND KAREN BASS HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO HAVE LAPD AND CHP PROTECT KAMALA HARRIS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN’T TRESPASSING ON OUR DIRT LOT IN THE PALISADES AND DOING SELFIES??????!!!!'\n\nLA Republican official Lisa Cusack also weighed in, writing: 'Democrat elites truly have no souls.' \n\nWhen reached for comment on Harris' LAPD protection by FOX 11, LA Mayor Karen Bass replied with a statement accusing Trump of 'political retaliation' against Harris.\n\n'This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more,' Bass said.\n\n'This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.' \n\nThe LAPD told Daily Mail on Thursday: 'For security reasons , the LAPD never discusses the existence of these assignments or provides details surrounding protective operations.'\n\nLast week, President Trump revoked former Harris’ Secret Service protection that otherwise would have ended next summer.\n\nFormer vice presidents typically get federal government protection for six months after leaving office, while ex-presidents do so for life. \n\nBut then-President Joe Biden quietly signed a directive, at Harris’ request, that had extended protection for her beyond the traditional six months.\n\nA recent threat intelligence assessment the Secret Service conducts on those it protects, such as Harris, found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president, said a White House official. \n\nThe administration found no reason Harris’ protection should go beyond the standard six-month period for former vice presidents, the official said. \n\nTrump's move to drop Harris’ federal protection came as the former vice president, who became the Democratic nominee last summer after a chaotic series of events that led to Biden dropping out of the contest, is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled '107 Days.' \n\nThe tour has 15 stops, including visits abroad to London and Toronto. The book, which refers to the historically short length of her presidential campaign, will be released Sept. 23, and the tour begins the following day.\n\nTrump’s vice president from his first term, Mike Pence, did not have extended Secret Service protection beyond the standard six months.\n\nStill, it is not unusual for Secret Service protection to continue well beyond the statutory six-month window, particularly when former officials face credible and ongoing threats. \n\nBut Trump’s decisions to revoke the protection have stood out both for timing and for targets.\n\nDuring Trump’s second presidency, he repeatedly has cut off security for adversaries and figures who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and members of Biden’s family, including the former president’s adult children. \n\nOutgoing presidents can extend protection for those who might otherwise not be eligible; Trump did so for his family after leaving office in 2021.","summary":"Los Angeles police have been slammed by taxpayers for offering round the clock protection to Kamala Harris after President Donald Trump yanked her security detail.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15065501/LAPD-Kamala-Harris-Trump-security.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/13/101835055-0-image-m-67_1756989562188.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 15:15:30","author":"Editor,Germania Rodriguez Poleo","authors":["Editor","Germania Rodriguez Poleo"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":357436944,"title":"Nolte: CBS News Clears CBS News of Wrongdoing in CBS News’ Deceptive Edit of Kristi Noem","text":"CBS News has no valid explanation for why it deceptively edited Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s listing of all the crimes illegal alien Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been credibly accused of.\n\nCBS News just paid $16 million to settle an election interference suit with President Trump after the far-left 60 Minutes was caught deceptively editing Kamala Harris to make her look good (but she’s a Democrat).

Alex Padilla running for California governor? Why Democrats are speculating about a 2026 bid\n\nCaruso, a Democrat, lost a race for Los Angeles mayor to Karen Bass in 2022 and has since emerged as one of her most vocal critics, particularly over her preparation and response to the area’s devastating wildfires this year. He said Wednesday that massive damage could have been “significantly mitigated” if authorities were better prepared.\n\nCaruso owns luxury shopping centers, hotels and apartments in the region. His Palisades Village mall, located near some of the worst-hit areas of the January blaze, was mostly spared because of private firefighters he hired.\n\nCaruso also urged Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s termed out next year, to make peace with President Donald Trump in an effort to secure the federal funds L.A. will need to rebuild.\n\n“We need federal funding and we’re getting none of that,” Caruso said. “I don’t think the bickering and name-calling that’s going on serves any purpose of advancing the negotiations or discussions in getting federal help in Los Angeles.”\n\nNewsom has asked for nearly $34 billion in aid to L.A. but the funds have not moved through Congress amid increasing animosity between the California governor and the US president. Newsom and Trump have publicly clashed over a range of topics, from education to public safety, as well as if California’s wildfire aid should come with strings attached.\n\nIf Caruso decides to pursue running for governor, he would face several other Democratic challengers, including Katie Porter, a former congresswoman from Orange County; former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra; and former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The race is considered to be wide open after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced in July that she wouldn’t pursue the job.","summary":"'I’m looking at both paths; there are good opportunities in both paths,' he said in an interview to Bloomberg Television.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/04/billionaire-rick-caruso-seriously-looking-at-running-for-la-mayor-or-california-governor/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LDN-L-CARUSO-VILLAGE-07-0529.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 14:42:31","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":357455430,"title":"Final Emmy Predictions: ‘Severance’ and ‘The Studio’ Position Apple TV+ for Breakout Year; Netflix Expected to Lead All Platforms","text":"Television’s awards season is nearing its grand finale, with the Creative Arts Emmys taking place over two nights this weekend, leading into the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, Sept. 14. The main ceremony will be hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze.\n\n Apple TV+ enters the night with unprecedented momentum. Its critically acclaimed psychological thriller “Severance” leads all programs with 27 nominations. HBO Max’s “The Penguin,” a gritty Batman spinoff, follows with 24. Meanwhile, Apple’s dark comedy “The Studio” — the razor-sharp satire of Hollywood — tied the all-time record for most comedy series nominations with 23.\n\n Many industry pundits project a historic showing for Apple TV+, with many predicting it will take home both drama (“Severance”) and comedy series (“The Studio”). Variety is inclined to agree. If achieved, it would mark the first time one network has won both top races since HBO accomplished the feat in 2016 with “Game of Thrones” and “Veep.”\n\n If our predictions hold, “The Studio” will lead all shows with 12 wins, followed by “Severance” and “The Penguin” with nine each. Netflix’s “Adolescence,” the moving psychological limited series, is forecast to collect eight including the top miniseries race. NBC’s “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” could round out the top five with a projected six statuettes.\n\n On the platform level, Netflix is projected to top the leaderboard with 25 total wins, edging out Apple TV+ (24) and HBO Max (23). The latter set an all-time nomination record with 142. The record for most wins is shared between CBS and Netflix who both won 44 in 1974 and 2021. \n\n Other networks rounding out the top five would be NBC following with 11, then Disney+ and Peacock with six and five, respectively. \n\n “Severance” is expected to collect big wins in directing (Ben Stiller), writing (“Cold Harbor” by Dan Erickson) and cinematography for double nominee Jessica Lee Gagné. However, we can’t count out HBO Max’s freshman medical drama “The Pitt.” Going into the Emmys, the show recently won program of the year at the Television Critics Association Awards, an accolade that has often predicted Emmy upsets, including past shockers like Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” and Prime Video’s “Fleabag.”\n\n Meanwhile, “The Penguin” remains a viable spoiler in the limited series space, especially for Colin Farrell’s lead performance that could also bring in co-star Cristin Milioti, if she can manage to sneak past Michelle Williams for FX’s “Dying for Sex.” The dark comic thriller also leads projections in makeup, production design, prosthetics, sound editing and visual effects.\n\n And in the guest drama actor category, a win for 86-year-old Scott Glenn (“The White Lotus”) would make him the oldest acting winner in the category ever, surpassing James Whitmore, who won at age 78 for “The Practice” in 2000.\n\n CBS’s “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” widely expected to win talk series, could finally break its Emmy curse. The long-running show is currently zero for 33 at the Emmys, making it the second-most nominated show without a win — just behind “Better Call Saul” (zero for 53).\n\n Comedian Adam Sandler could also make history for himself. The “SNL” alum is double-nominated for his Netflix special “Adam Sandler: Love You” and the “SNL50” song “50 Years.” A win in either category would mark his first-ever Emmy victory.\n\n NBC’s “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” is a frontrunner in Variety Special (Live), as well as Directing and Writing for a Variety Special. Netflix is expected to sweep documentary and animation categories, with “Simone Biles: Rising,” “Will and Harper” and “Arcane” all favored.\n\n In reality categories, Peacock’s “The Traitors” is predicted to win both Competition Program and Reality Host (Alan Cumming). “Love on the Spectrum” leads unstructured reality predictions, while ABC’s “Shark Tank” continues its structured reality reign.\n\n The final predictions are below.\n\n Drama Series: Will Win: “Severance” (Apple TV+)Could Win: “The Pitt” (HBO Max)Should Win: “Andor” (Disney+)Should Have Been Nominated: “The Agency”

I’m not yours to silence I never was.’ O’Donnell fired back.\n\nTrump’s rivalry with O’Donnell goes back to nearly two decades in 2006 when the comedian slammed Trump on ‘The View’ over his management of the Miss USA contest.\n\nDuring a 2015 Republican primary debate, Megyn Kelly confronted Trump over his use of derogatory language to describe women he dislikes.\n\nThen-candidate Trump famously replied, ‘Only Rosie O’Donnell.’\n\nO’Donnell, who was born in the U.S., probably does not have to worry about Trump actually pulling her citizenship anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not give the president the authority to strip citizenship from a native-born American.\n\nO’Donnell moved to Ireland earlier this year following Trump’s landslide electoral victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nThe Hollywood comedian said the current political climate in the U.S. is the reason she left.\n\n‘When it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,’ O’Donnell told her fans on TikTok at the time.\n\nShe is reportedly still in the process of obtaining her Irish citizenship to become a dual citizen.\n\nO'Donnell recently found herself in hot water following the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that left two children dead when she posted a video claiming the shooter was a Trump supporter and a White supremacist. \n\nThe comedian later took down the video after the identity of the shooter was revealed, and made an apology on social media. \n\n'I knew a lot of you were very upset about the video I made before I went away for a few days,' O'Donnell said. 'You are right. I did not do my due diligence before I made that emotional statement, and I said things about the shooter that were incorrect.","summary":"Trump reopened the old conflict by threatening to strip the comedian of her U.S. citizenship while she lives in Ireland full time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15065547/Trump-Rosie-ODonnells-citizenship.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/13/101822543-0-image-m-16_1756988323238.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 13:19:29","author":"Editor,Phillip Nieto","authors":["Editor","Phillip Nieto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":357384780,"title":"Exclusive Poll: JD Vance Thrashing Gavin Newsom Across 5 of 7 Swing States in 2028 Presidential Matchup","text":"Vice President JD Vance handily defeated Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) across seven battleground states in a theoretical presidential election matchup, according to a poll exclusively obtained by Breitbart News.\n\nPlymouth Union Public Research conducted a poll across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — seven key battleground states that could decide if Republicans would hold the White House after President Donald Trump wraps up his second term in office.\n\nAcross seven battleground states, 51 percent of likely voters said they would prefer to vote for Vance, while 49 percent would vote for Newsom. The survey found that Vance won the election in five out of the seven swing states. It also found that Vance is winning Democrats at a higher clip, or nine percent, than Newsom is winning Republicans, or seven percent.\n\n 2025_9.3_PUP-Memo by Breitbart News \n\nWhen polling presidential candidates, 27 percent of voters had a very favorable image of the vice president and a 21 percent favorable view of Newsom. On the obverse side, 45 percent of voters had a negative view of him, giving Vance a three percent net positive image.\n\nIn contrast to the vice president, 16 percent of voters had a very favorable view of the governor of California, 21 percent had a somewhat favorable view of him, 25 percent had never heard of the leader of the Golden State, while 14 percent had a somewhat negative view of him, and 24 percent had a very unfavorable image of Newsom.\n\nOther potential Democrat presidential candidates’ favorability includes:\n\nForty-nine percent of likely voters have a favorable view of former Vice President Kamala Harris, while 46 percent have a negative image of her.\nForty-three percent have a positive image of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), while 37 percent have a negative view; however, 20 percent have never heard of Walz, who was Harris’s vice presidential candidate.\nThirty-nine percent of voters had a positive view of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, while 32 percent have a negative image. Thirty percent of voters have not heard of him.\nThirty-nine percent of voters have a positive view of Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and 25 percent have a bad image of him, and 36 percent have not heard of the leader of the Keystone State.\n\nThe poll was conducted after Trump said that Vance could “most likely” be the “heir apparent” to lead the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.\n\n“Well, I think most likely, in all fairness. He’s the vice president,” Trump said. “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form.”\n\nAn Emerson College poll released in July found that Vance could beat Newsom and other potential Democrat presidential candidates, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nVance also handily won the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Republican presidential candidate straw poll.\n\nThe survey found that roughly two-thirds of those polled backed President Trump’s “America First Investment” policies.\n\nSixty-six percent of voters agreed with this statement, “President Trump’s America First Foreign Investment policy is designed to make America the world’s greatest destination for investment while protecting America’s national security interests. Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening our world-leading private and public capital markets is a key part of America’s Golden Age.” Forty-one percent of Democrats and 36 percent of Kamala Harris voters support this idea.\n\nEighty percent of voters also backed the idea of having foreign companies make their products in the United States in partnership with American companies to “maximize the benefit” to the American economy.\n\n“Some American companies that conduct business in China are forced to partner with Chinese-based corporations, which are often controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” the statement read.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Harris voters and 75 percent of Democrats and independents agreed with this statement. Voters between the ages of 18 and 29 ranked the lowest on this sentiment; however, 68 percent of them agreed.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of voters, or 71 percent, backed the idea of leveling the playing field with China. These voters agree that the U.S. government should require Chinese companies that want to do business in America to be partially owned by the government, as often happens when American companies want to do business in the Middle Kingdom.\n\nPlymouth Union Public Research conducted the poll from August 8-10, using a sample of 1,000 likely voters across seven battleground states.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance handily defeated Gov.

Alex Padilla running for California governor? Why Democrats are speculating about a 2026 bid","text":"For now, the rumors about a potential Sen. Alex Padilla for California governor run are just that, rumors.\n\nBut they’ve certainly got Democratic operatives and consultants talking — even as Padilla and his camp remain loudly mum on the possibility.\n\nThe focus for California’s senior senator, said Padilla spokesperson Edgar Rodriguez when asked about the gubernatorial rumors on Wednesday, remains on California’s upcoming special election on redistricting. That’s been the party line in the past few weeks, since the rumor mill really started churning, and what Padilla himself has said in recent interviews.\n\nThat’s not a confirmation of a 2026 candidacy — but it’s certainly not a firm no either.\n\nThat’s part because a strong, clear frontrunner has yet to emerge in the governor’s race, particularly since former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would not run for governor.\n\nAnd that’s also part because of Padilla’s political resume and temperament, experts said.\n\n“Padilla would be a formidable candidate. … I’m sure folks are worried about the current state of the race, potentially having a governor who is harder to work with,” said Ajay Mohan, a Democratic political consultant in California. “Padilla would have a field-clearing effect, second to none.”\n\nPadilla “brings a level of visibility and recognition that would make him the candidate to beat,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\nPolitical parallels for Padilla\n\nPadilla, 52, was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 when the seat was vacated by Harris to become the country’s vice president. He ran for, and won, a full six-year term in 2022, becoming California’s first Latino to hold a full-term seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRaised in Pacoima, the son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla’s entry into politics in the early 1990s was fueled by the politics of the late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A., amid the city’s growing Latino base.\n\nThose politics were defined much in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant sentiment. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, health care and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down, but the fervor propelled Padilla and many in his generation into public service. He would join protests against Prop. 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nTom Hogen-Esch, a professor of political science at Cal State Northridge, sees political parallels in the current moment, a time when the Trump administration’s mass immigration dragnet has swept the nation, hitting California — indeed, Padilla’s own hometown of Pacoima — hard.\n\nCut to the image of Padilla on June 12, at the Department of Homeland Security press office, amid the initial ramp-up of the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles.\n\nThere, Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials when he tried to ask questions. Video showed Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room, before officers pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back.\n\nHogen-Esch said it was unclear whether that could be a “motivating factor” for many voters next year.\n\nBut “to see a U.S. senator body-slammed, kind of embodies some of the political dynamics,” he said.\n\n“I’m not sure others in the race so far can make that kind of argument,” Hogen-Esch said, referencing Padilla’s journey from a working-class San Fernando Valley town to high-profile Trump critic in the U.S. Senate to that day when he was handcuffed on national TV.\n\nPadilla vs. the rest of the crowded field\n\nWith Democratic candidates relatively indistinguishable on policy, “it’s a matter of who’s the best messenger. But I think Padilla can speak to the moment in a way that some of the other contenders won’t be able to,” said Hogen-Esch, an expert on L.A. and California politics.\n\n“I think what the voters are going to look at is not only the experience and the capacity to lead, but also the ‘warriorness’ that is needed,” Richard Polanco, a former state Senate majority leader, who has led efforts to increase the statewide number of Democratic legislators.\n\nName recognition and a long list of party connections could make Padilla an instant frontrunner in the race, generate big campaign dollars and perhaps cause some lesser-known potential candidates to back down from running, pundits said.\n\n“He becomes a tier 1 candidate immediately,” said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist.\n\nTrujillo speculated a Padilla entrance in the race would impact former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra the most, among declared candidates. He noted the two boast similar portfolios — both have worked in Washington, both have served in the state legislature and both would benefit from D.C.-based relationships and donors.\n\n“Becerra isn’t in office anywhere,” Trujillo noted. “If you’re a lobbyist in D.C., if Padilla runs, he’s still going to be a U.S. senator and still going to be critical on bills in the Senate or in committee right now. A better insurance policy is to bet on Padilla rather than Becerra, because if he does come up short, he’s going to remember everyone who supported him for governor.”\n\n“If you’re in D.C., you want to make sure he has a happy memory of you.”\n\nThe current field of candidates, said Schnur, the political analyst who has worked on multiple California gubernatorial campaigns, is not lacking messages. “It just lacks the recognizable messengers,” he said.\n\nPadilla is particularly interesting because while he is temperamentally more moderate, he tracks more progressive on issues, said Schnur, and that could leave a pathway for a more centrist candidate, such as former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, to compete with him.\n\nBut on the progressive front, a Padilla candidacy would hurt Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter the most, Schnur speculated.\n\nAnd then there’s also another potential candidate: Billionaire developer Rick Caruso, the recent, unsuccessful candidate for L.A. mayor, said Wednesday he is “seriously looking” into running for California governor.\n\nTrujillo believes a Padilla candidacy would disrupt Caruso’s chances the most. Without Harris in the race, Caruso had more of a lane, he said, but Padilla narrows that substantially.\n\n“This absolutely disrupts Rick Caruso’s decision-making process once again,” he said.\n\nStill, Polanco, who supports Villaraigosa in the governor’s race, also pointed to parallels between the moment and the early 1990s era of intense anti-immigrant fervor in California.\n\nHe said the political price that Republicans paid for those years has resulted in a state where Democrats dominate, and where a Latino has a shot at the governor’s seat.\n\nThe current moment, like back when former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was campaigning for Prop. 187, will propel an increase in new voters, coming of age in 2026.\n\nThat could catalyze a Latino into office.\n\nPeople “will be able to look and say yes, the time is now, irrespective of ethnicity,” said Polanco.","summary":"California's senior senator hasn't ruled out a campaign.

The Illinois governor had his comeback ready","text":"Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz launched into an attack on Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, even making a jibe about his weight, during an interview about President Trump’s crime crackdown. \n\nSpeaking on Chris Salcedo’s Newsmax show, Cruz was asked about Gov. Pritzker’s opposition to Trump’s plan to send National Guard troops into Chicago to support local law enforcement, as he has done in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., this summer.\n\nAfter Salcedo ran a clip of the governor delivering a press conference, the senator responded: “Chris, you really know how to p*** me off. What a disgusting, racist bigot JB Pritzker is.” \n\nCruz was seemingly taking offense at comments made by the governor about ICE agents targeting Latinos and continued: “Listen, I don’t want to get between JB Pritzker and the Domino’s Pizza line, but I’ll tell you what I am willing to get between is him and his open doors for every human trafficker, every drug trafficker, every MS-13 and Tren De Aragua gang member.\n\nPritzker wasted no time in responding to a clip of the exchange shared on X, remarking: “And I would never want to get between Ted and a trip to Cancun when there’s an emergency in Texas.” \n\nThe slam alluded to the senator’s ill-advised vacation to the Mexican beach resort in February 2021 while his state was being battered by a winter storm that left millions of residents without power and running water, forcing him to return home early under a cloud.\n\nCruz finished his remarks saying: “The Democrats claim that Latinos support illegal immigration. Well, I’ve got news for you, JB, in the state of Texas in 2024, Donald Trump carried the Latino vote and so did I, because our community, like every community, are the victims of the violence of these illegal aliens and gang members that the Democrats trafficked into this country.”\n\nFifty-five percent of Texas Latinos did vote for Trump in last year’s presidential election but, nationally, the Republican candidate picked up just 43 percent of the demographic’s support, compared to 55 percent for Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nAt his press conference on Tuesday, Pritzker expressed his objection to having National Guardsmen descend on the streets of Chicago by saying: “I’m aware that the President of the United States likes to go on television and beg me to call and ask him for troops. I find this extraordinarily strange as Chicago does not want troops on our streets.”\n\nIn attacking ICE and its anti-immigration raids, he said: “They don’t actually care if you’re here and undocumented, they just care if your skin color is a little off of theirs, and if you’re Latino, they’re just going to target you... If they want to celebrate Mexican Independence Day [on September 16], they ought to be able to do that without being terrorized.”\n\nFormer Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot has also rebuked Trump over the planned deployment, telling CNN this week: “This is about two things: it’s about power and it’s about money. \n\n“He wants to exercise his power, he wants to scare the heck out of immigrant communities, and he wants to use the pretense of the National Guard or the military coming into Chicago to boost up the ICE numbers.”","summary":"Texas senator mocks Illinois governor in Newsmax tirade, only for the Democrat to immediately hit back with a reminder of the Republican’s infamous Cancun vacation","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ted-cruz-jb-pritzker-newsmax-b2820037.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/11/34/Ted-Cruz.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UGZql6uy-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-04 12:24:50","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":357374190,"title":"RFK Jr Confronts Intense Senate Scrutiny Amid Rising Resignation Demands","text":"Support Our Cause\n\nSupport Our Cause\n\n Search for:\n\n HomeLocal newsRFK Jr Confronts Intense Senate Scrutiny Amid Rising Resignation Demands\n\nLocal news \n\nRFK Jr Confronts Intense Senate Scrutiny Amid Rising Resignation Demands\n\n \n\n Up next \n\n \n\n \n\nMan Accused of Trying to Set Roommates on Fire Over Lease Renewal Dispute: Police\n\n Published on 04 September 2025\n\n Internewscast \n\nresignation,\n\nSenate \n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nIE 11 is not supported.

But in the world of social justice activism, the fat advocacy movement demonstrates an astute commitment to equity doctrine, the broader progressive theory of fairness from which all other social justice movements flow.\n\nIN FOCUS: CALIFORNIA’S MARIJUANA MARKET: FROM HIGH HOPES TO ‘COMPLETE FAILURE’\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd in 2020, the term “equity” burst into American life, emerging as a guiding principle across institutions. Schools, businesses, sports leagues, media companies, and even churches suddenly adopted the term as a foundational principle. \n\nThe problem, however, was that hardly anyone understood what “equity” really meant, operating as if it implied a kind of “super equality,” a perfecting of the Christian concept that all people possess the same ultimate and inherent value. \n\nBut the truth behind “equity,” understood well by the radicals who developed the concept and continue pushing it into the mainstream, couldn’t be more different. Unlike the Christian notion that equal opportunities should be afforded to all as a consequence of equality before God, equity demands equal outcomes as a result of flattened hierarchies and erased differences. \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris correctly articulated the concept during the 2020 campaign, saying that “equitable treatment means we all end up in the same place.” (Incidentally, Harris’s frequent refrain that America should be “unburdened by what has been” also echoes the writing of Karl Marx).\n\nFor fat activists — I’m not being rude here, they prefer the term “fat” to overweight or obese because those terms suggest a problem that needs solving — the mission is to ensure equal outcomes by eliminating social stigma and ensuring legal protections against weight-based discrimination. Like their progressive activist counterparts, they maintain that fat people are inherently oppressed and that their oppression intersects with other forms, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. They see their fat body types as an immutable characteristic, no different than the color of their skin or hair. This enables fatness to be counted among the oppressed categories. \n\nThat means fatness must not be regarded as a medical condition, but as a mere difference. Unequal outcomes for the fat must be exclusively understood as the result of social stigma and bias. Any hint of fatness being the result of individual choices shifts responsibility from society to the individual, rendering it out of bounds for equity-based activism. It is impossible to get everyone to “end up in the same place” if individual choices play a key role. All oppressed conditions must be something that cannot be helped.\n\nAs with their trans activist counterparts, fat activists promote alternative science to deliver ideologically correct conclusions. \n\nMarilyn Wann, a “weight diversity speaker” and author of Fat!So?, argues that the causal link between excess weight and other illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer has yet to be firmly established.\n\n“The assumption that being fat causes diseases like diabetes or heart disease is based on correlation, not causation,” she said in an interview with The Fat Studies Reader. “Thin people get these diseases too, and we don’t scrutinize their lifestyles the same way. The focus on weight distracts from systemic issues like poverty or medical bias, which have clearer impacts on health outcomes.”\n\nA mountain of science contradicts this claim. A 2021 American Heart Association study found that obesity contributes to cardiovascular risk factors and independently increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Meanwhile, the British Journal of Cancer found that obesity is causally associated with a variety of cancers. \n\nThe conclusion that obesity significantly contributes to serious diseases is firmly established in mainstream science.\n\nBut for Ani Janzen, operations and project leader at the Association for Size Diversity in Health, poor health outcomes for fat people are the result of biases in the healthcare system. She told the Journal, “The unfortunate reality is that a lot of the time, fat people don’t get the care they need, which can result in healthcare disparities. It’s an awful Catch-22 because those disparities are then used to enforce the idea that larger people are in worse health than people are in smaller bodies.”\n\nThe fat activists’ strategy, as with all other equity-based movements, is threefold: produce alternative science, impugn real science, and then blame society for being insufficiently enlightened. \n\nTo be sure, the spread of ideologically driven junk science is dangerous. We have only begun to understand the damage inflicted upon an entire generation by gender ideology. The foot soldiers of these ideologies deserve to be held fully accountable.\n\nBut the elite institutions that give these faux-intellectuals a perch bear greater responsibility for amplifying their influence and legitimizing their claims. Many of our most prestigious universities offer courses in “Fat Studies” that promote fatness as a social construct instead of a medical condition, while advocating for things like “fat liberation” and “size equity.”\n\nThe University of Maryland, for example, offers a course called “Fat Studies: Intersection of Blackness and Fatness” that, according to the syllabus, “emphasizes fatness as a social justice issue” that “intersects with other systems of oppression.”\n\nPrinceton University also offers courses in Fat Studies, including one titled “FAT: The F-Word and the Public Body.” A key course text, Queering Fat Embodiment, dismisses the obesity epidemic as “alleged” and argues that fatness has been unfairly subjected to “medicalization, pathologization, and commodification.”\n\nBrown University offers a Fat Studies course in its pre-college summer offerings for high school students called “The F-Word: Examining the Science, Culture, and Politics of Fatness.” This course explores the “pathologization of fatness in the medical community and the rising prevalence of eating disorders, as well as how fatphobia intersects with other systems of oppression.”\n\nUniversities that offer such courses should be ashamed of themselves. Prioritizing ideological narratives over scientific consensus risks real-world harm and further erodes public trust, which is already at an all-time low. Universities are meant to be the gatekeepers of reason, not amplifiers of ideological gibberish. \n\nIN FOCUS: DO DEMOCRATS WANT THE GOP TO TAKE OVER THEIR CITIES?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.’s stint at the Department of Health and Human Services has drawn the well-earned ire of many for his anti-vaccination extremism — the Washington Examiner’s most recent In Focus Forum skewered him for it. But on the topic of America’s obesity crisis and what needs to be done to solve it, the Ivy League makes RFK Jr. look like Jonas Salk. \n\nThe first step in overcoming any addiction, whether to food, alcohol, or ideology, is to admit you have a problem. That would be a good place for our elite universities to start regarding the ballooning field of Fat Studies. They should give themselves a good look in the mirror and ask themselves if they like what they see.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Kennedy Jr., Erica Roach found a Facebook group of women who homeschooled their kids and embraced wellness.\n\nAs some moms today who seek more natural lifestyles for their families are also anti-vaccine, so were some of Roach’s Facebook friends.\n\nBy the time her fourth child was born, Roach said, she was “pretty anti-vax,” declining vaccines in her baby’s first year after initial shots at the hospital. \n\n“I was just kind of in [the Facebook group], slowly getting radicalized to different things,” Roach told Raw Story.\n\nRoach said her beliefs soon became more extreme, and she ended up following a path that led to QAnon, the far-right conspiracy movement whose “outrageous” premise revolved around Donald Trump waging war on Satan-worshipping cannibalistic pedophiles among supposed Democratic elites in Hollywood and the federal government.\n\nComing out of the “extremism group” took months, Roach said, and led to her being doxxed — seeing private information shared online. \n\n“My house was attempted to be broken into. Somebody had called the sheriffs and [Child Protective Services] and anonymously said I was in a pedophile ring,” Roach said. \n\n“As much as it scared me, all those things, it emboldened me. It’s like I want nothing to do with people who will do this to me.”\n\nRoach has now joined communities of “former-something extremists,” among them Leaving MAGA, a growing online community of former Trump supporters. \n\n“It's remarkable how much happier I am,” Roach said, noting that her relationships and physical health have improved since she left QAnon and MAGA.\n\n‘Mortifying’\n\nRoach’s path to extremism started when her ex-boyfriend began sending her “Q-drops,” messages from the anonymous figurehead of QAnon. \n\n“He kept telling me that Trump was going to save the world,” said Roach. \n\nInitially she was skeptical — after all, she had disliked both candidates in the 2016 election, Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \n\nBut in her early 20s, Roach had dabbled in conspiracy theories, “getting into the Alex Jones type of craziness,” referring to the InfoWars host, and once considering herself a “9/11 truther,” convinced the terror attacks on New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001 were an “inside job.”\n\n“It's so mortifying to admit out loud, but that's what kind of started me on this path,” Roach said. \n\nBetween her history and the moms’ Facebook group, when COVID-19 hit, Roach said she was “primed” to embrace QAnon. Soon she was spending between 18 to 24 hours a day as an administrator of a “pretty big Q-influencers channel” on Telegram, a platform popular with right-wing extremists.\n\n“I listened to [Trump’s] pressers every day, religiously, at my dinner table with my kids because I wanted to know what was going on, and I was scared of COVID,” Roach said.\n\n“I had believed that COVID was the tool that was supposed to enact this depopulation agenda.”\n\nWhen Trump announced Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to accelerate development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Roach said “it was confusing.”\n\n“All the people that I trusted, all the people I communicated with every day, were saying this vaccine is going to kill us all,” Roach said.\n\nWith Trump as the hero of the QAnon movement, reconciling vaccine conspiracies with his actions required “mental gymnastics,” Roach said.\n\nBut “it was just enough to make me start questioning things because I was like, ‘This doesn't make any sense,’” she said.\n\nRoach monitored Telegram channels for anyone posting negatively about “Q” or Q supporters, such as former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood.\n\nIn a channel critical of Wood, Roach began noticing “inconsistencies” with beliefs she held and also articles questioning Trump’s “gross abuse of power” and millions of dollars made during his first term. \n\n“It was enough to be like, there's something wrong with me, not them,” she said. \n\nRoach said she reached out to the channel administrator, who met her “with nothing but kindness and empathy and genuine caring.” \n\n“When you're anonymous, and you're in an extremist group, you don't know what's on the other side waiting for you because you're under the impression that they're going to eat you alive for believing in this stuff,” Roach said.\n\nThrough the administrator, Roach connected with someone who debunked QAnon conspiracies. Still, Roach wasn’t fully out of her QAnon world by the time of the 2020 election and wished there was “some magical way for Trump to stay” in office when Joe Biden won, she said.\n\nA friend offered to pay for Roach’s travel from New York state to Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021, but she wasn’t able to arrange childcare.\n\n“I watched it live all day, knowing that people who represented the cause I believed in … were there, and I was horrified, completely horrified,” Roach said. \n\n“Watching them attack the Capitol, attack police officers, the things that they were saying, it stopped me on a dime. I've never wanted to distance myself so much from something because I realized this isn't peaceful. This is violence. This is an attempted coup.” \n\n‘Fighting back’\n\nRoach extracted herself from QAnon via four to five months of “re-educating” herself, she said.\n\nA restaurant worker, she went back to college to study medical billing and coding. Last month, she self-published a book, “Leaving The Mirror World,” about her departure from QAnon.\n\nShe voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 and was disappointed the US did not elect its first female president. \n\n“I voted down-ballot blue, and I will till the day I die,” Roach said. \n\n“I know the destruction that's in the minds of the Republican Party, and I could never support that again.”\n\nRoach said her former QAnon friends were “cheering on” Trump’s second presidency, particularly the building of detention camps for migrants and the deployment of the National Guard in major cities, which she found “disgusting” and “sadistic.”\n\n“Everything that's happened so far was outlined in Project 2025,” Roach said of the right-wing policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation, a far-right think tank.\n\n“It is a conspiracy theorist’s wet dream that this is all happening to their enemies.”\n\nNonetheless Roach said watching “hundreds” of neighbors protest against Trump on a bridge in her town every Saturday made her optimistic.\n\n“That's something uniquely American, I think,” she said. “That we're not going to destroy everything without fighting back.”","summary":"Long before “crunchy” moms championed the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda of Robert F.

He turned up over the holiday weekend, heading to the golf course with grandchildren, which he also did the following day.\n\n“I didn’t do anything for two days, and they said, ‘There must be something wrong with him,’” Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. “I was very active over the weekend. I went out to visit some people at the club that I own pretty nearby on the Potomac River. No — I’ve been very active, actually.”\n\nWhat is most interesting about the interlude is the absolute glee among Democrats and liberals. Call it TDS (Trump death syndrome). While Republicans often speculated on President Biden’s mental acuity — he was, after all, running the most powerful country in the world, and he could hardly utter a coherent sentence — none openly wished for his death.\n\nLike a phantom limb that aches long after amputation, Democrats are experiencing political pain from a presidency they keep insisting is already over. The recent “Trump is dead” social media frenzy wasn’t just wishful thinking; it was a full-blown celebration, complete with artificial-intelligence-generated caskets and virtual headstones.\n\nHere’s where the metaphor gets deliciously twisted: While Democrats are busy planning Mr. Trump’s political funeral, they’re the ones flatlining.\n\nDemocrats lost more than 2 million registered voters from the 2020 to 2024 presidential elections, while Republicans gained 2.4 million, The New York Times reported. What’s more, a recent CNBC survey shows the Democratic Party’s net favorability has plummeted by -32 percentage points among registered voters. The party now holds just a 24% positive rating and a 56% negative rating, “the lowest rating for either party going back to at least 1996.” According to Gallup, 76% of Republicans are satisfied with the country’s direction, versus less than 1% of Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, the party’s financial situation mirrors its other serious troubles. After its devastating 2024 elections, the Democratic National Committee trails the Republican National Committee by nearly every fundraising metric. By June’s end, the RNC held $80 million; the Democrats, just $15 million.\n\nHence the death wish for Mr. Trump. Some went over the top, like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who got crushed along with former Vice President Kamala Harris in November, in openly wishing for the commander in chief’s demise.\n\n“Look, I get it,” he told a group of supporters at a festival Monday. “You get up in the morning and you doom scroll through things. And although I will say this, the last few days, you woke up thinking there might be news. Just saying, just saying. There will be news sometime. Just so you know, there will be news.”\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is clearly planning a run for the White House in 2028, demanded “proof of life” from Mr. Trump, but the request would have been far more apt for the Democratic Party itself.\n\nDemocrats have long hoped for Mr. Trump’s death. Last September, after an armed assassin was arrested near where Mr. Trump was golfing, 28% said America would “be better off” if the president had been killed, Rasmussen’s Napolitan News Institute found. Another 25% said they were “not sure.”\n\nThe madness has been going on for a while. When images of Mr. Trump’s swollen ankles surfaced in July, Democrats didn’t see a medical condition; they saw an obituary waiting to happen. The conspiracy theory got so far afield that a British newspaper quoted someone named Dr. Mimmie Kwong, an expert in vascular surgery, saying Mr. Trump might need to have his leg amputated.\n\nThe beautiful irony is that Democrats keep trying to amputate Trump from American politics, but the patient (democracy) keeps rejecting the surgery. Like a skilled surgeon who refuses to remove a healthy limb, voters keep reattaching what Democrats desperately want to cut off.\n\nThe real medical emergency isn’t Mr. Trump’s ankles; it’s the Democratic Party’s complete circulatory failure. While they’re busy checking for Mr. Trump’s pulse, their own political arteries are completely blocked. CBS News can edit all the interviews it wants, but it can’t edit reality: The patient they keep declaring dead is doing jumping jacks while they’re on life support.\n\nPerhaps it’s time for Democrats to stop playing doctor with other people’s mortality and start performing some emergency surgery on their own political body. After all, the only thing more embarrassing than celebrating someone’s fake death is doing it while you’re actually dying yourself.\n\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

Subscribe here!\n\nJoe Biden was AWOL -almost his entire presidency and on the few occasions he was encountered by the press, he alternately whispered, yelled, fell over or shuffled about like a cadaver. Yet all the same people who turned a blind eye to Biden’s infirmities and routinely castigated the rest of us — “He’s sharp as a tack! Stop being ageist! Cheap Fakes!” — are now questioning Trump’s health.\n\nIn a 2,000-word piece written by three reporters Tuesday, The New York Times revisited the bruises on Trump’s hand that they keep pretending are sinister but just come from vigorous handshaking with large numbers of people, something Biden was never at risk of doing.\n\n“His ankles are swollen. He is the oldest person to be elected president,” they wrote, while acknowledging a “wishful-thinking industry around Trump’s health [and] legal woes.”\n\nAt 79, the president demonstrates an enormous capacity for vigorous action, morning, noon and night. What drives his opponents mad is they can’t keep up.\n\nThat’s why the entire Democratic Party apparatus is keyed in to the elimination of Trump.\n\nNo answer to victories\n\nHe has shown them up badly, and they have no answer to his victories, whether on illegal migration, big-city crime, cutting taxes, ending wars, boosting the economy, kicking biological boys out of girls’ sports, canceling vaccine mandates, Making America Healthy Again and all the other commonsense prescriptions he is energetically putting into place.\n\nThey can’t seem to counter him or change course and have no leader other than a snake oil salesman named Gavin with slicked-back hair and bizarre hand gestures who tries unsuccessfully to imitate Trump. \n\nSo they have retreated into the delusion that, if only Trump were gone, all their problems would vanish.\n\nTheir constant framing of Trump as “Hitler,” “authoritarian fascist” and an “existential threat” who must be stopped at all costs fosters a climate in which death threats against the president are normalized.\n\nThis week, Washington, DC, grand juries let off two nutjobs charged with repeatedly threatening to assassinate the president. \n\nOne was a New York woman who posted on Facebook that she wanted to “sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea” and was arrested by the Secret Service at a “No Fascist Takeover of DC” rally outside the White House.\n\nAfter Trump survived two assassination attempts during the 2024 election campaign, liberal feeds lit up with regret. \n\nOne-third of Democratic voters surveyed by a British politics professor in a small snap poll published in UnHerd in July 2024 agreed with the statement, “I wish Trump’s assassin hadn’t missed.”\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey typified the casual malice when he posted an Instagram photo of seashells that spelled out the numbers “8647,” which he captioned: “Cool shell formation on my beach walk.”\n\nThe number 86 is a slang term meaning “to get rid of” or “kill,” and Trump is the 47th president. \n\nSo Comey’s message was a pretty clear incitement to violence for which he was investigated by the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nOf course, he pretended he had no idea what the numbers meant: “I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence.”\n\nAs if a guy with decades in law enforcement who rose to the top of an intelligence agency that specializes in national security threats wasn’t adept at interpreting coded assassination threats.\n\nTrump knew better: “That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear. Now, he wasn’t very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant.”\n\nChi-town incitement\n\nThen there is Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who has no solution to the violence that claimed eight lives in his city over the weekend. \n\nOn Monday at a protest rally, he bordered on inciting violence against federal troops whom Trump has threatened to send in to clean up crime.\n\n“Are you prepared to defend this land that was built by slaves?” he shouted. \n\n“Are you prepared to defend this land?”\n\nEarlier he told MSNBC: “The people of this city are accustomed to rising up against tyranny and if that’s necessary, I believe the people of Chicago will stand firm.”\n\nRise up or stand firm. \n\nThe message is clear.\n\nViolence is encouraged, or at least condoned, by Democrats with nothing to offer, just as it was in 2020 when luminaries from -Kamala Harris to Minnesota First Lady Gwen “I want to smell burning tires” Walz welcomed the mayhem of the George Floyd anti-cop riots.\n\nThis is not normal. \n\nA collapsing political party is as dangerous as an animal in its death throes.","summary":"Over the Labor Day weekend, instead of enjoying the last days of summer with family and friends, Democrats and other Trump-deranged folk had nothing better to do than indulge in sick fantasies about the president’s death.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/03/opinion/the-dems-have-nothing-better-to-do-than-to-portray-a-fantasy-of-trumps-demise/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DLEDEE.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 01:36:41","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":357208276,"title":"Bari Weiss Set for Top Role at CBS News as Paramount Closes in on Free Press Acquisition","text":"Paramount is on the verge of acquiring Bari Weiss’ right-leaning Free Press news organization, with Weiss set for a top role in running CBS News, TheWrap has learned.\n\nThe deal, which is being finalized by Paramount’s lawyers and was first reported by Puck on Wednesday, sets CBS News on a course for a more conservative approach in line with CEO David Ellison’s vision. TheWrap’s reporting suggests it’s likely that Weiss will run CBS News.\n\nWeiss, who founded Free Press in 2022 after leaving the New York Times where she was an opinion columnist, is respected by some for her independent approach and her critique of mainstream media as too woke, but criticized by others for giving a pass to powerful people with whom she agrees such as Elon Musk when he bought Twitter in 2022 and Peter Thiel who she interviewed sympathetically earlier this year on her podcast, declining to push back on non-answers.\n\nParamount declined to comment. Weiss did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. \n\nCBS News has been the subject of a political tug-of-war and a target of the Trump administration, which extracted a $16 million settlement from a lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. As part of the Skydance merger, Paramount agreed to place an internal ombudsman to ensure that the news organization was even-handed as part of its negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\nIn one of its first moves after taking over Paramount, the Ellison-led leadership eliminated DEI initiatives at Paramount altogether. \n\nThe tug of war with the Trump administration continued just this week when Kristi Noem, who heads the Department of Homeland Security, accused the network of a “whitewash” when it chose not to air her full remarks on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who the Trump administration wrongly deported in March and has since tried to remove from the country. \n\nNoem disparaged Abrego Garcia as a “known human smuggler” and “MS-13 gang member,” allegations unproven in court. The network defended the interview on “Face the Nation.” \n\nCBS News has long been one of the most respected brands in journalism, with veterans from Walter Cronkite to Edward R. Murrow as part of the network’s esteemed legacy. A stable of star journalists at “60 Minutes” include Anderson Cooper, Bill Whitaker and Lesley Stahl among others. \n\nAs a journalist who comes from the opinion columns rather than the trenches of news-gathering, Weiss is sure to raise opposition within the newsroom ranks of CBS News as a top decision-maker, especially in the wake of the departure of venerated “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon, both of whom cited corporate meddling in the news division as the reason for their resignations.\n\nAn individual with knowledge of the deal said that Paramount did expect there to be resignations as a result of Weiss’ acquisition.\n\nWeiss has been reported as seeking $200 million for the sale of The Free Press, but the individual with knowledge said the sale price was expected to be lower than that.\n\nWeiss resigned from The New York Times in July 2020, citing what she described as a hostile work environment to ideological diversity. In her resignation letter, which she posted publicly, Weiss accused the paper of fostering an “illiberal environment” where dissenting views were met with open hostility from colleagues.

It is seen as a successful response to progressive media and mainstream outlets that lean to the left. The site consistently publishes pro-Israel writers and also showcases journalists who abandon mainstream media, such as Ari Berliner, a former senior business editor for NPR who left over alleged left-wing bias. \n\nIn a 2024 essay, Berliner argued that NPR had shifted from an “open-minded, curious culture” to one dominated by a progressive worldview—claiming that a lack of diverse views had undermined public trust in the outlet.","summary":"The deal is close to $200 million, an individual with knowledge tells TheWrap\n\n\nThe post Bari Weiss Set for Top Role at CBS News as Paramount Closes in on Free Press Acquisition appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bari-weiss-cbs-news-paramount-free-press/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bweiss.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 01:22:37","author":"Sharon Waxman","authors":["Sharon Waxman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":357446114,"title":"CBS in the Harsh Public Spotlight Again","text":"WASHINGTON — In his own fashion, President Donald Trump helped CBS News join the transparency bandwagon.\n\nYou could see it after White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe interviewed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Face the Nation Sunday.\n\nGuest host O’Keefe was fine — better than the usual host, Margaret Brennan.\n\nIt’s the editing of a question and answer about a deported Salvadoran national that set off social media — and gave Noem the perfect opportunity to bash the once-hallowed network.\n\nAs Noem posted on X, “This morning, I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Instead, CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety.”\n\nFace the Nation did air Noem’s comments about criminal charges hanging over the Salvadoran and her pledge to “make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States.”\n\nBut the live broadcast edited out her assertion that Abrego Garcia is a “known human smuggler, an MS-13 member” and a wife-beater and that he solicited nude photos from minors — all un-adjudicated charges that can be culled from government documents.\n\nIn May, a federal prosecutor charged Abrego Garcia with conspiracy to transport aliens, including MS-13 members, aka human smuggling. The Salvadoran has not had his day in court.\n\nAnd there have been no criminal charges for the other allegations. Noem should have spoken more carefully.\n\nBack to Face the Nation. Noem accused CBS of a “whitewash” — and I’d be inclined to agree except for one thing.\n\nSpoiler alert:\n\nA CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital, “Secretary Noem’s ‘Face The Nation’ interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards. The entire interview is publicly available on YouTube, and the full transcript was posted earlier this morning on CBSNews.com.”\n\nThat’s right. While the live broadcast excluded Noem’s allegations, CBS published the full quote — human-smuggling, wife-beating, truly creepy search for nudes and all — in the online version of the show, as well as the transcript.\n\nYes, probably more people saw the live show than the transcript.\n\nBut then, this story has more legs because of the omission.\n\nAlso: Many Americans don’t trust CBS. Just last year, the network’s 60 Minutes was hammered — righteously — for editing then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks in a way that cleaned up some of her word salad.\n\nWorse, CBS aired two different parts of a Harris quote on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — all but an engraved invitation for critics to see unbridled liberal bias.\n\nHere’s where Trump comes in.\n\nIn 2024, CBS would not release the raw video or transcripts of its 60 Minutes Harris interview in the face of Trump’s demands in the name of transparency.\n\nBut amid an FCC inquiry, a couple of weeks after Trump won back the White House, CBS released the full Harris transcript and videos citing “the value of transparency and the public interest here.”\n\nIt took a presidential election to move the needle, but it’s nice to see CBS in the transparency club.\n\nReview-Journal\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","summary":"WASHINGTON &#8212; In his own fashion, President Donald Trump helped CBS News join the transparency bandwagon.

One CBS insider told Fox Business that the new ombudsman amounted to a “hall monitor,” while former anchors have publicly warned that CBS News’ tradition of independent reporting could be in jeopardy.\n\nNow the prospect of Weiss — a sharp-tongued critic of progressive orthodoxy who quit the Times after blasting the paper’s “illiberal environment” — stepping into a leadership role has only heightened tensions, according to reports.\n\nWeiss has carved out a reputation for challenging both the left and the right, building The Free Press into a high-profile, subscriber-driven platform that publishes essays, interviews and investigative work outside the traditional media lanes.\n\nHer potential arrival at CBS News would mark her most prominent mainstream role since leaving the Times.\n\nThe timing is no accident. As part of the Skydance-Paramount merger, Ellison has been under pressure to prove he can modernize CBS News and reverse years of ratings decline.\n\nHis $8 billion takeover was billed as a bet on revitalizing Paramount’s content pipeline, but CBS News — long the crown jewel of American broadcast journalism — became the flashpoint in Washington during the regulatory review.\n\nFCC officials grilled Ellison’s team over CBS’s coverage, ultimately conditioning approval on the creation of the ombudsman’s office and the elimination of DEI mandates.\n\nThe Paramount-Skydance merger was approved after Paramount agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump against CBS News over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris that he says was deceptively edited.\n\nParamount has not commented on the talks, and Weiss has kept quiet publicly.\n\nThe Post has also sought comment from Weiss.","summary":"Weiss, the ex-New York Times opinion page editor who launched The Free Press in 2022, is reportedly in line for a senior editorial role at CBS News as part of the deal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/03/business/paramount-to-buy-bari-weiss-free-press-for-up-to-200m-give-her-senior-editorial-role-at-cbs-news-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-hd90m51i2-1756945871842.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756931495&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jPwH0kz2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:36:02","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":357181596,"title":"LARRY KUDLOW: Lisa Cook has been fired","text":"When the jobs report comes out on Friday, let&apos;s hope the Bureau of Labor Statistics subtracts one government job, namely the former Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. She was fired by her boss,President Donald J. Trump, even though for some reason she refuses to accept this. In the termination letter to Cook, Mr. Trump noted a criminal referral against Cook filed by the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte. In his letter, Mr. Trump said \"there is sufficient reason to believe you may have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements. For example, as detailed in the Criminal Referral, you signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year. Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year. It is inconceivable that you were not aware of your first commitment when making the second. It is impossible that you intended to honor both.\" Mr. Trump in his letter continued, \"In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity. At a minimum, the conduct at issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.\" In my judgement, the evidence behind the allegations of mortgage fraud in Michigan, Atlanta, GA and Cambridge, MA are overwhelming. One of the listings has been circulating online for several weeks. We&apos;ve all seen it. That is why I believe Ms. Cook is wasting everybody&apos;s time by throwing up legal smoke screens in court. She is pleading that President Trump has not shown sufficient \"cause\" to fire her (hat tip to Byron York). But since the Federal Reserve Act has never defined \"cause\", to me it&apos;s President Trump who defines what constitutes \"cause\". I&apos;d hold the same view, even if the 1913 legislation was perhaps clear. But really it should be up to Chief Executive. Actually, we&apos;ve learned that she knew all about the so-called mortgage fraud way in advance and told it to the Biden people when she was nominated, vetted and then confirmed to the Fed in 2022. But the Bidens chose to overlook it and jam through her Senate confirmation with, get this, a 49-49 tie that had to be broken by Vice President Kamala Harris. Because Ms. Cook lied about her primary residence and these other matters, she was able to get preferential treatment on interest rates that were not available to ordinary Americans who play by the rules and do not lie on their mortgage applications. Ms. Cook is doing enormous damage right now to the Federal Reserve by her public revolt against the mounting allegations. Indeed, Jay Powell should have suspended her several weeks ago, as he has in several other cases. But of course, Powell always lacks backbone. Cook&apos;s latest defense is that these mortgage lies were committed before shewent to the Fed. This is utter nonsense. Normally, the vetting process covers many prior years of various income, job, and contract histories. Her lies that were apparently accepted by the Bidens speak volumes about their lack of integrity. She should have been disqualified right from the start. Now look, I can go on about her lack of monetary credentials. Or the fact that she was very woke. But the reality here, the important point here, she has been fired from her job by the nation&apos;s Chief Executive. She should certainly not be permitted back into the Fed building. And she should certainly not be permitted to attend the next FOMC meeting in two weeks. Nor, of course, should she be allowed to vote at that meeting.","summary":"When the jobs report comes out on Friday, let&apos;s hope the BLS subtracts one government job","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/larry-kudlow-lisa-cook-has-been-fired","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Video-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 21:59:38","author":"Larry Kudlow","authors":["Larry Kudlow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":357181260,"title":"Is Sen. Alex Padilla running for California governor? Why Democrats are speculating about a 2026 bid","text":"For now, the rumors about a potential Sen. Alex Padilla for California governor run are just that, rumors.\n\nBut they’ve certainly got Democratic operatives and consultants talking — even as Padilla and his camp remain loudly mum on the possibility.\n\nRelated: These are the candidates for California governor in 2026\n\nThe focus for California’s senior senator, said Padilla spokesperson Edgar Rodriguez when asked about the gubernatorial rumors on Wednesday, remains on California’s upcoming special election on redistricting. That’s been the party line in the past few weeks, since the rumor mill really started churning, and what Padilla himself has said in recent interviews.\n\nThat’s not a confirmation of a 2026 candidacy — but it’s certainly not a firm no either.\n\nThat’s part because a strong, clear frontrunner has yet to emerge in the governor’s race, particularly since former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would not run for governor.\n\nAnd that’s also part because of Padilla’s political resume and temperament, experts said.\n\n“Padilla would be a formidable candidate. … I’m sure folks are worried about the current state of the race, potentially having a governor who is harder to work with,” said Ajay Mohan, a Democratic political consultant in California. “Padilla would have a field-clearing effect, second to none.”\n\nPadilla “brings a level of visibility and recognition that would make him the candidate to beat,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\nPolitical parallels for Padilla\n\nPadilla, 52, was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 when the seat was vacated by Harris to become the country’s vice president. He ran for, and won, a full six-year term in 2022, becoming California’s first Latino to hold a full-term seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRaised in Pacoima, the son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla’s entry into politics in the early 1990s was fueled by the politics of the late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A., amid the city’s growing Latino base.\n\nThose politics were defined much in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant sentiment. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, health care and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down, but the fervor propelled Padilla and many in his generation into public service. He would join protests against Prop. 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nTom Hogen-Esch, a professor of political science at Cal State Northridge, sees political parallels in the current moment, a time when the Trump administration’s mass immigration dragnet has swept the nation, hitting California — indeed, Padilla’s own hometown of Pacoima — hard.\n\nCut to the image of Padilla on June 12, at the Department of Homeland Security press office, amid the initial ramp-up of the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles.\n\nThere, Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials when he tried to ask questions. Video showed Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room, before officers pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back.\n\nHogen-Esch said it was unclear whether that could be a “motivating factor” for many voters next year.\n\nBut “to see a U.S. senator body-slammed, kind of embodies some of the political dynamics,” he said.\n\n“I’m not sure others in the race so far can make that kind of argument,” Hogen-Esch said, referencing Padilla’s journey from a working-class San Fernando Valley town to high-profile Trump critic in the U.S. Senate to that day when he was handcuffed on national TV.\n\nPadilla vs. the rest of the crowded field\n\nWith Democratic candidates relatively indistinguishable on policy, “it’s a matter of who’s the best messenger. But I think Padilla can speak to the moment in a way that some of the other contenders won’t be able to,” said Hogen-Esch, an expert on L.A. and California politics.\n\n“I think what the voters are going to look at is not only the experience and the capacity to lead, but also the ‘warriorness’ that is needed,” Richard Polanco, a former state Senate majority leader, who has led efforts to increase the statewide number of Democratic legislators.\n\nName recognition and a long list of party connections could make Padilla an instant frontrunner in the race, generate big campaign dollars and perhaps cause some lesser-known potential candidates to back down from running, pundits said.\n\n“He becomes a tier 1 candidate immediately,” said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist.\n\nTrujillo speculated a Padilla entrance in the race would impact former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra the most, among declared candidates. He noted the two boast similar portfolios — both have worked in Washington, both have served in the state legislature and both would benefit from D.C.-based relationships and donors.\n\n“Becerra isn’t in office anywhere,” Trujillo noted. “If you’re a lobbyist in D.C., if Padilla runs, he’s still going to be a U.S. senator and still going to be critical on bills in the Senate or in committee right now. A better insurance policy is to bet on Padilla rather than Becerra, because if he does come up short, he’s going to remember everyone who supported him for governor.”\n\n“If you’re in D.C., you want to make sure he has a happy memory of you.”\n\nThe current field of candidates, said Schnur, the political analyst who has worked on multiple California gubernatorial campaigns, is not lacking messages. “It just lacks the recognizable messengers,” he said.\n\nPadilla is particularly interesting because while he is temperamentally more moderate, he tracks more progressive on issues, said Schnur, and that could leave a pathway for a more centrist candidate, such as former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, to compete with him.\n\nBut on the progressive front, a Padilla candidacy would hurt Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter the most, Schnur speculated.\n\nAnd then there’s also another potential candidate: Billionaire developer Rick Caruso, the recent, unsuccessful candidate for L.A. mayor, said Wednesday he is “seriously looking” into running for California governor.\n\nTrujillo believes a Padilla candidacy would disrupt Caruso’s chances the most. Without Harris in the race, Caruso had more of a lane, he said, but Padilla narrows that substantially.\n\n“This absolutely disrupts Rick Caruso’s decision-making process once again,” he said.\n\nStill, Polanco, who supports Villaraigosa in the governor’s race, also pointed to parallels between the moment and the early 1990s era of intense anti-immigrant fervor in California.\n\nHe said the political price that Republicans paid for those years has resulted in a state where Democrats dominate, and where a Latino has a shot at the governor’s seat.\n\nThe current moment, like back when former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was campaigning for Prop. 187, will propel an increase in new voters, coming of age in 2026.\n\nThat could catalyze a Latino into office.\n\nPeople “will be able to look and say yes, the time is now, irrespective of ethnicity,” said Polanco.","summary":"California's senior senator hasn't ruled out a campaign.

Andy Barr, R-Ky., who introduced the legislation, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act specifically targets fentanyl manufacturers by allowing the U.S. government to sanction Chinese organizations, individuals, or government if those entities, according to Barr’s office:\n\n“Produce, sell, finance, or transport synthetic opioids or precursor chemicals;”\n“Fail to implement ‘know-your-customer’ procedures; or”\n“Refuse to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics efforts.”\n\nMexico’s criminal cartels are believed to use a chemical primarily sourced from China to make fentanyl, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n“President [Donald] Trump is securing our border after the chaos of the last four years under Joe Biden and border Czar Kamala Harris.

It demands that we ask of every policy, every proposal: Will this strengthen the American family?” he said.\n\nTo address the country’s declining birth rate — which plummeted to an all-time low last year — the paper also allegedly critiques “extraordinary technical solutions” to combat declining birth rates — like freezing eggs, in vitro fertilization, surrogacy and genetic screening — as part of “a world of artificial wombs and custom lab-created babies on demand,” according to the Post.\n\nThe group recommended “the answer to the problem of loneliness and demographic decline must begin with marriage,” casting blame on “free love, pornography, careerism, the Pill, abortion, same-sex relations, and no-fault divorce,” the outlet reported.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump declared himself the “father of IVF,” promising to expand access to the medical procedure — plans that the White House has reportedly abandoned in recent months.

It demands that we ask of every policy, every proposal: Will this strengthen the American family?” he said.\n\nTo address the country’s declining birth rate — which plummeted to an all-time low last year — the paper also allegedly critiques “extraordinary technical solutions” to combat declining birth rates — like freezing eggs, in vitro fertilization, surrogacy and genetic screening — as part of “a world of artificial wombs and custom lab-created babies on demand,” according to the Post. \n\nThe group recommended “the answer to the problem of loneliness and demographic decline must begin with marriage,” casting blame on “free love, pornography, careerism, the Pill, abortion, same-sex relations, and no-fault divorce,” the outlet reported.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump declared himself the “father of IVF,” promising to expand access to the medical procedure — plans that the White House has reportedly abandoned in recent months.

Twenty years ago, he led the Democrats’ takeover of the House, and he is widely rumored to be considering a run for his party’s nomination for president in 2028.\n\nMany smart Republicans will tell you privately that of all of the folks throwing their name around as possible contenders, it is Emanuel, a brilliant political animal and tactician, whom they fear the most. Why?\n\nWell, there is likely an entire generation of Democrats and journalists who might not know this, but his 2006 midterm election strategy of picking centrist candidates to run for the House in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Tennessee in Republican-leaning districts gave his party the gavel for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nEmanuel said in our interview that the survey numbers from the Wall Street Journal told him a few important things, but one above all: that Democrats really need to start addressing that it is unacceptable for the American dream to be inaccessible to so many.\n\n“I think that the core and the reason people are disappointed in the Democratic Party is because when their backs [are] against the wall, they expect us to show up, and we are nowhere on this,” he said.\n\nEmanuel said some of the things Democrats did over the years, such as universal healthcare, helped with affordability.\n\n“Other things we did, like allowing college costs to get out of control and allowing it to become less about a meritocracy and more about an exclusive club,” he explained.\n\nHis second lesson for his party: lifting people up so they could attain a middle-class life.\n\n“Today is a struggle, and you want a shot,” he said. “You want a shot for your children, and you’re getting the shaft now. You’re struggling to barely hold on, and it used to be you could work hard and get there and stay there. Now you’ve gotten there, you’re fearful, and you’re also pessimistic about your kids ever getting there either.”\n\nAnother thing Democrats need to address is that the system is rigged.\n\n“I’ll say it, it’s rigged in favor of me and my children,” he said. “And so I used to spend a lot of time unrigging, trying to unrig it. My attitude now is, ‘No, I want to keep it rigged. I’m just going to rig it for you against the powerful interests. It’s going to stay rigged, but we’re going to rig it on behalf of the working class, the middle class of America that struggle every day against great odds and great headwinds.'”\n\nWhile Emanuel admitted that putting it that way is sort of tongue-in-cheek, he is clearly frustrated that things have gotten so out of control for the middle class.\n\nThe former ambassador to Japan said he saw firsthand “the great lure of America” when he witnessed the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier depart Yokosuka for the last time in May 2024 and when his son graduated from the Navy’s Officer Candidate School among a “cross section of every background.”\n\n“And not just the diversity, but it was a diversity with a single purpose,” he said. “That’s the strength.”\n\nWhat led to the working class breaking off from his party, which many argue began with former President Barack Obama’s second campaign, when “hope and change” turned toward more divisive rhetoric?\n\n“We’ve lost touch with the uniqueness of what [Presidents Franklin] Roosevelt, [Lyndon] Johnson, and [Harry] Truman built,” he said.\n\nThe end result was not necessarily working-class Democrats voting for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. They just stayed home, making Obama the first incumbent president in modern politics to earn fewer votes than he did in his first run.\n\nEmanuel is well aware of the demographic shifts among voters, in particular among working-class Hispanic, black, and male voters under 50. Hispanic voters gave Joe Biden an advantage of 25 percentage points in 2020, but his vice president, Kamala Harris, drew even with this group in 2024, according to Pew Research Center analysis of the election results. Black voters also moved toward President Donald Trump, doubling their support for him over 2020, while men under 50 backed Trump, a group that favored Biden by 10 points four years earlier.\n\nEmanuel said Democrats need to talk more about appreciating those groups’ plight and stress, relating to it, understanding it, communicating on it, and detailing a plan to restore and uphold that.\n\nHe leans into an approach that is aspirational — think President Bill Clinton talking about his vision of building a bridge to the 21st century in 1996.\n\n“People knew he had a plan for America, and they were part of it,” Emmanuel said.\n\nEmanuel believes there is value in Democrats being the party of “let anybody be what they want to be.” But there is also value in respecting a set of values that are binding and a shared consensus.\n\n“As an example, in 2016, I dealt with bathroom access. I just didn’t make it my focus. I did it. Now, can we get back to working on reading, math, and graduation?” he said of the ordinance he introduced as mayor that prohibited public places from denying restroom access based on a person’s gender identity.\n\nBESSENT PREDICTS ‘BIG ECONOMIC PICKUP IN 2026’ AND POSSIBLE NATIONAL HOUSING EMERGENCY DECLARATION THIS FALL\n\nWhile he is not saying whether he is going to run, he is spending his time letting people get to know him and trying to help Democrats win races both at the top of the ballot in statewide elections and downballot.\n\n“Just this month alone, I’ll be back for my second trip to Virginia. I did some stuff for the governor and the speaker races. This trip, I’ll be doing something with a congressional candidate for the special election in that race,” he said, adding he is also going to Nevada for the attorney general race and then a two-day swing in Iowa.","summary":"SPRINGFIELD, Illinois — In casual conversations with Democrats in August from across the Midwest, I found that their biggest frustration with the national party is that its platform didn&#8217;t appeal to them.

By creating a permanent structure for coordination—including a new emergency operations center—she’s signaling that she’s willing to work with Trump’s task force rather than try to push it out.\n\nTrump wasted no time applauding the decision, calling Bowser “very helpful” during a press conference and praising the city’s falling crime rate. And a senior White House official told The Washington Post that Trump was “delighted” by the order.\n\nBowser framed the directive as a “pathway forward” beyond Trump’s 30-day emergency declaration. And while it asks that federal agents avoid wearing masks and identify themselves to maintain public trust, its overall tone is conciliatory.\n\nCritics say it’s capitulation. Nearly 80% of Washington residents oppose Trump’s takeover, according to a recent Schar School poll for the Post. Progressive groups, meanwhile, blasted the mayor in a letter last week, warning that “appeasement” only encourages future federal overreach. \n\n“History is calling upon you to lead our people, not to cower in the face of an authoritarian who does not have our best interests in mind,” the letter read.\n\nBut instead of pushing back, Bowser has positioned herself as a willing collaborator in Trump’s takeover effort. \n\nRelated | ICE official says Chicago's next on Trump’s military takeover list\n\nShe shared draft language of the order with senior White House officials, signed off on extra police cooperation with ICE, and even credited Trump with driving down crime—even though violent crime had already been falling before his invasion. \n\nAccording to the Post, Bowser’s aides believe that working with Trump is the best way to protect Washington’s fragile “home rule,” which allows the city limited self-governance but leaves Congress with ultimate authority.\n\nBehind the scenes, Bowser has kept in regular contact with Attorney General Pam Bondi, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. One senior official said that she speaks with Bondi “at times daily.”\n\nHer approach is at odds with other Democratic mayors and elected officials, who have loudly resisted Trump’s federal deployments. Over the weekend, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told city departments not to cooperate if Trump sends in the National Guard. But Bowser is betting that building trust with the White House could secure key wins for Washington—including a deal to redevelop RFK Stadium.\n\nStill, her stance is politically risky in a city where more than 92% of voters backed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last year. And several city council members have started to break with Bowser, accusing her of legitimizing Trump’s intervention. \n\n“Most Washingtonians want decisions guided by our community values, not federal overreach,” council member Zachary Parker told the Post.\n\nEven as she touts falling crime, Bowser has criticized ICE’s presence, saying that masked agents are “terrorizing communities” and calling the use of the National Guard unnecessary. Her order does not explicitly extend cooperation with ICE, but it does welcome federal agencies on other fronts.\n\nFor Bowser, the question now is how to eventually wind down Trump’s emergency powers without triggering a standoff. \n\n“We didn’t ask for any federal officers; we’re driving crime down,” she said last week. “But while they’re here, how can we most strategically use them to accelerate the work that MPD has done? … The next point is, how do we exit from this emergency the president declared?”\n\nTrump, for his part, appears happy to keep the partnership going. \n\n“We don’t have a crime problem in Washington anymore,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “And the mayor has been very helpful.”\n\nBowser’s order may reduce the risk of a showdown in Washington, but the city remains in a delicate spot—between a mayor betting that cooperation will protect local control and a president eager to show that federal muscle gets results. \n\nMeanwhile, tensions in Chicago are already rising. Trump said Tuesday that he plans to send federal troops in despite local opposition, signaling that the standoff isn’t over—it’s just moving to the next city.","summary":"With just days left before President Donald Trump’s federalization of Washington’s police force was set to expire, Mayor Muriel Bowser effectively removed the clock.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Bowser signed an order directing city officials to work with federal law enforcement “to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.” The order doesn’t contain a sunset clause—essentially giving Trump’s expanded federal presence a green light to continue past the 30-day legal limit, which was supposed to expire next week.\n\n\n\n\nArmed National Guard members walk through Washington.\n\n\nThe move marks a dramatic departure from Bowser’s early pushback against Trump’s occupation of the city.

Let us count the ways.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker (D-IL)\n\nThe Fred Flintstone doppelgänger has been in the news quite often lately as legacy media seemingly drool over every attack on President Donald Trump when they aren’t in awe that the overweight governor is actually shedding a few pounds.\n\nPolitico: JB Pritzker is losing weight. Even President Donald Trump is taking notice.\n\nAlso Politico: “In a powerful passage, Pritzker said, ‘After we’ve discriminated against, deported or disparaged all the immigrants and the gay and lesbian and transgender people, the developmentally disabled, the women and the minorities — once we’ve ostracized our neighbors and betrayed our friends — After that, when the problems we started with are still there staring us in the face — what comes next?”\n\nJERRY NADLER SAYS HE WILL NOT RUN FOR REELECTION\n\nHow utterly dishonest. And Politico calls such ridiculous claims “powerful.” So, how many gay, lesbian, and transgender people are being disparaged and deported? It must be nice to say whatever you like and not be held accountable, but that’s a benefit many Democrats appear to have.\n\nBut here’s why Pritzker will never be president: Before Labor Day Weekend, he claimed that there is no crime emergency in Chicago that warrants the federal boots on the ground that Trump is providing. Priitzker is also claiming that crime in the Windy City is down 50%. But instead of embracing the help from Trump, Pritzker is opting to portray Chicago as a utopian city.\n\nBut reality says otherwise: Over Labor Day weekend alone, 58 people were shot in Chicago. Nine are dead. Yet Pritzker still doesn’t want Trump’s help in seemingly being pro-crime to the average voter.\n\nHe can lose all the weight he likes. He can do all the softball interviews in the world. The crime numbers are the numbers, and being soft on crime and illegal immigration is a one-way ticket to defeat on a national level.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nShe received more than 75 million votes last November after 107 days spent as the Democratic presidential nominee. But Trump received nearly 78 million, won every swing state, and turned 89% of counties more red than blue overall.\n\nThe Harris campaign also burned through more than $1.5 billion in funds in 3 1/2 months and actually ended up in debt. This was by far the most inept campaign run in modern political history. It also featured an inauthentic, awkward, unlikable ticket with Harris clearly showing why she had to drop out of the 2020 presidential race before Iowa, and her vice presidential choice, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), he of stolen valor and a weird affinity for communist China, being a drag on the ticket to the point that Trump won Walz’s old congressional district in deep-blue Minnesota.\n\nThis ain’t Ronald Reagan in 1980 coming back from a stinging defeat to President Gerald Ford in 1976. Poll after poll shows there is no appetite for another Harris sequel to her runs in 2019, when she didn’t receive one vote in the primaries, and 2024, when she didn’t receive one vote in the primaries.\n\nHarris would have to actually earn the nomination this time. Would she try to run to the center as she hilariously attempted in 2024? Or would she go back to the left wing, as she did in 2019, in being opposed to border security and supporting taxpayer-funded sex changes for illegal immigrants in prison?\n\nShe can’t win. Even she probably knows this. So the prediction here is that she won’t even run.\n\nGov. Wes Moore (D-MD)\n\nSpeaking of stolen valor, Moore is being touted by the so-called experts as the second coming of Barack Obama. The Maryland governor has some built-in advantages that can help him win the nomination: The first Democratic primary is no longer in Iowa, but in South Carolina, which has a large black population. It’s hard to see how, say, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) could top Moore in South Carolina if the matchup came down to that.\n\nBut Moore has the same problems Pritzker has from this perspective: He’s rejecting Trump’s proposal to send National Guard troops to Baltimore while also claiming crime in the city isn’t as bad as Trump says it is.\n\n“We are seeing a resurgence that it would be great if the president would actually come and spend time and learn about what we are doing, instead of just throwing jabs at me and jabs at the city of Baltimore from the Oval Office,” Moore said in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut according to U.S. News and World Report, Baltimore still ranks as the fourth-most dangerous city to live in in the country, with 91 homicides and 218 nonfatal shootings thus far through the first eight months of the year. That’s lower than past years, yes, but how is being on pace for more than 150 homicides acceptable? Why wouldn’t Moore accept more help and partner with Trump after seeing the kind of results having National Guard troops patrolling Washington, which has seen a 40% drop in violent crime compared to the same time period in 2024?\n\nMoore also has another big problem: Stolen valor. The former Army captain claimed for years to have been awarded a Bronze Star for his service ending in 2006, but no such award was ever bestowed until it was done so retroactively in 2024. Moore was even introduced as a “Bronze Star recipient” in several interviews prior to 2024, including by Stephen Colbert, but he never corrected the record.\n\nAn August 2024 New York Times report found that “[Moore] made the claim on an application for a prestigious White House fellowship in 2006, when he was 27 years old.”\n\nMoore called the lie “an honest mistake.” And Democrats, fully aware that this could be the same kind of headache for Moore as it was for Walz, who claimed to fight in war zones when he never did, so he was awarded a Bronze Star in December 2024, as if that would somehow right a serious wrong.\n\nMoore was photographed over Labor Day weekend off the coast of Lake Como, Italy, on George Clooney’s luxury yacht, which isn’t elitist or anything.\n\nSeven people were shot in Baltimore between Friday and Sunday morning, including a 12-year-old boy outside of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School.\n\nPresident Wes Moore? Nope. Never happening.\n\nAs for those who can contend on the Democratic side, Newsom, despite having a horrific record in California that includes the highest taxes in the country and the highest homeless rate and is seeing residents and businesses leave the state for red states such as Texas and Florida, is surging among Democrats. Inept wildfire management and response? Doesn’t matter. Newsom is trolling Trump on social media by imitating him, and that appears to be a good enough reason for more people to vote for him. At least for now.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) is also a strong contender on paper, but some Democratic voters may be reluctant to support a staunch pro-Israel member of the Jewish community. On the flipside, there’s the possibility of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the energized extreme Left, doing well with female primary voters to the point she somehow captures the nomination in 2028 despite insane positions such as opposing Israel’s life-saving Iron Dome and spending trillions to fight climate change to avoid the world ending in 2031 — her predictions.\n\nMoore, Harris, Pritzker. Get ready for some serious hype next year. But they’re all foam and no beer.\n\nFor now, this appears to be Newsom’s race to lose for the nomination, creating a likely showdown with Vice President JD Vance. It would be the ultimate matchup of steak versus sizzle.\n\nBut then again, the same things were said about the likes of Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush as well.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Kennedy, is considering running for Congress next year to replace longtime Democratic stalwart Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who announced his retirement plans earlier this week. \n\nSchlossberg, 32, has never held public office, but told The New York Times on Tuesday that it was “certainly a possibility” he would run to fill Nadler’s seat, a highly prized New York City district spanning the center of Manhattan. \n\nThe 32-year-old Yale and Harvard graduate, the son of former diplomat Caroline Kennedy, has risen to fame in recent years, mixing political commentary and social media influencing, including serving as a political correspondent for Vogue during the 2024 election. He currently hosts a political commentary show on YouTube, recording episodes from inside his van. \n\nSchlossberg is also a regular, scathing critic of family member Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services secretary and the 32-year-old’s cousin. \n\nNadler announced his retirement plans in an interview with The New York Times published Monday, describing a need to pass his seat to the next generation of leaders after watching Democrats lose as an ailing Joe Biden ceded his 2024 campaign to Kamala Harris. \n\n“Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” Nadler said, adding that he hoped a successor “can maybe help us more.”\n\nThe retirement has set off a flurry of political maneuvering and speculation about who might replace Nadler and what that might say about the future of the party in New York and beyond.\n\nOther famous names have been rumored to be considering the race — progressive star and former Federal Trade Commission boss Lisa Khan; Sex and the City actor and former gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon; and Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; plus a gaggle of New York lawmakers — but only non-profit founder Liam Elkind has formally entered the primary.\n\nThe race to replace Nadler will take place next June, and it is expected to be a high-visibility contest awash in cash, given that it’s taking place in the heart of U.S.’s media and finance capital. \n\n“It’s the most coveted and arguably important congressional seat in New York because of the history of political influence from that seat, and also the fundraising base that comes with it,” Evan Thies, a Democratic strategist, told Politico of the race. “That allows you to be a national player and leader in the party, and you’re also representing one of the highest voting blocs for Democrats of any Congressional district in the country.”\n\nNadler’s unexpected exit plans, just a year after he speculated he might serve for another decade, is the latest shake-up in an already especially topsy-turvy season of New York politics, following the surprise victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the city’s Democratic primary.","summary":"Longtime New York Rep.

Even before his election win in 2024, Trump claimed his opponents’ economic policies were at the extremes of leftism. Kamala Harris, he said, had gone “full communist.” With Trump setting the tone — and now ensconced in the White House — his minions have amplified that rhetoric as a way of justifying their repressive onslaught. For example, Homeland Security Director, and anti-immigrant stormtrooper, Kristi Noem told the press in July that liberals “are actually turning out to be a bunch of communists and Marxists.” In like fashion, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Steven Miller — speaking in Washington’s Union Station after the military was dispatched to that city, proclaimed, “We’re not going to let the communists destroy a great American city.” The tenor and tone of all this show no signs of abating, as the fascistic moves and raw assertion of power continues.\n\nThat the trope of anti-communism is being invoked and retains such power, is in no small measure a testament to the legacy of the anti-communist initiatives of the 20th century. This writer’s forthcoming book, Menace of Our Time: The Long War Against American Communism, takes a deeper dive into that history. Given the moment we find ourselves in, it is worth exploring some.\n\nIn 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. What followed was a wave of repression in which his assassin, an erstwhile anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed, all within two months of the shooting. In the aftermath, New York State passed a law proscribing what it called “criminal anarchy,” making it a felony to advocate — not plan for, let alone move to carry out — revolution. The law would serve as a major weapon against organized leftists, specifically communists, who emerged in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nFast-forward 18 years, and an anarchist bombing at the home of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer triggered the Palmer Raids, a key chapter of what would come to be called the First Red Scare — a government roundup of thousands of anarchists and communists, hundreds of whom would be deported. Arrested in this period and prosecuted under the criminal anarchy law was the then-communist Benjamin Gitlow, convicted and imprisoned for publishing a document called The Left-Wing Manifesto. The conviction, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, was upheld. As the court wrote in its opinion, “It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration.” This principle of anti-advocacy — a fundamental negation of the First Amendment — would remain the law of the land for decades. It would also be a major instrument leveled against domestic communists.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of a young up-and-comer in the U.S. Justice Department: J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, who was modernizing the Bureau of Investigation (later the Federal Bureau of Investigation), created a filing system of anarchists and communists that would be a cornerstone of the FBI’s work going forward. The bureau also deployed government informants who gathered intelligence, facilitated raids, and spread insidious rumors about the loyalty of dedicated comrades. It was a methodological template that would come to serve the FBI well.\n\nWhile the fallout from the Palmer Raids subsided by the mid-1920s, the communists, who would cohere into the Communist Party USA (CPUSA or CP), would become the preeminent target of the FBI and other anti-communist forces. In doing so, it confronted the repressive bite of not only the bureau, but also the anti-syndicalism and criminal anarchy laws that had been passed in nearly every state in the U.S. — to say nothing of the routine harassment by right-wing forces and local police.\n\nDepression and World War\n\nSuch was the situation as the country entered the Great Depression. It was during this time that rank-and-file communists and their supporters fought for unions, the unemployed, and opposed lynchings and the larger Jim Crow system. In doing so, they confronted unceasing pushback — firings, violent attacks on their meetings, arrests on the picket lines, beatings by police, and even killings. All of this was facilitated by a media sounding a hyperbolic alarm against a communist menace.\n\nThat alarm would grow shriller as the country approached World War II. The communists, whose initial anti-war position was at cross purposes with the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, were targeted by early predecessors of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. They also saw their leader, Earl Browder, imprisoned for traveling under a false passport. At the same time, new anti-communist laws were enacted: the Voorhis Act, requiring the registration of agents of a foreign power (i.e., the CP); the Hatch Act, proscribing communists in government; and the Smith Act against teaching the principles of revolution. It was also during this time that Roosevelt bestowed extraordinary powers on the FBI to target domestic communism. That led to measures such as the creation of a custodial detention list — essentially a concentration camp scheme to round up communists if an emergency order was given. When the communists abandoned their anti-war position with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the repression abated — though hardly ended. It was a circumstance that would not last.\n\nDangerous Public Opinion\n\nWith the onset of the Cold War, the government undertook its most aggressive wave of anti-communist repression ever, imprisoning or holding under indictment dozens of the party’s top leaders by way of the Smith Act. This formal repression also fostered a social climate where communists became pariahs of the first order.\n\nAn indication of how deeply anti-communist sentiment penetrated the public consciousness could be seen in a 1954 poll by the Opinion Research Corporation. When asked if congressional committees hurt innocent people, 49 percent of the respondents said yes. Then, when asked if innocent people could be hurt in the process, 58 percent said, hurt or not, it was more important to uncover communists. The vast majority of Americans also said that communists should be stripped of citizenship, that the government should be allowed to tap their phones, and that it was a good idea “for people to report to the FBI any neighbors or acquaintances whom they suspected of being communists.” That this repression garnered such support — despite the modest actual influence of U.S. communists — was an example of how a negative consensus could be built through unrelenting demagoguery. In the fifties and to a lesser degree in the sixties, it was communism; in the eighties and nineties, it was terrorism, in the wake of 9/11 it was Islam, first Al Qaeda, then ISIS, and now again it is “the communists” and “the woke left.” The names may have changed, but the methodology has not.\n\nA Vicious COINTELPRO\n\nWhile the fever pitch of the Second Red Scare would lessen as the fifties gave way to the sixties, the pursuit of the CP did not. This era witnessed the initiation of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO), the first and possibly the most extensive of all their notorious surveillance and infiltration efforts.\n\nOne example can offer insight into the program’s myriad operations: the case of Aaron Libson, a closeted gay man and communist activist living in Philadelphia. In 1966, Libson was arrested by undercover police in a “tearoom” — a restroom in a public park used for gay encounters — on a sodomy charge. When the FBI, who knew Libson was a communist, learned of the arrest, they snapped into action with a COINTELPRO operation. As an FBI memorialized, the point was to “neutralize Libson with the party and embarrass the party generally.” To achieve this, they anonymously called James Dolsen, the head of the Philadelphia CP, as well as one of their press contacts “who has been used quite successfully in the Counterintelligence Program and has always protected the Bureau’s interests.”\n\nLibson describes what followed:\n\n“When I had the arrest, I pleaded nolo contendere — I do not wish to contend — on a Friday. The next day, Saturday, I woke up and got ready for work, and as I looked at the paper that morning, there was a small article saying, ‘Local Red arrested.’ I had a suicide plan ready just in case it came out, so I thought, OK, this is it and I carried out the plan. … I wasn’t going to do anything at my house where my family would find me, so I rented a room at the Arch Street YMCA. I’d packed some of the crystal stuff you clean toilets in some tin foil, and I swallowed that and laid down and waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. In the interim, I’d called a friend of mine. While I was waiting for something to happen with the poison, I got up and sat on the window ledge — the room was on the fifth floor. As I realized the poison wasn’t working.”\n\nFortunately, the friend stopped things from going further. For its part, the Bureau counted this as a victory. As the noted in a memo detailing various COINTELPRO operations, “After Libson entered a guilty plea in February 1967, the fact was published in a newspaper, Daniel Rubin, National Organizational Secretary, stated Libson was dropped from the CP.”\n\nWhile COINTELPRO officially came to an end after being exposed in the early 1970s, the surveillance and attention to the CP did not. In 1978 Congress established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which allowed for the legal wiretapping of those the US considered foreign agents, which included the pro-Soviet, CPUSA. The Bureau also kept in place its informant Morris Childs, who was acting as CP General Secretary Gus Hall’s liaison with the Soviets — a paradoxical circumstance of the Bureau both facilitating the funding of the CP, something Child’s was responsible for, while also garnering precious intelligence — and then there was the FBI’s investigation of the Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES) because of perceived communist infiltration. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the extraordinary attention to the CPUSA ended, if not the legal and extralegal measures against other perceived enemies.\n\nWere all this a matter of the past, it would be bad enough, but this history has thrust itself into the present. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used against communists and anarchists during the Palmer Raids of 1920, was leveled in 2025 against Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mahmoud Khalil. Trump has talked about stripping immigrant citizens of naturalization; meanwhile, the MAGA shock troops have set their sights on the political opposition. Elise Stefanik, the MAGA congresswoman from New York, has called New York City’s mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a “raging antisemite communist.” The methodology behind this is hardly concealed. Trump, while running for president in the summer of 2024, made this clear: “All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country.”\n\nWhile this effort has not been wholly successful, it is a significant problem that no small number of people are swayed by this. In that sense, knowing a little history can serve as a weapon.","summary":"This trope has long been used to justify repression of anarchists, communists, liberals, immigrants, and unions.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/how-a-century-of-anti-communism-cleared-the-way-for-trumps-authoritarianism/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232255618.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 17:16:25","author":"Aaron J.

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the cCDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.\n\nJoe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.\n\n“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent COVID money coming back.”\n\nKen Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.\n\nSome of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nBrent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.\n\nThe association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.\n\n“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.\n\nMethodology\n\nKFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.\n\nOur primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.\n\nTo classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.\n\nThis analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.\n\n©2025 KFF Health News.

The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri.

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the cCDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.\n\nJoe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.\n\n“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent COVID money coming back.”\n\nKen Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.\n\nSome of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nBrent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.\n\nThe association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.\n\n“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.\n\nMethodology\n\nKFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.\n\nOur primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.\n\nTo classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.\n\nThis analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.\n\n©2025 KFF Health News.

A Republican with a strong approval rating in a state that went for Joe Biden in 2024, Youngkin is popular, competent and photogenic. But the Old Dominion, thanks to a quirk in its 1776 constitution, is the only state where a governor cannot serve two consecutive terms. So instead of getting the chance to re-elect Youngkin, Virginia voters face a choice in November between Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. ‘DON’T MARYLAND MY VIRGINIA’: YOUNGKIN, 2025 GOP TICKET RALLIES TOGETHER FOR FIRST TIME AHEAD OF KEY ELECTION There is no way to sugarcoat that this is a real disadvantage for the GOP. Had Youngkin been allowed to run, it is not even clear that Spanberger would have entered the race. Now she's a heavy favorite to win. Youngkin has been above 50% in approval rating for almost his entire time in Richmond, no mean feat in a commonwealth that handed Kamala Harris a six-point win over Donald Trump, last year. The question is whether there is any way for Republicans to harness the potent power of incumbency and transfer it from Youngkin to Earle-Sears. And though it might seem unconventional, the answer really should be, yes. Youngkin’s accomplishments in under four years are impressive. He delivered $4 billion in tax cuts. In 2024, CNBC ranked Virginia the \"top state for business\" in the country. His overhaul of the education system has raised standards for students. This is what Youngkin would be running on if Virginia law wasn’t so weird, but why can’t Earle-Sears also run on this very record? After all, she was right by his side the whole time. In fact, why can’t they run on it together? Earle-Sears finds herself in almost the exact opposite position that Kamala Harris was in a year ago, replacing the top dog on the ticket. In Harris’s case, it was because Joe Biden was not fit to serve, while in Youngkin’s case, it is because of a decision made by some guys in powdered wigs 250 years ago. But, while Harris was doomed by her inability to differentiate herself from the wildly unpopular and bungling Biden, Earle-Sears has no reason to distance herself from Youngkin. Instead, she should be celebrating what they have achieved together. We should see Youngkin and Earle-Sears hip to hip at rallies and on TV ads, him defending his successful single term, and her promising to continue and expand on it. This arrangement, if not quite a co-campaign then at least a quasi-incumbency, wouldn’t just help Earle-Sears, it could help Youngkin with potential future political ambitions. Let’s not forget that in the days before the Republican National Convention, he was a serious dark horse for the VP slot. In Milwaukee, at that RNC, you could see Youngkin’s political chops at work. People would flock to him, in part because he’s approximately 8 feet tall and easily recognized, but also because they just like the guy. None of this is a knock on Earle-Sears, who has much to recommend her on her own merits, but to leave Youngkin, and all he brings to the table, on the sidelines, would be political malpractice. Thus far, Earle-Sears campaign has seemed focused on culture war issues, especially the battle over Northern Virginia counties flouting the Trump administration’s rules on trans policies like boys in women’s sports and restrooms. This is an important and powerful issue, but it isn’t enough on its own. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The economy, on the other hand, is not a sexy issue, but it sure does win elections. Earle-Sears is in the unique position to not only say that she can bring about a strong state economy, but that she is already part of the team that has delivered on that promise. When the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was debated, some wanted what Andrew Jackson wanted over a century earlier: a single six-year term for president that would remove the burden (and temptations) of running for re-election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Back in 1951, Congress landed on two four-year terms, instead. But what nobody ever seriously proposed was a single four-year term, because it's not enough time to see through major projects and endeavors. Not for the U.S., and not for any state. Maybe more so than any other political office in America, the Virginia governorship truly is custodial than it is powerful. Youngkin is a short-term caretaker, but what will matter most to his legacy is who gets the keys to commonwealth next.

Andy Barr, R-Ky., who introduced the legislation, said in a statement Tuesday. \n\nThe Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act specifically targets fentanyl manufacturers by allowing the U.S. government to sanction Chinese organizations, individuals, or government if those entities, according to Barr’s office: \n\n“Produce, sell, finance, or transport synthetic opioids or precursor chemicals;”\n\n“Fail to implement ‘know-your-customer’ procedures; or” \n\n“Refuse to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics efforts.” \n\nMexico’s criminal cartels are believed to use a chemical primarily sourced from China to make fentanyl, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. \n\n“President [Donald] Trump is securing our border after the chaos of the last four years under Joe Biden and border Czar Kamala Harris.

Vice President JD Vance. From poverty to the White House, his life has largely been shaped by the influential people around him. And although most of America knows him from that “childless cat ladies” comment and debunked conspiracy that Haitian migrants in Ohio are “eating the cats and dogs” in Ohio, there’s more to the second-in-command that meets the eye.\n\nLast week, Vance told USA Today he’s prepared to become president if “God forbid” something “terrible” were to happen to Trump. Amid the president’s diagnosed health conditions, we’re looking at exactly what a Vance presidency would look like… at how we even go to this point. \n\nIn the Beginning…\n\nAs told in his memoir turned movie, “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance was born to a drug addict mother and absent father. Eventually, his grandparents took him in and get the credit of raising him in the Appalachian communities of Ohio. Despite being raised by union Democrats in a poor neighborhood, Vance grew up to be one of the strongest faces in the Republican party. Certainly his upbringing had something to do with his current politics, but it’s his time in the military and in politics that would change his life forever. \n\nJoining the Marine Corps\n\n“When I joined the Marine Corps, I did so in part because I wasn’t ready for adulthood,” Vance wrote in his book. “It was the Marine Corps that first gave me an opportunity to truly fail, made me take that opportunity, and then, when I did fail, gave me another chance anyway.” So, Vance joined the Marines working in public affairs, Stars and Stripes reported. He wrote about the troops, escorted civilian reporters and spoke about things going on at the base. “I was lucky to escape any real fighting,” Vance said. \n\nNever Trumper Senator Turned Enthusiast \n\nEarly in his political career, Vance stood out as one of the many “Never Trumpers” in the Republican party. Like his colleagues, the Ohio senator criticized the then-45th president and vowed to never support him… then Trump ran for a second term with the support of some of Vance’s close allies. The then-senator quickly changed his tune and was tapped as Trump’s running mate in 2024. \n\nBecoming Vice President\n\nAlmost like a light switch, Vance evolved from a common Ohio local politician to a household Republican ready to defend President Trump no matter the cost. During their campaign in 2024, Vance found himself in controversy often after spewing MAGA conspiracies and even going up against Minn. Gov. Tim Walz in the vice presidential debate. \n\n‘Eating the Cats, Dogs’\n\nYup… you knew this was coming. Americans everywhere watched in horror during the second presidential debate between Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump falsely claimed that Haitian migrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. But while the country berated Trump for repeating this baseless conspiracy, the truth is Vance was responsible for feeding the information to the president. It all started with a tweet that Vance reposted and later used as a talking point in several interviews, BBC reported. Vance later doubled down on the sentiment, proving just how far he’s willing to go for his agenda. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what i’m going to do,” he said.\n\n‘Childless Cat Ladies’\n\nAnother misstep in the Trump-Vance campaign was when Vance got on national television and called out Democrats, who according to him are “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” The resurfaced clip went viral, fueling single women across the country to criticize Vance. This is when many folks began forming negative opinions about Vance, according to Navigator Search.\n\nVance to the Shadows\n\nWith all the controversy surrounding Vance, it’s not shocking that after Trump’s win against Harris, the vice president sat back for a while. He let Trump expectedly take the wheel while Vance let the heat die down from his many campaign blunders. Still, the vice president has always been behind the scenes, ensuring that things go as planned…\n\nJD Vance and Elon Musk\n\nVance has a tendency of surrounding himself with wealthy white men, and Musk was no different. Musk quickly joined forces with Trump in 2024, becoming his biggest campaign donor and eventual wing man at DOGE. Meanwhile, Musk was often overshadowing Vance, which had folks joking about Musk really being Trump’s VP. That’s why Trump’s blow-up with the Tesla mogul meant great news for Vance, who could finally get back some of the shine. Still, Vance described Musk as a “very good friend” after his break-up with the president. \n\nJD Vance and Peter Thiel\n\nAs we told you last month, billionaire Peter Thiel is anti-democracy and pro-Trump, but what’s more interesting is his connection to Vice President Vance. They met in 2011 when Vance was at Yale Law School, according to POLITICO. He attended one of Thiel’s speeches and from there, Thiel became Vance’s mentor. The billionaire also looked out big time for Vance during his 2022 Senate Campaign. Thiel positioned himself as a close ally to President Trump, even donating over $1 million to Trump’s campaign. In addition to his wealth, Thiel has also solidified himself as an integral force in the Trump campaign– despite his Neo-nazi ties. \n\nProject 2025\n\nProject 2025 is largely regarded as the Republican party’s playbook for Trump’s second term. So far, they’ve knocked off an estimated 47 percent of their proposed policies, and while Trump continues to deny any connection to Project 2025, it’s Vance who has a close relationship with the founders and writers of the playbook. Kevin Roberts is the founder of Heritage Foundation, the conservative mastermind behind Project 2025, and he told reporters in 2024 he was privately “really rooting” for Vance to be Trump’s VP pick.\n\nVance even penned the foreword to Roberts’ book where he praised the Heritage Foundation as “the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.”\n\nWhere Has Vance Been??\n\nWhile Trump and Musk were going back and forth online, many Americans were wondering where the hell is Vice President Vance? He’s not like past VPs like the overly involved Dick Cheney or the everyday man Joe Biden. With Trump taking most of the shine, Vance rarely makes national headlines… But when he does, Vance often blunders his words. As we previously reported, Vance’s one-liner during the White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got him in hot water with the media. \n\nA Tie Breaking Vote\n\nOne of the most important jobs of any vice president is being the tie breaking vote during an undecided Senate vote. Vance is the acting president of the Senate, and because the Senate is so closely split between the Democratic and Republican parties, the real decisions often come down to him. \n\nVance was the tie breaking vote to pass the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, which adds trillions to the national debt while cutting Food Stamps, Medicaid and key federal agencies.\n\nVance’s Billion-Dollar Black Book of Allies\n\nLike many in office, a huge part of Vance’s successes could be attributed to his black book of wealthy and powerful allies. From Musk and Thiel to the Claremont Institute, Vance has many billion-dollar machines working in his favor. So far, the country’s has only gotten a glimpse as to what Vance can do with his connections, but if the day comes where the vice president turns into the next leader of the free world, Vance will surely unlock his arsenal of influences. \n\nWhat Does JD Vance Believe In?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Vance’s politics now are vastly different than they were before he was picked as Trump’s running mate. And now that the president is running things according to his own plan, it’s unclear exactly what Vance believes in — besides Trump. We know family values are important to the 41-year-old. He is against abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. As president, Vance would likely champion these efforts in dramatic ways reminiscent of his Republican predecessors.\n\nHow Is Vance Different than Trump?\n\nAlthough Trump’s bold rhetoric is slowly rubbing off on Vance, there are still stark differences between the men and presumably how they would run the country. For starters, Trump is known for being divisive, racist and sometimes extreme in his politics. Vance, on the other hand, offers a more tamed alternative, especially as someone who has maintained valuable relationships for decades. Vance would be the first millennial president, differing from Trump, who is a baby boomer. \n\nContinuing the Legacy of Trump\n\nMany critics of Trump say they’re waiting for these four years to be over so we can get back to some sense of normalcy. But if Vance ever gets into the executive seat, you can expect Trump’s same playbook to be continued. As a avid supporter of the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 and of course President Trump, Vance would not only be predicted to continue the legacy of his predecessor, but he would be expected to do so. \n\nIf Project 2025 is not complete by the end of Trump’s time in office, Vance will likely pick up from exactly where he left off at, which would mean bad news for Black Americans.","summary":"Although Trump's bold rhetoric is slowly rubbing off on JD Vance, there are still stark differences between how they would run the country. \n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/everything-black-folks-need-to-know-about-jd-vance-i-2000059958","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/03124904/pariscol-300x168.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 13:33:26","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":357046556,"title":"In Maine, brewery owner joins push to unseat Susan Collins","text":"Dan Kleban, a co-founder of the Maine Beer Company, announced Wednesday that he was running for Senate in Maine, joining an expanding Democratic primary field that may not be settled for months.\n\nNational party leaders are anxiously waiting to hear whether Gov. Janet Mills, a two-term Democrat, will join the list of those vying to unseat Sen. Susan Collins, the lone remaining Senate Republican in New England.\n\nMills, 77, said recently that while she was “seriously considering” a run against Collins, she was unlikely to make any announcement until mid-November. “I’m not in any rush to make a decision,” she told reporters.\n\nBut Kleban, 48, is not waiting for Mills to decide, hoping his personal story — a college dropout from a middle-class family who went on to found a successful brewery — will appeal to voters. He’s drawing on his company’s motto, “Do what’s right,” to ground his campaign.\n\n“I just don’t think Susan Collins is up to the job anymore,” Kleban said in an interview.\n\nBut before taking on Collins, 72, Kleban must navigate a primary contest that already includes Graham Platner, 40, an oyster farmer and former Marine, and Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide.\n\nNotably, Kleban, a political newcomer, did not pledge to continue his run if Mills ultimately enters the race.\n\n“I don’t know what Gov. Mills is going to do, and I’m not going to commit to doing one thing or the other,” he said. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”\n\nWood and Graham both have said they are running regardless of the governor’s choice.\n\nAt a time when the Democratic Party is confronting demands for generational change, Mills would be a step in the other direction. She would be 79 when taking office, the oldest first-term senator in history.\n\nOther Democratic candidates who might still join the race include Cathy Breen, a former state senator, and Ryan Fecteau, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.\n\n“I’m exploring the opportunity and thinking about what a run would look like,” Fecteau said, adding that he would most likely not run if Mills does. “I have a lot of respect for her,” he said.\n\nPlatner entered the race last month and has excited progressive activists, raising $1 million in under 10 days. He also earned the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who held a rally with him in Portland, Maine, over Labor Day weekend that drew thousands of people.\n\n“Our taxpayer dollars can build schools and hospitals in America, not bombs to destroy them in Gaza,” Platner said from the stage, earning a raucous ovation.\n\nWood, who worked in Democratic politics before his run, had raised nearly $1.4 million as of June 30, and lent his campaign $250,000 more.\n\nDespite the crop of candidates, Mills is being wooed by national Democrats, in particular Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. The Maine seat is seen as one of the Democratic Party’s strongest pickup opportunities in 2026.\n\nCollins is the only Republican senator up for election in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, and some polls have shown her with a low approval rating. But Collins, 72, has defied the odds before, winning in 2020 when virtually no polls showed her ahead leading up to the election.\n\nDemocrats would need to flip four seats in 2026 to take control of the Senate — a tall task.\n\nWearing a camouflage hat with his beer company’s logo on it, Kleban was blunt in a Zoom interview about his party’s struggles to find a compelling economic message as prices spiral upward.\n\n“They’re feeling that no matter how hard they work, even if they play by the rules, the system’s rigged against them,” he said. “They don’t have a chance to succeed. And I think that’s wrong, and I think that needs to change.”\n\nHe said he could relate to the struggles of Mainers, having lost his own job during the Great Recession and once counted a loaf of bread and Tabasco sauce as dinner. “Those things you don’t forget,” he said.\n\nEventually Kleban and his wife tapped their family’s retirement savings to help start the Maine Beer Company with his brother. The brewery’s beers are now distributed in more than 30 states, according to the company, and Kleban said the company grew while providing health insurance to workers and giving away 1% of gross sales to environmental and other community organizations.\n\nKleban, a father of 14-year-old twins, said high prices would be his first issue to focus on as a senator.\n\n“It’s clear the cost of living is too damn high and Mainers are feeling squeezed — and Susan Collins isn’t doing enough to bring them relief,” he said.\n\nHe was more circumspect about some of the other issues he would face as a senator.\n\nHe would not say, for instance, whether he would vote to keep Schumer as the party’s leader, dismissing it as “inside the Beltway” chatter that “is just not what I’m focused on.”\n\nAnd Kleban did not take a position on whether it is time to do away with the filibuster, which forces the majority party in the Senate to get 60 votes to pass many types of legislation. “I come into it open-minded, I’ll leave it at that,” he said.\n\nHe pushed back on the idea that he was running as a backup to Mills even as he suggested he was open to stepping aside.\n\n“Anybody who puts their hat in the ring, especially in a race like this, needs to be 100% committed,” he said, before later adding, “I can’t predict the future.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"National party leaders are anxiously waiting to hear whether Gov.
