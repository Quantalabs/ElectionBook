Shakespeare warned, “Ingratitude is monstrous; and for the multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude.” In the case of TPS, “multitude” is correct. As of January 2025, approximately 1.4 million foreign nationals in the United States were shielded from removal under the program. \n\nThe Trump administration decided to terminate TPS for several countries, with Somalia as the most recent. That choice is the right step in a long-overdue course correction for an immigration program that previous administrations exploited far past its statutory purpose. \n\nSomalia was first designated for TPS in 1991, following political turmoil and the outbreak of civil war. At the time, granting temporary protection to Somali nationals already present in the United States was an act of kindness. \n\nOver three decades later, Somalis remained dependent on the charity extended to them by the United States and distorted the TPS program beyond recognition from its original legislative intent. \n\nPast Administrations Haven’t Followed the Law \n\nTemporary Protected Status is governed by Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a. According to federal law, TPS may be granted only when extraordinary and temporary conditions prevent safe return to a designated country. It applies only to individuals physically present in the United States at the time of designation. Foreigners who arrive after the fact are ineligible. \n\nTPS is not an open-ended invitation or a pathway to citizenship. \n\nYet over time, administrations treated TPS as anything but temporary. Excluding the first Trump administration, nearly every president extended or unlawfully redesignated TPS as a knee-jerk reaction, willfully pushing the program past its expiration date rather than enforcing the law. \n\nCongress imposed a mandatory review at 18 months precisely to prevent this outcome. And yet, as the deadline approached, bureaucratic habit won repeatedly, turning 18 months into 35 years in the case of Somalia. \n\nSection 244 does not authorize redesignation. It only permits designation, extension, and termination. The executive branch has not authority to cite the same emergency decades later to grant work authorization and removal protection to individuals who were not present in the United States when the original designation was made. That practice has no basis in statute and undermines our immigration system. \n\nThe Case of the Minneapolis Somalis \n\nThe consequences are rampant throughout the nation. Minneapolis is home to the largest Somali community in the world outside Somalia. In Minnesota, federal investigators have alleged that around $9 billion in Medicaid claims since 2018 may be fraudulent, potentially marking the largest scam in U.S. history. \n\nMany of the defendants charged in those cases are of Somali descent and several have pled guilty in court. Not all TPS recipients participate in criminal conduct, but Minneapolis serves as a case study on how abuse of immigration programs causes widespread reliance on the public benefit system created to serve Americans, not foreigners. \n\nThe costs are not always overt such as fraud; they also take hidden tolls. Minnesota’s English learner education funding doubled from $5.3 million in 2003 to $10.8 million in 2023, with Somali being the most popular first language in several schools besides Spanish. \n\nLong-running TPS designations create economic strains on health care, education, and other social services that were never intended to be permanent obligations. \n\nIt is no longer solely about a group of people who were offered brief protection in the ‘90s. According to the Department of Homeland Security, roughly 2,500 Somali nationals with TPS or pending applications will be affected by the termination. \n\nThose figures do not account for children and grandchildren born during the program’s 35-year existence at the taxpayer’s expense. The beneficiaries should have departed the country in the 1990s if perpetual redesignations had not occurred. \n\nCleaning Up the Biden Abuse of TPS \n\nThe Trump administration is trying to clean up the mess inherited by Kamala Harris’s open borders and immigration failures. The Biden administration deliberately expanded TPS, contrary to American security interests and granted TPS to over 1.4 million aliens by January 2025. \n\nPresident Joe Biden even urged Congress to pass legislation allowing TPS recipients to apply for green cards, highlighting how the administration viewed TPS as amnesty despite the law saying otherwise. \n\nFormer Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, extended and redesignated Somalia for TPS through March 2026, allowing new applicants and issuing automatic employment authorization extensions. \n\nThe massive expansion did not end with Somalia. TPS enrollment nearly quadrupled under the Biden administration, driven largely by new designations for Venezuela in 2021 and 2023. As of January 2025, more than 614,000 Venezuelans were protected under TPS, making up around half of all beneficiaries. \n\nA House report found that 95% were not admitted on visas and entered either illegally or through humanitarian parole—which is not a formal admission into the United States according to federal law. \n\nThe Supreme Court reiterated that truth in Sanchez v. Mayorkas in 2021, holding that TPS does not constitute an admission to the United States and does not translate into a pathway for lawful permanent residence. Any attempt to treat TPS otherwise reflects executive ignorance of both the legislative and judicial branch. \n\nMaking Temporary Mean Temporary Again \n\nEnding TPS for Somalia means that “temporary” will once again mean temporary. It also emphasizes that the United States will not reward aliens who try to override our laws. \n\nCongress is also responsible for allowing TPS to be manipulated. Lawmakers created the program and failed to enforce its limits. Congress should codify clear protections for Americans, including restricting eligibility to aliens present at the time of the triggering event, outlawing redesignation, capping active TPS periods at 18 months in absence of extraordinary justification, and requiring recipients to seek other immigration benefits if eligible or depart within one month of TPS termination. \n\nGenerosity is ruined by entitlement and mercy without limits enables a monster. TPS was meant to reflect American compassion without sacrificing the rule of law or public safety.","summary":"Congress created&#160;Temporary Protected Status&#160;(TPS)&#160;to&#160;briefly&#160;assist&#160;those in need.

That’s been rare so far","text":"A trio of Orange County officials is running for statewide executive office this year, and if any of them emerge victorious in November, it would be a bit of an anomaly.\n\nThat’s not just because former Huntington Beach city attorney Michael Gates and Supervisor Don Wagner are both Republicans running against Democratic incumbents in a very blue state in races for attorney general and secretary of state, respectively. And that’s also not only because former Rep. Katie Porter would be the first female governor in California.\n\nRather, it’s their home base: Orange County.\n\nDespite the county accounting for nearly 10% of California’s population, very few of its residents have been able to win statewide elections.\n\nThat’s certainly not due to a lack of political talent in Orange County, said Fred Smoller, an expert in media and politics who teaches at Chapman University.\n\nReally, it’s a structural curse, he said.\n\nLos Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco produce more statewide candidates because those cities have a centralized television news market and mayoralities that help boost candidates with name ID. Orange County doesn’t have that one mayoral position and shares TV media markets with Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, San Diego.\n\n“There’s plenty of talented people from Orange County on both sides of the aisle,” said Smoller. “But there’s no centralized media and we suffer from the fact that we have no career ladder (like a mayor’s office) that would provide a platform for them to receive greater recognition.”\n\n“It’s a structural constraint,” Smoller added, “and that inhibits talent from both sides of the aisle from moving to a statewide office.”\n\nBut that’s not to say it’s impossible for an Orange County resident to be elected statewide.\n\nCase in point: Ken Cory, who lived in Westminster and Garden Grove, was elected to serve as the state’s controller in 1974. Cory, who served in the statehouse prior to the executive branch, was reelected in 1978 and 1982, leaving office after not seeking another term in 1986.\n\nCory, his obituary noted, was a Democrat who was respected by those on both sides of the aisle. He was dubbed “the man oil companies fear most.”\n\nThere’s also Thomas Kuchel, who hailed from Anaheim and, like Cory, served as the state’s controller. Kuchel, though, was also elected to the U.S. Senate, albeit some time ago: He was appointed to the Senate in 1953, winning subsequent reelections to the seat where he served for 16 years, including as the Republican whip. He served as controller from 1946 to 1953.\n\nKuchel was an infamous progressive in the Republican Party at the time, playing roles in the Senate’s work to pass Medicare, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as conservation efforts and a nuclear test ban treaty.\n\nAnd there are others, too, with ties to Orange County. Probably chief among them: former President Richard Nixon, who, while he lived in Whittier and represented a Los Angeles County congressional seat, was born in Yorba Linda. His presidential library is in Yorba Linda, but when Nixon was president, the western White House was in San Clemente.\n\nThe presidency wasn’t Nixon’s only attempt to woo California voters all around the state. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1950, but a little more than a decade later, he’d lose a bid for governor, telling reporters after the loss, “Just think how much you’re going to be missing. You don’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.”\n\nJohn Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor and longtime Orange County politician, served in the U.S. Senate. But he was appointed to fill a vacancy and lost the election to the seat to the late Dianne Feinstein.\n\nMore recently, Loretta Sanchez, then an Orange County Congress member, made a run for what was an open U.S. Senate seat in 2016. But she finished second to Kamala Harris, then the state attorney general from San Francisco.\n\nSo what would it take for an Orange County politician to win elected office?\n\nIt’s more of an uphill battle, but not completely outside the realm of possibility, for a Republican to win, said Scott Spitzer, who teaches political science at Cal State Fullerton.\n\nIt depends on identity, he said, and whether candidates choose to focus on issues that would appeal to independent voters — taxes and cost of living, for example — rather than more polarizing issues, like gay marriage or climate change denial.\n\n“I do think there’s room for Republicans to win statewide office in California, but that’s not where the state Republican Party in California has been,” said Spitzer. “They’ve been pursuing a line of politics that’s nationally conservative and Trump-aligned, which doesn’t appeal to the moderate conservative voters in California. It definitely appeals to Republicans in pockets of the state, but it’s not going to win a statewide majority.”\n\nPorter recently lost a statewide bid, not even advancing past the primary in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\nBut she’s got the greater chance among the three in her quest for statewide office, both Smoller and Spitzer said, and her Orange County connection could actually be a boost.\n\n“In some ways, coming from Orange County could help her,” said Spitzer. “She could say, ‘Look, I could pull some votes from more conservative areas where other candidates are used to relying on San Diego and Los Angeles and San Francisco.’” She might not win those areas outright, Spitzer noted, but she could still pick up support there among people more familiar with her work.\n\nSmoller said Porter, although she’s a staunch progressive, could possibly sway more right-leaning voters as well, who might think she would keep the county’s interests more at the forefront than other candidates for governor.\n\n“She might make the appeal, ‘I’m not your cup of tea politically, but at least you know me, and we’d have someone from Orange County in the governorship,’” Smoller said.\n\n“I’m not sure that’s an argument that would sell, but she could certainly make it.”","summary":"Former Rep.

Cassidy Probes UAW Leader on ‘Workforce Retaliation’","text":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the leading Senate committee on labor matters, sent a letter to United Auto Workers (UAW) president Shawn Fain on Friday, probing him about alleged “workplace retaliation” in the union.\n\nCassidy, R-La., who chairs the Senate committee on health, labor, education, and pensions (HELP), asked the labor leader to clarify reports of alleged retaliation against fellow UAW leaders for workplace disagreements.\n\n“Several news reports and two reports by the United Auto Workers’ (UAW) court-appointed Monitor … have detailed concerning instances of workplace retaliation under your leadership,” the letter reads.\n\nCassidy added that “these actions create a serious distraction from UAW’s purpose to improve and protect UAW members’ wages, benefits, work hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.”\n\nFain has served as the UAW’s president since 2023. The Detroit, Michigan-based union was founded in 1935.\n\nCassidy writes in the letter that he is “concerned that the cost of litigating these matters is a disservice to the American workers who pay dues to the UAW.”\n\nIn particular, Cassidy probes Fain on two allegations of workforce retaliation. In one instance, Fain is said to have removed “several departments” from the purview of UAW Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock as retaliation for “instituting strict policies governing expenses.”\n\nIn the other case, Cassidy points to a report from The Detroit News, which cites an anonymous source who said Fain removed the union’s Stellantis department from the oversight of Vice President Rich Boyer due to “a disagreement over staffing changes.”\n\nStellantis is the parent company which produces and sells Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, Ram, and other vehicles.\n\nCassidy mentions that “Boyer states the dismissal was motivated by his refusal to make changes that would benefit your [fiancée] and your [fiancée’s] sister.”\n\nCassidy requests for clarification on whether the UAW has a workforce retaliation policy, as well as whether Faine’s fiancée or her sister would stand to benefit from Boyer’s removal. Cassidy also inquires if the UAW has a written policy on workplace nepotism.\n\nThe chairman asks several more questions of Fain on how these alleged actions affect workers, including whether Fain will commit to not raising dues on union members “to pay for internal UAW proceedings or any legal proceedings on these or other allegations of retaliation.”\n\nThe UAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fain and the union on the letter, the allegations it details, and whether they plan to respond to Cassidy.\n\nFain has served as the UAW’s president since 2023. The union, founded in 1935, is based in Detroit, Michigan. \n\nFain campaigned in support of then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ Democratic presidential bid in 2024, and was a harsh opponent of now-President Donald Trump, whom he called a “scab” who “doesn’t give a damn about working class people.” \n\nSince then, Fain has been critical of certain Trump policies, such as restricting federal workers’ unionization rights, but has also defended the president on policies such as tariffs.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—Sen.

John Barrasso delivered the following speech about the Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota. Watch the speech, below, or read his remarks, lightly edited.\n\nWhen the government wastes even a dollar of your taxpayer money, you have a right to know what happened. When emboldened criminals steal money intended to help single moms and children in poverty, you have a right to be angry.\n\nAmericans are infuriated by the staggering fraud unfolding today in the state of Minnesota. The past few weeks have shown how deep the corruption has turned out to be.\n\nInvestigators have uncovered fraud schemes across 14 Minnesota Medicaid programs. Joe Thompson—U.S. Attorney in Minnesota—has spent his career prosecuting fraud. Based on his extensive investigation, he believes criminals have stolen at least $9 billion from those Minnesota Medicaid programs. That is half of the total amount of money Minnesota spends for Medicaid programs in that state.\n\nToday, the fraud is so prevalent that Thompson says the state has “developed a fraud tourism industry.” Can you imagine such a thing? A “Fraud Tourism Industry.”\n\nHere’s how these schemes work. Fraudsters set up fake businesses and nonprofit organizations. The criminals claim to provide services such as housing, food, and healthcare assistance. Then, they bill Medicaid for services they never provided. They enroll children in programs they don’t need. \n\nIn 2021, taxpayers paid $4.6 million for something called Minnesota’s Integrated Community Support Medicaid Program. Three years later—due to criminal fraud—spending for that program ballooned to more than $170 million. That’s 37 times as much in just three years. \n\nTaxpayers similarly paid $21 million in 2021 for something called Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services. In the first six months of 2025—due to criminal fraud—taxpayers paid nearly triple that amount.\n\nA Medicaid program claiming to help Minnesota children with autism cost $6 million in 2018. By 2023—due to criminal fraud—it cost taxpayers over $192 million. \n\nDaycare fraud is one of these brazen schemes. Last month, an independent journalist visited 10 state-funded daycare sites in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. He found no children at the daycare centers. Middle of the day. No children there.\n\nOne year ago, a local reporter visited several of the same sites. This reporter found no children at the daycare centers. These are supposed daycare centers. They’re getting paid to take care of children.\n\nHere is one of those sites. It is the now-infamous ‘Quality LEAR-ING Center.’ LEAR-ING. Instead of Learning. Misspelling the name of the daycare center. That’s an obvious red flag for fraud. There were 95 violations for that site alone between 2019 and 2023. Those violations include ‘no records for 16 children.’\n\nYet in Minnesota, taxpayer dollars continued to flow. \n\nThese aren’t one-off abuses. We now know that the fraud scheme used in the state’s childcare program has been used to defraud other social service programs. The New York Times says the fraud is ‘staggering in its scale and brazenness.’\n\nThe Department of Justice has charged 98 defendants in Minnesota Medicaid fraud-related cases. So far, 64 of these defendants have been convicted. Last month, one defendant was found guilty of stealing $14 million from Medicaid. She also stole nearly half a million dollars from a child nutrition program.\n\nThat stolen money was supposed to be used to provide 200,000 meals for hungry children. Instead, the defendant sent hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. She bought real estate in Kenya in Africa.\n\nThis organized, systemic theft has gone on for years under the state’s Democrat leadership. It exploded under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nThe Democrats have permitted schemes stacked upon schemes to drain money meant for those in need. Republicans will not allow this massive theft of taxpayer dollars to be ignored.\n\nWe are taking a comprehensive approach to root out fraud in Minnesota and across the country. Our Working Families Tax Cuts law fights fraud.\n\nWe strengthened eligibility requirements for Medicaid. We ensured illegal immigrants do not receive taxpayer-funded healthcare. We put in place work requirements for Medicaid and for Food Stamps. These policies protect taxpayers and increase accountability.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans are conducting aggressive congressional oversight. On Friday, the entire Senate Republican Conference demanded Gov. Walz explain his actions. We asked nine detailed questions. Questions such as why Minnesota failed to adopt key fraud prevention measures—measures the Department of Health and Human Services recommended to Minnesota in May. \n\nGov. Walz knew about this widespread fraud. He refused to do anything to stop it.\n\nSenate Republicans are ready to give the Trump administration the manpower it needs to tackle fraud in Minnesota and wherever else it appears. The Trump administration has asked the Senate to confirm a new Assistant Attorney General position—a position that will focus on fraud. The United States Senate will get that person in place and on the job quickly. \n\nThe Trump administration has taken other bold and deceive actions to stop fraud. To further strengthen enforcement efforts, the Department of Justice has doubled the number of attorneys handling these fraud cases. \n\nThe Treasury Department is cracking down on businesses in Minnesota for alleged money laundering. The Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump froze federal funding for fraud-prone programs in Minnesota. \n\nIf Senate Democrats cared about stopping fraud, why are they preparing to vote today to loosen eligibility and income verifications for Obamacare subsidies? That is what the Congressional Review Act resolution from Democrat Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia does. \n\nEliminating these vital protections invites more fraud. It means subsidies go to individuals who don’t qualify for them.\n\nCongress should not make it easier to defraud American taxpayers. That is the wrong direction to take after the biggest fraud scandal in Minnesota history.\n\nProtecting taxpayer dollars should not be a partisan issue. The fraud scandal in Minnesota should be a wake-up call for every American taxpayer.\n\nOur federal government spends nearly $1.5 trillion each and every year to feed, house, treat, and care for vulnerable families and children. Medicaid, food stamps, and other social programs are often called a lifeline. Years of waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption have pushed those who truly need help to the back of the line.\n\nRepublicans will not stop until the depth of this fraud is uncovered and prosecuted. Republicans are committed to preventing it from happening again.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Sen. John Barrasso delivered the following speech about the Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota.

According to the magazine, the “My Chick Bad” MC “wasn’t supposed to be on” the lineup in the first place. Representatives for the traveling festival confirmed the news, directing Billboard to Ludacris’ team “for any additional comments.”\n\nRock the Country, which launched in 2024 as a festival centering country music, announced its 2026 lineup on Monday (Jan. 12). Country superstars Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Jelly Roll were listed as headliners, while additional performers included Ella Langley, Riley Green, Miranda Lambert, Brantley Gilbert, Shinedown, Gavin Adcock, Creed, Treaty Oak Revival, and, notably, “Hot In Herre” rapper Nelly. Not only did Nelly appear on the inaugural Rock the Country lineup, but he also performed at President Donald Trump’s second Inaugural Ball in 2025.\n\nKnown for Billboard Hot 100-topping rap and pop hits — as well as their past country crossover smashes — Ludacris’ and Nelly’s inclusions on the Rock the Country lineup quickly divided fans. In the Instagram comment section for the lineup poster, one user wrote, “[Ludacris], this is your crowd now? Pretty sad.” Another quipped, “In honor of Nelly and Ludacris appearing, they will be provided with their very own water fountain.” Ludacris was specifically scheduled to perform on Sunday, July 26, in Anderson, S.C.\n\nA sizable number of Luda’s fans also felt his appearance was an endorsement of the MAGA politics associated with the festival. In 2024, Adcock lambasted then-President Joe Biden onstage, also calling then-Vice President Kamala Harris a “b—h.” Last year, Trump introduced Kid Rock’s set with a simple video message: “Fight, fight, fight, win, win, win, for the American people.” One gobsmacked user shared a video declaring, “We about to put you over there with Kanye and Snoop … stop playing. Why’d you sign up for this?

But it's still a Friday. The Libs let us get here AGAIN. That's 2 for 2 on Fridays in 2026. Patriots always win! Libs always lose. And now, they're cooked. We're here. We made it. We've got NFL playoff action tomorrow. We've got NFL playoff action Sunday. We've got the college football title game Monday. Who has it better than us? Nobody. Let's roll. Welcome to a Friday Nightcaps – the one where Louisville's new assistant volleyball coach has America's attention as we barrel towards the weekend. What else? I've got the best of the rest from a loaded week of #content, Kamala Harris sobbing over Trump's middle finger, MLB is in TROUBLE as of this morning, and Sophie Cunningham's knee rehab seems to be going WELL as the WNBA season quickly approaches (maybe). Grab you a fig newton for National Fig Newton Day, and settle in for a Friday 'Cap! Kamala with some all-time spin here Do Fig Newtons still exist? Feel like I haven't seen one in a MINUTE. I used to hammer those things growing up. The best. Well, not the best. But solid. They were always billed as a healthy snack, which, looking back now, is hilarious. Sort of like when Eggo and Cinnamon Toast Crunch were sold as vital parts to \"this complete breakfast.\" Remember those commercials? No wonder I was so fat: \"Vitamin-packed Frosted Flakes.\" Amazing. We really had it all in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, and we pissed it right away. Sad. Anyway, let's get this class going. It's a Friday, after all. Kamala Harris fake-sobbed because Trump ‘defiled’ the White House this week with his VERY NASTY middle finger, and the grift with this one is truly amazing: What a week of #content! As Joe would say, ‘Come on, man!’ Don't you ever let anyone from the Biden Administration anywhere NEAR a pedestal. Don't you let them lecture you for one second. Not one single second. Kamala was a part of undoubtedly the most grotesque administration in American history. That's not hyperbole, although Bill and Monica would probably like a word. Again, these people invited THIS to the White House: This is the same White House, and the same president, that wished everyone a happy \"Trans Day of Visibility' on EASTER, by the way. The same one that had cocaine in the HALLS. The same guy who pardoned his entire family at the buzzer last January. The same vice president who, just 18 months ago, told Christian protesters that they were at the wrong rally. HER rally, by the way. The same one that looked like THIS for Christmas: Yeah, spare us the lecture, Kamala. We're good. Lunatic. OK, let's get to the best #content from a loaded week. Kyle Tucker bats leadoff! Dark days for MLB, Louisville's new coach & Zach Wilson is having a great offseason! Another solid week. Not our best, but it's also January and we're in the middle of just the longest month of the year, so I get it. Still, y'all made it work. Bravo. Couple thoughts … 1. Nothing like a good cup of coffee, am I right? Thanks, Sofia! 2. Farrah Abraham! As Obi-Wan once said, ‘Now there’s a name I haven't heard in a long time.' For those who don't remember her career arc, she was central casting in both MTV's 16-and-pregnant, and then again in MTV's Teen Mom. Just for good measure, she also had a sex tape leak. Cannot WAIT to cast my vote in 2026! 3. Sophie would also have my vote. 4. As for the Kyle Tucker/MLB stuff … Let's rapid-fire this Friday class into one of the final (or is it one of the first?) football weekends of the year. So, I spent my morning A) writing about Kamala, B) doing the newsletter, and C) doing some BIG J digging on this MLB situation. For those who don't know, it's about to get really nasty in about 11 months. The CBA is up at 11:59 on Dec. 1 of this year, and we will undoubtedly go into a work stoppage. The Dodgers, once again, signing another marquee free agent to a lucrative contract last night didn't help things. Here's what I found out in my Big J digging. The Dodgers really aren't at fault here. And yes, that pains me to say, because I'm a Red Sox fan. I hate LA. I hate its stupid Governor. I hate its stupid laws, and its stupid time zone. But … this isn't on the Dodgers. It's on Major League Baseball. The owners either won't spend, can't spend, or refuse to spend. The Dodgers, thanks to a lucrative – and well-timed TV deal back in 2013 – basically have endless money coming in each season. Nobody talks about that TV deal. I wrote about it extensively. LA basically has a budgetary floor each season that is infinitely higher than anyone else. Because of MLB's lax rules on luxury tax and deferrals, the Dodgers basically game the system by kicking the can down the road as far as possible, knowing they will have the money to cover it once the bill(s) come due. Anyway, it's all leading to a shutdown next season. Bank on it. Enjoy 2026, baseball fans. And that's my depressing Ted Talk for the day! Next? You know who isn't losing sleep over a looming lockout? Zach and Nicolette Wilson: No idea what Zach's gonna do now that Miami has cleaned house, but I think he'll be just fine wherever he lands. I just hope he stays somewhere warm, for obvious reasons. OK, that's it for today – and this week. Good work, everyone. Former Purdue star, and new Louisville volleyball coach, Jena Otec, takes us into a big weekend. See you Monday.

But they see this Senate race as yet another golden opportunity to break the GOP's winning streak. Party strategists have somehow convinced themselves that opposition to President Donald Trump could fuel an electoral wave big enough to finally deliver them a statewide victory. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called Texas a \"very possible\" Democratic pickup opportunity in 2026, though he hasn't quite put it in the top four targets.\n\nDespite being the presumptive frontrunner when she jumped into the race, Crockett is now trailing state Rep. James Talarico in the polls.\n\nThat's got to sting. Crockett, despite her national profile, is as big as her fake eyelashes, yet she is struggling in her own party’s primary. Her Senate campaign is clearly a last-ditch effort to remain in government after her district was redrawn. Now she's watching her supposed sure thing slip away before the primary even happens.\n\nHow is this happening?\n\nThe polling reveals some uncomfortable truths for Democrats. There's a clear racial divide between Crockett and Talarico. Talarico holds a majority among Hispanic and white voters, while Crockett has strong support among black voters. The gender gap is just as telling. Men favor Talarico by a wide margin, 52% to 30%, while women are almost evenly split between the two candidates, at 44% for Talarico and 43% for Crockett.\n\nRecommended: Hakeem Jeffries Just Crossed a Dangerous Line That Can’t Be Uncrossed\n\nWhile we can parse the demographic splits looking for an explanation, the answer is probably far more straightforward.\n\nTexas has become the Democrats' white whale. They've been trying to turn it blue for years without success, and the pattern is embarrassingly consistent. Back in 2018, some polls claimed that Beto O'Rourke was ahead of Ted Cruz. Cruz won that election. Then, in 2022, Beto tried to run for governor. Some polls said the race was close. Abbott ultimately won by 11 points. Fast forward to 2024, and polls once again gave Democrats hope and showed a close race between Cruz and Colin Allred. Cruz won by eight points. And don’t get me started on the polls that claimed Texas was in play for Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite the Democrats’ repeated failure to flip Texas, they keep throwing money and resources into the state, believing they still have a chance. Even in defeat, Democrats believe Texas is trending blue, and the rejection of Crockett in the Democratic Party primary is more likely a sign that Texas Democrats realize that they need a more pragmatic approach to choosing their candidates if they want to be even remotely competitive.\n\nDoes that really mean Tallerico can win? I wouldn’t bet on it. But, if you were a Democrat, do you really think a state that Trump won by more than 13 points is going to elect Jasmine Crockett? Of course not. Talarico may not win, but you’d probably still think you had a shot with anyone but Crockett.\n\nSo, sorry, Jasmine, things aren’t looking good for you right now. But, something tells me you won’t go away quietly.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/16/oh-jasmine-we-hardly-knew-ya-n4948394","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/345/656f695c-9f49-4729-8341-c76fa2190eec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 20:28:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":393645984,"title":"Everything we know about Charlie Kirk’s alleged ‘assassin’ Tyler Robinson","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMore than four months after right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead, prime suspect Tyler Robinson remains in custody as he prepares for his trial.\n\nKirk, 31, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop as he spoke onstage during an outdoor campus event attended by 3,000 people in Utah on September 10. \n\nTyler James Robinson, 22, has been charged with offences including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice over the shooting.\n\nIf convicted of killing Kirk, the charge means he could face the death penalty.\n\nHe is due to appear in court later today, with his defence team set to argue that one of the prosecutors needs to be removed from the trial due to their 18-year-old child being at the event where Kirk was killed.\n\nRobinson is reported to have raised suspicions while speaking with relatives, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said.\n\n Tyler Robinson is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder, and felony discharge of a firearm, among other offences (Picture : AP)\n\nMr Cox called Kirk’s murder a ‘watershed in American history’ and comparing it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nUtah County attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s DNA was found on the trigger of the rifle, alleging Robinson discarded the rifle and clothing and asked his roommate to conceal evidence.\n\nRobinson left a note under a keyboard saying he planned to kill Kirk and confessed after the shooting, documents allege.\n\nGray said Robinson’s romantic partner, who was reportedly trans, sent the suspect several messages on the day of the shooting.\n\n‘Drop what you’re doing. Look under my keyboard,’ Robinson said in one text. Under it, the partner found a note that said: ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it.’\n\nRobinson’s next hearing has been scheduled for September 29 at 10am, and will be held using WebEx.\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson?\n\nMr Cox told reporters the suspect had lived for a long time with his family in Washington County in the southwest corner of Utah, near the Arizona and Nevada borders.\n\nRobinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records.\n\nHe was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.\n\nHe is listed as an ‘inactive’ voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, when Republican Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n Mr Kirk, 31, was answering a question about gun violence at Utah Valley University on Wednesday when he was shot (Picture: Reuters)\n\n The body of Charlie Kirk is carried from Air Force Two (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAt the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system.\n\nAn honour roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member’s social media account.\n\nHe attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson. He’s now enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St George.\n\n Images show what appears to be a young man wearing dark clothing including a shirt with what appears to be an American flag (Picture: FBI Salt Lake City/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock)\n\n Utah Valley University shooting map (Picture: Metro)\n\nA neighbour, Steven Green, said he knew the family from attending the same Mormon church down the street.\n\n‘Great family, good kids,’ he said, though he added he did not know Tyler Robinson well.\n\nCanaan Timothy, 21, said he was in the year below Robinson at high school. Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.\n\n‘I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,’ said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family.\n\n‘Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.’\n\nWho are his parents?\n\nRobinson has two younger brothers, and his parents Amber Jones Robinson and Matt Robinson have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts.\n\nHis parents are registered to vote as Republicans but none of their social media posts appeared overtly political.\n\nPosts by Robinson’s mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska.\n\nThey frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles.\n\n People cashing in on Charlie Kirk’s death selling ‘gunman’s shirt’\n\nA young Robinson is shown smiling as he grips the handles of a 50-caliber heavy machine gun.\n\nRobert Sylvester has lived on the same tree-lined street as the Robinson family for about six years and described the family as ‘pretty quiet’, adding that the suspect’s father keeps busy as a contractor.\n\n‘They’re not unlike most families,’ he said.\n\nWhat do we know about Robinson’s alleged motive?\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand what allegedly led Robinson to that rooftop.\n\nOfficials have not yet identified a precise motive for the shooting, though they offered some clues in announcing his arrest the day after the shooting. \n\nMr Cox told reporters that a family member interviewed by law enforcement said Robinson had recently mentioned Kirk’s scheduled appearance at Utah Valley University, where he was shot.\n\n‘They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints he had,’ Cox said, without offering further details.\n\nRobinson had also become more political in recent years, the family member told investigators, and authorities said he had engraved what appeared to be anti-fascist messages on bullet casings they found with the suspected murder weapon.\n\nWhat rifle did the gunman use and what did the bullet casings say?\n\nThe governor declined to discuss possible motives for the killing.\n\nBut in describing inscriptions investigators found on ammunition recovered from the scene, Mr Cox said one of the casings bore the message: ‘Here fascist!

John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned critic, is living under a politically hatched indictment, and Mike Pence, his first-term vice president, was exposed to a violent mob for executing his constitutionally mandated duties.\n\nYet Powell’s case is distinct because he—more than any other top-level civil servant—helped secure the most significant policy triumph of Trump’s career. He even played a crucial part in Trump’s eventual reelection.\n\nDuring the Obama years, after the mortgage bust, Ben Bernanke and the Fed kept the short-term interest rate close to zero, setting the stage for Powell’s role in the Trump economy. Free money was great for stock-market investors, but Main Street’s recovery was torpid.\n\nIn 2018, when Powell took office, a year into Trump’s first term, the federal funds rate was still only 1.5 percent. Under Powell, the Fed gradually hiked the rate to 2.5 percent and then pulled back. Trump squawked and mused about firing Powell.\n\nTrump’s carping notwithstanding, economic growth spiked during Powell’s first year to 3 percent, the highest since the mid-2000s, and wages rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. Growth remained a still-strong 2.6 percent in 2019. And thanks to Powell’s refusal to cave to the president, inflation remained muted. In other words, wage gains translated to real gains in living standards. Inequality, as measured by the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances, actually contracted. By any fair measure, economic performance during the first three years of Trump 1.0 was good, and the Fed chief deserved credit—which never emanated from the White House.\n\nPowell’s record during Joe Biden’s presidency was far more mixed. When the pandemic shut down the economy during 2020, Powell cut the federal funds rate to effectively zero. And left it there.\n\nBiden, inaugurated nine months after the COVID recession ended, enacted a massive deficit-spending program. He styled himself a second version of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just as Trump had pursued a highly stimulative program (particularly with his tax cut), so did Biden. The purposes were different, but both added to inflationary pressures.\n\nUnder Biden, Powell did not experience overt pressure from the White House, but there was soft pressure on the Fed not to choke off the recovery, and to align with the executive during a crisis. Both Powell and the Biden White House misread the COVID recession as similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown. In a financial crisis, recoveries are typically slow. People’s assets are underwater and stimulus is needed for a protracted period. During the COVID recession, once people exited the initial lockdown, the crisis was over.\n\nWhen COVID struck, Powell kept the overnight interest rate at or below 1 percent for more than two years, until June 2022. By then, the annualized inflation rate had hit 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.\n\nPowell then became serious about fighting inflation and eventually brought it under control, but the damage was done. In effect, Powell had saved Trump from his worst instincts but failed to do so for Biden.\n\nThe statistic known as “real median household income” vividly contrasts what happened to the typical family’s living standard during each presidential term, after adjusting for inflation. During Trump’s first term, it rose 10 percent before COVID and 8.2 percent overall. Under Biden, it rose 2.6 percent.\n\nWhen Trump ran for reelection in 2020—before there was even a vaccine for COVID—the pandemic recession was on voters’ minds. But four years later, when voters told pollsters that the economy had been better under Trump than under Biden, median household income is what they were remembering, even if that’s not how they articulated it.\n\nInflation was probably the greatest factor in Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden were both reckless deficit spenders, but thanks to Powell’s tougher stance against inflation, Trump’s economy performed better, and that secured his political comeback.\n\nTrump’s response to this good fortune has been to attack the independence of the Fed and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects much of the data on which the Fed relies. Toward Powell, he has been vindictive (for what, exactly?) and mean-spirited.\n\nTrump wants Powell to lower rates, just as the Fed kept them low under Biden. This would risk repeating the Biden-era inflation that Trump campaigned against. Does this make sense? Not to me, either.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jerome-powell-fed-trump-thankless/685653/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lcKbYryyRSso5I6OvwNmtQk4R0c=/0x0:4000x2250/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_16_How_Jay_Powell_Helped_Re_Elect_Trump/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:50:54","author":"Roger Lowenstein","authors":["Roger Lowenstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":393631202,"title":"Trump donor, dark money largely funding Maine referendum drives","text":"Funding for two state referendum drives is coming almost exclusively from out-of-state sources. \n\nA citizen initiative to end recreational marijuana sales and add tracking and testing requirements to medical marijuana received a $2 million infusion from Smart Approach to Marijuana Action Inc., a dark money group from Virginia. \n\nAnd a citizen initiative to remove transgender protections for students is mostly funded by an $800,000 contribution from conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, the founder of the Wisconsin-based Uline Corp., a shipping supplies company. \n\nThe disclosures contained in campaign finance reports filed this week show the outsized role that national groups may play in deciding local issues in the 2026 election cycle. The cycle also includes competitive races for the U.S. Senate and both seats in the U.S. House.\n\nUihlein and his wife donated about $138 million to various federal political groups during the 2024 cycle, according to Open Secrets. His primary Super PAC, Restoration PAC, spent about $35 million supporting Trump and attacking his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris. It also spent $3.1 million opposing Maine U.S. Rep.

The results this November will depend more on the voters' perception of which side understands and speaks to their real concerns.\n\n\"Affordability\" is a catchphrase, not a definition or a policy declaration. Democrats are going to rely, as they have been since at least 2008, on radical racial politics and trying to paint the right as Nazis or closet kluxers.\n\nJosh Barro wrote an essay pointing out that the enthusiastic support for \"bomb-thrower\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) in her bid for the Democratic Party nomination to the U.S. Senate demonstrates why many Democrats are stuck in the past, trying to define everything through the prism of race.\n\nNot only is Crockett a hyper-partisan nut, but she's also out-and-out stupid.\n\nOr, consider what Crockett said when Republicans sought to censure Stacey Plaskett, the non-voting delegate representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, for her ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Crockett went to the House floor with a list of Republicans who had taken donations from “Jeffrey Epstein,” including Lee Zeldin, the former congressman from Long Island who now serves as EPA Administrator. But there was a problem — the Jeffrey Epstein who donated to Zeldin is a Long Island neurosurgeon who made his donations in 2020, after the notorious Manhattan financier Epstein had died.\n\nHer explanation for getting the two Jeffery Epsteins mixed up is a primer on how to never admit you're wrong, even not doing so makes you look even dumber.\n\n\"Listen, I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein,\" she told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Just so that people understand, when you make a donation, your picture is not there… unlike Republicans, I at least don’t go out and just tell lies. Because it was not the same one — that’s fine.\"\n\nBarro points out that \"she’s a loudmouth who talks a lot of s**t in a way that’s neither smart nor strategic.\" He added, \"She appeals to the sort of voter who is so partisan that he or she thinks 'I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein” is a good argument.\"\n\nFor this reason, Crockett has a very good chance of winning the Democratic Party primary in March to face either incumbent Sen. John Cornyn or Attorney General Ken Paxton, who are running neck and neck in the polls. She's running eight points behind Rep. James Talarico, another radical left bomb-thrower. Barro believes, \"what makes him stand out in the crowd is his choir boy/seminarian persona.\"\n\nRelated: Pray That Elizabeth Warren's Vision for a 'New' Democratic Party Comes True in Time for Midterms\n\nBarro sees the problem because Democratic Party voters have developed \"deeply dysfunctional relationships to black women as political candidates.\" Not just Crockett, but Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, Fani Willis, and Tish James. These are all barely competent (or worse) office holders who have legions of white liberals standing up for them, no matter what stupidity or illegal crap they pull.\n\nOf course, the grant of inherent moral authority does not extend to all black women, but only to black women who agree with the person issuing the grant — as Steve Morris noted on this week’s Central Air (see link below), a liberal who worships Crockett or Abrams is unlikely to extend the same reverence to a socialist like Nina Turner or a moderate like Lauren Underwood, let alone to a Republican like Winsome Earle-Sears. But the idea that moral authority arises from black female identity is what makes Crockett so popular as a meme: liberals, even if they are not themselves black or female, can share her “clapbacks” online and see them as final-boss slams that win arguments, even if what she is saying is false (Zeldin accepted money from Epstein) or politically damaging (Hispanic voters have a “slave mentality”) or contentless (Greene has a “bleach-blond bad-built butch-body”).\n\nThey have created a mythos around black female candidates because \"black women are an essential part of the Democratic Party coalition — they vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, and their votes are needed to win elections.\" This mythos has led \"to a view that there is inherent moral authority that arises from being a black female Democrat,\" Barro writes. \n\nAs long as Democratic midterm voters are stuck in that mindset, neither Crockett nor Talarico has much of a chance against any Republican in the field.\n\nThe same might be said of Democrats across the country. Republican losses will be minimized, and in some districts, the left will actually work in the GOP's favor, giving it a fighting chance of maintaining control of Congress.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2026/01/16/the-cult-of-jasmine-crockett-refuses-to-move-on-from-the-reign-of-terror-racial-politics-of-2020-n4948387","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/324/967fd60e-aab8-4de5-a5f1-c4ed7a5a66c1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:00:00","author":"Rick Moran","authors":["Rick Moran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":393642408,"title":"Iranian Calls Out Leftists’ Hypocrisy, and She Couldn't Be More Right","text":"🇮🇷 This is how an Iranian girl, a follower of Zoroastrianism, explains everything \"on her fingers\":🔴\"Hello, I am Iranian.Everyone keeps asking the same question over and over: what's wrong with the leftists?

Why are they so noisy, why do they support the Gaza Strip, but remain completely silent when it comes to Iran?” Why, indeed? \n\nFor some reason, it is never popular to support victims of Islamic dictatorship. Unfortunately, even Donald Trump appears to be reversing his promise to help the Persian protesters in Iran after pressure from Qatar and other Khamenei-loving Gulf states. There was a lot more pontificating, even from the American right, about Gaza than about Iran. As for the left, they’re on Ayatollah Khamenei’s side as he massacres Persians.\n\nAs Iranians filled the streets of Tehran and other cities despite murderous fire from Iranian government terrorists, American leftists filled the streets of many of our major cities to protest the death of would-be killer Renee Good, who committed vehicular assault on an ICE officer to prevent the arrest of foreign sexual predators. It must be heartbreaking for the Persians waiting for the Western aid and empathy that never comes.\n\nRead Also: Muslim Who Stabbed Westernized Sister Caught 13 Years After Deportation Order\n\nI would like to point out another aspect of Democrats’ hypocrisy. Leftists swore that the Capitol events of Jan. 6, 2021, represented the worst “insurrection” in American history. Kamala Harris compared Jan. 6 to Sept. 11 and Pearl Harbor. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it “the day democracy was placed at greater risk than it has been in a century.” Politicians and media outlets called for the harshest of punishments for J6 protesters, and ignored multiple reports of inhumane conditions for J6 prisoners.\n\nExcept that Jan. 6 was never an insurrection, and in fact, we now know that literally hundreds of federal agents were embedded in the crowd, rigging and directing and manipulating the event to seem worse than it originally was. Most importantly of all, the only people killed on Jan. 6 were protesters murdered by Capitol police. Yet Democrats repeatedly lied about Capitol police being killed on that day.\n\nI mention this because the activists who decried J6ers are now actively assaulting federal immigration officers and considering themselves heroes for doing so. Dems acclaimed the Capitol police officers who murdered Ashli Babbitt and Rosanne Boyland as heroes. Now they're comparing Homeland Security officers who are arresting murderers to the Gestapo. As with their attitude toward the Iranian protests, Democrats have reality upside down.\n\nThere is one commonality between Democrats' opinions on any given protest or political event: Whichever is the most evil and indefensible side, that is the side leftists will join.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/16/iranian-calls-out-leftists-hypocrisy-and-she-couldnt-be-more-right-n4948382","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/13/adbad902-2f8a-43ee-9450-c4cd0c5b8f3f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:42:00","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.64},{"id":393638646,"title":"Nebraska Governor Backs Ballot Measure Changing How State Elects Presidents","text":"Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen, a Republican, during his State of the State address this week, backed a plan to change how the state elects presidents. Newsweek reached out to Pillen’s office and the Nebraska Democratic Party for comment via email. Why It Matters Nebraska, along with Maine, is one of two states that do not use a winner-take-all electoral system in presidential races. Instead, it allocates two electoral votes for the statewide victor, while each candidate receives one additional vote per Congressional district they carry. In 2024, President Donald Trump won four of the state’s five votes, while former Vice President Kamala Harris won a single Electoral College vote for the Omaha-based seat she narrowly carried. If this plan goes through, Republicans may benefit from not having to worry about the Second Congressional District, which is viewed as competitive for both parties. It backed both Harris and former President Joe Biden while electing centrist GOP Representative Don Bacon at the same time. What to Know Pillen, during his speech, urged legislators to pass a GOP-led bill that would establish a ballot question in November 2026 that would allow the state’s voters to decide whether to move to a winner-take-all system or stick with the current way it elects presidents. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen speaks during the State of the State address in Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 15, 2026. “I call upon this Legislature to pass Senator Dorn’s LR24CA to place this question on the November 2026 ballot so that the people of this state can have the final say as to how their voice will be heard in America’s most important national election,” he said. He said there is a “clear majority” in the legislature who would vote for that change, but that a “minority of this body has repeatedly obstructed the will of the majority of this body and the majority of this state by filibustering it to death.” If the bill passes, it would be left up to voters. That doesn’t guarantee that it would pass, though Republicans do make up a majority of Nebraska, which gave Trump more than 59 percent of the vote in 2024. There were efforts to change the state’s electoral system ahead of the 2024 election as polls showed a tight margin between Trump and Harris, but those efforts failed. Ultimately, Nebraska’s competitive district did not matter as Trump carried each swing state. However, there are electoral scenarios where the district could have been a tiebreaker. If Harris had won the three closest states—Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania—she would have held 269 electoral votes, so the Second District would have pushed her over the top. The Omaha World-Herald reported that lawmakers have already voted on a bill to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state that failed to overcome the filibuster. The state legislature is officially nonpartisan, and two members who caucus with Republicans voted against it. Maine is the only other state that splits its electoral votes. Democrats are generally favored statewide in presidential races, and the First Congressional District, based around the southern part of the state, is also safely Democratic. The Second District, however, is more conservative, having backed Trump in each of his three presidential bids. What People Are Saying Governor Jim Pillen said during his address: “We have arrived at the critical juncture in our long-running debate over whether Nebraska should unify and strengthen its voice in presidential elections, which this body decided to divide without the input of the people in a partisan act three decades ago.” Nancy Pettito, executive director of Civic Nebraska, responded to his remarks in a statement Thursday: “Nebraska’s split electoral vote system has ensured that more Nebraskans are represented in presidential elections. When voters know their participation matters, engagement increases. Our current system reflects Nebraska values of independence, balance, and accountability, while preventing national political parties from taking our state for granted. “There is no compelling reason to abandon a system that has served Nebraska well and given voters more voice and national relevance. Civic Nebraska urges lawmakers to protect Nebraska’s split electoral vote and reject efforts to move to winner-take-all.” What Happens Next It’s yet to be seen whether the legislature will advance the bill to create a ballot initiative. If so, no public polling has been conducted on whether it will pass. But it could have key implications for the 2028 presidential race.","summary":"Nebraska Republicans are eyeing a change to how the state allocates its Electoral College votes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nebraska-governor-backs-ballot-measure-changing-how-state-elects-presidents-11374330","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26015710282501.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:36:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":393612994,"title":"'Mask is off': Trump voters growing disillusioned with 'sinister and out of control' Trump","text":"Donald Trump has run for president four times, starting with a short-lived Reform Party campaign in 2000.

Critics argue the spending has little to do with improving classroom outcomes and everything to do with advancing partisan politics.\n\nTime to end teachers unions. Post haste! pic.twitter.com/ykrgs0Bc43\n— Shannon 🇺🇸I stand with America (@thewriterme) January 4, 2026\n\nAmong the beneficiaries of the funds from teachers unions were powerful left-wing philanthropic hubs including the Tides Network, New Venture Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, and Future Forward — groups that sit at the center of the progressive political funding ecosystem. According to the report, those organizations alone received nearly $1.5 million from the unions.\n\nFuture Forward played a major role in national politics as the primary super PAC backing Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The report shows money from the teachers unions flowing into the same political machinery powering Democratic campaigns at the highest levels.\n\nThe unions also directed large sums to organizations explicitly focused on electing Democrats, including the Democratic Governors Association, House Majority PAC, and Senate Majority PAC — groups whose missions center on winning political power rather than improving classroom instruction.\n\nIn addition, the unions donated heavily to major left-wing think tanks shaping national policy debates. The Center for American Progress and its affiliated 501(c)(4) arm received close to $1 million combined from the two unions since 2022, according to Defending Ed’s findings.\n\nCritics say the spending underscores a widening disconnect between teachers unions leadership and rank-and-file educators. In many states, teachers were historically required to join unions and pay dues as a condition of employment, leaving them little choice but to financially support political causes they may not agree with — or may actively oppose.\n\nDefending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley said the findings confirm long-standing concerns among parents and teachers.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union has been widely regarded as one of the most outspoken, radical unions in the country, and that is no accident.

It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.”\n\nTeachers unions leaders have defended the spending, arguing that education policy is inseparable from broader social and political issues. Critics counter that teachers enter the profession to educate children, not to bankroll national political machines.\n\nThe teachers unions report lands amid a historic shift in American education. Homeschooling has surged to record highs nationwide, a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained elevated. Parents say remote learning gave them an unprecedented look inside classrooms — and what they saw prompted many to walk away.\n\nVirtual instruction exposed curriculum content, political messaging, and ideological discussions that parents say went far beyond basic academics. For many families, it marked the breaking point in their trust of the public school system.\n\nThis raging screeching lunatic is in charge of one of the largest teachers unions in America.\nHomeschool your kids. pic.twitter.com/Ewwi4P2lHs\n— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) July 22, 2024\n\nAmid this backdrop, teachers unions membership has steadily declined since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling ended mandatory union dues for public-sector employees. For decades, teachers in many states were required to financially support unions regardless of their personal beliefs. After the ruling made membership optional, union rolls began shrinking as educators exercised the right to opt out.\n\nDespite the decline in teachers unions membership, the Defending Ed report shows union leadership has continued pouring tens of millions of dollars into left-wing political causes, intensifying scrutiny over how dues from remaining members are being used.\n\nAs homeschooling continues to grow and public confidence in traditional education erodes, the report adds fresh pressure on teachers unions already facing questions about whose interests they truly serve.","summary":"Report exposes massive political spending by teachers unions as forced dues backlash grows","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/teachers-unions-cash-splash-far-left-woke-groups-rake-in-millions-as-parents-flee-public-schools","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/teachers-unions.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:23:27","author":"Tara Dodrill","authors":["Tara Dodrill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.229},{"id":393628820,"title":"Kamala Harris back in Chicago: &#8216;People are sick and tired of being sick and tired&#8217;","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris tapped into local resentment against the White House Friday during a brief speech in Chicago, her latest post-election stop as she seeks to stay in the national spotlight while mulling whether to make another run for the Oval Office in two years.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Interfaith Breakfast downtown, the Democratic nominee for president in 2 ...","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/16/kamala-harris-chicago-sick-and-tired/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ctc-l-kamala-harris-mlk-breakfast-03.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 17:52:18","author":"Alice Yin","authors":["Alice Yin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":393612974,"title":"Kamala Harris and Mayor Brandon Johnson Unite at Chicago’s MLK Interfaith Breakfast to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.","text":"In a gathering that underscores the spirit of unity and reflection, Chicago paid tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at its 40th annual interfaith breakfast on Friday.\n\nThis significant event brought together a diverse group of community and faith leaders from all over the city.

He pardoned violent insurrectionists and other rich fraudsters who used their considerable means to bribe their way to freedom. He's cut benefits to the poor and slashed the federal government in a way that hurt federal workers while also costing taxpayers money. His idiotic trade policy has not only failed to lower prices but also tanked the job market. And he's literally destroyed part of the White House to turn it into his own version of his tacky Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nTurns out, America isn’t a fan of all that.

Indeed, with less than a year to go before the midterms, Democrats are the favorites to win control of the House and may even have a shot at flipping the Senate. \n\nAnd, believe it or not, a lot of that is thanks to Democratic messaging.

But we won’t give them that satisfaction,” said Harris, who last visited Chicago in October to promote her book about losing the presidency to Trump. “We will continue the fight with determination, with resilience and, dare I say, with joy. So, in the spirit of Chicago, it is time to bear down.”\n\nHarris is mulling another run for president in 2028, along with other potential hopefuls such as Gov. JB Pritzker and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nHarris said she flew to Chicago Thursday evening from Memphis, Tennessee, where she spent time at the National Civil Rights Museum and reflected on “the stakes of what Dr. King confronted.”\n\n“Government-sanctioned segregation and redlining, the vote of the people denied by literacy tests and poll taxes. Churches bombed and people lynched,” she said. “Here, what we understand about that moment, hate and fear were being weaponized by the powerful to terrorize those they saw as powerless,” Harris said.\n\nShe said King and leaders of that time reminded the people of their power. They “reminded them that it doesn’t have to be this way; that the power of protest, of organizing, of the collective can change the course of our history and its country.”\n\nThe same can and should be done in response to the Trump administration, she said.\n\n“I thought about what Dr. King would see if he looks at America now,” she said.\n\nShe asked what King would think about the Trump administration attempts to rewrite Congressional maps, or call the Civil Rights movement “reverse racism,” or of social media and misinformation “taking hold of our lives and the lives of children.”\n\n“When the federal government rips people out of their car, out of their home, out of their church — when families are separated and a mother of three is shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis — people are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Harris said.\n\nShe said many people feel overwhelmed with the state of the country, and many people are isolated and lonely. “A long-broken system has fueled cynicism and, yes, apathy, and people are rightly angry and profoundly frustrated,” she said.\n\nHarris asked people to pause and see the echoes of history: “Yes, the threats we face, but also the power of the people.\n\n“Let us see, like then, this is a moment not to throw up our hands, but a moment to roll up our sleeves, to organize, to register people to vote and to speak and act with truth, power and conviction. And I look around this room. I know the people of Chicago. You uniquely understand that the fight requires courage. It requires stamina. And it requires commitment. It requires us to show up, even when we are sick and tired because we are sick and tired.”\n\n“To the leaders here, I saw, let us continue to be clear-eyed. They may want us to be afraid, to be divided, to be silent. But we don’t give them that satisfaction. We will continue to fight with determination, with resilience and, I dare with, with joy. So, in the spirit of Chicago, it is time to bear down.”\n\nThis year’s MLK breakfast’s theme was “defending democracy, protecting our rights.” Other speakers included Mayor Brandon Johnson and state House Speaker Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch. The breakfast honored author and peace activist Jacqueline L. Jackson and the Rev. David Black with its Champion of Freedom award.\n\nThe late former Mayor Harold Washington, the city’s first Black mayor, held the first MLK Interfaith Breakfast more than 40 years ago.

For those who had been convicted in the past, the data doesn't distinguish between minor offenses and violent crimes.\n\n Though data on how many Americans have been swept up in immigration arrests remains incomplete, ProPublica identified more than 170 cases where U.S. citizens were detained at raids and protests in the first nine months of Trump's second presidency.\n\n Podcaster Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the final stretch of the 2024 election, has become one of the most prominent critics of the president's immigration actions.\n\n On the Jan. 13 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, he said \"most people\" believe law enforcement is necessary and they should arrest criminals, but said many of the same people also believe ICE is \"operating illegally.\"\n\n \"Those same people that believe that might also believe that once someone is here, they should be able to stay in this country and ICE is operating illegally and we shouldn't have militarized groups of people roaming the streets just showing up with masks on, snatching people up, some of them U.S. citizens, and shipping them to countries they didn't even come from,\" he said.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n Rogan — whose show has routinely held the No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts and has more than 20 million subscribers on YouTube — also compared ICE asking for U.S. residents' papers to actions carried out by the \"Gestapo,\" the political police under Adolph Hitler's Nazi regime, which used tactics including surveillance, home searches, and interrogation — sometimes torture — in investigations of people seen as enemies of the Nazis.\n\n \"I can also see the point of view of the people that say, 'Yeah, but you don’t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around snatching people up, many of which turn out to actually be U.S. citizens that just don’t have their papers on them,' \" Rogan, 58, said. \"Are we really going to be the Gestapo?

Over the past few weeks, TikTok and Instagram users have been declaring that pop culture has come full circle, from indie sleaze fashion and Tumblr-era aesthetics to throwback filters and deliberately lo-fi posts. A recent BBC video suggests the resurgence of 2016 nostalgia is driven by both platform culture and the fact that it was a culturally dense period that many remember fondly. Forget the uncertainty spawned by the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's first election victory—the year marked the peak of Snapchat Stories, defined by instantly recognizable features like the dog filter and flower crown. One talking head in the video notes that the era produced such a strong run of pop hits that many are still played on BBC Radio 1 today, with artists like Zara Larsson, Zayn, The Chainsmokers, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975 dominating the charts. Reese Witherspoon visits “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” at Rockefeller Center on December 16, 2016, in New York City. Celebrities have been quick to travel back in time. Singer John Legend, 47, shared a nostalgic selection of photos from the era, including a tender shot of him kissing his wife Chrissy Teigen shortly after the birth of their daughter Luna, a snap with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, and a glamorous moment from the Oscars. John Legend’s post also referenced La La Land, the musical that dominated the 2016 awards season and became inseparable from pop culture history after the infamous Oscars mix-up, when it was mistakenly announced as Best Picture before the award attribution was corrected to Moonlight. “2016 - The year of Luna, Darkness & Light, La La Land…“ he wrote as the caption. Billie Eilish, 24, kept things minimal, posting a cool black-and-white snap with a simple caption: “2016.“ The understated post perfectly captured the artist's aesthetic. Charlie Puth, 34, also leaned into the throwback. The singer-songwriter and producer—known for hits like “Attention“ and “We Don’t Talk Anymore“—shared a post referencing his career breakthrough. “2016 charlie here to remind you that beat yourself up is out tonight and my world tour goes on sale at 10am local time:)“ he captioned the post. Melissa McCarthy, 55, revisited her film career highs from the time, sharing throwback images from the sets of The Boss and Life of the Party. “The year was 2016. Life of the Party & The Boss were happening and through it all I remained very devoted to my beloved HIPSTAMATIC!! For the VIBES!!!!“ she wrote. Model and former Victoria’s Secret Angel Miranda Kerr, 42, shared a selection of photos complete with the era’s unmistakable Snapchat filters—think dog ears, flower crowns, and heavily softened lighting. “Since we’re bringing 2016 back…“ she wrote. Reese Witherspoon, 49, also jumped on the trend, sharing a selection of shots of herself. “I heard we’re bringing back 2016,“ she wrote.","summary":"&quot;I heard we’re bringing back 2016,&quot; wrote Reese Witherspoon, jumping on the trend.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/decade-old-photos-celebrities-revealed-nostalgic-trend-11372757","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Copy-of-32-image-2026-01-16T153026.125.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 17:11:50","author":"Lydia Patrick","authors":["Lydia Patrick"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.385},{"id":393642412,"title":"Tufts Professor Drag Queen to Give Harvard Lecture on Kamala and Mamdani","text":"A “queer ethnography” professor who goes by the name “LaWhore Vagistan” when in drag has been invited to Harvard University to give a special lecture on Kamala Harris.\n\nHarvard last year hired Kareem Khubchandani, an associate professor of Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora Studies at Tufts University, as a visiting professor. Now, the wacko who spends his free time dressing up like a female caricature and performing gross sexual routines is back, not only to continue teaching classes, but to host a special and especially disgusting political lecture.\n\nThe drag queen professor is still set to teach “Queer Ethnography” and “RuPaulitics Queer Ethnography” for Harvard’s Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Department. But on Feb. 10, he will host the 2025-2026 Matthiessen Lecture at the woke Ivy League university called “Auntologies: Queer Aesthetics and South Asian Aunties.” It is going to feature discussions of two high-profile Democrat politicians — Zohran Mamdani and Kamala Harris.\n\nKhubchandani performs in drag under the vile name “LaWhore Vagistan.” The first name supposedly comes from Lahore, Pakistan, where Kareem would almost certainly be executed for his activities. And the second name — well, I don’t think I really need to explain what word Khubchandani combined with “Pakistan.”\n\n‘LaWhore Vagistan’ to lead Harvard lecture linking drag, politics, and Kamala Harris’ ‘chitthi brigade’Link in bio or read the story at https://t.co/kH1TNSDvnl#harvard #drag #kamalaharris #drag #campusreform pic.twitter.com/3TAavsolwV— Campus Reform (@campusreform) January 14, 2026\n\nThe Harvard description of the upcoming lecture enthuses, “The figure of the aunty is ubiquitous in South Asian public culture. Most recently, incumbent New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani repeatedly named the ‘aunties’ that tirelessly supported his mayoral campaign. This is not an uncalculated mention and has many precedents.” Mamdani’s most famous mention of his aunt was when he claimed she was afraid to wear a hijab on the New York subway after 911, even though it turned out his aunt does not wear a hijab at all and did not live in New York after the 2001 terrorist attack.\n\nBut to return to Khubchandani’s creepy lecture description:\n\nDuring Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential run, she described herself as “Auntie” on her Twitter profile and had a “chitthi brigade” of South Indian aunties supporting her campaign. In 2016 an Indian newspaper caused a national stir by labeling a politician “aunty national.” The mention of “aunties” in South Asian contexts is vexed, inviting both warmth and revulsion. This talk draws on the tools of queer studies to demonstrate how the study of aunties can elucidate important questions of gender, sexuality, and normativity. \n\nWhat the actual hell (and I do mean hell, the obvious source of this insanity) does any of this mean? Inviting “warmth and revulsion”? Important questions of “normativity”? I think Donald Trump needs to cut off Harvard’s federal funding again.\n\nMcMahon Investigates California Community Colleges for ‘Trans’ Athletes\n\nThe reality is that “LaWhore Vagistan” is not an academic; he is a mentally ill activist with a pseudo-academic veneer.\n\nKareem Khubchandani is Associate Professor of theater, dance, and performance studies at Tufts University. He is the author of the award-winning books Decolonize Drag and Ishtyle: Accenting Gay Indian Nightlife. He is also co-editor of the Lambda Literary-nominated Queer Nightlife, guest editor of Text and Performance Quarterly’s “Critical Aunty Studies,” and associate editor for GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies. His new book, Lessons in Drag: A Queer Manual for Academics, Artists, and Aunties is now out from Brandeis University Press.\n\nWhenever I read something like this lecture description and Khubchandani’s bio, I am reminded why I did not go to an Ivy League university or decide to pursue a master’s degree. What a horrendous waste of some $85,000 a year to send a kid to Harvard for such perverted indoctrination.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of wokeness in education and other key news in this new year.

enforcement and warns it could damage Trump's midterm chances","text":"Megyn Kelly has warned her fellow Republicans that Americans are majorly souring on President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement tactics and that it could cost the party dearly in the midterm elections.\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with Adam Corolla on her Sirius XM radio show, Kelly acknowledged that polling data shows Americans are deeply dissatisfied with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), especially after the deadly January 7 shooting of Renee Good by an agent in Minneapolis.\n\nOn air, Kelly reacted to a YouGov poll that came out on January 14, which among other things, showed that 53 percent of Americans thought the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, was not justified in killing Good, a 37-year-old mother-of-three.\n\n'I mean, that’s just not good,' Kelly said.\n\nThe same number of Americans, 53 percent, believe Ross should face criminal charges, something the Department of Justice almost certainly won't pursue given the Trump administration is unified in arguing the agent acted in self-defense.\n\nAccording to the YouGov survey, 42 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly support the idea of ICE being abolished, while 60 percent believed ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary force against US citizens.\n\nA slightly larger contingent, 45 percent, do not support doing away with the agency, which was created in March 2003 with the passage of the Homeland Security Act.\n\nICE's worsening reputation coincides with a stronger midterm outlook for Democrats, who are on track to easily win back the House of Representatives this November. \n\nHouse Democrats only need to flip three seats to win the House, and according to the non-partisan Cook Political Report, a whopping eighteen races have shifted into the blue column.\n\nExperts also point to Trump's approval rating declining on the immigration issue as a major problem for down-ballot Republicans, who have

Crockett’s announcement in December 2025 was already tearing Democrats apart, and now, new reporting on the donors lining up behind her campaign might make the fight even scrappier. (RELATED: Failed Democrat Candidate Calls It Quits Hours Before Jasmine Crockett Makes Senate Announcement)\n\nAccording to a report from NOTUS, Crockett has received campaign contributions from billionaire tech overlord Marc Andreessen, Wall Street behemoth BlackRock’s PAC, Lockheed Martin’s PAC, and super PACs funded by the crypto industry. \n\nSo, why would that piss off the left?\n\nCrockett claims she’s a liberal, but it has become increasingly clear that she is just a vain, empty suit — Kamala Harris 2.0 — willing to sell herself to the highest bidder. Her main attributes are that she is big on social media and comes across as a real “fighter” by constantly attacking the Trump administration. Her fiery persona is exactly what the base wants, though anyone who sees past the bluster will quickly discover that she is, in fact, all talk and no walk.\n\nThe donations from Andreessen and corporate America suggest that the tech overlords, banks, and defense contractors are genuinely afraid of Talarico. The state lawmaker has previously said that the “biggest welfare queens” in America are giant corporations and CEOs “who get a tax deduction” for flying private. (And he does have a point there.) Although he was one of Donald Trump’s biggest backers in 2024, Andreessen would rather have a puppet like Crockett in the Senate that he and other tech overlords could easily manipulate. \n\nWe all know the left, not the centrists or the empty suits like Crockett, but the actual left, hate corporations, the tech industry, and the military industrial complex. However, here’s something to chew on: are they going to have the guts to call out Crockett even though she checks the identity boxes? As was the case with Kamala Harris, there will be a group of leftists who refuse to denounce her because she is a black woman, even though Talarico appears to be the real progressive in the room.\n\nLess than 50 days out from the primary, Talarico is leading Crockett in the polls. But sometimes in primaries, it’s not the best candidate who wins; it’s the candidate who says all the right things, the loudest.","summary":"Progressives gonna be big mad...","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2026/01/16/jasmine-crockett-texas-senate-primary-democrats-cryptocurrency-blackrock-marc-andreessen/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F01%2FGettyImages-2228562419-1-scaled-e1768574137220.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 16:08:16","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.413},{"id":393597340,"title":"Official at ICE resigns to run for Congress in Ohio","text":"Madison Sheahan, the 28-year-old deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is resigning from the agency to run for Congress in her home state of Ohio. Sheahan has served as ICE’s second-in-command since March 2025. \n\nIt was a period marked by an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement under pressure from President Donald Trump. \n\nSheahan launches campaign\n\nIn a post on X announcing her run, Sheahan described herself as “a Trump conservative running for Congress to protect American jobs, American paychecks, and American values.“ The post links to her campaign website, which features a roughly two-minute introductory video.\n\nIn the video, Sheahan leans heavily on her work at ICE, claiming that under the current administration the agency has recruited more than 12,000 new officers and agents and deported more than 2.5 million undocumented immigrants.\n\n“Ohio neighborhoods are safer thanks to President Trump and ICE,“ she says. \n\nThe video highlights Sheahan’s upbringing on her family’s farm, framing it as a source of toughness and work ethic. She goes on to sharply criticize Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, accusing the longtime incumbent of opposing the border wall and supporting housing and health care access for immigrants. \n\nBacking from DHS leadership\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed to CBS News that Sheahan is leaving ICE to seek elected office, praising her leadership and record.\n\n “Madison Sheahan is a work horse, strong executor, and terrific leader who led the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people’s mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens,” Noem said. \n\nNoem noted she has known Sheahan for years. Before joining ICE, Sheahan served as Noem’s political director for nearly three years when Noem was governor of South Dakota. Sheahan later worked as Louisiana’s secretary of Fish and Wildlife before taking the deputy director role at ICE.\n\nQuestions inside the agency\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Sheahan’s rapid rise inside ICE raised eyebrows among some career officials. The Journal notes she had no previous law enforcement background and was accused by some within the agency of issuing direct operational orders and, at times, sidelining ICE Director Todd Lyons. \n\nThe report also said Sheahan was not visibly present during the recent ICE crackdown in Minneapolis, which led to violent clashes, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good and a separate ICE-involved shooting earlier this week.\n\nCrowded Ohio race ahead\n\nSheahan is entering a competitive Republican primary in Ohio’s 9th Congressional District. It includes Toledo and Sandusky in the northwestern part of the state. She will face state Rep. Josh Williams and former state lawmaker Derek Merrin, who lost to Kaptur in 2024.\n\nTrump carried the district by seven points over Kamala Harris. The primary is scheduled for May 5.\n\nKaptur campaign responds\n\nKaptur, who has represented the district since 1982, is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. Her campaign quickly pushed back on Sheahan’s candidacy.\n\nCampaign manager Kegan Zimmerman told The Washington Post that voters are frustrated by “the self-dealing corruption and culture of lawlessness they’ve seen over the last year” and want a results-driven leader.\n\nThe post Official at ICE resigns to run for Congress in Ohio appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2026/01/16/official-at-ice-resigns-to-run-for-congress-in-ohio/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2246521326_Joe_RaedleGetty_Images_clean-Fp9Z0R.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 16:01:52","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.336},{"id":393605894,"title":"Nolte: Kamala’s $8M Home Purchase Proves She Doesn’t Believe in Climate Change","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris (D-WordSalad) just proved that she doesn’t believe in Climate Change by purchasing an $8.15 million home that sits right on the Pacific coast of Malibu.\n\nBut-but-but she said this in 2023: “To live in a coastal community is to live on the front lines of the climate crisis.”\n\nBut-but-but she has repeatedly told us the planet is warming, the polar ice caps are melting, and the oceans will rise and wipe out the coasts.\n\nI’m so confused.\n\nThey keep doing this, and by they, I mean the fascist cult of Global Warming that wants to raise our taxes, undermine our standard of living, explode energy costs, and meddle in our lives because they believe — truly, truly believe — we are on a path to environmental Armageddon unless we embrace socialism, move to Democrat-run cities, stop having babies, and live in public housing.\n\nFormer President Barry Obama says he believes in Climate Change (i.e., that the oceans will rise) and still buys a multi-million dollar home right on the coast that proves he doesn’t believe it.\n\nBond Villain Bill Gates is so worried about the planet warming and oceans rising, he wants to blot out the sun, and yet he bought a $43 million home right on the coast.\n\nOh, and here’s my favorite…\n\nCNN, a basement-rated, far-left propaganda outlet that spreads conspiracy theories and encourages political violence, has spent decades preaching the Global Warming Gospel, but what did CNNLOL do?

It makes sense, given their positions as senior members of this administration. They may both be stars, but it is still President Donald Trump’s show.\n\nThe problem, however, is that many are looking ahead to the sequel in 2028. \n\n“We’re not even at the midterms yet,” a Republican strategist who requested anonymity to discuss future campaigns told the Washington Examiner. “Their interests might diverge down the road, but right now they are on the same team and have a lot of common interests.”\n\nBoth men have told interviewers that the success of the Trump administration is more important to them than any future race.\n\nNBC News recently quoted a “person close to the vice president” as saying anti-Vance positioning by Republicans with their eyes on 2028 is hurting the current administration, in addition to being “silly and early.” But the outlet reported that this person made clear that “their critique did not extend to Rubio or any other Cabinet member who might be entertaining thoughts of a presidential bid.”\n\nThere still isn’t much that can tamp down the speculation. “If JD Vance runs for president, he’s going to be our nominee, and I’ll be one of the first people to support him,” Rubio told Vanity Fair last year. \n\nThat would seem to be as close to a Sherman statement as one can get years before the next presidential election. Yet many played up a joke Vance reportedly made to a photographer during a shoot for the magazine profile: “I’ll give you $100 for every person you make look really s****y compared to me. And $1,000 if it’s Marco.”\n\nEven their teamwork is often carefully inspected for rifts. Much was made of Vance’s absence from Trump’s news conference announcing the Venezuela operation. He did stand with Trump, Rubio, and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth when the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were made public. But his team has had to push back against reports of Iran policy disagreements as the Islamic Republic faces protests that the president has pledged to support.\n\n“Faced with a barrage of American threats to grab Greenland, Denmark’s foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart flew to Washington for — they hoped — sympathetic talks with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state,” Politico reported. “But their plan for a soothing diplomatic chat escalated into a tense White House head-to-head with the [European Union’s] nemesis, JD Vance.”\n\n“Vance hates us,” an unnamed European diplomat told the outlet. No disagreements between Vance and Rubio on Greenland were specified or are apparent.\n\nVance professes no hatred for Rubio. “I was very fond of him as a Senate colleague, but you learn a lot about somebody when you see them actually operate behind the scenes,” he said when the two spoke at last year’s American Compass gala. “And Marco is, if anything, more impressive privately than he is publicly, which is very hard to do, but he’s very thoughtful. He actually listens, which is a rare skill in politics.”\n\nOn Vance, Rubio said at the same gathering: “I admired him in the Senate. I admire him a lot more now as vice president because I think vice presidents are just more impressive than senators.”\n\nNevertheless, there are plenty of Republicans who would prefer to see them as competitors. Some merely wish to avoid the kind of coronation that plagued Democrats, first with former President Joe Biden and then with his replacement at the top of the 2024 ticket, former Vice President Kamala Harris. Others see ideological and policy reasons to back one over the other.\n\nAlthough they both are converts on Trump, Vance and Rubio hail from different strains of conservatism. Rubio became more populist after his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, adding “common good” conservatives to his senior Senate staff during Trump’s first term.\n\nIt is less clear that Rubio has shifted on foreign policy. Vance, a veteran of the Iraq War, has historically been less hawkish. He was pushed for the vice presidency over rivals such as Rubio by the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who shares this skepticism of “forever wars.” Vance has publicly defended Trump’s recent military interventions and now has taken a certain amount of ownership of Venezuela after the war powers debate, though no modern vice president would have broken with the president on a Senate vote.\n\nTrump, perhaps mindful of his late split over the 2020 election with former Vice President Mike Pence in his first term or simply enamored of the man he has called “the greatest secretary of state in the history of the United States,” has encouraged Rubio vs. Vance talk himself, though he has also proposed an elegant solution. \n\n“I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” he said last year.\n\nHistorian Doris Kearns Goodwin might call it a “team of rivals.” Stranger things have happened.","summary":"Washington insiders keep straining to see daylight between Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, only for the two of them to maintain a united front.

Trump’s face is now visible in the “experience“ section of Obama’s LinkedIn profile. The change was spotted by a Reddit user posting under the handle u/marionjoshua. The post, which was shared to the r/mildlyinfuriating subreddit, has already been upvoted over 17,000 times. Josh, the Reddit user behind the u/marionjoshua account, told Newsweek he noticed the change yesterday. “I was browsing through LinkedIn and decided to check on President Obama,“ he said. “I happened to have watched his new presidential library on YouTube, and, there it was, I saw the new logo.“ Josh added that he decided to post it because he thought it “looked ridiculous“ and “petty.“ Though he doesn’t know precisely when the White House logo was changed, he doesn’t think it was long ago as he recalls “checking Obama’s page a month ago“ and not seeing it. Newsweek has contacted the White House and Obama’s press office for comment. Former President Barack Obama's LinkedIn page. Why It Matters Trump and Obama have clashed at several points during the former’s presidency, and this will only add further fuel to the fire. In July last year, Trump accused Obama of committing “treason“ following the release of a report alleging the Democrat and members of his administration manufactured intelligence regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election and “lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Trump.“ Obama took several jabs at Trump while campaigning for Democrat candidate and former vice president Kamala Harris during the 2024 U.S. elections. Since then, Obama has been more sparing in his criticism of the Trump administration. In June, he criticized Trump without mentioning him by name, saying only that the current administration has a “weak commitment“ to upholding democratic principles. In September, his condemnation of Trump’s gerrymandering at the time also garnered attention. Needless to say, there is little love lost between the two presidents, and the sight of Trump on his LinkedIn pictured alongside arguably Obama’s greatest achievement, serving as president of the United States, is unlikely to sit well with Obama. What To Know The change has come about as a result of an edit to the White House LinkedIn page. Whereas the White House page previously included a thumbnail featuring the build itself, that image has now been replaced by one of Trump. The page has also been updated to the tag line: “The Golden Age of America Begins Right Now.“ It is not clear when the change of photo on the White House LinkedIn profile took place or the motivations behind it. The idea that the alteration was made to impact Obama’s LinkedIn page is highly implausible. However, the impact of the change has been felt on social media. What People Are Saying Some of those commenting on the viral Reddit post saw the change as evidence of Trump’s vanity. u/Comfortable-Roof-185 commented: “Nobody will ever love any of us like Trump loves Trump.“ Another posted, “Your president is so insecure“ with a third, u/Coolbanh, asking: “So it's the Trump House now?“ Others, however, saw the funny side. u/Terrible_Banana2223 said: “It’s wild how something like this can happen. I bet Obama’s team is getting a good laugh out of this one! Another, u/check_me_out-boss, commented: “Sorry, but this is funny.“ A few were simply surprised to discover Obama was on LinkedIn. “I don't know why, but it's funny to me that he's even on linkedin,“ u/deepdishpizzastate said. User u/rentedtritium joked: “Do you think he gets notifications like ‘hiring for presidents of the United States is up 20% this quarter.’“ What Happens Next It is not clear if or how Obama could take steps to remove Trump’s face from his LinkedIn. The president himself may also be unaware that the change has resulted in this. However, with Trump continuing to push allegations of wrongdoing on Obama’s behalf, this is unlikely to be the last time the two presidents go head-to-head.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#039;s face is now a prominent part of former leader Barack Obama&#039;s profile on the popular networking site.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-face-barack-obama-linkedin-profile-11371476","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Obama-LinkedIn.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 13:52:49","author":"Jack Beresford","authors":["Jack Beresford"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":393547154,"title":"Kamala Harris Fake-Sobs About Trump 'Defiling' The White House With His Finger","text":"Oh buddy, the Kamala Harris book tour is BACK! After a brief hiatus for the holidays, the greatest show on turf returned this week with another humdinger from the former vice president. Get this – she's mad that Donald Trump flipped off the snot-nosed Ford worker who called him a pedo protector. Shocking, I know. Didn't see it coming! But it's better than just Kamala being upset. All the Libs are mad. Predictably. As I wrote earlier this week, they didn't care when Joe Biden went on an absolute rampage against voters during the 2020 campaign, but whatever. That's neither here nor there. This is better because Kamala's not only fake-mad, but she also accused Trump of degrading the White House. That's right. KAMALA HARRIS, who was part of an administration that had topless trans activists on the White House LAWN, is now upset at Donald Trump for … degrading … that very same office. Amazing: This is amazing spin from Kamala Harris \"That is not his office … that office belongs to the people!\" I mean, she's just the best. All the Libs are, really. I say it every week. Sometimes multiple times a week. They make this job so easy. The fake-outrage over this one has been amazing. The Libs get fake-mad over a lot of things – all of them having to do with Trump – but this one has been particularly fun to watch. And then a totally sober Kamala Harris comes in and unleashes this little soundbite to top it all off. That was an actual quote from Joe Biden, by the way. Like I said, there was zero outrage when he yelled at that factory worker five years ago, but NOW the Libs are mad? As Joe would say, ‘Come on, man!’ Don't you ever let anyone from the Biden Administration anywhere NEAR a pedestal. Don't you let them lecture you for one second. Not one single second. Again, these people invited THIS to the White House: This is the same White House, and the same president, that wished everyone a happy \"Trans Day of Visibility' on EASTER, by the way. The same one that had cocaine in the HALLS. The same guy who pardoned his entire family at the buzzer last January. The same vice president who, just last 18 months ago, told Christian protesters that they were at the wrong rally. HER rally, by the way. The same one that looked like THIS for Christmas: So yeah, Kamala, go ahead and spare us this particular lecture on Trump defiling the White House because he flipped someone off.

What they are is foolish. Unwise. Inexperienced. And, increasingly, ignorant of the most basic facts of life. \n\nThat ignorance is cultivated, not dispelled, in our public schools these days. Back in the 19th century, kids educated in one-room schoolhouses knew how to read and write much better than many kids today, and few people were innumerate. These days, there are vast numbers of kids who enter even elite colleges who have literally never read a book, can't do basic math, and have no idea where the UK or Poland are on a map. \n\nThey aren't stupid, or at least most of them are not. There IS a troubling trend in recent years: IQs are actually declining for the first time in history. After decades of increasing IQs (known as the Flynn Effect), IQs are actually reversing, with a measured decline of about 3 points a decade. \n\nSUBMITTED: Minneapolis school employees tell us these whistle packs are being handed out at every school in the district.“We are directed to follow instructions in the flyer if we spot ICE near or in the school,” the tipster said. pic.twitter.com/OEnvOXsNuh— Liz Collin (@lizcollin) January 15, 2026\n\nThat's pretty scary, although probably besides the point of this article. I would argue that it is likely that the dumbing down of how we stimulate kids is part of the problem, and hence education is involved, but I don't have the evidence to back that up. \n\nIn any case, what is clear is that our schools are failing badly, and that an increasing number of them, especially in urban areas, focus more on ideological \"education\" than actual education. Kids learn bogus history, are fed bogus economics, told that the West is systemically evil, and that the world is coming to an end due to capitalism and imperialism. \n\nStudents who were bused to the Minnesota State Capitol to protest against ICE started a big fight that needed to be broken up by police.This is what happens when you’re indoctrinated with leftist propaganda instead of learning to read.pic.twitter.com/Hz2vfN8uzD https://t.co/wix7rgvpbi— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) January 15, 2026\n\nWhere do high school students learn that \"nobody is illegal on stolen land?\" It's unlikely that it is their parents, and highly likely it is that man in a dress or the Queer teacher who is celebrating Assata Shakur as a freedom fighter. \n\nThe vice president of the CTU agrees a cop killer and a terrorist was a “freedom fighter.”The immorality and incompetence comes straight from the top. https://t.co/c6XXcax2lA— Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) September 28, 2025\n\nMany teachers now believe that political consciousness is more important than learning how to read and do math, and will openly say so. \n\nOne of the first things Minneapolis did when Renee Good was shot was close the schools for two days and then make in-class attendance optional for a month. \n\nStudents who participated in the anti-ICE protest at the Minnesota State Capitol were instructed to return to the \"vans\" and \"buses\" so they could be transported back to school.Who paid for these vans that transported hundreds of kids from school to protest? Who funded this?… https://t.co/wix7rguRlK pic.twitter.com/bSLAV3cE6L— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) January 14, 2026\n\nYes, you read that right. Kids can basically opt out of going to school for a month. Supposedly, they will be doing distance learning (optionally), but COVID showed us how well that works. \n\nOne thing the schools ARE doing is busing kids to demonstrations, which is where that video comes from. A high school bused kids to the capitol and the little monsters spent their time there getting into fights. \n\nWell, that and chanting that \"nobody is illegal on stolen land.\" \n\nIt's hard to overestimate how politicized the schools are and how teachers are leading the ideological charge. They are no longer about teaching knowledge, or \"how to think.\" It's about what to think, and what to do about injustice. \n\nKids don't know anything about the world, and they are spoonfed the most insane stuff. And the result is kids cosplaying revolutionaries at the Capitol and...fighting each other. \n\nGreat look. \n\nMEANWHILE, in my fair city:\n\n🚨 BREAKING: Minneapolis City Attorney’s Office emailed staff inviting them to a “healing circle” with “therapy goats.”While Democrats fan the flames against ICE agents.

The recruit claimed self-defense, which detectives are still investigating, but the incident has renewed questions about the agency’s history of lowering hiring and vetting standards in an effort to address a severe manpower crisis.\n\nAfter two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump in 2024, Trump tapped Sean Curran to lead the agency. But Curran is somewhat of a paradox, having served both as the leader of the team who failed to keep him safe at the July 13, 2024, rally Butler, Pennsylvania, and the man who was part of the inner circle of agents who leaped to Trump’s rescue after he was nearly killed when a bullet grazed his ear that day.\n\nMany expected Curran to usher in a new era of agency reform and discipline, jettisoning the DEI priorities of the Biden-era agency Secret Service leader, Kimberly Cheatle, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Instead, Curran determined that no agent needed to be fired over the assassination failures, that the entire agency had failed, not just the individuals involved in planning and providing security at the Butler rally, so firings wouldn’t solve the problem.\n\nMatt Quinn, the agency’s deputy director who this week lamented the agent’s manipulation by O’Keefe’s undercover sting operation, told CBS News in July that they “weren’t going to fire [their] way out of this,” stressing instead they would be “laser-focused on fixing the root cause of the problem.”\n\nWhile no known additional assassination attempts have occurred on Curran’s watch, he has presided over an agency plagued by embarrassing incidents over the last year, including a physical fight involving two women Uniformed Division officers outside former President Obama’s home, an agent celebrating Charlie Kirk’s assassination on Facebook, and his hand-selected chief counsel being forced to resign after a road-rage incident in a government vehicle in New Jersey. Curran also greenlit the agency’s renewal of Cheatle’s security clearance until GOP Sens. Ron Johnson and Marsha Blackburn objected and kept former Acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe on the agency payroll until he reached a key retirement date, after Rowe gave himself a bonus before Trump was inaugurated.\n\nSo why hasn’t Trump replaced his Secret Service director?\n\nA senior White House official this week told RCP that the Trump maintains a “great level of personal trust” in Sean Curran but added some context.\n\n“That doesn’t mean that the White House has not raised concerns at certain times with what we’ve seen with respect to the president’s security,” the official said. “But overall, the president continues to have confidence in Sean.”\n\nOne incident that raised White House concerns but went unreported until now involved a top Secret Service leader last summer and drew the ire of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, prompting unprecedented repercussions for more than a dozen Secret Service leaders, according to several knowledgeable sources.\n\nWiles was never a fan of Trump choosing Curran for the director post because she was aware of a number of formal complaints filed against the Trump campaign detail, which Curran headed, according to several Secret Service sources. Those complaints included reports of a hostile workplace and fraternization within the Florida Trump protective Secret Service detail, which spent most of its time at Mar-a-Lago before the 2024 campaign kicked into gear, multiple sources tell RCP.\n\nCurran and his deputy Matthew Piant, who recently received a promotion to come to Washington from West Palm Beach, were cleared of any wrongdoing by the Secret Service’s Office of Professional Responsibility. But some agents question how thoroughly the 2024 complaints were investigated and point out that neither Curran nor Piant were forced to turn over their personal or work phones for inspection. Neither were forced to take a polygraph test to help prove the truthfulness of their responses.\n\nFor context, Curran has now required several senior-level Secret Service leaders to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they’re not leaking to the media. He has also forced all Secret Service personnel to sign non-disclosure agreements that include threats of criminal reprisals after RCP published a series of embarrassing incidents by Secret Service agents and employees. \n\nTrump trusted Curran as the agent who had shadowed him on a day-to-day basis for several years, and Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump rallied around him for this reason, several knowledgeable source tell RCP. Eric Trump, however, at times over the last year (including in interviews promoting his book “Under Siege,”) has been critical of the FBI’s investigation into Thomas Crooks, the man who tried to assassinate Trump in Butler.\n\nEven after his selection, Wiles remained skeptical, telling Trump that if things goes south with Curran, “It’s on the boys,” according to several sources familiar with the conversations.\n\nLast summer, Wiles was incensed when Curran’s hand-selected top lieutenant demonstrated poor judgment at the White House, according to White House and Secret Service sources.\n\nIn July, Curran’s hand-picked chief of staff, Tyler McQuiston, intervened at a White House entry point to escort a former colleague and employee at CitiGroup, where McQuiston had previously worked after serving for decades in the Secret Service, into the White House West Wing lobby area for a meeting the employee claimed she was invited to. However, there was a mix-up, and White House aides had not included this woman in a new meeting schedule.\n\nMcQuiston, these sources say, thought he knew better and entered the woman into the White House waves system and escorted her into the West Wing lobby, leaving her on a couch unattended until White House aides found the unauthorized person and escorted her out of the complex. McQuiston’s move placed the presidential detail at the White House in the extremely awkward position of being forced to take sides with concerned presidential aides, with whom they have to work every day, and their own boss, who was allowing an unauthorized person to access the West Wing.\n\nWiles was so angry that she told Secret Service leaders to do something to ensure such a violation of White House security procedures never happens again. Responding to Wiles’ anger, Secret Service leaders then decided to cut off unrestricted White House access to more than a dozen top-level Secret Service leaders, including McQuiston, and several assistant directors. The restrictions on White House access excluded Curran and Deputy Director Matt Quinn, sources familiar with the details tell RCP.\n\nThe leader of the presidential protective division went to the 8th floor of Secret Service headquarters to collect the White House passes of several Secret Service leaders and supervisors in order to restrict White House complex access, an unprecedented and embarrassing move impacting senior agency leaders accustomed to showing up at the White House at any time.\n\nWhen RCP reached out to the Secret Service, the agency referred our questions to the White House. A White House aide confirmed that Wiles was upset over McQuiston’s decision to supersede White House entry protocols.\n\n“Following this miscommunication, and out of an abundance of caution, United States Secret Service pulled badges from personnel deemed unnecessary to have access to the West Wing of the White House,” a White House official told RCP. “The directive to pull [the badges] did not come from Susie. It was a decision by the presidential detail leaders. It’s a decision she supports.”\n\nIn December, Curran responded to the FBI raid of a Secret Service agent’s home in a tax fraud investigation prompted by the agent’s moonlighting as a tax preparer, by having the agency suspend all agents’ outside employment until they can get a handle on how many agents were potentially involved in tax fraud.\n\nOne well-placed Secret Service source said so many agents used the agent’s tax services that it could explode into a media storm bigger than the 2012 Columbia prostitution scandal, in which more than a dozen agents were found to have hired legal prostitutes in Cartagena during an advance trip for President Obama.\n\nLingering resentment over Curran’s decision not to fire anyone over the Butler failures continues to simmer within the agency. Several members of Congress have expressed deep concerns about the light punishments Secret Service agents involved in the security planning and execution for the Butler rally received last year. Many of those agents are back on the job helping to protect Trump and other key administration officials, including Miyo Perez, the agent in charge of developing the Butler security plan.\n\nCurran delivered slaps on the wrist for those responsible for the Butler failures – 10 to 42 days of paid suspension – and yet failed to usher in robust DEI and other reforms like those Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has aggressively implemented, resulting in a recruiting bonanza for the military.\n\nCurran actually promoted two supervisors who signed off on the Butler security plan that didn’t place anyone on the AGR building roof where shooter Thomas Crooks fired off his shots at Trump and the crowd, killing Corey Comperatore, a retired firefighter who attended the rally, and severely injuring two others.\n\nCurran’s record on ridding the agency of DEI also gets mixed reviews.\n\nCurran promoted one of those supervisors, Nick Olszewski, to become head chief of the Inspection Division, which falls under the Office of Professional Responsibility and is responsible for ensuring the accountability and integrity of the agency’s personnel and operations. Olszewski received this promotion even though he failed to detect a major flaw in the Butler plan while overseeing the final walk-through of the rally security plan the day before the assassination attempt.\n\nSome in the agency believe Curran tapped Olszewski for the post to help insulate him from any formal complaints and investigations into his leadership of both the Trump campaign detail and now of the entire agency. Another supervisor on the final Butler walk-through was Nick Menster, who also avoided any discipline for Butler. Curran promoted Menster to become the second agent in charge of the Lara and Eric Trump protective detail.\n\nMany in the Secret Service Community, both active agents and officers and those who have retired, are still upset over the unequal discipline for inexperienced agents positioned for failure at the Butler rally and their supervisors who appear to have skated or received promotions despite their supervisory failures.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of the Butler assassination attempt last year, the Secret Service noted several operation, policy, and organization reforms it has taken. The agency highlighted changes to its protective operations aimed at ensuring “clear lines of accountability and improved information sharing with local law enforcement partners,” as well as the creation of an Aviation and Airspace division dedicated to upgrading its drone and drone mitigation and monitoring capabilities. Officials also said that Curran is leading an effort to change its resourcing process to ensure that assets are “better accounted for and appropriately applied.”\n\nWhile the agency claimed to be implementing all 46 recommendations from Congress, it is notably disregarding another by the bipartisan Independent Review Board. The board called on the Secret Service to narrow its mission to protecting the president, the vice president, their families, and certain Cabinet members, while eliminating investigations into financial crimes and child trafficking.\n\nLast week, the Secret Service announced plans to hire 4,000 employees over the next two years and cut its hiring timelines in half. But long-time observers warned that speeding up the hiring process would undoubtedly result in less training and the hiring of less qualified individuals.\n\nFormer agents and other sources in the Secret Service community have recently criticized the agency for lowering standards in recruiting, arguing that misplaced DEI initiatives were given priority during the Obama and Biden administrations, and former law enforcement experience was not valued as much as in previous years, when the agency had a better reputation and protection record.\n\nSome have also argued that Curran isn’t doing enough to rid the agency of DEI hires and woke culture, which one agent has publicly blamed for the near-killing of Trump in Pennsylvania.\n\nOther agents have raised concerns over the Secret Service’s decades-long policy of not requiring psychological exams as part of the hiring process – unlike most police departments across the country. Doing so would prevent any type of insider threats to the president or other protectees, these sources argue.\n\nMany of these complaints have circulated for more than a decade. Former GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who served as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, held numerous hard-hitting hearings on the failures of the Secret Service after the 2012 Colombia prostitution scandal involving several agents who were caught with prostitutes during the Obama administration. Chaffetz was also highly critical of several White House fence-jumping incidents – so much so that the fence surrounding the complex was raised.\n\nIn 2015, Chaffetz and committee staff also produced a detailed, bipartisan report on “The Secret Service in Crisis,” which recommended numerous reforms, many of which the agency has yet to implement. \n\nThree months before the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, RCP reported on a female agent’s mental health meltdown and physical attack on her supervisor, which took place at Joint Base Andrews, before a planned trip protecting then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLast year, the agency spent $2 million on a Super Bowl recruitment video by Hollywood producer Michael Bay in which Curran is prominently featured. The expenditure came after hundreds of agents applied for lateral transfer to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe agents are working harder than ever at what many argue is an unsustainable pace after the previous acting director, Ron Rowe, promised “a paradigm shift” post-Butler – that they would not have to continue “doing more with less,” a common refrain in the Secret Service over the last decade.\n\nThe vice-presidential detail is especially taxed because JD Vance travels much more than his predecessor, Kamala Harris, but the agency has kept the number of agents assigned to it at similar levels. One source tells RCP that vice presidential agents work five to six days a week, while Trump’s detail works two to three days.\n\nSusan Crabtree is RealClearPolitics' national political correspondent.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2026/01/16/trump_continues_to_back_secret_service_chief_despite_concern_at_times__153724.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/707194_6_.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 12:43:40","author":"RCP,Susan Crabtree","authors":["RCP","Susan Crabtree"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.515},{"id":393498124,"title":"Transcript: Trump Is Running a “Global Mafia”","text":"Duss: I would like a rules-based order, but for real. For real, by which I mean: that was not what we saw from Joe Biden. For Joe Biden—and this is… this is a place where Joe Biden was actually very representative of the way that I think the D.C. foreign policy establishment thinks about the quote rules-based order—which is that the U.S. gets to make the rules. There’s one set of rules for our partners and friends, and there’s a different set of rules that must be imposed and enforced against our adversaries and enemies.\n\nAnd you couldn’t ask for a better example of that than comparing Ukraine to Gaza. I think it’s hard to think of a social science experiment one could devise that would show this hypocrisy and these double standards more clearly than opposing the Russian invasion of Ukraine—which I agree with; it was a clear violation of international law—opposing the war crimes that Russia has clearly committed in Ukraine, while supporting those same war crimes day after week after month after in Gaza. \n\nThis was catastrophic, not just for the people of Gaza, but for the region. I think it’s catastrophic for the United States and for the idea of international cooperation.\n\nSo again, when I talk about rules I think about Gandhi’s quote when he was asked about Western civilization. He said: I think it would be a great idea. If asked me about the rules-based order, my response is the same. I think it is a good idea; we should endeavor to build something like that. But that requires the United States really agreeing to and upholding the rules for ourselves and for our friends when they violate them, and not just give them a pass.\n\nBacon: Last question. If you were advising somebody running for president in 2028, give me two or three—two or three ideas or principles—that should guide their foreign policy.\n\nDuss: I think invest in the idea of multilateralism—just engaging within the international community, international organizations is not just something nice to do; this is how we advance America’s interest. This is how we’re safer and more prosperous. \n\nI think the second thing I would say is: really start to build a better relationship with China. I think the Biden administration, in my view, unfortunately adopted the previous Trump administration’s approach to China as a threat and started to contain that threat. Interestingly, the second Trump administration has not been as hostile to China, but still seems invested in American primacy, including in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\nBut China is powerful. It has a huge population. It has a very powerful economy. It has built relationships all over the world, including in the Western Hemisphere. And China has a role to play in shaping the global agenda. And so I think building a better relationship with China… it’s going to be frustrating. \n\nCertainly, China’s going to do things that we don’t like, and is already doing that. But that’s a hugely important relationship. And there need to be multiple channels of communication.\n\nAnd the last thing I would say is: I would love a Democratic nominee to really focus on the idea of accountability. Real accountability. Not just in foreign policy, but in general. \n\nWe face a crisis of political legitimacy in this country. That is part of what we’re facing right now. Americans have lost faith in American government, in the political process, and in our leaders. Leaders in part because they haven’t delivered, but also because they see, time after time, powerful people pay no price. \n\nThis is something that Donald Trump has very successfully exploited. When Donald Trump says the system’s rigged, he gets traction with that because the system is rigged. The system is rigged on behalf of people like Donald Trump and his powerful friends. \n\nBut you can name Republicans and you can name Democrats who have committed egregious offenses, both of corruption and foreign policy, who have simply skated—faced no consequences whatsoever. \n\nSo I think bringing some real accountability to this process and back to American politics, dealing with the fact that our political system is essentially a form of legalized corruption. I think addressing all of these things is really essential for rebuilding—or building—a new, shared kind of political consensus about what the American Project really is.\n\nBacon: Let me drill down. What would accountability look like? Do you mean, for example, that the ICE officer who killed the person in Minneapolis should be in jail? What do you mean when you say accountability?\n\nDuss: For example, I want to see—going back to Gaza—I want to see all the reports about what we knew, because I know that the Biden administration really did know Israel was violating international law, and yet continued to give them weapons in violation of U.S. law. I want to see those reports. State Department reports. Other reports declassified.\n\nI want those officials to have to answer for what they did in Gaza in a real way—not just in softball interviews on CNN or elsewhere, or on podcasts sponsored by God knows who, or their own podcasts where they pretend to reflect on what they actually did.\n\nThat’s one of—for starters—yes.\n\nBacon: Let me ask you one last thing. What did you make of what happened in New York City, the election? What did you make of Mamdani’s victory—how it happened? Because you work on policy, and it seemed like Gaza played some role, but he also talked about affordability.\n\nIt seemed like the Bernie Sanders campaign, but almost a bit more advanced—that’s how I felt about it. He learned the right lessons, is how I saw it, but I’m curious how you saw it.\n\nDuss: No, I think he was really focused on just the struggles of everyday people. Affordability is the new keyword. But that’s important. I think that was something that was a through-line we saw not just with Zohran Mamdani’s campaign, but also with Spanberger here in my state of Virginia. We saw that with Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and others.\n\nAnd I think what Mamdani did was inspiring in so many ways because he’s just very talented. He’s a great communicator. He had a great media team, but it was also based on real policy that addressed the real lives and the real struggles of people in New York. \n\nAnd I think the role that Gaza played was… even for people… this is clearly a very important issue for the progressive base—and I would say beyond the progressive base. It stands in for a broader debate about American foreign policy. About the role that America should play in the world. On what principles, on what basis, according to what laws. \n\nBut also for people, I think, who don’t really even pay that much attention to foreign policy, it was just an issue that gave him credibility because he took so much heat. Let’s remember: He is not the one who injected Gaza and Palestine and Israel into this campaign. \n\nIt was his opponents, Eric [Adams], yeah, pressing on him on this. And the fact that he stood strong on this issue of principle, I think, gave him credibility across a whole range of other issues. Because people see that and they’re like: This guy is pretty outstanding[ly] firm. He’s speaking clearly about this important issue. Maybe I can believe him on all these other things.\n\nI would say I think it worked in the opposite direction for Kamala Harris, just for example. She had some pretty good policies, but then when she had to speak on Gaza, she just regurgitated the same old talking points about “Israel has a right to defend itself” and “too many people have died.” \n\nI think when people saw that, they’re like: Oh, okay. She’s just saying the usual stuff. I’m not buying it. Maybe if she can be pushed on this, she can be pushed on other things. So I think that’s what the lesson I think Democrats should learn here.\n\nBacon: Matt, great conversation. Thanks for joining me.\n\nDuss: Good to see you. Take care.","summary":"This is a lightly edited transcript of the January 16 edition of Right Now With Perry Bacon.

But Sinema and Manchin didn’t sit on the House Ways and Means Committee, nor were they among the rural House Democrats mentioned above. Let’s name them: Reps. Cindy Axne, Jim Costa, Cheri Bustos, Josh Harder, Salud Carbajal, Angie Craig, Antonio Delgado, Kim Schrier, John Garamendi, Julia Brownley, Tom O’Halleran, Abigail D. Spanberger, and Kurt Schrader.\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Kelly joined Sinema and Manchin to oppose Biden’s appointment of David Weil as Biden’s Labor Department wage and hour commissioner. As I explained at the time, Weil was judged too left-wing based on his (greatly exaggerated) views on liberalizing wage/hour regulations to crack down on corporate evasions. Just this past week a handful of Republican opponents managed to kill three proposed conservative wage/hour bills intended to create more opportunities for corporate evasions. I’m inclined to scoff at any notion that Republicans will someday steal labor issues from Democrats, but, putting this week’s events together with the House’s passage last month of a bill restoring collective-bargaining rights to federal employees, I feel less certain about that.\n\nWarren mentioned in her speech that LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who donated $7 million to Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, tried to persuade Harris to pledge that if elected she’d fire the antitrust champion Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Harris did not make that pledge, but, as Warren pointed out, Harris didn’t pledge to keep Khan, either. Warren might further have noted that Harris positioned herself to Biden’s right on taxes, proposing a capital gains hike to 28 percent rather than 39.5 percent. “Kamala Harris is listening to business people and getting their feedback on what’s fair and what will lead to more investment in business,” Harris’s billionaire adviser Mark Cuban crowed at the time. Nobody in his right mind believes that if Harris had only lowered her proposed cap gains hike to 25 percent she would have won the election.","summary":"Elizabeth Warren gave an excellent speech January 12 (text; video) urging Democrats not to “to sand down our edges to avoid offending anyone, especially the rich and powerful who might finance our candidates….

The term refers to the idea that even the flutter of a butterfly’s wing could cause a tornado elsewhere. As far as real-world examples go, the events of October 7, 2023 are the perfect case study, causing ripples big and small across the globe.That day, a terrorist organisation’s desire to imbibe a little culture by paragliding into a music festival ended up rewriting the world order. The story that followed could have been directed by Quentin Tarantino: gory, non-linear, with all threads interconnected and a few perverts thrown in. Israel’s furious response, with help from Uncle Sam, led to the dismantling of Iran’s Axis of Resistance, tangentially hastened Trump’s return to the White House, and reminded Russia, China, and even Europe who is Daddy. Here’s how Oct 7 reshaped the globe.Chapter 1: Axis of No Resistance Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise that Hamas leaders were “dead men walking” sounded, at the time, like the sort of thing politicians say when the cameras are on and adrenaline is high. One seldom expects a politician to keep his word. Netanyahu went above and beyond.With the benefit of hindsight, it echoed an older, cruder American warning: George Bush promising to smoke enemies out of caves. This was the kind of language modern states pretend to have outgrown.Sun Tzu once said: “If you wait by the river long enough, you will see your enemy’s corpse float by.”After Oct 7, Israel decided to stop waiting by the river.Eschewing any notions of constraint, no matter how many international bodies or nations condemned it, Israel set about dismantling, dismembering, decapitating, decimating, and, to borrow a word from Derrida, deconstructing what is known as the Axis of Resistance.Its air power erased entire neighbourhoods. Commanders were hunted irrespective of geography, no matter where they were based: Palestine, Iran, Qatar, or Yemen. Leaders of each organisation, including Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah, were targeted using tactics that seemed lifted from John Wick and James Bond. Particularly illuminating, for sheer audacity, was the pager attack that maimed Hezbollah fighters across the region.By early 2026, even Iran was tottering, with internal protests threatening Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s regime, which only a few years ago had seemed impregnable.If Khamenei’s rule ultimately unravels, October 7 will be remembered as the red-letter day that dragged the Axis into the open, forced a confrontation its patrons were unprepared for, and turned Iran’s proxies into the Axis of (No) Resistance.Chapter 2: The Don returns May we live in interesting times.Ostensibly a Chinese curse, the phrase was popularised by Austen Chamberlain, whose son Joseph would win the Nobel Peace Prize, and whose other son Neville would be meme-fied forever for his premature celebration of peace. And history has obliged, courtesy the return of Donald Trump to the White House.While it would be a stretch to say Oct 7 alone caused his return, it was certainly one of the straws that broke the carefully crafted coalition that had brought Democrats back to power in 2020.There were, of course, other factors: an inability to recognise that their President could not speak without falling asleep; his successor, who could not complete an interview without breaking into laughter; an obsession with identity signalling over material reality; pronouns over prices; and moral performance over lived experience.Add to that economic gaslighting that insisted everything was fine while voters’ bills said otherwise, a culture of speech policing that turned free expression into a grievance, and the quiet arrogance of assuming entire voter blocs had nowhere else to go.Trump distilled this problem into a brutally simple campaign line: Kamala is for they/them, I am for you.Yet Democrats kept sleeping at the wheel. Unlike the caterpillar struggling to break free from its cocoon, they had forgotten how to be pugilistic, having grown accustomed to manufacturing consent in the post-Obama years.Oct 7 shattered that illusion.Older Democrats were aghast as younger ones celebrated Hamas as freedom fighters. Younger voters could not understand why Biden was not stopping Israel’s war machine, one largely funded by America.Harris inheriting the nomination only made things worse.To progressives and anti-war liberals, Harris sounded like Biden with a softer tone but the same substance. To foreign-policy hawks and pro-Israel conservatives, she sounded hesitant, constrained, and insufficiently forceful. She occupied the narrowest and most uncomfortable position in American politics: not progressive enough for the left, not hawkish enough for the right.Her campaign even ran contradictory messages: one ad in Michigan highlighting humanitarian suffering in Gaza, another in Pennsylvania emphasising unwavering support for Israel’s military response.Her abject performance was most evident in Michigan, where Arab American and Muslim voters hold sway. Many backed Trump, believing he might actually do something about the war, opted for third-party candidates, or simply abstained.This collapse was not merely a reflection of foreign-policy discontent, but a symptom of deeper structural drift within the Democratic Party. Trump did not need to win hearts. He merely needed Democrats to lose them.And that loss ushered in a return of American imperialism in a form few had anticipated. One that China, Iran, and Russia had not prepared for.Chapter 3: China and Russia who? Uncle Sam is back There was a time when MAGA claimed to be about dismantling the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party. That illusion is gone. Neocons used to say America doesn’t want to be the Global Policeman. Under Trump, it now wants to be the world’s hafta collector.Since returning to power, Trump has stripped American foreign policy of the pretence that it seeks to do good. In its own way, that is refreshing.The Trump Doctrine is not complicated. It rests on five beliefs.First, Trump does not believe in a rules-based international order. International law, to him, is a fiction sustained by people without power.Second, Trump views foreign policy as transactional. Every relationship is a deal.Third, Trump is driven by revenge. Anyone who has slighted him, or America, will not be spared.Fourth, Trump believes in his own hubris. Expertise is secondary. Doubt is weakness.Finally, Trump believes America should act without apology. As one staffer put it: “We are America, b****.”That is the Trump Doctrine. At home, this has meant abandoning constitutional restraint and testing how much power truly lies with the executive. American citizens have been deported to random countries, sometimes on flimsy evidence such as tattoos. ICE has taken to the streets like a mildly menacing version of White Walkers, tangling with local law enforcement and suburban mothers alike. There have been removal errors, due process gaps, chaotic deportations, and a flood of undertrained ICE officers.The DOJ, as under Biden-Harris, has been fully weaponised against political opponents, ranging from former FBI officials to national security advisers and attorneys general.Woke policies have been purged from federal government and corporate America. Big Tech, which deplatformed Trump after January 2021, has been brought to heel, even promising to fund Trump’s personal projects. Federal media funding has been cut, while major outlets have been acquired by Trump allies. Universities have been threatened with grant cuts, federal money wielded as carrot and stick.Washington has been transformed into St Petersburg, a living embodiment of the Peter Principle, staffed by loyalists who understand that fealty matters more than competence. The VP is a millennial untroubled by ideological whiplash, even when it includes racist attacks on his own family. The Department of Defence has been rechristened the Department of War, led by a former Fox News host with a drinking problem who struggles to do pull-ups.Homeland Security is headed by a grandmother unable to protect her own handbag. The White House press secretary dismisses all critics as leftists. The Director of National Intelligence has been sidelined to the point insiders joke DNI now stands for “Do Not Invite”. The FBI chief is a former podcast bro who enjoys using federal resources to spend time with his country singer girlfriend.And unfortunately for the rest of the world, America’s dysfunction never stays contained. The Shining City on the Hill’s problems always trickle down.Random tariffs, based on incorrect formulae, have threatened the global economy. Tariffs have also been used to bully allies, to the point no one knows what tariffs they are actually paying.Together, these actions have stripped emerging powers like China and Russia of the illusion that they could challenge American hegemony. That belief, to borrow from Dumbledore, was optimism bordering on foolishness.Bashar al-Assad survived for years with Russian backing, yet Putin was powerless when Syrian rebels overran Damascus. A former Al Qaeda militant, once on the FBI’s most-wanted list, now heads the state, and Trump calls him “beautiful”. Similarly, China and Russia could do nothing when Trump decided Nicolás Maduro’s dancing had gone too far and had him picked up like a neighbourhood delinquent. This was not the extraction of a terrorist, but the detention of a sitting head of state backed by nuclear powers. Trump even “accepted” the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Machado.Iran may be next.Trump’s first exposure to foreign policy came during the Tehran hostage crisis, when he could not fathom how a country as powerful as America failed to protect its own people. He never forgot that humiliation.It was evident on June 25, 2025, when Trump, borrowing from Top Gun: Maverick, sent B-2 stealth bombers and other assets to strike three Iranian nuclear sites.Iran’s response, an attack on an American base in Qatar, appeared choreographed by all sides. Casualties were zero.The doctrine has since expanded to America’s allies. Canada was labelled the 51st state. Europe was told to call Trump “Daddy”. Denmark was threatened over Greenland. Zelenskyy was humiliated publicly. Keir Starmer was made to bend, literally. France even moved the G7 summit because Trump wanted a birthday party at the White House, complete with an MMA spectacle.Trump postures endlessly, announcing ceasefires where there is no firing and no ceasing. But truth is irrelevant compared to the story in his head.To borrow Albert Einstein’s words: Future generations will scarcely believe that such a man once walked the face of the earth.But would that walking and talking have been possible without Hamas paragliding into Israel?That is the question that will haunt us, a cruel mathematical equation whose solution began on October 7. If history is written by the victors, then October 7 may come to be remembered not as the beginning of a war, but as the moment the post-World War 2 rules-based international order illusion finally collapsed. One reckless act, one miscalculated spectacle of terror, set off a chain reaction that stripped away moral language, exposed power as power, and revealed that the world never really moved on. The butterfly flapped its wings, and what followed was not chaos, but clarity.","summary":"That day, a terrorist organisation’s desire to imbibe a little culture by paragliding into a music festival ended up rewriting the world order.

power.\n\nI’m not talking about Kamala Harris, but Elphaba Thropp from the box-office smash Wicked.\n\nThe Democratic nominee for president was unable to defy gravity in the end, but over in Oz, the battle is still raging.\n\nWhen we last saw Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) at the cliffhanger ending of Wicked, she was preparing for war.\n\nThe not-so-Wicked Witch of the West is back in theatres, and she’s ready to rumble.\n\nWicked: For Good is not, alas, that good.\n\nAs fans of the Broadway musical on which it’s based know, all the best bits are in the first instalment.\n\nAnd yet this brassy, candycoloured Battle Of Algiers takes one of the clearest stands against authoritarianism and white supremacy you’ll find in theatres.\n\nIt couldn’t be more timely.\n\nAccording to Gallup, people worldwide have more worry, stress, sadness and anger than they did a decade ago.\n\nIts recent surveys in the United States find that only 29% of Americans are satisfied with the direction their country is going, and they strongly dislike their leader: The only president to have had a lower average approval rating than Trump 2.0 (42%) so far was Trump 1.0 (41%).\n\nThere’s a reason Republicans were routed in the off-year elections and seven million people marched against the administration in the latest No Kings protest, on Oct 18.\n\nFrom subtle to sly\n\nFilmmakers the world over are stepping into the breach.\n\nProbably the most notable political movie this year is Paul Thomas Anderson’s raucous, violent takedown of America’s immigration policy: the excellent and polarising One Battle After Another.\n\nThe auteur’s latest epic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Teyana Taylor as scrappy activists facing off against a racist police state embodied by a villainous Sean Penn.\n\nThe movie has made a tidy US$200mil (RM822.5mil), and stands to rake in more if its director and stars take home Oscars as expected.\n\nPolitical thriller 'A House Of Dynamite' offers a more subtle critique of the government.\n\nThe taut if somewhat cliched political thriller A House Of Dynamite offers a more subtle critique of the government.\n\nBy keeping her main actor – the president – off-camera until the conclusion of the film, director Kathryn Bigelow leaves his character, ethics and intellect a mystery.\n\nFor most of the movie, we’re engaged in a thought experiment: What would happen if a rogue nuclear missile launched over the Pacific, and our president was, say, the current occupant of the White House?\n\nThe Mastermind takes on the spread of shameless self-dealing.\n\nIn this marvellously sly film from Kelly Reichardt, a clueless petty thief (Josh O’Connor) gets tripped up in Vietnam War-era social unrest.\n\nYou’d almost miss the connection to national politics, except that the director keeps deviously flashing Richard Nixon’s grim mug on the televisions in the background of many scenes.\n\nWith headlines on Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and the Venezuelan boat bombings serving up stories of brutal aggression almost daily, it’s a great time to revisit Nuremberg.\n\nJames Vanderbilt’s polished movie about the precedent- setting trials at the end of World War II isn’t great – Russell Crowe is terrific as Hermann Goring, but Rami Malek is painfully hammy as the shrink tasked with figuring him out – but it did manage a respectable US$9mil (RM37mil) in its first week.\n\nConflict, paranoia and cataclysm\n\nThe list goes on: Eddington, Bugonia, Sirat – there’s a reason directors are digging into stories of conflict, paranoia and cataclysm.\n\nTaken together, these films, most of which were conceived and went into production during Donald Trump’s interregnum, between the insurrection of Jan 6, 2021, and MAGA’s triumphant return to power, have coalesced into a troop of cinematic resistance amid the conflicts and crises defining his political era and the rightward, nationalistic turns happening broadly around the globe.\n\nAnd lest you think this is a strictly art-house phenomenon, edgy political fare has made it to the megaplex too.\n\nIn his blockbuster Sinners, a gorgeous revenge fantasy worthy of Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler took a broader view of America’s problems.\n\nThis big-budget horror film, which raked in US$368mil (RM1.5bil), imagined a pair of Black brothers in 1932 facing off against the vampires (actual vampires, in this case) of white supremacy.\n\nJames Gunn took on the destructive influence of the world’s billionaires with his loopy, overstuffed Superman, which made US$617mil (RM2.5bil) this summer.\n\nIts villain, the erstwhile Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), will sound familiar: He’s a megalomaniac inventor manipulating a corrupt federal government.\n\nAlong the way, the movie also looks at xenophobia, foreign misadventures and online disinformation – no wonder our critic called it a pro-immigration, anti-Trump blockbuster.\n\nSuperman is also mordantly funny in places, but then, contemporary politics have taken a darkly comic turn.\n\nNo film last year leaned harder into the almost cartoonish nihilism in Washington than the sci-fi satire 'Mickey 17'.\n\nDid you ever imagine a president would post an AI video showing him dumping excrement on protesters, say, or take a wrecking ball to the East Wing of the White House without warning?\n\nNo film last year leaned harder into the almost cartoonish nihilism in Washington than the sci-fi satire Mickey 17.\n\nIts villains, an interstellar CEO (Mark Ruffalo) and his wife (Toni Collette), were so on-the-nose, the movie was hard to watch.\n\nThat may explain why the March release, from Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, didn’t break even with its modest US$133mil (RM547mil) haul.\n\nEmboldened filmmakers\n\nHollywood, of course, has a famously liberal bias; and the best of the year’s resistance films will romp during awards season even if they weren’t box-office juggernauts.\n\nCertainly there have been other recent films about less charged topics: Sentimental Value, Hamnet and Frankenstein are three acclaimed movies that don’t get anywhere near contemporary politics (they describe more intimate family struggles) and ought to win their share of awards.\n\nBut more and more filmmakers are responding to the urgency of world events with movies that have an urgent, starkly political point of view.\n\nFor my money, the two must-see political films are Kleber Mendonca Filho’s The Secret Agent, about a man on the run from Brazil’s military regime in the 1970s, and It Was Just An Accident, shot in secret in Tehran by Jafar Panahi.\n\nThey stand out partly because they don’t take on the corrupt regimes directly. No generals or mullahs appear in these films.\n\nThey’re focused instead on how we ourselves change living under authoritarian systems.\n\nAccident is especially devastating. Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), who spent time in jail, abducts Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), whom he suspects tortured him there.\n\nVahid can’t be 100% sure he’s got the right guy – he was blindfolded in prison – so he searches for other victims to corroborate the man’s ID and help him decide how to repay him.\n\nWhat does justice look like in such a world? What do we ourselves begin to look like?\n\nFrom the Yellow Brick Road to a dusty highway outside Tehran, something is going on.\n\nAs corporations, universities and news media are criticised for cowering in fear, filmmakers are getting more emboldened.\n\nTheir movies share the same insistent message: Wake up, world. – Bloomberg","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/entertainment/2026/01/09/039wicked039-039one-battle-after-another039-the-rise-of-resistance-cinema-in-the-era-of-trump","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/08/3710268.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 10:00:00","author":"Agency","authors":["Agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.243},{"id":393478818,"title":"Just as Dangerous: Vance and the 2028 Election","text":"Donald Trump may, of course, be the Republican candidate for president in 2028, the U.S. Constitution notwithstanding. Although it is clearly written in the 22nd Amendment that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,” it may well be a majority vote of the Supreme Court that determines whether that applies to Trump.\n\nIn the past, that court has gotten around the Constitution without a single word of it being changed. Rather, its judges have let an innovative interpretation prevail. In 1896, for instance, in Plessy v. Ferguson, the court ignored the unambiguous language of the 14th Amendment that demanded “equal protection” and so upheld racial segregation by creating the fiction of “separate but equal.” It would take 58 years before that lie would be overturned.\n\nHarvard law professor and Trump legal whisperer Alan Dershowitz has told the president that “it’s not clear” if it is constitutionally settled whether he can serve another term, even if elected. Reportedly, Jeffrey Epstein’s former lawyer is working on a book on the subject to be published in March 2026. And MAGA world — from the White House to members of Congress to far-right media figures — is stirring the pot on Donald Trump’s potential fourth bid for president.\n\nTrump is also clearly worried about his legacy. Branding federal buildings and institutions with his name, building an outrageous ballroom, pimping out the Oval Office in gold, and constructing an unnecessary “Triumphal Arch” are all desperate attempts to be remembered as “great” at any cost. Yet, he has to know that the next Democratic president will be under tremendous pressure to remove most, if not all, Trump-brand edifices as quickly as possible. In the end, his real memorials will undoubtedly be the authoritarian policies and conduct that will label him as one of the worst, if not the worst, presidents in American history.\n\nThat said, Trump remains a question mark when it comes to a third term. There are a number of reasons he might not try for one, not the least being his deteriorating mental and physical health. It didn’t take the New York Times to question his capabilities, not when anyone watching him could hear him slurring his words, dozing off in front of the cameras, barely moving even on a golf course, and sounding more incoherent than ever.\n\nHis manic putting up of sometimes hundreds of posts a day or in the wee hours of the night — although his staff may be responsible for some of it — should be considered a cry for help, if ever there was one. And it’s not just the volume of his postings, but their increasing extremity. The hate has become more hateful, the taunts more vicious and racist, and the fabrications more outlandish and divorced from reality. And keep in mind that Trump will be 83 by the time of the 2028 election and he’s already exhibiting so many of the behaviors generally attributed to the fabled “crazy old man” down the street.\n\nFinally (should it get to that point), a majority of the Supreme Court — I certainly don’t think all of them, no matter the situation — could follow the Constitution and rule against a third term. It should be considered ironic at this point that the 22nd Amendment was proposed and passed in response to a Democratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, winning his fourth consecutive presidential race.\n\nThe Vance Option\n\nWith Trump a distinct question mark and while the Trumpian current ebbs and flows, another wave is pushing the 2028 candidacy of Vice President JD Vance. Trump found his avatar in 2024 when the junior senator from Ohio and former harsh Trump critic joined the crew of Republican senators fighting to be the most sycophantic to the party’s new Führer. Like his compatriots Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio, there were no morals or principles that superseded Vance’s ambition and lust for power. Under the circumstances, that “JD” could easily have stood for “just as dangerous.”\n\nAs Vance confirmed at the recent Turning Point USA gathering, not only are White nationalists like Nick Fuentes and unrepentant conspiracists like Candace Owens not denounced, but they are welcomed and embraced. Tucker Carlson’s friendly interview with Fuentes roiled MAGA, but before that he was interviewed by Owens on her podcast. Again, there are no discernible objections from GOP leaders, including Vance.\n\nWhile Vance opportunistically inserted himself into the Charlie Kirk martyr-building project — he was a pallbearer and spoke at his memorial — he has yet to call out Owens for her wild and unfounded claims that Turning Point USA staff, Israel, the French Foreign Legion, and God knows who else were somehow involved in Kirk’s assassination.\n\nVance’s most eye-raising statement at the TPUSA event was when he said, “You don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.” First, it is a pretty sure bet that no one at the event (or in MAGA) ever apologized for being White. Second, Vance reinforced the view that White supremacy will not be a barrier to any future campaign of his.\n\nVance’s message is clear: every imaginable far-right extremist, from White supremacists and technofascists to offensive fabulists, is welcome in his coming 2028 campaign. And he will assumedly have Trump’s blessing (if the president doesn’t indeed decide to try to run again himself).\n\nPoor Secretary of State Marco Rubio has as much chance of getting Trump’s support as Black GOP Congressional Representative Byron Donalds did of becoming his vice-presidential candidate in 2024. Trump 2.0 is wholly built on racial profiling, especially of Latinos, and asserting White power. Merely “looking” Latino is enough in these Trumpist times to attract armed masked men and a trip to an immigration hellhole. Rubio has vigorously defended such illegal arrests and detentions and the racist demonization of immigrants of color that’s gone with it, but he’s rolling the dice if he thinks the MAGA base will see him as the exception to their rule.\n\nJust ask Vance. As hillbilly-centric and pro-White working class as he has tried to portray himself, despite being a millionaire many times over, the fact that he is married to Usha Vance, a woman of color and a non-Christian, has generated lots of racist blowback. Fuentes, for example, called Vance a “race traitor” for marrying Usha. Many MAGA adherents were shocked to discover Usha was not White. One report found that, between January and August 2024, there were at least 1,800 racist, gender, or religious-based attacks on Usha that reached an audience of an estimated 216 million.\n\nWhile Vance has pushed back against such threats and insults, he’s ignored any possible relationship between Trump’s and his racism against Haitian and other immigrants of color and the blowback he’s experienced against Usha. His default position (rather than directly challenging MAGA bigotry): Usha is “tough enough to handle it.” In addition, instead of defending Usha’s right to practice whatever religion she chooses, he pandered to the religious extremist crowd by stating that he hoped she would convert to Catholicism and “eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church.” He then added, “I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.”\n\nVance Courts the Extremists\n\nIf Trump doesn’t manage to run a fourth time and Vance wants to be president, he’ll be more dependent than ever on the MAGA base and the far right, especially since he has little to no chance of winning over many Democrats or independents. Few will forget that he personally led the outlandish racist claims that Haitian immigrants were stealing pets and eating them in Springfield, Ohio. When busted on that fabrication, he admitted that he had known the truth, but didn’t care as long as it served his interests. He stated in an interview during the 2024 election campaign, “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast.”\n\nVance’s “stories” were blatant lies about immigrants (of color) and their role in U.S. society. According to him, undocumented (and perhaps, maybe, kinda legal) immigrants are to blame for high medical prices, rising housing costs, education crises, crime, antisemitism, and illegal voting. In other words, there isn’t a problem in the United States that can’t be linked to undocumented aliens.\n\nA Time When Vance Was Truthful\n\nThe next time around, Democrats would be wise to highlight Vance’s past criticism of Donald Trump. After all, he referred to Trump as “Hitler” and as a “morally reprehensible human being” in emails that plausibly were not supposed to be publicly seen. However, he did publish an article in The Atlantic only weeks before the 2016 election that he clearly wanted to be on the record. In a piece entitled “Opioid of the Masses,” he called Trump “cultural heroin.” He argued that, while Trump’s blather might make people feel good, he was anything but the answer to the deeply rooted causes of the multiple crises facing poor Whites, particularly and ironically, opioid drug addiction. Like heroin, he wrote, its poison “enters minds, not through lungs or veins, but through eyes and ears, and its name is Donald Trump.” Vance’s own mother, as he noted in the article, abused heroin and prescription opioids, giving him a highly personal stake in the issue.\n\nWhat he wrote then is no less true today: “Trump offers an easy escape from the pain… Trump’s promises are the needle in America’s collective vein.” Continuing with that addiction metaphor, he added, “Perhaps the nation will trade the quick high of ‘Make America Great Again’ for real medicine.” That Vance is long gone.\n\nOf course, his most important pre-Trumpian links weren’t to his largely made-up hillbilly upbringing — he was born and raised in Ohio — but his ties to far-right billionaires in Silicon Valley. They have been dubbed “techno fascists” for their reactionary, racist, misogynist, and anti-democratic views. His bids for the Senate and then the vice presidency weren’t just supported by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and other big names in the billionaire tech world, but opened the door to their increasing role in shaping policy, especially but not exclusively in relation to the artificial intelligence and technology industries.\n\nVance has, of course, also been in lockstep with Trump’s imperialist and self-serving foreign policy. He crudely sided with the president when he attempted to browbeat Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in their infamous Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025. He also defended, and even cruelly joked about, the deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean by the U.S. military. He justified Trump’s illegal abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, echoing all the false claims of Trump, Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about drug trafficking and stolen oil.\n\nIt’s a maxim of today’s politics that all relationships with Trump end badly. Will Vance abandon Trump as he deteriorates yet more? The main lesson Trump learned from his late lawyer, the notorious Roy Cohn (of McCarthy era fame), was to use people until they are no longer useful. Cohn counseled Trump in his early years and introduced him to influential and important people who facilitated his rise in New York City. They became “friends” until Trump (of course!) abandoned Cohn in his time of need once he contracted AIDS and was dying. Trump simply brushed him aside when he was no longer useful and reportedly did not even attend his funeral. Can Trump expect the same treatment from Vance?\n\nOr will the vice president be like Kamala Harris and, as she did with President Biden, pretend Trump is well when he clearly is not? As Trump struggles to make it for three more years, Vance will be questioned about his cognitive state and physical health. Will he gaslight the public and hope for the best?\n\nGiven what we have seen and that Vance has demonstrated no loyalty to principles or ethics, no one should be surprised if he turns on Trump at some point, should he determine that it is in his interest to do so.\n\nClarence Lusane, a TomDispatch regular, is a political science professor and director of the International Affairs program and majors at Howard University, and former Independent Expert to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance.

About 30 minutes later, the network followed up with another post, containing a link to an article by two correspondents that similarly cited “two US officials briefed on his medical condition”.\n\nThe report, which was not extensively covered by other news organizations, drew an immediate response on social media from critics who questioned the network’s sourcing – and whether it aligned with the Trump administration’s preferred focus.\n\nBut there was also internal skepticism at the network about the report, according to emails viewed by the Guardian. It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said. Others viewed the conversations as standard editorial discussions.\n\nBefore the original report was published, a medical producer at the network suggested in an email to colleagues that “it would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received”, and whether the officer received surgery or any other type of procedure.\n\nIn another email, an executive expressed skepticism about the broad nature of the medical diagnosis, and what it actually entailed. “I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.\n\n“A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious,” Reiter continued. “We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.” (The network’s story noted that “videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident”.)\n\nThe network’s top editor, Bari Weiss, expressed a high level of interest in the story on an editorial call Wednesday morning, according to staffers who listened.\n\n“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said . “It was viewed as a thinly-veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”\n\n“Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources,” said a second network staffer, who was also not authorized to comment.\n\nIn a statement, a CBS News spokesperson said the network “went through its rigorous editorial process and decided it was reportable based on the reporting, the reporters, and the sourcing”.\n\nCBS, which labeled its story as an “exclusive”, was not totally alone on the story. The ABC News live blog published a two-paragraph update repeating the claim and citing “multiple US officials familiar with [Ross’s] medical condition” – but noting that the officials “didn’t provide more details about the medical condition”.\n\nOther news organizations, including NBC News and the New York Times, also made brief mentions of the claim. Fox News, which published a full story, cited a confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin – though it acknowledged that “the extent of the bleeding … was not immediately clear”.\n\nThe Guardian has not independently confirmed the report.\n\nSince Weiss took over as editor-in-chief in early October, the network has faced accusations of favoritism toward the Trump administration. CBS has been controlled since last year by Paramount Skydance, the media conglomerate heavily bankrolled by the tech billionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.\n\nOn Tuesday, CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil scored an exclusive interview with Trump, who claimed he wouldn’t have recently been made anchor of the CBS Evening News if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election. When Dokoupil pushed back, Trump conceded that he might have, “but at a lesser salary”.","summary":"Anonymously sourced report that Jonathan Ross ‘suffered internal bleeding’ after killing Renee Good faced skepticism inside CBS newsroom\n\nSome CBS News employees expressed concern after the network cited two anonymous “US officials” on Wednesday to report that the ICE officer who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis “suffered internal bleeding to the torso” after the incident.\n\nCBS initially published the account about officer Jonathan Ross on X, formerly Twitter.

Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX) are indicative of changes in the opinion of Republicans.\n\nErin Covey, a CPR House analyst, said in an interview that the shifts are based on the changes in the political environment, which a year ago hadn’t been swayed by legislative actions taken in Congress, while Trump’s approval rating was relatively untested.\n\nBut Democratic election wins in 2025 have become a “good harbinger” of Democratic voters being more motivated to turn out in 2026.\n\nOne of the seats that shifted from “likely” to “solid” was the district represented by Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY). He was one of several where former Vice President Kamala Harris did worse than the congressional incumbents in 2024, so the analysts kept his and many others’ seats at “likely” to see which way the wind blew.\n\n“We weren’t saying that, like, folks like Pat Ryan would necessarily be vulnerable in 2026,” Covey said. “It was just like, well, this is a district that Harris only won by three points. We don’t really know what the environment is going to look like.”\n\nShe noted that in several “likely,” now “solid Democrat” seats, most of the Democratic incumbents have not drawn a strong Republican challenger.\n\n“So, we felt like these were races that warranted just moving into the ‘solid’ category,” Covey said. “It’s not even like we’re saying these districts were competitive before; it’s more that we don’t think that there’s a real potential for them to become competitive at this point.” \n\nHowever, races like Kaptur’s and Gonzalez’s could decide the fate of the House. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) currently has a two-seat majority, which is increasingly being tested by attendance problems stemming from campaigns, medical emergencies, and even death.\n\nKaptur and Gonzalez’s seats were rated “lean Republican,” but are now considered “toss-up.” Seats held by Reps. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) and Laura Gillen (D-NY) shifted from a “toss-up” to “lean Democrat.” \n\nPart of that reason, Covey said, is due to a drop in Hispanic support for Republicans. Hispanics and other key blue voting blocs trended toward Trump significantly in the 2024 election. In 2024, Trump received 43% of Hispanic support, up from 35% in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump’s overall approval rating sits at 42% as of Thursday. And polling from the Pew Research Center in November found Hispanic adults are growing increasingly unhappy with the Trump administration over his economic and immigration policies, as the president continues to levy tariffs and increase deportations of illegal immigrants.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Hispanic adults overall disapproved of the president’s approach to immigration, while 61% said his economic policies have made conditions worse, according to the poll.\n\nCovey said it’s still too early to tell how Hispanic voters will vote in 2026, but the 2025 results in New Jersey and Virginia resulted in “quite a big reversion” away from supporting Republicans. She noted that many Latino voters are independents, which could give members in swing districts an edge.\n\n“It’s not like these are hyper partisans in one way or the other,” the analyst said. “And a lot of the new voters that Trump brought out in 2024, these were not folks who had been reliable Republican voters at all. And so it’s just like the uncertainty around them gives Democrats in some of these places, particularly someone like this. I think it’s always a lot more wiggle room than a Democrat in a bit more less-elastic district.”\n\nKaptur, in particular, is one of a few toss-up incumbents who have a talent for holding onto her competitive seat. She narrowly won her seat by less than 1% in 2024. She was presumed to have her work cut out for her this year, with her seat shifting to “lean Republican” last year due to successful redistricting efforts in Ohio.\n\nBut the seat is back to being a toss-up, largely because the Republican field is growing. Derrick Merrin, her 2024 challenger, is launching a rematch, and Air Force veteran Alea Nadeem is also vying for the Republican nomination. \n\nOn Thursday, hours before the Cook Political Report ratings came out, former deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Madison Sheahan announced she would leave her agency role and run for Kaptur’s seat as a Republican.\n\nCovey said Sheahan’s entrance did not impact the seat’s shift in ratings, but she said it does add to the problem the GOP will have this cycle in Kaptur and many other seats: Republicans don’t have a strong GOP challenger to coalesce behind.\n\n“It means that this primary, I think, is going to be more competitive, and you’re going to see Republicans spending money, having to go after each other, just because it’s not like there’s a clear front-runner here,” Covey said.\n\nData shows that while Democrats are on a high after their wins last year, they cannot just ride a hypothetical blue wave to victory. Covey said a good night for Democrats would be flipping 20 seats, with the party unlikely to reach the 40-seat figure it achieved in 2018.\n\nIn November, a Marist-PBS-NPR poll found that Democrats had a 14-point lead on the generic ballot, the largest advantage for control of Congress in eight years. \n\nIf Democrats were to win every seat President Donald Trump won or lost by 5 points or less, that would only give the party a gain of 14 seats, per the Cook Political Report. That would be more than enough to take the majority, but it wouldn’t be a “wave election” in the eyes of seasoned political pundits.","summary":"Democrats’ chances of recapturing the House majority in the 2026 elections are increasing, thanks to President Donald Trump’s approval rating, off-year election results, and lack of strong Republican candidates.

It’s actually a very good indicator,” Sara scoffs.\n\nTo see the head-shaving video protesting the death of “Renee Cook” and to hear more of Sara’s scathing commentary, watch the video below.\n\nWant more from Sara Gonzales?\n\nTo enjoy more of Sara's no-holds-barred takes on news and culture, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/sara-gonzales-unfiltered/protesters-stand-with-renee-good-by-repeating-their-bizarre-ritual-from-trump-s-2024-victory","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62815478&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 22:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142}]}
