As hundreds of graduating seniors crossed the stage in their blue and white regalia early that morning at Compton High School, many paused to shake hands and take selfies with an honored guest on the dais: the former vice president herself, who'd made a surprise appearance after being invited by a graduating student. Several hours later, Newsom read to young students at Compton's Clinton Elementary School before standing with local leaders in front of a cheery, cartoon mural to launch a new state literacy plan. The issue is one of deep importance to the governor, whose own educational career was often defined by his dyslexia. The adjacent appearances, which occurred a few miles apart, were \"coincidental,\" Newsom said. But they come at a moment when both the high-octane Democrats are in a political limbo of sorts. The pair are viewed as potential 2028 presidential candidates, but the California political world is also waiting on tenterhooks to see if Harris enters California’s 2026 race for governor – a move that would almost certainly preclude a 2028 presidential bid. Harris is expected to make a decision by summer, and her entrance would upend the already crowded race. With just 19 months left in his second and final term, the lame duck governor is scrambling to cement his gubernatorial legacy while also positioning himself as a pragmatic leader capable of steering his national party out of the wilderness. Harris, meanwhile, must decide if she actually wants to govern a famously unwieldy state and, if she does, whether California voters feel the same. Both Harris and Newsom were notably absent at the state party convention last weekend, as thousands of party delegates, activists, donors and labor leaders convened in Anaheim. Newsom was a famously loyal surrogate to then-President Biden. But in recent months with his “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast and its long list of Democratic bête noire guests, the governor has worked to publicly differentiate his own brand from that of his bedraggled party, one controversial interview at a time. Meanwhile, Newsom — who previously scoffed at the speculation and said he wasn’t considering a bid for the White House, despite his manifest ambitions — is more openly acknowledging that he could run for the country's top job in the future. “I might,” Newsom said in an interview last month. “I don’t know, but I have to have a burning why, and I have to have a compelling vision that distinguishes myself from anybody else. Without that, without both, and, I don’t deserve to even be in the conversation.” Newsom demurred Thursday when asked whether he thought Harris would run for governor. \"Look, I got someone right behind me running for governor, so I'm going to be very careful here,\" Newsom said to laughter, as California Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond — who announced his 2026 gubernatorial bid back in September 2023 — smiled behind him. Harris attended the Compton High graduation at the invitation of Compton Unified School District Student Board Member MyShay Causey, a student athlete and graduating senior. She did not speak at the ceremony, though she received an honorary diploma.

Rapinoe said something to the same effect during Team USA's Women's World Cup title run in 2019 after a quarterfinal victory over France, the host country of that year's tournament. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Go gays!\" Rapinoe said at the time, per The Guardian. \"You can't win a championship without gays on your team – it's never been done before, ever. That's science, right there! \"I'm motivated by people who like me, who are fighting for the same things. I take more energy from that than from trying to prove anything wrong. That's draining on yourself. But for me, to be gay and fabulous, during Pride month at the World Cup, is nice.\" MEGAN RAPINOE ‘OVERWHELMED’ BY ANOTHER TRUMP PRESIDENCY, FEARFUL FOR THE TRANSGENDER It's Pride Month now, which brought about the question from Bird to Rapinoe about what it means to play during it. \"Our team was super gay in 2019,\" Rapinoe responded. \"A lot of us were out, a lot of our fans were gay, a lot of the other players were gay. First and easiest thing to ensure you have is gay players on our team.\" In 2019, Team USA had five players who were publicly LGBTQ players. Ali Krieger and Ashlyn Harris, two of the team’s stars, were engaged at the time, while coach Jillian Ellis was also out. That year, Outsports also reported that around 40 lesbian and bisexual players participated in the Women’s World Cup compared to less than 20 in 2015. Rapinoe aided Team USA's efforts in winning back-to-back World Cups in 2019, taking down the Netherlands, 2-0, where Rapinoe scored a penalty kick in the 61st minute to take the lead. Rapinoe had six goals and two assists during five matches in that Women's World Cup, while scoring two goals and dishing out two assists in the 2015 victory. Team USA wasn't able to make it three straight in 2023, as they were eliminated by Sweden in penalty kicks. Rapinoe made it known that the 2023 tournament would be her last World Cup, and while she wished it ended differently, she noted feeling \"so lucky and so grateful to play as long as I have.\" Off the pitch, Rapinoe has been outspoken, including after the 2019 victory where she said \"I'm not going to the f---ing White House,\" while President Donald Trump was in his first term. She also told her Team USA peers to \"think hard\" about going to the White House before facing France in the quarterfinal, prompting Trump to tweet out \"Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job! We haven't yet…\" \"Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\" Trump added in his tweets at the time. Rapinoe also commented on an earlier episode of her podcast with Bird after Trump beat former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, saying she felt \"overwhelmed\" that he would be back in office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think that I feel – not so much personally scared, because I think that we live in very progressive places, we’re unbelievably privileged in our place in the world and life and financially and all of these things, but I think that fear extends to just people in general that will be really affected,\" Rapinoe explained to Bird. \"I’m thinking of all my trans friends and people that I know and trans kids. I’m thinking about the potential of mass deportations if that is going to happen, and just like the general chaos that’s going to be sown is really overwhelming.\" In 2023 appearances with Team USA in her career, Rapinoe scored 63 goals and had 73 assists with her two World Cup titles. She also had 56 goals and 34 assists in her 13-year professional league in the WPS and NWSL.

Vance amid their fiery falling out on Thursday. \n\nX User Ian Miles Cheong wrote: 'President vs Elon. Who wins? My money's on Elon. Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him.'\n\n'Yes,' Musk responded. \n\nHe also predicted that Trump's tariff policy would create economic turmoil. \n\n'The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year,' Musk said. \n\nThe impeachment call comes after Musk made the eye-popping claim that the president is 'in the Epstein files' and as he also threatened to decommission the space ships that are taking NASA astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. \n\nThat came after Trump threatened to cancel all of Musk's government contracts and said he had pushed the billionaire DOGE leader out and in turn the SpaceX CEO had gone 'CRAZY!' \n\nOne of Trump's oldest advisers, Steve Bannon, went even further and suggested the South African-born Musk should be deported. \n\n'They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,' Bannon said in a phone interview Thursday with The New York Times. \n\nLater on his War Room show, Bannon - who has long openly criticized the billionaire - called Musk an 'unstable individual' and a 'national security issue,' pointing to The New York Times report that charted the DOGE leader's drug use. \n\n'President Trump is a bull and Elon is a baby calf,' Bannon also said. \n\nThe spectacular fallout between Trump and Musk - who were political allies for a little less than a year - started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans' 'big, beautiful bill,' arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, on Thursday, when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office he was asked about Musk's recent criticism. \n\nFrom there the dam broke. \n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX's government contracts.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disburbed him.'\n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA.\n\nIsaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX.\n\n'He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I'm sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,' Trump continued. 'We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat.' \n\nMusk posted to X as Trump's Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote. \n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised. \n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued. 'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.' \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man - him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican's campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk's help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.' \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n'Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,' Musk claimed. \n\n'Such ingratitude,' the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n'Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,' Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went 'CRAZY!'\n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts. \n\n'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!' Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n'This just gets better and better,' he wrote. 'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station - and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n'Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,' West wrote.\n\nAnd Musk threw the Epstein bomb. \n\n'@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nJeffrey Epstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n'Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,' Musk added. \n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.' \n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.' \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk's Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nIt was less than a week ago that Trump gave Musk a golden key and a DOGE send-off from the Oval Office.","summary":"Elon Musk agreed Thursday that President Donald Trump should be impeached and replaced with 40-year-old Vice President J.D.

But if you’ve been watching the online “X” spat between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, you might want to reassess which gender cornered the market on emotional volatility.\n\nWho would have thunk it: Two of the world’s most powerful billionaire men would go at each other in open social media warfare.\n\nIt all started with Elon Musk openly criticizing the “big beautiful bill” first in interviews but then on social media, and by Thursday afternoon, it was a full-blown brawl between the President of the United States and his “first buddy,” Elon, spilling all over the internet.\n\nTo be direct, this is what can happen when men start peacocking for power, relevance, or just a bigger slice of the media spotlight, it’s not logic or reason that rules—it’s ego, insecurity, and good old-fashioned drama. We’ve heard it time and time again, how women are just too emotional to lead. The Trump-Musk Feud exposes the myth of male rationality.\n\nThe age-old trope and stereotype that has dogged women for centuries is that we’re too reactive, too moody, too impulsive to lead with wisdom or command with clarity. We as women leaders know this is untrue. But nothing proves the truth we all know like the current online beef right now between Trump and Musk.\n\nIf we are honest, all of us expected the breakup of Trump and Musk to happen. But none of us could have predicted the online spectacle unfolding in real-time between former President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. Because if emotional volatility were a disqualifier for power, these two wouldn’t just be off the stage—they’d be banned from the building.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nGoogle Issues Emergency Update For All 3 Billion Chrome Users\n\nGoogle Confirms Most Gmail Users Must Upgrade Accounts\n\nBitcoin ‘Going To Take Over’—Tesla CEO Elon Musk Backs Shock $40 Trillion U.S. Dollar Collapse Warning Amid Price Boom\n\nIn the past few days, Trump and Musk have engaged in a public spat that can only be described as a billionaire version of a high school hallway fight, minus the locker doors and gym whistles. Trump, never one to let an insult go unreturned, said he believed Musk had \"gone crazy\" and mocked his business record. Musk fired back with jabs about Trump’s alleged involvement in the Epstein files. A low blow to be sure. The entire exchange dripped with insecurity, wounded pride, and a desperate hunger for dominance in the culture war arena.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about political ideology or differing visions for the future. It’s about ego. It’s about bravado. It’s about two powerful men unable to resist the urge to flex, feud, and flame each other in full view of the public. And it demolishes—once and for all—the outdated, sexist trope that women are the ones too “emotional” to be in charge.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t about political ideology or differing visions for the future. It’s about ego. It’s about bravado. It’s about two powerful men unable to resist the urge to flex, feud, and flame each other in full view of the public. And it demolishes—once and for all—the outdated, sexist trope that women are the ones too “emotional” to be in charge.\n\nLet’s unpack that for a moment.\n\nFor centuries, women leaders—from Cleopatra to Golda Meir, to Margaret Thatcher, to Hillary Clinton—have been judged not just on their decisions but on their tone, their temperament, their tears. And lest we forget Kamala Harris’s laughter and joy.\n\nWomen are not allowed to have a moment of vulnerability. Or weakness. And never a moment of anger. If we do so, we are labeled hysterical. If we have a moment of strength--threatening. Meanwhile, men in power have been allowed to rage, sulk, scream, and peacock without having their fitness for leadership questioned. They’re “strong.” They’re “assertive.” They’re “alpha.”\n\nWhat we’re witnessing with Trump and Musk isn’t just a clash of two of the world’s most visible men—it’s a textbook case of emotionally driven leadership. It’s personal. It’s petty. And it’s profoundly performative.\n\nYet somehow, no one is questioning their capacity to lead based on these outbursts. No one is wringing their hands about whether this kind of erratic behavior is a symptom of “unstable masculinity.” And that’s the double standard.\n\nHere’s the truth: emotional intelligence—not emotional suppression—is what makes great leaders. It’s the ability to regulate emotions, communicate clearly, and make decisions rooted in empathy and long-term thinking. By those metrics, women frequently outperform men in corporate boardrooms and political arenas. Multiple studies, including those from Harvard Business Review, have shown that women leaders tend to score higher on qualities like collaboration, integrity, and resilience—key traits of effective governance.\n\nHere’s the truth: emotional intelligence—not emotional suppression—is what makes great leaders. It’s the ability to regulate emotions, communicate clearly, and make decisions rooted in empathy and long-term thinking. By those metrics, women frequently outperform men in both corporate boardrooms and political arenas. Multiple studies, including from Harvard Business Review, have shown that women leaders tend to score higher on qualities like collaboration, integrity, and resilience—key traits of effective governance.\n\nMeanwhile, unchecked male ego—especially when backed by money and power—has caused some of the most destructive decisions in history. Wars. Economic collapses. Political coups. And now, social media meltdowns influence everything from market reactions to public trust.\n\nThe Trump-Musk exchange is more than entertainment. It’s a warning. These men shape public discourse and public policy. One lives in the White House for the next three years. The other controls the platform where much of our political conversation now takes place. Their tantrums aren’t just embarrassing—they’re consequential.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you that women are too emotional to lead, point them to this week’s billionaire bro battle royale. Remind them that composure, grace, and maturity are not traits reserved by gender, but are, in fact, requirements of leadership. And right now, the most emotional people in the room aren’t women at all.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Trump and Musk Prove Men Are Too Emotional to Lead","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophianelson/2025/06/05/male-ego-on-display-trump-musk-and-the-myth-of-rational-men-leaders/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/684213e6131e215951b2b6c1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 22:27:47","author":"Andrew Harnik,Contributor,Sophia A.

Trump and Musk, who spent the first four months of the president's second administration as a special White House advisor steering the recently created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are also blasting each other over which one of them should get the credit for Trump's decisive 2024 election victory. The president, speaking with reporters Thursday, argued, \"I think I would have won\" even without Musk's help on the campaign trail last year. Musk, the world's richest person and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, went all in for Trump last summer and autumn. MUSK UNLEASHES EPSTEIN CLAIM AGAINST TRUMP AFTER BEING BOOTED FROM DOGE He endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in July right after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk became the top donor of the 2024 election cycle, dishing out nearly $300 million in support of Trump's bid through America PAC, a Trump-aligned super PAC. Much of the money was used for get-out-the-vote efforts and ads in the crucial battleground states as Trump and Kamala Harris faced off for the presidency. TRUMP SAYS HE'S ‘VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MUSK FOR OPPOSING ’BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY' Musk concentrated much of his efforts on Pennsylvania. He joined Trump for the first time on the campaign trail at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, then held five town halls in the Keystone State later in October. And Musk set up a war room of sorts in Pittsburgh. Trump, mentioning how Musk campaigned for him in Pennsylvania, pointed to his White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was co-chair of Trump's 2024 campaign. The president noted that \"Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway.\" Musk, apparently watching Trump's comments in real time, quickly fired back on X, which Musk renamed after buying Twitter. \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk wrote. \"Such ingratitude.\" MUSK-TRUMP 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL FEUD SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL Tom Eddy, the GOP chairman in Erie County, a longtime crucial swing county in northwestern Pennsylvania, told Fox News that Musk \"helped Trump significantly. I really think so. He had money and he had a name.\" But Eddy added that \"my gut feeling would be that Trump is basically saying, ‘Look. I won the election. These people helped me, but I won.’ That's what he's trying to bring across.\" Longtime Republican strategist Dave Carney, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns over the past few decades, said the president and Musk are both right. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carney, who steered Preserve America, another top-spending Trump-aligned super PAC, told Fox News that Trump \"might have won without the help, but you can't underestimate how important that help was.\" Pointing to Preserve America, Musk's America PAC and MAGA Inc, which was the main Trump-aligned super PAC, Carney said they all deserved \"a tremendous amount of credit\" and \"just made it easier\" for Trump to sweep all seven battleground states and win the White House. Carney also highlighted the Musk-aligned super PAC's \"unprecedented field effort, mail and other communications … to turn out these low-propensity Trump voters.\"","summary":"Former allies President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trading fire over credit for the 2024 election win, with Musk highlighting his fundraising and campaigning in battlegrounds.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/would-donald-trump-have-won-2024-presidential-election-without-elon-musks-help","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/donald-trump-kamala-harris-president-election-2024-election-campaign-photos_45.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 22:25:39","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":328564644,"title":"George Clooney admits ‘everyone worries about’ being targeted by Trump","text":"George Clooney, actor and prominent Democrat donor, said “everybody” worries about being targeted by President Donald Trump’s administration, but added that won’t stop him from standing up for what he believes in.\n\nSince Trump was elected in November under a campaign which promised retribution, some of the president’s loudest critics have put down their megaphones out of fear he may come after them next. \n\n“Sure, everybody worries about it,” Clooney told CNN’s Anderson Cooper when he was asked about it. “But you know, if you spend your life worrying about things, then you won’t do things.”\n\n“I want to be able to look at my kids in the eye and say where we stood and what we did at certain times in history, and I have no problem with that,” he said. \n\nAlthough Clooney is a lifelong Democrat, he broke from the party last summer to pen an op-ed urging former President Joe Biden to drop out of the race.

Pelosi, Ocasio-Ortez and other top Democrats reportedly boycott 3 Stephen Starr restaurants in Washington","text":"Congressional Democrats are boycotting six upscale restaurants in Washington – including three owned by Stephen Starr – in a show of support for restaurant workers attempting to unionize.\n\nMore than 50 high-profile Democrats, including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have signed a pledge to avoid eating at Starr's Osteria Mozza, Le Diplomate and The Occidental — and three other restaurants founded by chef Ashok Bajaj of Knightsbridge Restaurant Group, Axios reported Thursday. \n\nThe pledge is being circulated by United Here Local 25, a union that represents hotel, restaurant and casino workers in the Washington metro region. Workers at Le Diplomate and two other Starr-owned restaurants – St. Anselm and Pastis – demanded Starr Restaurants voluntarily recognize them as a union in January, but Local 25 claims the company instead has engaged in union-busting tactics.\n\nThe six restaurants subject to the boycott – which do not include St. Anselm and Pastis – have long been political hotspots. Over the last year, political groups and candidates have spent thousands of dollars at the restaurants, Axios reported, citing federal campaign records. \n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were spotted at Osteria Mozza in April. Former President Joe Biden has dined and ordered from Le Diplomate over the years, including a 2021 meal with Jill Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff.\n\nLawmakers who have signed the pledge also include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Jared Golden (D-ME), Greg Landsman (D-OH) and Greg Casar (D-TX), as well as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI). \n\n\"With these restaurants that are frequented so much by members of Congress, our boycott of fundraisers and visiting could have a real impact — could really help these workers,\" Casar told Axios. \"This is our opportunity when we're here in Washington, D.C. to not just go vote in the Capitol but actually go out in the community and make a difference.\"\n\nLocal 25 claims Starr workers at Le Diplomate, St. Anselm and Pastis were offered raises and promotions to campaign against the union and that Starr Restaurants hired \"anti-union persuaders\" to campaign against the union every day. When workers at St. Anselm voted to join Local 25 in February, Starr Restaurants filed objections, according to Local 25. \n\nStarr Restaurants also reportedly successfully petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to cancel a unionization election at Le Diplomate in March, accusing the union of using bullying and intimidation tactics. \n\nLocal 25 has been accused of using aggressive tactics to get employees to sign cards in favor of unionizing. In February, Eater DC reported that the union went to employees' homes and demanded signatures after hours. \n\nOn Thursday, Starr Restaurants called the need for a Democratic boycott \"baseless,\" saying that a majority of Le Diplomate employees have no interest in joining a union. \n\n\"A boycott of any kind can result in lost hours, wages, and tips that our hardworking employees rely upon,\" a Starr Restaurants spokesperson said in an email. \"It is unfortunate that an organization that claims to want to represent the employees of Le Diplomate would call for an action that would harm them.\"","summary":"More than 50 Congressional Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Ortez, reportedly signed a pledge to boycott six high-end restaurants in Washington in a show of support for workers attempting to unionize.

Is the goal here to sell a book? Because that’s what it feels like,' said the former official, calling the book a 'huge distraction.'\n\n'We’re in the middle of fighting against what the [Congressional Budget Office] called 10.9 million people losing their health insurance. Mass deportations. Potential citizens deported to a f***ing concentration camp in El Salvador. This is the messaging you’re sending right now?'\n\n'Her becoming independent because they were mean to her boss is the lamest s--- I’ve ever heard.

And I’m willing to fight side by side with anyone who shares my goals and principles, no matter how they identify politically, so long as they treat me and the communities I love with respect,' she said.\n\nThe criticism from Democrats followed the shock announcement by Jean-Pierre's publisher about her forthcoming book resurfaced complaints about her own capabilities and officials who insulated the former president from criticism that could have helped right the ship.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who launched a brief primary challenge citing his age long before he dropped out, took a shot a Jean-Pierre without naming her direction. 'I haven’t written a book or been paid for a speech and will never become a lobbyist.

As it turned out, Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in at the 11th Hour and lost to Donald Trump anyway. \n\nMost surprising to many is that Jean-Pierre announced she is leaving the Democratic Party, after a long career as an operative, at a time when Democrats are soul-searching to try to find a way to combat Donald Trump. Her new book, titled Independent, has a cover featuring shattered glass, and a PR release describes its substance as 'a look inside a broken White House, outside the party lines.'\n\nHer publisher Hachette describes an 'urgent, timely analysis' and urges Americans to 'vote their values and maintain individuality within party lines.'\n\n'A lot of group chats were revived today,' posted former White House official Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former advisor to VP Kamala Harris, on X, adding a smiling / crying emoji.\n\n'Counting 13 on my end,' chimed in former Biden State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. \n\n'Lol,' wrote former White House assistant press secretary Jeremy Edwads, reposting an article about Jean-Pierre penning the book and leaving the party. \n\nFormer officials contacted by DailyMail.com said they didn't know what kind of advance Jean-Pierre was coming in, after failing to land a high-profile TV gig as did her predecessor Jen Psaki, now an MSNBC host. \n\n'Probably best to purge the party of our most delusional and self-serving personalities,' the former official added. \n\n The slack-jawed responses came after news broke that Jean-Pierre, who spent years defending Biden from the White House podium on both substance and questions about his age, health, and mental fitness was writing the book.\n\nIt comes as her former boss has been hit by a round of tough press coverage with the release of Axios reporter Alex Thompson and CNN anchor Jake Tapper's new book, 'Original Sin,' which rakes the Biden White House for covering up signs of his decline. \n\n'In a country obsessed with blind loyalty to a two-party democratic system, Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary to the Biden-Harris administration, shares why Americans must step beyond party lines to embrace life as Independents,' according to an online release for the book.\n\nShe worked as a political director for Obama. She also worked for liberal outside group MoveOn. Jean-Pierre didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her new project.\n\nThe write-up for her forthcoming book indicates she'll take on people within the party who tried to force Biden to end his reelection campaign after his debate disaster.\n\n'She takes us through the three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision,' according to the release.","summary":"Former Biden White House officials are questioning Karine Jean-Pierre's motives for penning a book  settling scores while leaving the party, while hammering her performance.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14784827/ex-biden-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-blasted-colleagues.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/05/21/99090065-0-image-m-15_1749155224171.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/15/613888008004745960/1024x576_MP4_613888008004745960.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-05 21:22:19","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":328547600,"title":"Tension as Elon Musk, US President Trump fight dirty in public","text":"The co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tesla, Elon Musk, and the United States President, Donald Trump are in the newsMusk said Trump is in the Epstein files and that's the real reason they have not been made publicAccording to Musk, the Democrats would have defeated Trump in the November 2024 presidential election.ng journalist Adekunle Dada has over 8 years of experience covering metro, government policy, and international issues \n\nUnited States - The co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tesla, Elon Musk, has lambasted the president of the United States, Donald Trump.\n\nMusk said Trump would have lost the 2024 presidential election to the Democrat candidate, Kamala Harris without his help.\n\nHe added that Democrats would have control of the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.\n\nThe tech billionaire stated this via his X handle @elonmusk on Thursday, June 5, 2025.\n\n“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.\n\nIn another tweet, he wrote:\n\n“Time to drop the really big bomb:\n\n@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.

That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nJeffrey Epstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\nIn the past few days, Musk has grown increasingly critical of the 'big, beautiful bill' Republicans are trying to pass through Congress - arguing it reversed his work with DOGE - but on Thursday, he took aim at Trump himself. \n\nTrump took to Truth Social Thursday afternoon after first criticizing Musk in the Oval Office. \n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts. \n\n'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!' Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n'This just gets better and better,' he wrote. 'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nTrump's swipes came after Musk said the Republican would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man's help. \n\n'Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,' Musk claimed. 'Such ingratitude,' the billionaire added on X.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured $290 million of his fortune on the Republican's campaign.\n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day. \n\nTrump said he likely still would have won the key state of Pennsylvania without Musk's assistance, partly because Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the Democratic ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.' \n\nMusk said that was laughable.\n\nDuring the transition, Trump announced that Musk would run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency or 'DOGE,' allowing the businessman to take a chainsaw to alleged waste, fraud and abuse. \n\nThose efforts didn't play well with the American public, with Musk formally out last week. \n\nNow the 53-year-old South African-born billionaire is asserting that he has more staying power in U.S. politics than the 78-year-old president. \n\n'Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,' Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nMusk's latest online assault of Trump came moments after the president went on a tirade about the billionaire while hosting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office. \n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump said. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla.\n\nHe also indicated that there was a problem when he rejected Musk's preferred nominee to lead NASA because his choice was a Democrat.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disturbed him.'\n\nShares of Tesla dipped 8 percent amid the spat. \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX.\n\n'He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I'm sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,' Trump continued. 'We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat.' \n\nMusk posted to X repeatedly as Trump's press conference was going on. \n\n'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote, as he continued to criticize what Trump has called his 'big, beautiful' spending bill.\n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised. \n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued. 'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.' \n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump insisted that Musk knew the contents of the bill before the House passed it. Trump is now pushing Republican senators to back it so he can sign it before the July 4 holiday. \n\n'He became a little bit different. I can understand that. But he knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,' Trump protested. \n\nMusk immediately pushed back on X - sharing the clip of Trump's comments. \n\n'False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!' Musk said. \n\nAt the top of Musk's X profile on Thursday, the billionaire had pinned a tweet that said 'Wise words,' highlighting a Trump tweet from 2013 that said, 'I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!'\n\nTrump noted that until recently Musk had 'said the most beautiful things about me.'\n\nIn the Oval Ofice, Trump pointed out that the battle with Musk had yet to turn personal. \n\n'And he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that will be next,' Trump said. \n\nHe went on: 'I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.'\n\nTrump suggested Musk was disappointed by life outside the White House. \n\n'I think he got out there and all of the sudden he wasn't in this beautiful office,' Trump said. \n\nTrump said Musk's about-face represented a greater trend. \n\n'People leave my administration and they love us and then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is, it's sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it,' the president said.\n\n'They leave, they wake up in the morning and the glamour is gone, the whole world is different and they become hostile.' \n\nThe president's comments come less than a week after he feted Musk in the Oval Office, giving him an official farewell as the billionaire moved out of special government employee status and back into the private sector. \n\nTrump noted that he had given Musk a 'wonderful send-off' on Friday before he headed to Pittsburgh to tout a steel deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel. \n\n'Remember, he was here for a long time. You saw a man who was very happy. He stood behind the Oval desk. Even with a black eye,' Trump said.\n\n'I said, \"do you want a little makeup?\" And he said, \"No I don't think so,\" which was interesting.'\n\n'And very nice,' Trump added. 'He wants to be who he is,' the president shrugged.","summary":"Elon Musk claimed Thursday afternoon that President Donald Trump is 'in the Epstein files' - a dramatic escalation amid their spectacular falling out.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14784545/elon-musk-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/05/20/99088515-0-image-a-54_1749151457623.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/05/6934957452681561401/1024x576_MP4_6934957452681561401.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-05 19:40:45","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":328530456,"title":"Washington Post enable amateur authors to publish articles written using AI","text":"By Alimat Aliyeva\n\nThe Washington Post may soon begin accepting opinion pieces from non-professional writers using a proprietary artificial intelligence tool known as Ember. This move is reportedly part of a broader initiative — internally named Ripple — aimed at opening the newspaper to third-party content, including articles from independent authors, Substack writers, and amateur columnists, Azernews reports.\n\nEmber, the AI at the core of this project, can automate several tasks traditionally handled by human editors. These include a \"story power\" tracker to help writers visualize their article’s development, as well as a dynamic sidebar that outlines key elements of the piece, such as the early thesis, supporting moments, and a memorable ending. Writers will also receive support from an AI assistant, which will offer helpful hints, feedback, and \"developing questions\" to guide the writing process.\n\nUnlike traditional op-eds, submissions through Ripple will appear outside the newspaper’s main opinion section and will be available without a subscription via The Washington Post’s website and app — a strategic choice designed to attract a broader, potentially younger audience. Editors will continue to review submissions before publication to ensure quality and compliance with journalistic standards.\n\nThe first partnership agreements are expected to be finalized this summer, while the AI writing coach will be tested in the fall as part of the project’s final phase. Notably, the initiative reflects a shift in how legacy media platforms are embracing generative AI and user-generated content to stay relevant in an increasingly decentralized media landscape.\n\nThis comes amid broader transformations at The Washington Post. In recent months, Jeff Bezos, the paper’s owner and Amazon founder, has taken a more active role in its editorial direction. He reportedly intervened to cancel an editorial in support of Kamala Harris, and later emphasized that the paper should avoid publishing content that contradicts principles of free speech and free markets. These decisions have sparked internal debates and may signal a realignment of the newspaper’s ideological tone.\n\nUltimately, Ripple seems to be a response to the growing popularity of platforms like Substack, Medium, and even Reddit, where readers are hungry for diverse voices and grassroots perspectives. Whether this experiment leads to a renaissance of public discourse or a flood of poorly edited opinion pieces remains to be seen — but it's clear that The Washington Post is betting on AI-assisted democratization of journalism as the future.","summary":"","url":"http://www.today.az/news/regions/259693.html","image":"http://www.today.az/pictures/pic259693.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 19:30:00","author":"Alimat Aliyeva","authors":["Alimat Aliyeva"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"az","sentiment":0.502},{"id":328519082,"title":"Mark Cuban appears to endorse Elon Musk's idea of creating a new political party for the '80% in the middle'","text":"Billionaires Mark Cuban and Elon Musk seem to have found some common ground.As the Tesla CEO's relationship with President Donald Trump blows up in real time on social media amid their clash over the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" Musk proposed creating a new political party for \"the middle.\"\"Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?\" Musk asked in an X poll on Thursday.Cuban, who has sparred with Musk on X multiple times on subjects ranging from DEI to Trump, appeared to endorse the idea, responding to Musk's post with three check marks.Cuban did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.That Cuban is attracted to the idea of a new political party may not come as a surprise.The former \"Shark Tank\" star and Cost Plus Drugs founder has previously expressed his dismay with both political parties.

He’s stifling media. He’s illegally disappearing people and deporting people. And he’s now threatening to impeach judges. So are you confident that the courts will hold, and what concerns you most about what he’s doing now?”\n\nReacting to Hostin’s question, which referenced the administration’s complaints about a “judicial coup” amid a spate of unfavorable court decisions over Trump’s executive orders and policies, the former president wondered what would happen if the White House just outright defied the judicial branch.\n\n“That the courts won’t hold until we have the midterm elections,” he replied to the View host. “Because they’ve made – the Supreme Court has made some good decisions which so far have been ignored.”\n\nClinton then brought up the case surrounding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT mega-prison despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation. The Supreme Court affirmed a ruling in April that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, but he is yet to be sent back. The federal judge in the case ruled this week that Abrego Garcia’s lawyers can seek sanctions against the government.\n\n“They sent him away, then manufactured a picture that made it look like he had MS-13 on his hands, which he didn’t, and the guy is still there in jail,” the former president declared. “And so I’m worried about that. And you should be worried about that, whatever your politics.”\n\nStill, as Clinton expressed fear that the judicial branch may be eradicated within the next year, he did offer up a glimmer of hope that a Trump exit from the White House will eventually bring about strengthened checks and balances.\n\n“I have a sinking suspicion if we – if our party wins the White House in the next election, there will be a hallelujah moment and the Supreme Court will rediscover the Constitution,” he said to applause.\n\n“I’ll be happy if that happens, because all of us should operate under guardrails,” Clinton concluded. “The whole purpose of the Constitution was to repeal royal governments, unaccountable governments that no Democrat or Republican can be without accountability. That’s what I think, so we’ll see what happens.

So are you confident that the courts will hold, and what concerns you most about what he’s doing now?”\n\nReacting to Hostin’s question, which referenced the administration’s complaints about a “judicial coup” amid a spate of unfavorable court decisions over Trump’s executive orders and policies, the former president wondered what would happen if the White House just outright defied the judicial branch.\n\n“That the courts won’t hold until we have the midterm elections,” he replied to the View host. “Because they’ve made – the Supreme Court has made some good decisions which so far have been ignored.”\n\nClinton then brought up the case surrounding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT mega-prison despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation. The Supreme Court affirmed a ruling in April that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, but he is yet to be sent back. The federal judge in the case ruled this week that Abrego Garcia’s lawyers can seek sanctions against the government.\n\n“They sent him away, then manufactured a picture that made it look like he had MS-13 on his hands, which he didn’t, and the guy is still there in jail,” the former president declared. “And so I’m worried about that. And you should be worried about that, whatever your politics.”\n\nStill, as Clinton expressed fear that the judicial branch may be eradicated within the next year, he did offer up a glimmer of hope that a Trump exit from the White House will eventually bring about strengthened checks and balances.\n\n“I have a sinking suspicion if we – if our party wins the White House in the next election, there will be a hallelujah moment and the Supreme Court will rediscover the Constitution,” he said to applause. \n\n“I’ll be happy if that happens, because all of us should operate under guardrails,” Clinton concluded. “The whole purpose of the Constitution was to repeal royal governments, unaccountable governments that no Democrat or Republican can be without accountability. That’s what I think, so we’ll see what happens. But I’m pretty upbeat about it.”\n\nWith the White House increasingly attempting to undermine the courts and casting the federal judges as corrupt and impeachable, legal experts told The Independent

Donald Trump over breakup as interrupt erupts in memes","text":"Elon Musk's baba mama Ashley St. Clair waded into the dramatic fallout between Elon Musk and Donald Trump as she asked the president if he 'needs any breakup advice.' \n\nSt. Clair spoke out as she is in the midst of a custody battle with Musk for their son, and she previously fumed at the billionaire to DailyMail.com when he slashed her child support in half. \n\nSocial media erupted on Thursday as Musk turned on the president with a flurry of insults over his 'Big Beautiful Bill', leaving the internet stunned and waiting to see what he posts next. \n\nX users poked fun at the fight between the world's richest man and the president, with some memeing Musk as Quentin Tarantino character Kill Bill. \n\nOthers ridiculed the billionaires and compared them to bickering teenagers, and joked that Trump would add Musk to his deportation lists. \n\nThe public fallout between Musk and Trump stunned Washington DC and sent Republicans scrambling, but some saw the funny side as political journalist Michael Tracey chimed in with his own prediction. \n\n'At this rate Musk might receive a one-way ticket to El Salvador,' he said on X. \n\nMany had predicted that Trump and Musk's rosy bromance wouldn't last long, as some pointed to betting markets on when they would turn on each other. \n\nBetters heavily favored a fallout before July 1, 2025, less than six months after Musk joined Trump's administration as a special advisor. \n\nPolitical firebrand Laura Loomer also waded into the controversy, saying she had 'been on the hill all day and it’s all anyone is talking about.' \n\n'Will be interesting to see what Republican lawmakers do now,' she said. \n\n'I know law makers who are asking if they should side with President Trump or Elon.' \n\nAfter Musk sent a raft of insults at Trump including claiming he was the sole reason Trump won the 2024 election, the president fired back on Thursday afternoon. \n\n'Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' he said on Truth Social. \n\nHe added in a follow up post: 'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. \n\n'I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!' \n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican's campaign.\n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day. \n\nMusk's claim that Trump wouldn't have won the election without him appeared to strike a chord with the president. \n\nTrump said he likely still would have won the key state of Pennsylvania without Musk's assistance, partly because Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate.\n\nEven with Shapiro on the Democratic ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.","summary":"Elon Musk's baba mama Ashley St. Clair waded into the dramatic fallout between Elon Musk and

WALZ REVEALS THE MISSTEPS HE SAW WITH HARRIS CAMPAIGN AMID POSTMORTEM MEDIA BLITZ Trump remarked that the Democrat Party should have tapped Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to join former Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate on the presidential ticket, but instead chose Walz. \"Elon endorsed me very strongly.

But if they picked him, I would have won Pennsylvania,\" he added, referring to how Shapiro's home was targeted by arson while his family slept back in April. Walz joined Harris on the Democrat ticket in August 2024, just days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July 2024 amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity, giving way to Harris at the top of the ticket. The Harris campaign had just more than 100 days between Biden dropping out and rallying support for the Harris-Walz ticket before Election Day on Nov. 5. After the election, Walz revealed he would run for president in 2028 if the opportunity presented itself. \"Well, I had a friend tell me, ‘Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered,’\" Walz told the New Yorker in March when asked if he would run for president.

But LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield recently said he is “increasingly concerned” the deal could collapse as Paramount is “paralyzed by legal fears” surrounding President Donald Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS and “60 Minutes” over an Oct. 7 interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSettlement talks between Paramount and Trump have prompted warnings from both members of Congress and the California State Senate that doing so to secure regulatory approval of the Skydance deal could potentially constitute a violation of federal anti-bribery laws. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.\n\n“Obviously, as I read in the newspapers, there are some political elements surrounding that deal,” McDowell said during a session at Gabelli Funds’ 17th Annual Media & Sports Symposium in New York. “We’ll see how all that plays out, and also the patience of Skydance. How patient are they going to be? If this is not the deal for Paramount, then it’s a melting ice cube. What would be the next price? Who would be the next buyer?”\n\nThe FCC typically approves or denies transactions within 180 days. However, Greenfield pointed out that it is a guide and not a rule in terms of decision-making and that there’s no “forcing function” for the agency to act.\n\n“We believe it is unlikely the FCC will weigh in until the current Trump/CBS lawsuit is resolved,” he wrote on Tuesday. \n\nThough the five-member regulatory body will be down to just two members following the departures of Democratic member Geoffrey Starks and Republican member Nathan Simington, McDowell said that the Paramount-Skydance deal can still be approved as a “bureau action.”\n\n“The conventional thinking, which is inaccurate, is that you need commission votes for high-profile mergers. Only if there’s something ‘new or novel’,” McDowell explained. “The Skydance proposal is a simple transfer of control of licenses. They’re not already a broadcaster, they aren’t other issues at play. So, it should be approved on bureau action so that’s something that you do not need an FCC vote of the commissioners to get done.”\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into allegations of “news distortion,” including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard. As part of that investigation, CBS News turned over transcripts and video footage from the Harris interview.\n\nThe Skydance deal recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7. If the deal is not closed by July 6, the deadline will be automatically pushed another 90 days to Oct. 4. After that, if the deal is still not closed, Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal. \n\nDespite the uncertainty for Paramount, McDowell was optimistic that the FCC may be more favorable to M&A in the media sector and that there will be “pent-up demand” in areas like local broadcasting. \n\n“The Big X factor, just to talk about the elephant in the room, is the Trump factor,” he said. “But I think as a general matter, especially with traditional media, I think the FCC is going to be a little bit more laissez-faire and allow different experimentation and combinations.”","summary":"The pending $8 billion merger has been stuck in regulatory limbo   as the media giant fends off a $20 billion lawsuit from President Trump\n\n\nThe post Former FCC Commissioner Warns Paramount Will Be &#8216;Melting Ice Cube&#8217; if Skydance Deal Collapses appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-skydance-deal-former-fcc-commissioner-warning/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/skydance-national-amusements-paramount-ellison-redstone.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 17:38:39","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":328528322,"title":"'Sick puppy' Tim Walz should never have been on Dems' 2024 ticket, Trump says","text":"Sick puppy' Tim Walz should never have been on Dems' 2024 ticket, Trump says\n\n President Donald Trump said June 5, 2025, that 'sick puppy' Minnesota Gov.

FORMER BIDEN OFFICIALS RIDICULE KARINE JEAN-PIERRE'S BOOK AS 'BIZARRE CASH GRAB' Jean-Pierre’s political shift comes ahead of her new book \"Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,\" which promises an insider account of her time in the Biden administration. The book’s publisher writes that the memoir will focus on the \"three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision.\" KARINE JEAN-PIERRE RIPPED OVER 'FIRING SQUAD' RECAP OF BIDEN'S EXIT FROM RACE: 'STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND' Jean-Pierre often had a visibly tense relationship with members of the press corps and was a staunch defender of Biden. She repeatedly defended the former president against growing concerns over his mental acuity and physical health, which she frequently brushed off as baseless speculation. In a video promoting the book, Jean-Pierre declared her departure from party politics: \"I think we need to stop thinking in boxes and think outside of our boxes and not be so partisan,\" she said. JESSE WATTERS UNPACKS KARINE JEAN-PIERRE’S ‘BACKSTABBING BOOK’ Heinrich, however, questioned the authenticity of that transformation, suggesting her actions in office don’t align with her new message. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE COMPARES DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR BIDEN TO BE KICKED OFF THE TICKET TO A 'FIRING SQUAD' \"I would be really surprised to learn if there was anything independent about Karine Jean-Pierre,\" she said. \"Including her ability to think through things without the answers in a book in front of her, after sitting in that press briefing room for four years.\" Heinrich, a board member for the White House Correspondents' Association, asked how Jean-Pierre could now claim \"moral clarity\" after serving as the face of the White House’s messaging.

Narrator Iain Stirling announced the abrupt exit midway through Episode 2, although he offered no explanation as to why Yulissa had departed completely off-camera. Viewers may have felt thrown for a loop, but anyone who’s been on Love Island social media has a pretty good idea of why Yulissa was probably asked to leave.\n\nShortly after Season 7’s cast was revealed, social media sleuths uncovered videos of Yulissa repeatedly using racial slurs while on a podcast. Following the revelation, many Love Island fans began to post their intent to vote Yulissa out at the first opportunity. Now, it seems the show itself has intervened before it could come to a fan vote.\n\nYulissa wasn’t the only Season 7 contestant to find themselves in hot water with the fandom over past social media activity. Screenshots from a now-deactivated TikTok account allegedly run by contestant Austin Shepard went viral, showing numerous likes on pro-Donald Trump and anti-Kamala Harris videos. (Yulissa was also exposed for being vocally MAGA after her casting announcement). Austin is still part of the Season 7 cast.\n\nPrior to her abrupt departure, Yulissa caused a stir when she matched with Ace Greene on the first night of the season, despite Chelley Bissainthe having also expressed interest in him (and even a prior connection outside the show).

Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) — the gay, Black, self-described Zionist representing one of the most Democratic districts in the country. \n\n Liam Kerr, co-founder of the centrist-supporting political action committee Welcome PAC — decked out in a West Viriginia Mountaineers jersey with senator-turned-lobbyist Joe Manchin’s name emblazoned across his back — bodies out a bespectacled, man-bunned individual trying to film the scuffle. It would have been a particularly crude piece of performance art depicting the Democratic Party in its present incarnation, but unfortunately, it was real.\n\n Organizers of WelcomeFest, an event billed as “the largest public gathering of centrists,” were expecting disruptions when they convened in D.C. on Thursday — you could even say they welcomed them. Earlier that day, as Kerr kicked off the festivities, he drew a contrast between his own apparel and a t-shirt he told the crowd organizers had on hand for any protesters who might show up. The tee featured a depiction of Babydog, the beloved bulldog belonging to Jim Justice, the West Virginia Republican who replaced Manchin in the U.S. Senate this year, and his slogan, “Delivering Justice for West Virginia.”\n\n “I am wearing a jersey of someone who stepped on the West Virginia campus 50 years ago on a football scholarship, who is the number one-rated ‘Wins Above Replacement’ candidate,” Kerr told the crowd of his Manchin jersey. (Wins Above Replacement, or WAR, is a sports statistic that measures a certain player’s contributions to their team. More on that later.) The Justice t-shirt was meant to send a message to progressive-minded: If you’re not with us, you’re against us. Or, as Kerr put it even more bluntly, “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin.” \n\n Manchin’s dark money group, Americans Together, was, incidentally, one of the sponsors of the event.\n\n Over the course of the afternoon, speakers at WelcomeFest offered their diagnosis for what ails the Democratic Party, which might be summed up as: too much democracy. Too many people making too many demands of their elected representatives. \n\n Onstage, speakers used the shorthand “The Groups” when discussing this phenomenon. Speaker after speaker blamed “The Groups” for Democrats’ failure to win elections and to govern effectively when they did win them. (Names of the specific Groups in question were rarely invoked on stage, but a recent New York Times op-ed by one of the day’s speakers, Democratic operative Adam Jentleson, called out the American Civil Liberties Union, the Sunrise Movement, the Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats as some of the culprits responsible, in his view, for browbeating Democratic candidates into adopting unpopular positions in primaries that Republicans could weaponize against them in a general election.)\n\n The blogger Matthew Yglesias flogged this thesis most aggressively in his presentation. To illustrate his point that “Bad Groups create bad incentives for Democrats,” Yglesias pointed to Democrats’ after a Maryland man was illegally renditioned to a Central American supermax prison by accident — some Democrats have traveled to El Salvador to seek Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the U.S. \n\n Besides this being the only moral position one can take on the question of whether the government should be allowed to extrajudicially seize individuals, ship them off to a foreign jail, and refuse to bring them back when ordered by the courts, Yglesias appears to be wrong about this being a politically dangerous position for Democrats to stake out: Media coverage of this case, kept alive by Democrats who continued to raise awareness about it, damaged Donald Trump’s image, pollster G. Elliott Morris points out. Approval for Trump’s immigration agenda nosedived during the height of the furor over Abrego Garcia’s wrongful seizure. \n\n While speakers at WelcomeFest generally seemed to agree The Groups’ influence was to blame for Democrats’ failures, no one seemed to offer much in the way of a contrasting vision for what the party’s orienting principle ought to be going forward. Abundance, the airport book that some Dems appear determined to adopt as a policy platform, got only brief attention at the WelcomeFest. Instead of a mission or any one overarching vision, there only seemed to be consensus on the fact that Democrats need to start winning again, by whatever means necessary. \n\n The political analyst Lakshya Jain urged reorienting party recruitment efforts to focus on candidates with high “Wins Above Replacement” statistics. The concept will be familiar to anyone who has read Moneyball, Michael Lewis’ book about how the Oakland A’s used sabermetrics to identify and recruit undervalued players. Jain’s model compares a generic match-up in a particular district with the actual results in an effort to evaluate who overperformed or underperformed expectations for their particular race. \n\n To illustrate this point, Jain compared the results of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s race with that of Janelle Stelson, a candidate who ran in Pennsylvania’s 10th district. In his model, AOC, who won her race and outperformed Kamala Harris by six points, underperformed a generic race in her district by two points; Stelson, who lost by one point and outran Harris by four points, overperformed a generic Democrat by nine points. \n\n Jain’s pitch was that, in the current political environment, which he says is D+6, Democrats have a real opportunity to seize legislative majorities if they focus their efforts on recruiting candidates with high WAR scores — the catch is that these candidates might be unpalatable to The Groups and other party faithful. \n\n “Being very blunt, if we run candidates that D.C. finds appealing, we’re probably going to lose. There is an inverse correlation between what you guys all find appealing and what the median voter finds appealing,” Jain told the room. \n\n He brought up Blue Dog Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), who spoke on a panel with Yglesias and Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) and Adam Gray (D-Calif.).\n\n “A lot of you may say you find some of Jared Golden’s votes to be annoying for a Democrat,” Jain said. “Well, guess what? The choice isn’t between Jared Golden and AOC. The choice is between Jared Golden and Paul LePage. So who would you rather have?”\n\n It was an echo of Kerr’s opening remarks — “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin” — and it’s a real question that gets at the heart of Democrats’ present predicament. \n\n Do Democrats — or Americans writ large — need more candidates in the mold of Joe Manchin, the man single-handedly responsible for torpedoing Democrats’ expanded child tax credit, a program that had lifted 2.1 million children out of poverty?\n\n Unappealing as the choice is, there’s also a high probability that it is a false binary too: Jain claimed in his presentation, “The base will vote for you anyway… Don’t worry about liberal defections.” \n\n But if the results of the 2024 election have indicated anything, it’s that attitude — the attitude that was also adopted by the Harris campaign — is a losing one: We know that demoralized Democratic-leaning voters who stayed home decided the election.","summary":"At WelcomeFest 2025, centrists offered their diagnosis for what ails the Democratic Party: too many people making demands of their elected representatives","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/democrats-centrist-welcomefest-everything-wrong-1235356464/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/welcomefest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 16:09:35","author":"Andrew Perez,Tessa Stuart","authors":["Andrew Perez","Tessa Stuart"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":328467660,"title":"Full List of Democratic Leaders Who've Left the Party Since 2024 Election","text":"With news of Karine Jean-Pierre's departure from the Democratic Party making waves, the former White House press secretary joins a growing list of high-profile Democrats distancing themselves from the party in the wake of the 2024 election.Newsweek has reached out to several political scientists and historians for comment via email on Thursday.Why It Matters Last November marked a pivotal election in the United States, with Donald Trump returning to the White House after winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College. The scale of the Republican Party's triumph in November—taking the White House, flipping the Senate, and maintaining control of the House—has sparked widespread soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild.Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within, some for pushing the party too far left, and others for appearing too conciliatory toward Trump, and a number who have felt disillusioned with its agenda have left the party entirely to either identify as independent or as a Republican.Democrats Who've Left The PartyJean-Pierre, once a staunch defender of the Democratic Party and then-President Joe Biden, announced she has left the party to become an independent. The move coincides with the upcoming release of her book, Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, which is set for release in the fall.Others have already left the Democratic party, including a number of state-level lawmakers.Kentucky State Senator Robin WebbWhile some Democrats have switched to become independent, Webb flipped parties, now identifying as a Republican, which is relatively rare in American politics. She was the last Democrat representing Eastern Kentucky in the state Senate.\"While it's cliché, it's true: I didn't leave the party—the party left me,\" Webb said in the statement. \"The Kentucky Democratic Party has increasingly alienated lifelong rural Democrats like myself by failing to support the issues that matter most to rural Kentuckians.\"She wrote that she no longer felt the party represented her values amid a \"lurch to the left\" and a \"hyperfocus on policies that hurt workforce and economic development\" in the region, which is known for its coal industry.Florida State Representative Hillary CasselIn December, Cassel framed her decision to become a Republican around several key themes. She emphasized her roles as both a mother and a Jewish woman, expressing desire to \"build a world where our children are judged on their character and their actions not their labels.\"Cassel specifically cited growing concerns about the Democratic Party's stance on Israel, pointing to what she described as its \"failure to unequivocally support Israel and its willingness to tolerate extreme progressive voices that justify or condone acts of terrorism.\" She also highlighted frustration with the party's ability to \"relate to everyday Floridians.\"Florida State Representative Susan ValdésNearly a month after the November election, Valdés announced her decision to flip from being a Democrat to a Republican. In her statement noting her departure, she noted that she prefers to follow the agenda that Republican House Speaker Daniel Perez has laid out, which she says focuses on \"empowering House members to work on real problems facing our communities.\"She added that she is \"tired of being the party of protesting when I got into politics to be part of the party of progress.\"Florida State Senator Jason PizzoIn April, Pizzo, who was then the Senate Minority leader, said on the floor of the Florida Senate that the \"Democratic Party in Florida\" was \"dead,\" criticizing modern partisanship as \"a mess\" and calling for practical leadership over politics.\"Stripping myself of the title of a party designation allows me to run free and clear, clean and transparent,\" he said, a nod to his rumored 2026 gubernatorial ambitions. He is currently nonaffiliated.Democratic National Committee fundraiser Lindy Li\"It's like leaving a cult,\" Li said in December, explaining that she was ostracized for questioning then-Vice President Kamala Harris's political ambitions and Biden's leadership abilities.Li was part of the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) finance committee and has been critical of her party since Harris' election loss, calling it a \"$1 billion disaster.\"Even ahead of the 2024 election, some Democrats have signaled frustration and disillusionment with the party, with Senator Joe Manchin notably leaving the party to identify as an independent. Others, like State Representative Shawn Thierry, switched parties after losing her Democratic primary.However, on the flip side, this week, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his Florida gubernatorial run as a Democrat.What People Are Saying Professor Michael Kazin, an expert on U.S. politics and social movements in Georgetown University's history department, told Newsweek in an email Thursday: \"In the past, politicians switched parties either when they felt their old party no longer represented their views (examples include Charlie Crist in FL, Wayne Morse in Oregon, and Ronald Reagan) or when they thought they had a better chance to win a primary or general election as the candidate of the other party...The partisan battle-lines are pretty rigid, and it's become perilous for a politician to cross them.\"U.S. Representative James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, on X, formerly Twitter: \"Congratulations to my dear friend Sen Robin Webb for switching parties. Like so many good honest people with common sense who work hard and pay taxes, the Democrat party has abandoned them. Robin will make an excellent addition to our great Kentucky State Senate Majority!\"Then-president-elect Donald Trump said on Truth Social in December: \"Congratulations to Hillary Cassel for becoming the second State Representative from the Great State of Florida to switch her Party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, once more expanding the GOP Supermajority in the State House! I would further like to invite other Disillusioned Democrats to switch Parties, and join us on this noble quest to Save our Country and, Make America Great Again - GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.

The other members are Christian Newton, the 23-year-old chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, Erik Conyers, a 25-year-old Trump fundraiser and event planner, and Janiyah Thomas, who ran Black media for the president during his 2024 campaign.\n“They represent the future of Trump’s transformational ‘America First’ legacy within the Republican Party and are the MAGA standard-bearers of what was originally considered a one-time, extremist political movement but is now the proud and loud political majority of this country,” Lynne Patton, the director of minority outreach at the White House tells me.\nThe friends met on the campaign trail and bonded over what they felt was a lack of Black staffers. Thomas says the group bonded partly because of how ostracized they felt by their friends and families for being young, Black, and conservative.\nConyers grew up in a Democratic household in Virginia and went through the Senate Page Program when Barack Obama was in the White House—the only Black page in his cohort. “Everyone wanted me to be a Democrat,” Conyers said. “My family wanted that, but I knew that there were things that I didn’t agree with.” Conyers maintains relationships with family and friends from back home, but not without some pushback. “They think I’m crazy, but they still support me,” he told me over the phone. “We know what parameters we should and shouldn’t discuss.”\nNow that it may be seen as trendy to be a conservative in America, they no longer feel self-conscious about their political beliefs. But the group didn’t get its name until February, when someone approached them at a party and said, “You know what we call you guys behind your back? The Black Republican Mafia,” Conyers tells me. They decided it was the perfect moniker.\nThe mafia have become an emblem of a new era of young conservatism: one that is brash, ambitious, and loves to party. The group is part of a trend in the 2024 election, when Americans between 18 and 29 shifted favorably toward the Republican Party—although, according to analysis by Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), their attitudes and interests diverged from older conservatives on issues like climate change, abortion, and immigration. At the same time, support for Democrats decreased among young Black voters. In 2024, they voted for Kamala Harris by a 50-point margin, down from 2020, when Black youth supported Joe Biden by a 77-point margin, according to surveying by the Associated Press. CIRCLE researchers observed that “among the Black electorate, young voters gave President Trump the highest support compared to other age groups, continuing a 2020 shift in which Black voters under the age of 45 started switching their preference.”\nWhen I asked why Trump’s second term has been particularly welcoming to this group, they say that the president is willing to engage with and listen to the younger people he employs, that he is transparent about what he is doing in government and shares everything on social media, and that they don’t have to shrink themselves or change to fit in with his administration.\n“The fact that there are young conservatives like us that are so involved and spearheading a lot of the efforts to support President Trump, and support his agenda, really, I think is super special,” Newton says. “We have hired more political appointees and at a quicker rate than any administration ever has…. It shows that the president is committed to making sure we get stuff going.”\nPearson first met Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022; he recalled him being “passionately enthusiastic” about young people playing a bigger role in the party. He has a photograph with the president pinned on his Instagram page.\nDespite Trump’s campaign against DEI policies or rollback of civil rights protections, some members of the group say they don’t see his comments or actions as racist.\n“The president eliminating DEI is not racist, because none of my friends needed DEI to get to where they are,” Pearson says. “From what I’ve seen from the president, every interaction that I’ve had with him, and also going back to his record, this is a president who has, time and again, delivered for the Black community.”\nWhen the group goes out, it’s usually to DC’s latest members club, The Ned, Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab next to the White House, or The Park at 14th for Sunday lunch. Erik Conyers loves gossip and a French 75, and can recite the rest of the group's go-to drink orders by heart. For CJ, it’s a whisky sour, Emery, a vodka soda, Janiya loves a prosecco, and Christian, a vodka soda with lime. Once, when someone approached Conyers and asked if they could potentially join the group, his response was, “There’s really nothing you can do.” Another person has reportedly asked five times.\nFor now, the group chat shows no sign of growing, but if they were to admit a new member, they say it would be Xaviaer DuRousseau, a 28-year-old conservative social media star based in Los Angeles. DuRousseau is a “friend of the group,” says Pearson, but he would have to live in DC for the invite to be formally extended.","summary":"Meet the clique of five friends in and around the Trump administration who form the nucleus of the young, Black, conservative social scene.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/black-republican-mafia","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6841ad225662e572ee3682a4/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf625-republican-mafia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 15:56:39","author":"Olivia Empson","authors":["Olivia Empson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.142},{"id":328462058,"title":"Trump Should Get The Hint That Xi Just Isn’t That Into Him","text":"China's President Xi Jinping (R) and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKIFRED DUFOUR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nXi Jinping probably doesn’t know whether to be flattered or aggrieved by Donald Trump’s late-night rantings about the Chinese leader.\n\nSounding more like a jilted ex than a head of state — or a force to reckon with in negotiations — the U.S. president complained Xi is proving “extremely hard to make a deal with.” Trump, on social media, sounded sincere enough — as if it just dawned on him that Beijing might not be interested in a bilateral trade deal after all.\n\nAll this raises almost too many questions to pose here. One: Doesn’t Trump recall Xi giving him the talk-to-the-hand treatment the first go around from 2017 to 2021? Another: What about Xi’s energy, circa 2025, makes Trump think Xi is anxious for another go?\n\nTrump, like any wistful ex, is keeping his options open. He prefaced his 2:17 a.m. Washington-time rant with “I like President Xi of China, always have, and always will, but…”\n\nIt’s time that someone on Trump’s staff had the courage to tell him that perhaps the most powerful Chinese leader in many decades just isn’t into him and his trade tactics.\n\nOn one level, Xi can be excused for lacking the bandwidth to deal with Trump World’s chaos right now. Even before the Trump 2.0 era started on January 20, Asia’s biggest economy was grappling with a massive property crisis that’s generating deflation. Xi’s Communist Party was already facing weak domestic demand and record youth unemployment.\n\nBack in November, when Team Xi assumed Kamala Harris would be the next president, Beijing was struggling to stop the national birthrate from falling. It was mulling ways to address a rapidly ageing population. It was devising bigger social safety nets to encourage China’s 1.4 billion people to save less and spend more.\n\nPre-Trump 2.0, Beijing was in the throes of trying to reduce several trillions of dollars of local government debt. Before the latest Trump tariffs, Xi’s government was working to shift its growth model away from exports and runaway investment to domestic demand-led growth. It was working to reduce the dominance of inefficient state-owned enterprises. It was endeavoring to increase the use of the yuan in global trade and finance.\n\nTeam Xi is also contending with a notable increase in in-person protests. Especially factory workers getting stiffed as export growth slows. Now, Trump’s tariffs, volatility in the dollar and bedlam in the U.S. Treasury market are sending intensifying headwinds China’s way.\n\nSo, yes, a busy time to be the leader of a giant, unbalanced economy directly in the Trumpian crossfire. And the White House thinks now is a good time to drop everything and do a hasty bilateral trade deal?\n\nTrade agreements are wildly complicated affairs in the best of times, taking several months, even years. Hence, Xi’s strategy of slow-walking the process, one that’s worked so far.\n\nDelaying talks is all the more rational given the decent odds U.S. courts will ultimately rule against Trump’s claim that presidents have tariff powers.\n\nTrump, of course, is desperate for a trade deal, any deal, to try to convince Americans that, see, the tariffs are working. His splashy signing ceremony with London doesn’t count, since the U.S. has a trade surplus with the United Kingdom.\n\nJapan hasn’t been as pliant as Trump seemed to expect. And new South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is more Seoul’s answer to Bernie Sanders than a kindred spirit keen to work with Trump World.\n\nEurope isn’t exactly fertile ground for a win. Why would Trump be threatening 50% tariffs on the EU if concessions were forthcoming from the 550-million-person market?\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative sending reminder letters to trading partners so they don’t forget about the upcoming deadline for talks is telling in itself. If White House phones were ringing with good offers, such embarrassing letters wouldn’t need to be sent.\n\nAlso, if Trump really believed Xi is ready to make big concessions, why would his team risk a deal by going after Chinese students with a ban on visas? China, meanwhile, knows how news this week that it may place an order for hundreds of Airbus aircraft, not Boeing, will have Trump fuming.\n\nLittle about the last couple of weeks suggests these two economic giants are about to sit down for nuts-and-bolts trade negotiations in good faith.\n\nTrump’s late-night post might’ve been his way of reminding Xi that the two men were supposed to catch up via phone this week. They did indeed talk on Thursday. But it still seems like high time Trump took the hint that Xi just isn’t that into his trade deal.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Xi Jinping probably doesn’t know whether to be flattered or aggrieved by Donald Trump’s late-night rantings about the Chinese leader.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2025/06/05/trump-should-get-the-hint-that-xi-just-isnt-that-into-him/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6841bbce590dbd5795debc46/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 15:56:16","author":"Donald Trump,Senior Contributor,William Pesek","authors":["Donald Trump","Senior Contributor","William Pesek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":328479550,"title":"MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace on Her New Podcast, Trump’s “Undemocratic” Antics, and How the GOP Lost Its Way","text":"I met Wallace briefly before the taping, which was featuring the brothers behind MeidasTouch, the independent, pro-democracy media network whose podcast briefly unseated Joe Rogan’s on the charts, a fact I overheard someone mention as we headed toward the studio.

The MeidasTouch Podcast is among the most popular politics shows on YouTube, a platform MSNBC is increasingly turning to; it first did so quietly, with Why Is This Happening? The Chris Hayes Podcast, and as of Thursday, the first two episodes of Wallace’s podcast are available to watch.\nThe Best People, which debuted at number one on the Apple Podcasts charts after launching Monday, marks Wallace’s first foray into the podcast space, and its content varies significantly from that of her two-hour block on weekdays for Deadline: White House, on which she has conducted interviews with political leaders such as former president Joe Biden, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, as well as former FBI director James Comey. Guests from all industries are featured on the first season of the new podcast, including actors Jason Bateman, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Jeff Daniels; music producer Jimmy Jam; Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers; and media figures Rachel Maddow and Kara Swisher.\nIn an interview, Wallace acknowledged that the podcast lineup is less explicitly political than her typical MSNBC guest list, though those coming on, in addition to being “insanely and wildly accomplished,” are also “interested in talking about the moment and the world around us.”\nAs a former White House communications chief under George W. Bush and senior adviser for John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, Wallace hasn’t identified with the GOP since Trump came on the scene, voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden in 2020, and Kamala Harris in 2024. “The Republican Party broke my heart the first time,” she tells me. “I don’t expect anything from them, but even expecting nothing, I’m embarrassed for them that they’ve relinquished so much authority,” Wallace adds, referring to congressional Republicans’ unwillingness to push back on Trump’s executive overreaches.\n“Trump isn’t acting in a way that is Republican,” Wallace says. “He’s acting in a way, in my view, that is undemocratic.”\nOur full conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, is below.\nVanity Fair: I would love to hear in your own words what this podcast aims to be and how the format and content might differ from your on-air work.\nNicolle Wallace: First of all, The Best People is our effort to repossess or reappropriate Donald Trump’s pledge to have “all the best people” in his first term. That clearly wasn’t a term being used to describe the folks in the second term, so we thought we’d have fun with it, with people who actually are legitimately, and objectively, the very best people, certainly that I have come across in my career and life.\nThere’s such a range of guests in this first season, from people like Jason Bateman to Kara Swisher and, even from your own network, Rachel Maddow. I’m curious what sort of through line, if any, you saw in their stories?\nAll of them are so engaged in the world in which we live. Sarah Jessica Parker is so deeply focused on public libraries and worried about what will happen if we have to go without any of them or if their hours are cut. Jason Bateman is so incredibly astute about this political moment and the need to bring everybody into the conversation, to get beyond a moment where politics is so divided.\nThe through line, obviously, is that they’re all insanely and wildly accomplished. That I even know all of them is mind-blowing to me. But if there’s a through line in the conversations themselves, it’s that not one of them found it easy to talk about themselves. They were much more interested in talking about the moment and the world around us.\nSeveral of your guests are from the world of entertainment. What are your thoughts on the role of pop culture in shaping political society today?\nI think it’s from the other way around. If you look at the history of any political movement, it never comes from Washington. It never comes from politics. It comes from culture. You look at Donald Trump’s nod to the manosphere, that was really a nod to culture and the power of culture.\nI don’t think any of these people would say that they’re going to move politics, but I think all these people care so deeply about different policy issues. Their voice and their role in shaping the culture is probably more significant than any of them think.\nThis is a podcast that’s a little less focused on the more typically political aspects of your job. Do you see this content as an escape from the news or possibly a supplement to it?\nWhat I found was, with Sarah Jessica, for example, we sat down and just dove right into the news of the day. We talked about some of these policies. And I was the one who said, “I got to screen And Just Like That…” I would get, like, half an answer out of her, and then she’d want to go right back into the broader world in which we live, or the sort of things that our children will confront. Jeff Daniels was the same. He just wrapped up a really neat project in which he plays [Ronald] Reagan. I was interested in talking to him about his new projects and other things, and he plays the guitar for me in the episode. But he, too, had his mind on this moment.\nWhat it is is maybe just more in proportion to how people think about politics in their own lives. I don’t know that people will feel like they’re devoid of politics. They certainly aren’t. There was no prescription or structure about how much politics we would talk about, but they are certainly people who are very astute and smart about our politics, that obviously have accomplishments and credibility in broader fields.\nI wanted to turn to the news of the day and Trump’s second administration. Have you felt any change in the tone or tempo of the political news cycle under his second term?\nIt’s whatever you make of it. We at the show have made a decision to try to slow it down. The freneticism that we brought to the first term was just so dizzying. So we made a decision as a show—instead of trying to do 20 stories in two hours, we try to do maybe four. The pace is what it always is with Trump.\nMy sense after he won was that we should try different things, and we’ve felt like our audience has really stayed with us. I’ve always said this—and this became really true during the pandemic—we have a monogamous relationship with the viewer.\nI’m curious to hear your thoughts on Trump’s attacks on press freedom. Should the media at large be concerned?\nWe should always do our jobs concerned. The power of the things that we say and do is so great that we should always be cognizant and make sure that we have all of our facts straight.\nI think that the way Trump is governing in the second term makes it a lot easier, because it’s all out in the open. In the first term, we relied so much on investigative journalism and investigative stories, and then the second term, so much of it is just out in the open. That may end up being a symptom of Trump’s real or perceived political strength. It may be a symptom of him being a lame duck. He’s not running again. He feels like he has mastered the job. I don’t know why that is, but the seeming corruption of the pardon process or the rule of law is all happening in plain sight.\nIn terms of press freedoms, if you look at countries that move toward an autocracy, there is intimidation, there are lawsuits, there are things that start to happen. We’re obviously watching for those things and concerned about them, but I think our focus day-to-day is on covering the things that happen in full view and holding up a mirror to them. We’re trying to deepen our understanding of why they’re happening and how they differ, not just from past presidents, but the past Trump administration. We have a lot of security from the folks that we work for, having our backs and worrying about running the company, so that we can cover the news. It is obviously a live wire and a dynamic thing that anyone who says they’re not concerned about it or watching it, I’m not sure would be telling you the truth. It’s something Trump talked about enough, going back to his first term and describing the press as the enemy of the people, that we have to take him literally and seriously.\nI wanted to go back to something you just said about it possibly being a symptom of Trump being a lame duck in a sense, but at the same time, all this is happening in plain sight. He’s been unwilling to shut down rumors about running for a third term, even though that’s not constitutionally plausible. How are you looking at that, if at all?\nI haven’t covered that yet. I’ve tried to take a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other approach to the second term. I think it’s important to acknowledge that everything is possible. We’ve never before elected someone convicted of 34 felonies. So it is certainly plausible that he does that. And you’re right, he has flirted with it publicly.\nBut I think that getting ahead of the story is how you lose that connection with your own audience. What people can take in immediately is what has already happened, the news that is happening right in front of us. So we’ve stayed more focused on the news of the day. But I think that norm busting and waving something in front of us that is unconstitutional flagrantly delights him, and it is obviously an important thing to keep an eye on.\nGiven your experience prior to journalism, as a former White House communications director for a Republican president, I’m curious how you’re reflecting on the Republican Party of today?\nThe Republican Party broke my heart the first time. It’s sort of like, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don’t expect anything from them, but even expecting nothing, I’m embarrassed for them that they’ve relinquished so much authority. You don’t have to make Trump mad to say, “Hey, Congress has a role here. We get to decide if your nominees are qualified to run such venerable institutions like the Pentagon and the FBI.” That they don’t seem to be interested in doing the normal functions of that branch is amazing to me, but not surprising.\nWhat would you say to other former Republicans or those more traditional Republicans who are struggling with their place in the current political landscape?\nI never thought there were enough “Never Trump” Republicans to be a meaningful voting bloc. I think that the better function is to articulate how unconservative all these things are. Trump isn’t acting in a way that is Republican. He’s acting in a way, in my view, that is undemocratic.\nIt’s an interesting moment, and I think the oldest rules of politics apply here–it’s the economy, stupid. If Trump’s tariffs do what Trump has said they will do—if they make it very expensive for people to purchase things at places like Walmart and Target, which have already said they’re going to raise their prices—then it’ll be interesting to see if that changes or erodes any of his public support. It’s already happening in the polls, but we’ll see how that translates and if that translates into any courage for Republicans in Congress who see their constituents hurting.\nOn the other side, what do you make of the Democrats’ messaging strategy in response? Is it meeting this moment?\nI think there are some extraordinary messengers. I see the things that Chris Murphy puts out almost instantly, and he’s doing them on social media. He’s doing them on the floor of the Senate. He’s doing it in interviews. I saw what Cory Booker did, which was both a powerful message and a sort of unforgettable tactic, the filibuster.\nI was a Republican, so I understand the muscle memory and the reflexes and history of the Republican Party. I have never been a Democrat. I voted for three Democrats for president since Trump came on the scene, but I’ve never been a Democrat, so I try to refrain from too much analysis. I think that the recklessness with which Trump is treating the economy, and the indifference to how people will feel about flagrant self-enrichment, feel like opportunities for Democrats. But we’ll see if Democrats run with that as a political message.\nWhat does your media diet look like?\nMy husband, [Michael Schmidt], is obviously at The New York Times, so I have a real affinity for the Times. I consume a lot of New York Times live blogs. I read everything that The Atlantic puts out. I’m in awe of the depth and the beauty of their pieces. I watched probably most or all of Rachel [Maddow’s] 100 days. I have a 13-year-old and a one-year-old, so I don’t get a lot of the evening diet because I’m doing homework or bath or bed, but I try to watch as much of Morning Joe as I can before my house wakes up and takes off. The one big difference? I quit X. I don’t see any of the social media stuff. I don’t see what Trump posts. I don’t see what [Elon] Musk posts. And that’s a problem, because we have to cover it. That’s where my big blind spot is. My team mostly flags stuff for me.","summary":"The cable host is expanding her scope with The Best People, bringing in voices from across industries and culture who are “interested in talking about the moment and the world around us.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/msnbcs-nicolle-wallace-new-podcast-trump-gop","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/683f2a6b5b68e4853f138f64/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Nicolle-Wallace-Interview.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 15:05:31","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.635},{"id":328445706,"title":"Steve Jobs’ Daughter Eve To Marry UK Olympian In Star-Studded Affair: Who’s On The Guest List?","text":"Eve Jobs, the youngest daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, is set to marry British Olympic equestrian Harry Charles in August this year.

The preliminary research, conducted by the cybersecurity firm iVerify, includes a “significant amount of circumstantial evidence,” iVerify CEO Rocky Cole said. Apple, the maker of the iPhone, refuted the findings. But Cole said the report was worth publishing for use by the cybersecurity research community. Apple's reputation is sterling among security professionals, and if it is confirmed a hack occurred, it would be a significant development in the cybersecurity industry. IVerify has not identified who may be behind the potential hacking operation, but believes the targets and technical sophistication suggest a capable spy agency may have been involved. Two people familiar with the investigation told NBC News that former members of the Harris-Walz campaign were some of the people iVerify believes were targeted. It’s not clear what initially set off the investigation. IVerify said that in addition to the Americans who were targeted, a European government official’s iPhone had indications of remote tampering. It appears that last year, a hacker remotely and secretly installed a type of invasive, malicious program known as spyware to snoop on those users without their knowledge, iVerify said. Out of nearly 50,000 phones that iVerify analyzed, it found only six — all belonging to high-profile people who would be potential targets for an espionage campaign — that showed evidence of exploitation. Apple disputed iVerify’s conclusion that its evidence is a strong indication that iPhones were hacked. “We’ve thoroughly analyzed the information provided by iVerify, and strongly disagree with the claims of a targeted attack against our users. Based on field data from our devices, this report points to a conventional software bug that we identified and fixed in iOS 18.3,” Ivan Krstić, the head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, said in an emailed statement. Apple is “not currently aware of any credible indication that the bug points to an exploitation attempt or active attack,” Krstić said. Cole, iVerify's CEO, responded in a statement: “In light of the recent public conversation around mobile security, there is ample evidence in the report worth sharing with the research community. We’ve never claimed there is a smoking gun here, only a significant amount of circumstantial evidence.” iVerify’s report makes it clear it did not directly catch malicious software that took over phones. Instead, its researchers found evidence that it had been installed, then deleted. The phones suspected of being hacked displayed suspicious activity in crash logs, the records a computer or a smartphone automatically writes when the operating system encounters an error or a program fails. That indicates tampering, the company said. “We identified exceedingly rare crash logs that appeared exclusively on devices belonging to high-risk individuals including government officials, political campaign staff, journalists, and tech executives,” the report says. “At least one affected European Union government official received an Apple Threat Notification approximately thirty days after we observed this crash on their device, and forensic examination of another device revealed signs of successful exploitation.” Andrew Hoog, a co-founder of the mobile phone security company NowSecure, told NBC News that he found iVerify’s “analysis and conclusions credible and consistent with what we’ve observed over nearly a decade of mobile zero-click attacks.” If a spyware campaign has been taking over high-profile Americans’ phones, it would be a major escalation in the back-and-forth between cyberspies and the security engineers who try to stop them. The iPhone’s cybersecurity is widely revered, and cybersecurity experts largely view iPhones as some of the most secure devices that are commercially available. Apple routinely updates its operating system to fix flaws that hackers use to break in. But it has also designed the iPhone operating system to share very little information with cybersecurity researchers, far less than most other operating systems. iVerify’s claim comes in the context of other allegations that cyberspies snooped on the 2024 presidential campaigns, including the United States’ accusing China of listening to both parties’ presidential campaigns’ phone calls and Iran of hacking Trump campaign emails and sending stolen information to Biden campaign officials. The Biden administration’s Justice Department charged three Iranians in connection with the operation in September. Researchers have for years tracked governments’ use of spyware to spy on journalists and activists in other countries. Politicians in France and Spain have been targeted by spyware, prompting national scandals. IVerify’s report is the first major public claim of spyware’s successfully breaking into iPhones tied to American phone numbers and high-profile Americans. There is precedent for cyberspies’ targeting major political campaigns. Last year, Microsoft, Google and several federal agencies said Chinese intelligence had hacked several major telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, and used that access to specifically spy on both the Trump and Harris campaigns’ conversations. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not hire iVerify, so it does not have data from it to analyze. Sources who confirmed that members of the Harris-Waltz campaign were among those whom iVerify has investigated as targets of the campaign did not identify those people. iVerify also discovered a potential way hackers could have gotten in: a vulnerability in iMessage, the chat app that comes preloaded in Apple phones, that appears to be a zero-click vulnerability, meaning a hacker could exploit it without the user’s even knowing. Apple has since patched the vulnerability. Spyware can give remote hackers remarkable insight into their victims’ personal messages and accounts. While confirmed instances are rare, it is the only proven tactic for hackers to reliably bypass the major privacy protections available for commercial phones, like the encrypted messaging app Signal. A hacker who successfully deploys spyware on politicians’ phones, for instance, could read all their Signal chats, track their browsing histories, listen to their phone calls and even turn the phones into covert listening devices to spy on conversations while they are in the targets’ pockets. By giving a hacker remote access to a phone, spyware goes beyond even the Salt Typhoon espionage campaign, in which the United States accused China last year of hacking AT&T and Verizon to intercept phone calls and text messages as they traveled from one person to another — including targeting the messages of both the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz campaigns. The most commonly identified spyware in such cases is designed by the Israeli company NSO Group, which is sanctioned by the United States and has long claimed its products cannot be used to hack phones with American numbers. An NSO Group spokesperson told NBC News it was not involved in the incidents iVerify’s research identified. American diplomats and embassy workers abroad have also been infected with NSO spyware, according to the Biden White House, but evidence that such technology had targeted a U.S. presidential campaign or other high-profile Americans in the United States has never been previously reported. “I think it illustrates that mobile compromise is real, not academic or hypothetical, and it’s happening here in the United States in a systematic way,” said Cole, iVerify’s CEO. He declined to specify the identities of the five people whose phones exhibited signs of having been targeted with spyware, except to say that they are all Americans who work in politics, media and artificial intelligence and that all would be of interest to a foreign intelligence service. The fact that sophisticated phone spyware is becoming the most reliable way to read a person’s otherwise secure messages makes it an obvious tactic for spy agencies, despite its technical difficulty, said Patrick Arvidson, a National Security Agency veteran who worked on mobile phone security at the agency, who viewed iVerify’s report before it was published. “I think that you’re going to see in the coming year, two years, three years, more and more of these kinds of mass-scale incidents,” he said.","summary":"One of the few companies to specialize in iPhone cybersecurity said that it has uncovered evidence of a potentially groundbreaking hacking campaign.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/harris-walz-campaign-may-targeted-iphone-hackers-cybersecurity-firm-sa-rcna199468","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250403-kamala-harris-se-241p-a7a770.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 14:16:17","author":"Kevin Collier","authors":["Kevin Collier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":328422246,"title":"Trump’s ‘Grand Legislation’ Struggling to Gain Traction in Senate","text":"The sprawling bill to enact President Trump’s “big, beautiful” agenda is losing momentum in the Senate in the face of blistering attacks from Elon Musk and outspoken opposition from conservatives.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) warned colleagues at a special conference meeting Wednesday afternoon that there are two likely “no” votes against the bill within the Senate GOP conference, which means just one more defection would derail the legislation, according to a senator who attended the meeting.\n\n“Crapo just said, ‘I think [there] are two of us who are pretty definite no’s,’ which means we can’t lose anybody else,” the source said.\n\nCrapo did not name names, but colleagues assumed he was talking about conservative Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).\n\nPaul says he will vote against the bill because it includes language to raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, extending the federal government’s borrowing authority past the 2026 midterm election.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has called for Senate GOP colleagues to scrap the House-passed bill and move a smaller measure that would focus on extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, securing the border and banking on the spending cuts identified by House committee chairs.\n\n“What I am rock-solid on is that I can’t accept this as the new normal,” he said of projections that the annual federal deficit will reach $2.2 trillion in 2025 and grow to $2.7 trillion by 2035.\n\n“We have our chance to reverse this,” he said of growing deficits. “I will not be responsible for continuing this.”\n\nPaul and Johnson are stepping up their criticism of the bill just as Musk is urging lawmakers to “KILL” the legislation, warning it will blow up the deficit.\n\n“Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,” Musk posted on his social platform X.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday that the 1,116-page bill passed by the House will add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.\n\nTrump has set a July 4 deadline for Congress to get the bill to his desk. But some GOP lawmakers say that’s looking increasingly unlikely because of a battle between Republican senators over cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the repeal of renewable energy tax incentives.\n\n“It won’t happen,” Johnson said.\n\n“The sooner President Trump recognizes the reality of the situation, the sooner we can work on a smaller version of the bill, do the things that have to be done: Extend current tax law, increase the debt ceiling, provide border funding,” he said.\n\nHe said the package could include spending cuts already passed by the House, such as a proposal to reduce federal subsidies to Medicaid by $698 billion and reduce SNAP spending by $267 billion.\n\nThe expectation that Paul and Johnson will vote against the bill could give more leverage to Republicans who want to make other changes, further delaying the effort. Those moderates include Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who are warning against Medicaid spending cuts that would affect benefits.\n\nSenate Republicans control 53 seats, which means they could only afford three defections and still pass the bill.\n\nCollins, Murkowski, Hawley and Moran say they are closely following the proposed reforms to Medicaid.\n\n“I am evaluating those provisions,” Collins said of the changes to Medicaid.\n\nShe said it’s difficult to fully assess the bill until the Senate parliamentarian weighs in on what policy changes can remain in the legislation and which need to be stripped out for it to qualify for fast-track consideration on the floor.\n\nShe said some of the most controversial provisions “may fall out.”\n\n“We still don’t know exactly what we’re looking at,” she said.\n\nCollins, who is up for reelection in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in the 2024 election, said she’s concerned about changes to the SNAP program that would require Maine to shoulder more of its costs.\n\nShe said the bill “switches a lot of the administrative costs” for SNAP “onto the state.”\n\nMurkowski said it will be “hard” to meet Trump’s deadline of passing the bill by July 4, noting that even after Republican senators reach a deal, many of the provisions will need to be vetted by the Senate parliamentarian.\n\nMoran said he’s “waiting for where we end up in the Ag [Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry] Committee” on reforms to SNAP.\n\n“What we do will be different from the House. I’m analyzing and participating in the discussion,” he said.\n\nHe said the negotiations over the nutrition program for low-income Americans are “taking time.”\n\nRepublicans at a special meeting Wednesday afternoon discussed expanding their search for savings to Medicaid, despite Trump’s warning to House lawmakers last month not to “f‑‑‑ with Medicaid.”\n\nAnd, notably, they raised the possibility of changes to Medicare.\n\n“There’s a legitimate debate about, ‘Can we do more with Medicaid? Are we doing too much with Medicaid? How much waste, fraud and abuse is there in Medicare? Why don’t we go after that?’ I think we should,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said after meeting with colleagues to discuss the bill.\n\nCramer said senators talked about also examining waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare to further reduce future deficits.\n\n“There was a lot of presentation and then debate, people throwing out other ideas, like, ‘What about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare?’” he said.\n\nBut tackling waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare would be a time-consuming task and likely generate a lot of anxiety among GOP senators who are balking at cuts to Medicaid that they worry could impact benefits.\n\n“Some people are making that case, other people are wringing their hands,” Cramer said of the internal debate.\n\nUpdated at 8:37 a.m. EDT","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe sprawling bill to enact President Trump’s “big, beautiful” agenda is losing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Grand Legislation&#8217; Struggling to Gain Traction in Senate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-grand-legislation-struggling-to-gain-traction-in-senate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Trump039s-039big-beautiful-bill039-losing-momentum-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 13:48:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":328418050,"title":"GOP Billionaire Ken Griffin Says Trump’s Tariffs Have ‘Taken Toll’ On Economy","text":"Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, one of Wall Street’s most prominent Republicans, expressed frustration about President Donald Trump’s “anti-growth” tariff agenda and its impact on U.S. economic growth at Thursday’s 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit.\n\nHedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin went in on Trump's policies Thursday.\nGetty Images\n\n“Unfortunately, the last few months have been characterized by a set of policy decisions that have rendered a great deal of uncertainty, have called into question American exceptionalism,” Griffin, founder of the Citadel hedge fund and market maker Citadel Securities, told Forbes editor-at-large and Iconoclast founder Maneet Ahuja.\n\nGriffin said his firm cut in half its estimates of 2025 growth since Trump took office, explaining the tariffs have “taken their toll already on our economy.”\n\n“The administration's attempts to use tariffs comes at a dear price to the U.S. economy and comes at a dear price to the U.S. consumer,” added Griffin.\n\n“Why are we aspiring to be the nation of the lowest cost and lowest paid workforce in the world? That makes no sense to me,” Griffin quipped about Trump’s push to onshore manufacturing of low-cost goods.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“Shame on the administration for criticizing [an] American CEO—who has done an extraordinary job of helping to have people get more for their dollar, more for the hours they work—for just being honest.” Griffin said Thursday about Trump’s criticism of Walmart after its CEO Doug McMillon warned of raising prices in response to higher import costs.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nA 1989 graduate of Harvard University, Griffin is worth $44.5 billion, according to our latest estimates.

The sweeping tax and spending cuts package, passed by House lawmakers in May and backed by President Donald Trump, addresses many of the president’s legislative priorities on cutting taxes, boosting border security, American energy, defense and production, and rolling back some of former President Joe Biden’s environmental regulations and tax credits. The White House has hailed the legislation as delivering \"the largest tax cut in American history.\" However, the bill has faced criticism from former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk, who claims it \"undermines\" all the work his DOGE team was doing. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" Musk wrote in a post to X on Tuesday. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER' The measure, if signed into law, would likely even further fuel the nation's massive budget deficit. The national debt currently sits at $36.2 trillion and counting, according to Fox Business' National Debt Tracker. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the bill would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion while adding $2.4 trillion to the national debt. Fox News Digital sought out Americans from communities that helped Trump win the 2024 election to see what they thought about Musk's criticism of the bill and if they'd support the legislation, even if it increased the national debt. In Warren County, Virginia, where Trump won by 37 points, a Trump supporter named John said he was supportive of the bill and wasn't worried about increasing the debt for a time because he believed that Trump's efforts to bring \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs back to America would bring in more revenue and pay down the debt. \"These people are not real smart,\" he said of the bill's critics. John said he likes Musk but disagrees with his take on the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" \"He shouldn't say anything about the bill because it's better than no bill,\" he added. ELON MUSK WARNS EXCESSIVE SPENDING WILL PLUNGE US 'INTO DEBT SLAVERY' In Cypress, Texas, a community outside Houston that gave Trump a double-digit advantage over former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, locals were supportive of the bill, though they did not agree with everything in it. \"It's probably not the perfect bill, but it's a start,\" a man named Chad said. \"It's a step in the right direction, getting us where we need to be.\" TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS Another man, Chris, said he was \"frustrated\" by the legislation because he supported a lot of the policies that were in it, but he also wanted to see DOGE preserved. Keith, also from Cypress, said Musk was entitled to his opinion, but he didn't think the bill should get scrapped just because it may have some \"bad things stuck in with the good.\" \"We have an imperfect system, but it's the best one in the world,\" he added. All three men were skeptical about economists' predictions that the bill would add trillions to the national debt. \"Economists are correct less frequently than the weatherman,\" Chris joked. SPEAKER JOHNSON SURPRISED BY MUSK'S CRITICISM OF 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL': HE'S 'FLAT WRONG' In South Florida, Trump supporter Franceen said she approved of the president's push to get the bill passed and was leery of media reports about the financial cost. \"They make up information and tell lies, anything to get at President Trump, so I tend to be very skeptical about things I hear and read in the mainstream media,\" she told Fox News Digital. Over in red Staten Island, New York, Trump supporters also came out to back the bill, saying any financial cost would be worth it in the end. \"I think the benefits of the Big Beautiful Bill will outweigh any negativity,\" one man said. \"Overall, everything he's going to be doing is going to take us to a better place,\" another Trump supporter said. Others dismissed Republicans and independents who've come out against it. \"He's the commander-in-chief,\" one man said. \"Where do you get off telling the commander-in-chief what to do?\" In Lapeer County, Michigan, where voters overwhelmingly supported Trump in the 2024 election, residents said they were concerned about the rising national debt, but were also wary of those criticizing it. \"I don't believe that's true,\" Joe said of economic predictions. \"I believe that's just to turn people against Trump.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The legislation is now headed to the Senate. Trump is urging the chamber to work as quickly as possible to get the bill to his desk before July 4. Those who spoke to Fox News Digital said lawmakers shouldn't worry about pressure from Trump or anyone else and should think of doing what's best for the American people. \"I think lawmakers should stop worrying about getting re-elected and do what's best for the people right now when they have the chance,\" Franceen said. \"This is probably the one opportunity for the country to get back on track and right itself from the egregious mess that's previously been created.

Their strategies on how to improve the state's economy, however, largely embraced the divergent views of their respective political parties as they discussed housing costs, high-speed rail, tariffs, climate change and homelessness on Wednesday evening at the first bipartisan event in the 2026 governor race to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"Californians are innovators. They are builders, they are designers, they are creators, and that is the reason that we have the fourth largest economy in the world,\" said former Rep. Katie Porter., a Democrat from Irvine \"But businesses and workers are being held back by the same thing. It is too expensive to do things here. It is too expensive to raise a family. It is too expensive to run a business.\" Conservative commentator Steve Hilton, a Republican, argued that state leaders need to end the \"stranglehold\" of unions, lawyers and climate change activists on California policy. \"I've been traveling this state. Everywhere I go, it's the same story, this heartbreaking word that I get from every business I meet, every family is in such a struggle in California,\" he said, with a raspy voice he explained immediately upon taking the stage was caused by a sore throat. The candidates spoke to about 800 people at a California Chamber of Commerce dinner at an 80-minute panel at the convention center in Sacramento. The chamber's decision on who to invite to the forum was based on which ones were leaders in public opinion surveys and fundraising. Making the cut were former Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, Hilton, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, Porter and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The sharpest exchange of the evening was between Kounalakis, a Democrat, and Bianco, a Republican. After the candidates were asked about President Trump's erratic tariff policies, Kounalakis cited her experience working for her father's reat estate company as she criticized Bianco for arguing for a wait-and-see approach about the president's undulating plans. \"You're not a businessman, you're a government employee,\" she said to Bianco. \"You've got a pension, you're going to do just fine. Small businesses are suffering from this, and it's only going to get worse, and it's driven, by the way, it is driven by Donald Trump's vindictiveness toward countries he doesn't like, countries he wants to annex, or states he doesn't like, people he doesn't like. This is hurting California, hurting our people, and it's only going to make things worse, until we can get him out of the White House.\" Bianco countered that Kounalakis and the other Democrat gubernatorial candidates are directly responsible for the economic woes facing Californians because they have an \"unquenchable thirst\" for money to fund their liberal agenda. \"I just feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. I have a billionaire telling me that my 32 years of public service is okay for my retirement,\" he said. \"It's taxes and regulations that are driving every single thing in California up. We pay the highest taxes, we pay the highest gas, we pay the highest housing, we pay the highest energy.\" The Democrats on stage, though largely agreeing about policy, sought to differentiate themselves. The sharpest divide was about whether to raise the minimum wage. On Monday, labor advocates in Los Angeles proposed raising it in Los Angeles County Atkins reflected most of her fellow Democrats' views, saying that while she wanted to see higher wages for workers, \"now is not the time.\" Villaraigosa said that while he believes in a higher minimum wage, \"we can't just keep raising the minimum wage.\" Kounalakis, though, said not increasing the minimum wage would be inhumane. \"I think we should be working for that number, yes I do,\" she said. \"You want to throw poor people under the bus.\" California's high cost of living is a pressing concern among the state's voters, and the issue is expected to play a major role in the 2026 governor's face. Nearly half feel worse off now compared with last year, and more than half felt less hopeful about their economic well-being, according to a poll released in May by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times. Nearly exactly a year before the gubernatorial primary next year, the event was the first time Democratic and Republican candidates have shared a stage. It was also the first time GOP candidates Bianco and Hilton have appeared together. Although the state’s leftward electoral tilt makes it challenging for a Republican to win the race – Californians last elected GOP politicians to statewide office in 2006 — Bianco and Hilton are battling to win one of the top two spots in next year’s primary election. The pair expressed similar views about broadly ending liberal policies in the state, such as stopping the state's high-speed rail project and reducing environmental restrictions such as the state's climate-change efforts that they argue have increased costs while making no meaningful impact on the consumption of fossil fuels. A crucial question is whether President Trump, who both Bianco and Hilton fully support, will eventually endorse one of the Republican candidates. The gubernatorial candidates, some of whom have been running more than a year, have largely focused on fundraising since entering the race. But the contest to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom is growing more public and heated, as seen at last weekend’s California Democratic Party convention. Several of the party's candidates scurried around the Anaheim convention center, trying to curry favor with the state's most liberal activists while also drawing contrasts with their rivals. But the Democratic field is partially frozen as former Vice President Kamala Harris weighs entering the race, a decision she is expected to make by the end of the summer. Harris' name did not come up during the forum. There were a handful of light moments. Porter expressed a common concern among the state's residents when they talk about the cost of living in the state. \"What really keeps me up at night, why I'm running for governor, is whether my children are going to be able to afford to live here, whether they're going to ever get off my couch and have their own home,\" she said.","summary":"Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates lamented California's affordability crisis.

Greg Casar (D-TX) said at a Center for American Progress event held Wednesday afternoon. “So we have to solve it.”\n\nThe event, titled “Representing Working-Class Voters,” featured Casar along with Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) discussing ways to “promote a policy agenda for today’s working class.” \n\nWhile Democrats have only gotten stronger with college-educated voters over the last decade, the majority of the electorate does not have a bachelor’s degree and has been slipping toward the GOP.\n\nIn 2024, that trend accelerated and included significant numbers of blue-collar black and Hispanic voters, especially men. A big question now is whether Democrats should adjust their policies to match these voters’ interests, or whether they simply message to them better.\n\nCasar said he heard from many people last year who voted Democratic in 2016 and 2020 but were planning to vote for Trump in 2024. When he asked why, they told him they knew Trump was a jerk but believed he would support their economic interests, while Democrats were focused on “other stuff.”\n\n“I said, ‘So, you mean like, gay stuff?,'” Casar recalled. “And they said, ‘Yea.'”\n\nHe’d tell them that while he supports the LGBT community, his top priority was making sure they had steady work and that their children could expect a brighter future. Still, Casar acknowledged the message was at times lost on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nToday, winning back those lost blue-collar voters is top of mind for Democrats across the country.\n\nAlong with the Center for American Progress, former Kamala Harris spokesman Ian Sams is spearheading an entity called The Working Class Project, which is hosting seminars with various voter groups to divine their political wants and needs.\n\nA recent dispatch, for example, noted that Democratic support among black men fell from 95% in 2012 to 79% last year, and all the way down to 75% for young black men, a historically low figure. \n\nIn swing state Wisconsin, black voter support for Trump more than doubled in some areas. Trump’s support stood at 21%, while Harris’s was 77%. That’s up from four years ago, when Trump won just 8% of black voters in the Badger State, according to an NBC News exit poll. \n\nSams, who was tasked with defending former President Joe Biden against special counsel Robert Hur’s damaging characterization of Biden’s decline, held focus groups with working-class black voters to get their insights.\n\n“It’s the pandering they do to us,” one respondent said. “When Biden was running, it’s ‘you ain’t black’ if you don’t vote for me. It’s Hillary and the hot sauce. We know, at the end of the day, you’re not really for us.”\n\nThe problem is so vast that Sams pitched his group as “the largest research effort to understanding why working class voters are trending away,” indicating there are many competitors in the space.\n\nKen Martin, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, staked his place in February with a memo saying the Democratic Party “always has been and always will be the party of the worker.”\n\n“I believe the canary in the coal mine for what happened on Nov. 5 was the recent showing that, for the first time in modern history, Americans now see the Republicans as the party of the working class and Democrats as the party of the elites,” Martin wrote. “As the Trump agenda fails our nation’s working communities, we have to take seriously the job of repairing and restoring the perceptions of our party and our brand.”\n\nMartin is the son of a teenage mother and says programs advocated by Democrats helped his family not only survive but get ahead. He’s one of many party leaders who wants to see Democrats center that working class message going forward.\n\nThat’s a big shift from the party’s message just months ago. Previous DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison advocated a strong identity politics focus not only before but even after the party’s losses in last November’s elections.\n\n“When I wake up in the morning, when I look in the mirror, when I step out the door, I can’t rub this off,” Harrison, who is black, said during a speech in December while waving his hand in front of his face. “This is who I am. This is how the world perceives me.”\n\nFollowing 2024 disaster, Democrats look to reclaim status as ‘party of the worker’\n\nBut Martin’s working class memo did not include the terms “diversity,” “equity,” “inclusion,” or “gender.” It mentioned identity only once, saying that labor unions “protect workers regardless of identity.”\n\nRepublicans say their gains are well-earned.\n\n“No,” CNN commentator Scott Jennings said when asked if Democrats will get blue-collar voters back.\n\n“You’ve got working-class voters in every racial demographic moving towards the Republican Party,” Jennings said, “because they think the Republican Party has strong leaders who are operating out of a position of common sense.”\n\nFormer GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich made a similar point in a recent Fox News appearance.\n\n“There is a very profound, underlying cultural civil war underway,” Gingrich said. “The American people increasingly are on the side of Donald Trump, because they believe he stands up against the very values that are at the heart of the Obama-Biden system.”\n\nGingrich suggested that Democrats are doubling down on failed figures like Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and fearmongering about GOP cuts to Medicaid because they “can’t win any honest debate.” Meanwhile, Trump is boosting blue-collar workers by reshoring manufacturing and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime.\n\nSome Democrats aren’t so sure. \n\nA Center for American Progress analysis released this week argues that both college and non-college voters prefer progressive economic policies such as higher minimum wages, stronger unions, higher taxes on the rich, better infrastructure, and a larger social safety net.\n\nYet the report acknowledged that 56% of working-class voters backed Trump last fall.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, an expert on political communication and campaigns at the University at Buffalo, said that changing party perceptions is hard to do once they’re formed. \n\n“Though the U.S. electorate isn’t generally credited with being overly ‘class conscious,’ it is probably a stronger force than most have recognized,” Neiheisel said. “I’m not sure how they might go about gaining back lost ground among working class voters.”\n\nHe also pointed to historic preferences that a majority of voters have toward Democratic priorities, but suggested execution has become an issue.\n\n“The electorate has long preferred Democrats’ positions on key issues,” he said, “but they seem to have grown wary about the party’s ability to bring about positive changes.”","summary":"A range of Democratic and progressive groups are all working on the same problem — how to win back working-class voters.

Susan Collins. A registered Democrat, he wanted to contribute to the Pine Tree State’s reputation as independent, he said, and he thought Collins embodied that. But he never voted for her again.\n\n Several Mainers who regularly gather to protest the senior senator in the York County town similarly said that at some point during Collins’ decades-long career, they too voted for her. For most, their view of her shifted during Donald Trump’s first presidency and has solidified during his second.\n\n But Collins won in 2020 without the support of people like Burgess. Last time Collins was up for reelection, her Democratic opponent Sara Gideon, then the Speaker of the Maine House, focused her campaign on whether Collins had “changed” since she was first elected to the Senate in 1996.\n\n ”She tried to make the election about Sen. Collins,” said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a moderate Republican representing Oxford, “and it didn’t work.”\n\n The November 2026 midterm election, when Collins will be up for re-election, will be something of a referendum on Trump, Bennett said. However, he added that it also matters who Collins’ opponent is. A year and a half out from Election Day, some have already started to make themselves known.\n\n Collins told Maine Morning Star she intends to run for reelection in 2026 and highlighted her record of delivering for Maine, primarily financially, as why she feels she remains the best person to represent the state.\n\n That focus of hers has previously helped unify a winning coalition of supporters. However, with the increasing demands for loyalty to Trump, slim Republican majorities in Congress and Collins’ race seen as an opportunity for Democrats to gain seats in the Senate, legal scholars, her critics on both sides of the aisle and polling signal the tightrope she has been walking is thinning.\n\nKnown opponents \n\n Collins will face at least two primary challengers: Carmen Calabrese of Kennebunkport and Daniel Smeriglio of Frenchville have filed to run as Republicans. Calabrese, who moved to Maine five years ago from Florida, is a driver for Walmart and former small business owner. Smeriglio runs the rightwing Voice of the People USA radio and activist group.\n\n An independent has also entered the race: Phillip Rench of Waterboro, who sits on the board for the Maine Space Corporation and owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. He was a former senior engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, though he said he has no association with Musk or the company now aside from stocks he was awarded as an employee.\n\n Two Democrats are also vying for Maine’s U.S. Senate seat so far.\n\nJordan Wood of Bristol, originally from Lewiston, spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., including as chief of staff to former Democratic U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California.\n\nNatasha Alcala of Madawaska is currently a fashion designer who moved to Maine from California a little over four years ago. She has degrees in international relations and criminal justice and is a U.S. Navy veteran. Alcala previously filed to run against U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2024 but withdrew before the primary.\n\nA focus on money, in many respects \n\n Last election cycle, Collins’ pitch to Mainers focused on her ability to secure federal funding for the state through her then-expected ascent to chair one of the chamber’s most powerful committees, a position she now holds and emphasized when asked why she believes she’s still best poised to represent Maine.\n\nSusan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?\n\n “By climbing that ladder in the last three years I have been able to secure more than a billion dollars for hundreds of projects in communities across our state,” Collins said, “That would not have happened without the seniority that I have.”\n\n Collins highlighted earmarks she’s secured for investments throughout each of Maine’s 16 counties as well as legislation that will impact Mainers more broadly, specifically co-authoring the Social Security Fairness Act, which was signed into law under former President Joe Biden earlier this year and restored full benefits for millions of public sector workers.\n\n Calabrese acknowledged that Collins’ role as top appropriator is a strength. “You can’t argue with that,” he said, “but I look at it as well, I thank you for bringing it, but you’re also spending my money. It’s my tax dollars.”\n\n And Calabrese thinks those tax dollars would go farther if Collins sided with Trump more often.\n\n “If you agree more with some of the stances that he has, maybe you’ll do better,” Calabrese said.\n\n Rench said he doesn’t think Collins’ continued pitch that she is best equipped to deliver financially for the state is a valid point.\n\n “What we need to do as a state is become less dependent on federal dollars,” he said.\n\n Rench said he would do this by building a stronger economic foundation for Maine families, including by addressing what he sees as “brain drain” in the state by overhauling the school system to have both college and trade school tracks. As someone who left the state after college to pursue opportunities in the space industry and then returned, he said he understands why young people leave and wants to change it.\n\n He is also proposing reinventing industries, such as creating a federal reserve of dimensional lumber, growing Maine’s food production and processing capabilities to serve the country and positioning Maine as a leader in the space industry.\n\n Wood previously helped lead End Citizens United, a political action committee working to reverse the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act, which deregulated restrictions on independent political spending by corporations and unions.\n\n Some of his top priorities will be anti-corruption reform and getting big money out of politics. He said he plans to lead by example with his own campaign by not taking any money from corporate PACs or lobbyists. He is also committed to not becoming a lobbyist after serving in office, refuses to engage in selling individual stocks and will prohibit his family members and those of his staff from lobbying his office for issues.\n\n In light of Trump slashing federal funding, Alcala said she would propose Maine partner with other states that have large gross domestic products, such as California, to ensure federal funding inconsistency doesn’t prevent people from having their basic needs met, such as by accessing low-income food assistance or making higher education free.\n\n “With our combined GDP, we can definitely make it so that we can help those that need the extra funding,” Alcala said.\n\n Smeriglio did not respond to interview requests.\n\nAccessibility \n\n Constituents who have reached out to Collins — including Cape Elizabeth resident Jerry Kaufman, an independent who said he emails Collins nearly every day, and Cokie Giles, a registered nurse at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor who regularly attends federal lobby days — argue they don’t feel heard.\n\n A common critique these two Mainers and others have is that Collins hasn’t hosted a town hall in at least 25 years.\n\n Collins deferred to her press secretary Blake Kernen when asked about constituent requests for town halls.\n\n “She prefers smaller group meetings or Zooms, rather than holding town halls where very few people get to speak, and the level of civility is often not that high,” the spokesperson said. “These forums were also difficult for people who were more reserved or less comfortable speaking in public.”\n\n Kernan also said Collins individually meets with thousands of Mainers every year in her office and during events across the state.\n\n These frustrations about accessibility are not unique to the Republican senator. Mainers have started to hold town halls to air their concerns, whether their current members of Congress agree to attend or not. In Maine, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is an outlier, as she held in-person town halls in early April, her first since 2017.\n\n In public events so far, some of Collins’ opponents have deliberately focused on personal appeals to voters to set themselves apart.\n\n Wood has held two town halls since he launched his campaign over a month ago. He said he will hold a town hall in each of Maine’s 16 counties during the race and, if elected, once a quarter. Wood also plans, if elected, to make his calendar public every month so his constituents can see who he is spending time with, he said.\n\n Rench opened up his observatory this spring to meet constituents and intends to travel around the state with his mobile telescope to continue one-on-one discussions.\n\n Alcala said she plans to start a YouTube channel to offer a more candid perspective into herself and her views for voters.\n\n Calabrese is starting with speaking at county Republican meetings and trying to engage with people at events such as upcoming county fairs.\n\nLessons learned from elections past\n\n Some of those challenging Collins are actively trying not to make the mistakes they think Gideon made last election cycle.\n\n Rench made a list of criticisms he heard about Gideon, down to her wearing clothing from Patagonia, an L.L. Bean rival. But the one that is guiding him most is focusing on what he could bring to the Senate, not what he thinks Collins lacks.\n\n “I don’t think people want to hear critiques of Collins,” Rench said. “They know who she is.”\n\n In Rench’s view, neither of the major parties adequately represent the working class, which is why he chose to run as an independent. In particular, he said, “I still think the Democratic Party is stuck in grief.”\n\n Nationally, Senate Democrats have previewed their campaign messaging, already targeting Collins in particular.\n\n The campaign arm of Senate Democrats began running digital ads in April against Collins and Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina that highlight the Trump administration’s plans to cut phone services for Social Security, though the agency has not followed through on that plan. In response to this, Collins highlighted her work passing the Social Security Fairness Act.\n\n Wood, who is running as a Democrat, is bringing lessons learned from the presidential election, particularly his party’s estrangement with working-class and young voters, into how he’s shaping his campaign.\n\n “It’s our responsibility as candidates and as a political party to prove to that voter that we are the party that they should see as the side fighting for them,” Wood said. “I will spend as much time as I can in these communities, telling them about my vision for the future and the policies that I’ll champion to make their lives better.”\n\n The average age of Congress has been a concern raised in elections past.\n\n Collins is 72 years old and will be running for her sixth term as senator. Wood, Wrench and Alcala emphasized that they want to offer a younger perspective to Congress than Collins.\n\n Calabrese is more so focused on the length of time Collins has held office. He said he’d only serve up to two terms if elected.\n\n “I think it’s time for some people — I mean we’re not Middle America but Middle America-thinking people — who understand what’s going on boots on the ground to get involved,” he said.\n\nCan Collins continue to tow the line? \n\n Both parties have grown more ideologically cohesive creating a political environment that’s less hospitable for lawmakers who straddle the center — now a rarity in Congress.\n\n Collins became a more reliable vote for her party during Trump’s last presidency compared to her track record before. In 2017, 87% of her votes were party-line. This was a shift, as Congressional Quarterly found between 1997 and 2016 that she voted with her party on party-line votes only 59% of the time.\n\n But last year, she bucked her party the most out of all senators. An analysis from Roll Call found Collins sided with Republicans 47.8% of the time in 2024, although largely because of her votes in favor of President Joe Biden’s nominees. Her level of bipartisanship fluctuates depending on the measure, but she remains a rarity in the Trump era, neither endorsing the president nor fully turning her back on him.\n\n “I don’t want to say she’s on the outside of her own party, but to a certain extent she is,” said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine.\n\n Fewer people are running, and succeeding, with bipartisan campaigns. However, the success of Collins, the only senator from her party representing a state Trump lost in 2024, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden in the second district — which also went for Trump — exemplifies that Maine is still holding onto that tradition, Brewer said. Bennett’s career as a prominent bipartisan voice is another example, Brewer added.\n\n Those running against Collins have taken more pointed stances, both for and against Trump.\n\n Wood said he spent the January 6 attack barricaded in Porter’s office, after which he co-founded democracyFIRST, a pro-democracy organization dedicated to combating growing threats to the free and fair elections.\n\n “I think [Collins] had ample opportunity to be courageous to stand up to Donald Trump and her own party and she has failed to do so,” Wood said.\n\n Calling Trump a “wanna-be dictator, authoritarian that is trying to centralize all power and authority in himself,” he said if Democrats are able to secure a Senate majority in the 2026 election that will provide a better opportunity to oppose the president during the remaining two years of his term.\n\nAs Trump slashes federal spending, Collins’ promise to deliver for Maine is tested\n\n Alcala is also pitching herself as a candidate who will stand up to Trump. “We’re in a coup d’etat by Trump and Elon Musk,” she said. “The fact that Trump is taking money away from Mainers, whether they’re Republican, liberal, what have you, the fact that he’s doing that means that we can’t rely on the current government that we have.”\n\n On the other hand, Calabrese said if elected he would help codify many of Trump’s executive orders into law. He commended Trump’s approach to immigration policy. “All this illegal immigration that’s one thing that I totally agree with him on,” he said.\n\n He also supports Trump’s push to make the U.S. a global leader in Artificial Intelligence and the cuts made by his Department of Government Efficacy.\n\n Calabrese said, “the President is not a king,” noting that he’d try to tow the line between helping the president follow through with his plans while still respecting the balance of power.\n\n However, Calabrese said, “If he needs to take his executive orders to the Supreme Court, well that’s the checks and balances.”\n\n When it comes to the Supreme Court, Rench was also motivated to run because of Collins’ pivotal vote that helped seat Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n “I have a nine year old daughter and after Sen. Collins, in my opinion, enabled the reversal of Roe vs. Wade,” Rench said, “I no longer trust her with my daughter’s future.”\n\n Collins voted for Kavanaugh after she said he gave her private assurances he wasn’t a threat to the landmark abortion ruling that he later voted to overturn.\n\n Early surveys show the senator with much lower favorability than ever before.\n\n A poll from Morning Consult found that since last quarter, Collins’ net approval declined by 12 percentage points — more than that of any other senator. According to the poll, 51% of Maine voters disapprove of Collins, down from 47% at the end of last year.\n\n Another poll commissioned by a top Democratic super PAC shows Collins is being pinched on both sides.\n\n “A big part of Collins’ problem is that when it comes to Trump her approach is just antagonizing everyone,” the pollster wrote in a memo.\n\n The survey of 569 registered Maine voters showed 81% of voters who supported Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris think the senator votes with Trump too often and 73% of Trump voters think she doesn’t vote with Trump often enough. Only 10% think she’s striking the right balance.\n\n But on Monday, Pan Atlantic Research released its latest independent Omnibus Poll capturing the opinions of 840 likely voters and found close to an even split between those who find Collins favorable or unfavorable, similar to its polling in September.\n\n “A year and a half out from Election Day, it’s far too early to poll right now,” Kernan, Collins’ spokesperson, said.\n\n Pollsters have gotten Collins wrong before. The day before the election in 2020, Maine Senate polls showed Collins’ Democratic opponent Gideon ahead by six points. Collins went on to win by almost 9%.\n\n Some speculate she appealed to undecided voters in the end and that pollsters underestimated that Mainers would split tickets.\n\n Wood noted that Collins voted against Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett right before the 2020 election.\n\n “It was a reminder that she has a tendency to be independent sometimes and there was a hope that she could be a catalyst in some way for a post-Trump Republican Party, that was the Republican Party they grew up with,” Wood said of voters. “That did not come to fruition. I think that voters now have a much clearer understanding of the threat in front of us.”\n\n But beyond this race, pollsters across the country failed in 2020, as well as in 2016, to accurately capture the zeitgeist, particularly for working class voters in rural areas.\n\n When it comes to Collins’ continued independent, deliver-for-Maine pitch, Brewer said, “I think it’s going to be harder for her to do that, to run that kind of campaign. It doesn’t mean that she can’t pull it off.”\n\nMaine Morning Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

But he never voted for her again.\n\n\n\n\n\tSeveral Mainers who regularly gather to protest the senior senator in the York County town similarly said that at some point during Collins’ decades-long career, they too voted for her.

For example, according to Pew Research Center, about 71 percent of Hispanic voters supported Barack Obama in 2012, and 66 percent backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, 63 percent chose Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.In 2024, however, Trump made significant gains. His support among Hispanic voters rose to 43 percent—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest level for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked. Meanwhile, 55 percent supported Kamala Harris, narrowing the Democratic advantage.Yet recent polling suggests Trump's momentum is fading. Newsweek's analysis of major surveys since April shows his approval among Hispanic and Latino voters has dropped to 40 percent, with 56 percent disapproving—down from March averages of 43 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. YouGov's data mirrors this trend, showing Trump's net approval plummeting from -12 in January to -32 in May.While a few surveys show scattered signs of support, the overwhelming majority of polls conducted from late March to mid-May show Trump underperforming with Hispanic and Latino voters.Echelon Insights, which polled from May 8 to May 12, found Trump's approval at 32 percent and disapproval at 67 percent, marking a sharp drop from his earlier approval rating of 42 percent and disapproval of 56 percent.The Marist/NPR/PBS poll from late April also recorded a similar downward trend, with Trump's approval slipping from 44 percent to 32 percent.Fox News polling from mid-April showed Trump's approval dipping slightly from 44 percent to 41 percent, while McLaughlin found a more substantial drop, from 44 percent to 36 percent. Pew Research Center also reported a stark fall in Trump's favorability, with approval plummeting from 35 percent to 27 percent, and disapproval rising from 62 percent to 72 percent.But some other polls have shown Trump's approval rating increasing among Hispanic voters. For instance, the Civiqs poll conducted from May 17 to May 20 shows a notably higher approval rating of 57 percent among Hispanics, an increase from 42 percent earlier in the year.Likewise, Insider Advantage/Trafalgar's mid-May poll reports a 59 percent approval rating, up from 39 percent in April. However, these results contrast with the broader majority of polling data, which has shown that Trump's ratings remain below 40 percent, while disapproval consistently climbs above 50 or even 60 percent.This decline isn't a sudden collapse but a slow erosion of trust and confidence—particularly among a demographic Trump courted heavily in 2024. Experts point to dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy as a key driver of this shift.It comes after Trump introduced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. The policy move rattled markets, prompting a sharp sell-off before an eventual recovery.It also saw Trump's overall approval ratings take a hit. And his approval marks among Hispanic voters have not been exempt.The latest YouGov/Economist poll shows that only 32 percent of Hispanic voters approve of Trump's performance on the economy, which is down from 40 percent at the end of March, before he introduced the tariffs. And on the issue of inflation, only 28 percent of Hispanic voters said they approve of Trump's performance, down from 39 percent.Similarly, Fox News shows that Trump's approval rating on the economy among Hispanic voters is down to 37 percent, from 43 percent in March. On inflation, Trump's approval rating was down 10 percentage points, to 30. Meanwhile, 80 percent of Hispanics polled said they think it is extremely or very likely that the U.S. economy will plunge into recession this year.Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative, told Newsweek that \"Latino voters are frustrated that their economic priorities are being ignored and that a key promise made by President Trump during the election is not being kept.\" As a result, \"Sixty percent of Latino voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and 70 percent hold President Trump and his administration responsible,\" she said, citing an April UnidosUS poll.\n\nYouGov/Economist\n\nEchelon Insights\n\nApril 25-May 2\n\nInsider Advantage/Trafalgar\n\nApril 1-April 30\n\nLord Ashcroft Politics\n\nNavigator Research\n\nEmerson College\nApril 25-28\n\nYouGov/Yahoo\n\nDecision Desk/News Nation\nApril 23-27\n\nApril 23-25\n\nApril 21-24\n\nMarist/NPR/PBS\nApril 21-23\n\nYouGov/Times\nApril 21-23\n\nIpsos/ABC/Post\nApril 18-22\n\nApril 18-21\n\nApril 16-19\n\nMarch 15-April 18\n\nApril 10-14\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts/YouGov\n\nJanet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS, emphasized that economic discontent played a significant role in Trump's earlier gains but is now undermining his support. \"Over half of Hispanic voters feel the economy is worse now than a year ago, and nearly as many believe it will be worse a year from now,\" she said. \"Economic discontent was the most potent driver of increased Latino support for Trump in 2024.\"Martínez De Castro added, \"For many Latinos, inflation, wages, and housing affordability remain top concerns. Sixty percent believe the President and Republicans are not focusing enough on lowering prices, and over half think the economy has worsened and will continue to decline under Trump's policies. The president owns the economy now, and Hispanic voters are not seeing the quick turnaround he promised.\"Immigration has further dented Trump's standing among Hispanic voters. His aggressive policies, including expanded ICE enforcement and National Guard involvement, have targeted not just criminals but also long-residing undocumented immigrants without criminal records.From his inauguration on January 20 through February, over 40 percent of deportees had no criminal history. Pew Research Center polling shows that only about one-third of Americans support mass deportations, with most preferring to prioritize violent criminals and showing far less support for deporting those with family ties or brought to the U.S. as children.This sentiment is also shared by Hispanic voters, Martínez De Castro said. She warned: \"Eight in ten Hispanic voters support deporting dangerous criminals, but President Trump and congressional Republicans should not target long-residing undocumented immigrants without criminal records. Latino voters want policies that are firm, fair, and free of cruelty, but that is not what they are witnessing in their communities.\"Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of the Hispanic Federation, echoed these concerns, saying Trump's policies have \"vilified our communities and disregarded people's rights.\" He highlighted the rise in hate crimes, family separations, and the targeting of law-abiding immigrants as consequences of the administration's approach.\"Many immigrants who worked hard to secure legal protections, such as TPS and work permits, are having those protections stripped away,\" he said.Recent polls have shown a broader trend of voters becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Trump's performance on the economy and immigration, which were previously his strongest. His \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2 rattled markets, prompting a sharp sell-off before an eventual recovery. But public sentiment did not rebound as quickly as the Dow. Polls throughout April showed sliding approval ratings.The president has also seen kinks in the rollout of his aggressive immigration agenda, which has attracted legal scrutiny. One high-profile case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported from Maryland in what the Department of Justice called an \"administrative error.\" The Trump administration labeled Garcia a member of MS-13, now designated a terrorist group, but his family and lawyers deny any connection.Trump's mass deportation plan seeks to remove millions of undocumented immigrants through expanded ICE enforcement and National Guard involvement, focusing not only on criminals but also on many without criminal records. Early in his presidency, ICE arrested over 32,000 people, nearly half with no criminal history, and by February, over 40 percent of deportees had no criminal record. Despite this aggressive approach, public support is limited.An April Pew Research Center poll found only about one-third of Americans support deporting all undocumented immigrants, with most favoring deportation primarily for violent criminals and much less support for deporting those with family ties or who came to the U.S. as children.And such sentiment also exists among Hispanic voters. Martínez De Castro highlighted that while economic concerns helped Trump gain Hispanic support in 2024, the optimism has quickly faded. \"Sixty percent of Latino voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and 70 percent of them hold President Trump and his administration responsible,\" she told Newsweek, citing an April UnidosUS poll.\"Latino voters are frustrated that their economic priorities are being ignored and that a key promise made by President Trump during the election is not being kept. Economic discontent was the most potent driver in the 2024 election, helping President Trump increase support among Latinos. But over half of Hispanic voters feel the economy is worse now than a year ago and nearly as many believe it will be worse a year from now,\" Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS, said at the time.Martínez De Castro added that for many Latinos, economic issues like inflation, wages and housing affordability remain top priorities, yet \"60 percent believe the President and Republicans are not focusing enough on lowering prices,\" and over half think the economy has worsened and will continue to decline under Trump's policies. Martínez De Castro noted bluntly, \"The president owns the economy now, and Hispanic voters are not seeing the quick turnaround the President promised.\"Miranda also criticized the administration for \"actively dismantling the asylum system for some of the most vulnerable and deserving applicants escaping violence and persecution from Latin America,\" while simultaneously easing restrictions for others.He warned that \"Such action is only serving to alienate the Latino community from the Trump administration and driving people who want to care for loved ones into the shadows.\"","summary":"The 2024 election saw Trump make substantial gains among the Hispanic community.

I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”\n\nThe Justice Department under Democratic and Republican administrations has recognized the use of an autopen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades, Trump presented no evidence that Biden was unaware of the actions taken in his name, and the president’s absolute pardon power is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,” Trump wrote in a memo. “The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.”\n\nTrump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington to handle the investigation.\n\nIt’s unclear how far Trump will push this effort, which would face certain legal challenges. But it reflects his fixation on Biden, who defeated him in 2020, an election that Trump never conceded and continues to falsely claim was rigged against him.\n\nTrump frequently suggests that Biden was wrong to use an autopen, a mechanical device that replicates a person’s authentic signature. Although they’ve been used in the White House for decades, Trump claims that Biden’s aides were usurping presidential authority.\n\nBiden issued pardons for his two brothers and his sister shortly before leaving office, hoping to shield them from potential prosecution under Trump, who had promised retribution during last year’s campaign. Other pardon recipients included members of a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump often suggests that his political opponents should be investigated, and he has directed the Justice Department to look into people who have angered him over the years. They include Chris Krebs, a former cybersecurity official who disputed Trump’s claims of a stolen election in 2020, and Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who wrote an anonymous op-ed sharply critical of the president in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, a Republican, requested transcribed interviews with five Biden aides, alleging they had participated in a “cover-up” that amounted to “one of the greatest scandals in our nation’s history.”\n\n“These five former senior advisors were eyewitnesses to President Biden’s condition and operations within the Biden White House,” Comer said in a statement. “They must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.”\n\nInterviews were requested with White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti, a former counselor to the president.\n\nComer reiterated his call for Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, and former senior White House aides Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, Ashley Williams and Neera Tanden to appear before the committee. He warned subpoenas would be issued this week if they refuse to schedule voluntary interviews.\n\n“I think that people will start coming in the next two weeks,” Comer told reporters. He added that the committee would release a report with its findings, “and we’ll release the transcribed interviews, so it’ll be very transparent.”\n\nDemocrats have dismissed the effort as a distraction.\n\n“Chairman Comer had his big shot in the last Congress to impeach Joe Biden and it was, of course, a spectacular flop,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who served as the ranking member on the oversight committee in the previous Congress. “And now he’s just living off of a spent dream. It’s over. And he should give up the whole thing.”\n\nRepublicans on the committee are eager to pursue the investigation.\n\n“The American people didn’t elect a bureaucracy to run the country,” said Rep.

He was replaced on the ticket by Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Trump.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Smith explained how he would tackle global conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war as he chose the U.S presidency over a hypothetical role on the New York Knicks staff.On ESPN’s First Take, Stephen A. said he wouldn't want to work for Knicks owner Jim Dolan, instead chosing the country's presidency. He also touched on how he could be a peacemaker across the world.“I would have to work for Dolan, wouldn’t I? That’s tough. Because I have to work for him, I really have no power other than the power granted to me by him. If I am the commander-in-chief, the president of the United States, the man the American people elected to guide us to the future, I would have to say the presidency (over the Knicks),” Smith said before discussing his potential global policy.\"I know that Russia's ultimate quest is to recapture Europe, and I don't want that to happen. Therefore I would help out Ukraine,\" Stephen A. added.Stephen A. has been a vocal, diehard fan of the Knicks, who let go off coach Tim Thibodeau on Tuesday despite taking the team to the Eastern Conference finals and within two wins off their first NBA Finals.The firing was reportedly because of the ownership’s desire to have a fresh voice in the locker room. New York has been bannered by a core of Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby.What Stephen A. Smith said about running for presidencyIt isn't the first time Stephen A. has thrown his name in the U.S presidency. In April, he revealed in an interview with ABC news that he had been asked about his desire to be the president in the next election.“I have no choice,” he said about running for president. “I've had elected officials, and I'm not going to give their names, elected officials coming up to me. I've had folks who are pundits come up to me. I've had folks that got a lot of money, billionaires and others that have talked to me about exploratory committees and things of that nature.\"In the same interview, he criticized current U.S president Donald Trump’s economic policies and how his tariffs have impacted the world. However, he has also become a critic of the Democratic Party in recent months after its candidate Kamala Harris lost in the past elections.For now, Stephen A. is expected to continue his work as a sports analyst, as the next election is in 2028.","summary":"Renowned ESPN analyst Stephen A.

Mr Trump had cued up the ban in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March.\n\nMr Trump has cited a range of justifications for the bans, including national security and concerns that visitors from those countries are overstaying their visas.\n\nBut advocates and experts have said that blanket travel bans discriminate against groups of people based on ethnicity alone. They will likely result — as the travels bans did during Mr Trump’s first term — in the separation of families. The bans on travel from Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela could be especially impactful in US communities with huge immigrant populations from those countries.\n\n“This discriminatory policy, which limits legal immigration, not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and communities that rely on the contributions of people who come to America from this wide range of countries,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative of Washington.\n\nThe decision to ban travel from these countries comes amid a wave of hardline immigration policies that Mr Trump has issued, including the blocking of asylum claims at the southern border and cancelling temporary protected status for immigrants from a number of countries facing deep humanitarian crises. \n\nMr Trump has also signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University and ordered US consulates to conduct social media screening of every visa applicant seeking to travel to the university.\n\nIn a video message released on social media, Mr Trump said he was making good on a promise to act following the recent attack at a Boulder, Colorado, event showing support for Israeli hostages. The attack by an Egyptian national “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” he said.\n\nMr Trump added that the list was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made” and that “likewise, new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world”.\n\nHaving instituted a travel ban on Muslim countries early in his first term, Mr Trump trailed his plans for a new ban during his election campaign against Kamala Harris last year.\n\n“I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,” Mr Trump said in September. “Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world. We’re not taking them from infested countries.”\n\nHe was referring to the ban he imposed after taking office in January 2017, leading to chaos at airports as protesters and civil rights attorneys rushed to help affected travelers.\n\nMr Trump said the ban was needed to combat terrorist threats. It was blocked by federal courts on civil liberties grounds but the US supreme court, to which Mr Trump would eventually appoint three hardline rightwing justices, allowed the ban to stand.\n\nThe supreme court said Mr Trump’s ban did not target Muslims — despite the fact it originally targeted travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, Muslim-majority countries. According to the court, the ban fell within the remit of a president’s national security powers. North Korea and Venezuela were also included.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said then: “The Muslim ban’s bigotry should have been as clear to the supreme court as it is to the Muslims demonized by it. Apparently, everyone but the supreme court can see the decision for what it is: an expression of animosity.” \n\nIn 2020, shortly before the Covid pandemic drastically reduced world travel, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Tanzania and Sudan were added to the ban.\n\nIn 2021, that travel ban was among measures Joe Biden ended within hours of being sworn in as Mr Trump’s White House successor.\n\n The Guardian","summary":"Nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan ‘fully’ restricted as those of seven other countries partially restricted","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41645560.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9298/4649245_5_seoimage1x1_64c1951b982c4ddc8ee9aa86e8239683.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-05 06:03:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Maanvi Singh And Martin Pengelly","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Maanvi Singh And Martin Pengelly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.072},{"id":328271760,"title":"Yulissa Escobar said the N-word; Trump and the real reason she got booted from Love Island season 7","text":"Yulissa Escobar, a 27-year-old contestant from Miami, has departed Season 7 of Love Island USA following the resurfacing of controversial content from her past.

According to Politico, former colleagues are furious and have denounced KJP as a grifter:\n\nThe attention-grabbing ploy lit up Democratic and Biden alumni texting groups and reignited frustrations that burned for years about Jean-Pierre, according to seven former Biden administration officials granted anonymity to describe private conversations.\n\nOne former official recalled that Jean-Pierre had joked about becoming an independent even while on the job in the Biden White House, an off-key comment for someone ostensibly serving as a major messenger for the Democratic Party. Another former official said that Jean-Pierre had begun working during the Biden administration with a New York-based publicist and had copied that person on official emails before some of Jean-Pierre’s White House colleagues intervened.\n\nA former colleague of Jean-Pierre was reported as saying, “Everyone thinks this is a grift.” Other colleagues expressed confusion as to why she would paint Biden as a victim while saying she left the Democratic Party over a “broken” White House.\n\n“She made a joke about being an independent last year and now it’s a book. All ideas are monetary — even the dumb ones,” another former staffer was quoted as saying.\n\nDemocrat strategist Caitlin Legacki argued that Biden needed to drop out and that Democrats would have suffered a worse defeat if he stayed on the ticket.\n\n“Kamala Harris and the entire Biden/Harris campaign did hero’s work to avoid losing 400 electoral votes and giving Republicans a supermajority in Congress, which is what would have happened if he stayed on the ticket,” she said. “It’s more productive to focus on that, and thank Biden for doing the responsible thing by stepping aside, than it is to pretend this was an unwarranted act of betrayal.”\n\nAnother former Democrat colleague who worked with the press secretary prior to her White House tenure called her book “the most grift-y thing I’ve seen in a long time, and that’s saying something in Washington.”\n\n“SHE was the public face telling us all that this White House was on track and that Biden was amazing. And now she doesn’t even want to be a Democrat????” one former official said in a group text. “She’s making herself the middle ground here when Republicans hate her. She’s not in any position to be a connector of our two party system and assuming she could be is just ego.”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.
