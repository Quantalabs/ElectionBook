According to figures shared first with Fox News Digital on Thursday, the RNC brought in $14.7 million in October, bringing its fundraising total so far this cycle to $146 million. And the RNC reported $91 million cash-on-hand as of the end of October. That's a massive advantage over the $18.2 million the rival Democratic National Committee (DNC) held in its coffers at the end of last month, according to public filings. And the DNC's $7.5 million in fundraising last month was roughly half of the RNC's haul. THE TRUE COST OF THE 2025 ELECTIONS \"Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Vice President Vance as our Finance Chair, the RNC is building a powerful war chest for the 2026 midterms,\" RNC chair Joe Gruters said in a statement. And Gruters emphasized that \"Vice President Vance has been a driving force for our fundraising efforts, and we’re entering 2026 with serious momentum and the funding we need to defend our Republican majorities in Congress.\" WHAT THE NEWLY ELECTED RNC CHAIR TOLD FOX NEWS With Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, the party has enjoyed a financial advantage over the Democrats this year, as the minority party has faced sluggish fundraising among top-dollar donors and the grassroots still frustrated with last year's election setbacks. The party is still crawling out of debt — it still owes roughly $15 million — in the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris' massively expensive 2024 White House campaign. And $15 million of the DNC's cash-on-hand came from a loan the party committee took out, which was first reported by the New York Times. The DNC confirmed to Fox News Digital that they opened a $20 million line of credit, tapping $15 million in recent months for investments in the 2025 elections earlier this month, as well as long-term party infrastructure, and other priorities. SURVEY SAYS: ISSUE THAT HELPED TRUMP AND GOP IN 2024 HURTS THEM IN 2025 The loan helped boost DNC get-out-the-vote efforts in the two races for governor this year, in New Jersey and Virginia. The loan appeared to pay off, as Democrats won both of those elections by double digits, and also scored big wins in ballot box showdowns in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and left-leaning New York City and California. \"We can't win elections or fight back against Trump if the DNC downsizes operations like it often does after a presidential cycle. I made a bet that investing early would build power, rack up wins, and rally supporters back to the table. That bet is paying off,\" DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The DNC also highlights that it's raised more money under Martin, who was elected in February, than any chair in party history nine months into their tenure. And the party also highlights their grassroots fundraising pace is far ahead of the 2017 and 2019 cycles, the previous election periods when Democrats didn't control the White House.","summary":"RNC raises $14.7 million in October, building massive $91 million war chest for 2026 midterms as Republicans prepare to defend House and Senate majorities.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-fueled-trump-vance-tops-rival-dnc-october-fundraising-race","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/vance-and-trump-in-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 00:25:09","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.015},{"id":381060530,"title":"US Buries Its 46th Vice President: Trump Not Invited","text":"The United States on Thursday buried its 46th vice president, a man who represented the old guard of the Republican Party, and feuded publicly with President Donald Trump over what he saw as Trump’s disdain for the Constitution, respect for democratic values and the rule of law.\n\nRichard Cheney served as VP under then-President George W Bush from 2001 to 2009, and previously held various posts including Secretary of Defense and Chief of Staff under George H.W. Bush, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, now all deceased. He had a ten-year tenure in the House of Representatives, and in all, he served continuously in Washington in some capacity from 1969 to 2009.\n\nWhile a Republican icon of old, he broke in dramatic fashion with the new, populist, isolationist MAGA version of the party after Trump was defeated in 2020 and refused to accept the results, fomenting an insurrection on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 2021.\n\nCheney’s daughter Liz, then the Chair of the House Republican Conference and holding the same Wyoming district seat her father had held for 10 years, called out Trump for eroding American democratic values in that riot, voted for his second impeachment, but paid a heavy political price for it. Trump directed vast campaign funds to her opponent for re-election in 2022 and she was defeated.\n\nCheney endorsed Trump’s opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, in the 2024 elections. In a 2022 political TV ad, he said: “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said, calling him a “coward.”\n\n“A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know it.”\n\nNeither Trump nor Vice President J.D. Vance were invited to the funeral.\n\nIn the National Cathedral in Washington, along with her family members and former president Bush, Liz Cheney remarked in her eulogy that her father “knew that bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans” and said he always “put country over party.”\n\nAlso in attendance were Harris, former President Joe Biden, and a host of other Democrats.\n\nThe gruff-talking Cheney was remembered as one of the last surviving Cold Warriors, facing down Soviet expansionism and what his breed deemed as a constant Communist threat. Liz Cheney remained a staunch supporter of Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky throughout Moscow’s unprovoked invasion.","summary":"The funeral for Dick Cheney sees leaders from both parties remembering one of the last Cold Warriors, and reminisce on a different breed of statesman and Republican leader","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/64655","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/11/21/2386ddbd9c18dbe45219013c5b255c09.jpeg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 00:23:31","author":"John Moretti","authors":["John Moretti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":0.051},{"id":381059564,"title":"Donald Trump and JD Vance not invited to Dick Cheney&#039;s funeral service in DC","text":"They gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday — former presidents, vice presidents, sworn political foes and newfound friends — in a show of respect and remembrance for Dick Cheney, the consequential and polarizing vice president who became an acidic scold of President Donald Trump.Trump, who has been publicly silent about Cheney’s death Nov. 3, was not invited to the memorial service.Two ex-presidents came: Republican George W. Bush, who eulogized the man who served him as vice president, and Democrat Joe Biden, who once called Cheney “the most dangerous vice president we’ve had probably in American history” but now honors his commitment to his family and to his values.“Solid and rare and reliable,” Bush said at the service of his vice president, praising a man whose “talent and restraint” exceeded his ego. “Smart and polished, without airs.”.preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Bush and others noted the understated demeanor of a man who nevertheless wielded great influence in government. “Above all,” Bush said, “I wanted someone with the ability to step into the presidency without getting distracted by the ambition to seek it.”Among the eulogists, Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter, only obliquely addressed what amounted to a father-daughter feud with the president — a man her dad had called a “coward” for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.She spoke of her father’s conviction that when confronted with a choice between defending the country and a political party, the country must come first. “Bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans,” she said.Liz Cheney is a former high-ranking House member whose Republican political career was shredded by a MAGA movement angered by her investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Thursday, she chose not to speak directly of Trump.She spoke of seeing clouds in the shape of angels just before her father died.A Who’s Who of Washington, minus you know whoMoments before the service began, figures of recent but now receded power mingled: Bush and Biden and their wives sitting in a row together, former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Mike Pence chatting side by side in their pew with Al Gore and Dan Quayle together behind them.Biden greeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Senate leader, and his wife, former labor and transportation secretary Elaine Chao. Behind them sat Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who spent time talking with another former House speaker, Republican John Boehner. All gathered among the soaring interior columns of the grand cathedral known as “a spiritual home for the nation.”Others delivering tributes at Thursday’s funeral were Cheney’s longtime cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner; former NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, who was Cheney’s spokesman at the Pentagon; and several of the former vice president’s grandchildren.“I’m happy to report that I haven’t given many eulogies,” Reiner said in his remarks. “Nobody wants a doctor who is great at funerals.”Reiner recalled doctors telling Cheney decades ago, after the first of multiple heart attacks, that he should abandon his political ambitions then. Yet he kept winning elections as a Wyoming congressman for years after that.Cheney, he said, was always the “calmest person in the room.”Cheney had lived with heart disease for decades and, after the Bush administration, with a heart transplant. He died at age 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, on stage at another event in the morning, was asked about Cheney and said: “Obviously there’s some political disagreements there but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”Vance was also not invited to the funeral, according to a person familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The White House lowered its flags to half-staff after Cheney’s death, as it said the law calls for, but Trump did not issue the presidential proclamation that often accompanies the death of notable figures, nor has he commented publicly on his passing.The deeply conservative Cheney’s influence in the Bush administration was legendary and, to his critics, tragic.He advocated for the U.S. invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to be faulty intelligence and consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush credited him with helping to keep the country safe and stable in a perilous time.Bad blood between the Cheneys and TrumpAfter the 2020 election won by Biden, Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the Democratic-led special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She accused Trump of summoning the violent mob and plunging the nation into “a moment of maximum danger.”For that, she was stripped of her Republican leadership position and ultimately defeated in a 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming. In a campaign TV ad made for his daughter, Dick Cheney branded Trump a “coward” who “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.”Last year, it did not sit well with Trump when Cheney said he would vote for the Democrat, Harris, in the presidential election.Trump told Arab and Muslim voters that Dick Cheney’s support for Harris should give them pause, because he “killed more Arabs than any human being on Earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”- EndsPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Nov 21, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/donald-trump-and-jd-vance-not-invited-to-dick-cheneys-funeral-service-in-dc-glbs-2823493-2025-11-21","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/dick-cheney-041331404-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=FYcZwOgWJ9teVlTAXQM6RbEJOnx1nyXH?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 00:22:41","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.344},{"id":381062034,"title":"Thoughts on Dick Cheney's Rehabilitation by Democrats","text":"I don't want to get into an argument about Dick Cheney's legacy. \n\nFor much of my career, I admired the man as a steely, clear-eyed warrior for Democracy, although, as you can imagine, soured on him long before he became a hero to the left. \n\nRelitigating the Iraq war right now is not my purpose, and I have no desire to trash a guy whose virtues and faults were outsized. He has passed on, and there will be plenty of time to consider his legacy without trashing the man at the moment he faces his Maker. \n\nSo when I share this Glenn Greenwald tweet, it isn't to trash Cheney, but rather the liberals who flocked to his side as soon as he started trashing Trump. \n\nBadge of honor not to be invited at the funeral of one of the 9/11 masterminds:https://t.co/Xd1Nc1sER3“Trump and Vance not invited to Dick Cheney’s funeral, but all four living former vice presidents attending” pic.twitter.com/bSf3hcS9l6— Abraham van Helsing (@Abraham02782754) November 20, 2025\n\nFor liberals, Dick Cheney was Darth Vader for most of his career, and they didn't flock to Cheney because he changed his mind about anything or expressed regrets for the very decisions for which they reviled him, or at least claimed to revile him. Cheney remained the same Darth Vader whom they called a minion of Satan; in fact, as far as I can tell the only thing he agreed with them on was Trump. \n\nAnthony Fauci, Rachel Maddow and James Carville are sitting together at Dick Cheney’s funeral. pic.twitter.com/MOdh99AV0H— Dylan Wells (@dylanewells) November 20, 2025\n\nThat tells you everything you need to know about Democrats' supposed moral concerns about Dick and Liz Cheney back when they were said to be evil. They didn't care a whit about war and peace; they trashed them because they found it convenient to do so. The Cheneys went from war criminals to close allies for one reason: political gain. \n\n📸 What a moment at the Cheney funeral. A light hearted exchange between old political rivals George W.

Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) November 20, 2025\n\nIt's hard to even know how many Democratic Party leaders are genuinely outraged by Trump, for all the storm and strife they project. I am tempted to believe they genuinely hate him, but only because he has discovered the magic formula for taking away some of their perks and power. He is dismantling their carefully constructed graft machine. \n\nFormer president George W.

Who knows these days? \n\nDick Cheney was a war criminal. Mitt Romney wanted to reenslave blacks. George Bush was a Nazi. Even John McCain was beyond the pale. \n\nIf I told people in 2008 that Dick Cheney would be a hero to Democrats, I would have been involuntarily committed.But here we are. https://t.co/n8QPdXqtdO— David Chavous (@DACDAC4DAC) November 4, 2025\n\nOnce these people were no longer threats to their power, they became the \"good\" Republicans who we should all admire because none of them liked Trump, who is as big a danger to their power as he is to the Democrats'. Trump has destroyed the Republican establishment and replaced it with his loyalists and MAGA advocates, and that is unforgivable. \n\nKamala Harris based much of her campaign on her alliance with the Cheneys, which would be hilarious but for the fact that it highlights the moral vacuity of the entire Establishment. Mortal enemies united because Trump is a threat to their iron grip they had on the country's wealth and power. All that talk about \"war criminals\" and \"corruption\" turns out to have pure performance. \n\nDid y'all notice anything interesting about Dick Cheney's Funeral?

Their ultimate allegiance is to the power structure that elevated them. \n\nCheney, for all his many flaws, was a true believer. At least I think so. He believed that he was helping save America from existential threats, and he certainly had his moments during and right after the Cold War and before the 2003 Iraq war. No man's motives are entirely pure, but my sense was that he followed his conscience most of the time. \n\nNot so with those honoring him today, for the most part. All those people who flocked to Cheney to get that anti-Trump quote never cared about anything but power, which is why they stopped on a dime and reversed course when Trump emerged. \n\nEditor’s Note: The mainstream media isn't interested in the facts; they're only interested in attacking the president.

Republican Matt Van Epps, a former state official, and Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn are in a heated ad war that has drawn notable outside groups from both parties into the 7th Congressional District, which President Donald Trump carried by 22 points in 2024. Behn’s campaign raised more than $1 million from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12, according to a Thursday campaign finance filing. She spent a little more than half of that during the same period. Van Epps, meanwhile, raised about $591,000 and spent most of it, leaving him with $231,000 in the bank for the stretch run. Behn had about $522,000 on hand at the close of the fundraising period. Behn is hoping to mobilize independents and moderate Republicans, as well as her Nashville Democratic base, to capitalize on expected low turnout. She sees a path to victory by defining herself as an accountability candidate who can put a check on President Donald Trump’s party in the House, particularly criticizing the GOP’s signature tax cuts and spending bill as well as Trump’s tariffs. And she’s running an unabashedly Democratic campaign, leaning on DNC Chairman Ken Martin and former Vice President Kamala Harris. But that support from establishment figures is giving her opponent fodder. Van Epps, an Army veteran, boasts endorsements from Trump, Gov. Bill Lee and former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in April from the seat Van Epps is seeking to fill. He’s running on reliably MAGA themes, as Republicans are trying to rev up enthusiasm for the unusually timed election — and make sure that low turnout doesn’t turn into an embarrassing result. But he has also sought to emphasize other issues on the airwaves, like bringing down prices. The Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc. has already reported over $1 million in independent expenditures in the race, marking the first time the group has waded into a federal contest so far this year. Other conservative groups like Club for Growth and another super PAC that’s been primarily funded by GOP megadonors in the past, have jumped in too to boost Van Epps. Behn is getting an outside boost too, albeit a bit of a smaller one than her Republican opponent. There’s been more than $3.3 million spent to oppose Behn or support Van Epps, with a little more than $900,000 in independent expenditures aimed at boosting the Democrat. Tthat includes about $100,000 that also boosts independent Jon Thorp, likely hoping the Army veteran might pull more votes from the Republican candidate than the Democratic one. Republicans have the edge on the airwaves, too. The Van Epps campaign and its allies have spent about $730,000 on advertising since the primary, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, while Democrats have spent about $500,000. Super PACs backing Van Epps are trying to brand Behn as a radical, likening her to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and using a clip from a video she recorded calling herself a “very radical person.” Van Epps’ own campaign has run ads playing up his service in the Army. Behn hit back with an ad comparing conditions for working people to a rough ride on a mechanical bull. She criticized expiring Medicare subsidies, tariffs and the Trump administration’s longtime hesitancy to release files related to the investigation into late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/millions-pour-tennessee-special-election-ahead-december-vote-rcna244846","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251119-Epps-Behn-split-gk-556e6e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 00:09:56","author":"Ben Kamisar,Owen Auston-Babcock","authors":["Ben Kamisar","Owen Auston-Babcock"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":381065434,"title":"Trump lashes out at ABC, calls for licenses to be taken away","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C.: A brief exchange with a reporter has prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to renew his calls for federal regulators to strip broadcast licenses from ABC affiliates, escalating his long-running campaign against media outlets he says treat him unfairly.\n\nDuring an Oval Office appearance with the Saudi crown prince this week, an ABC News reporter asked Trump about the Jeffrey Epstein political scandal.

New fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show the national party committee took out the loan at the start of October, about a month before Democrats secured major victories in pivotal elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, a key redistricting referendum in California, and various other downballot races. Those results have energized the Democratic Party one year after President Donald Trump swept the presidential battleground states on his way to defeating then-Vice President Kamala Harris, and as poll after poll in the wake of that loss shows the party's image at an all-time low. National party groups often take out loans just before elections to help fund the frantic final weeks of activity. Such a large loan one year out from a national election is uncommon, especially at this point in the four-year election cycle. And while the party out of power typically trails the president's party in terms of fundraising, the Republican National Committee stockpiled a massive lead over its Democratic counterparts going into October, $85 million to $12 million. The RNC has not yet filed its monthly fundraising report, which is due Thursday. The DNC's shows it closed the month with about $18 million banked away after taking the $15 million loan. In a statement to The New York Times, which obtained the DNC's filing shortly before it was publicly released, DNC Chairman Ken Martin framed the decision as a way to help invest in party-building activities. DNC officials have said the national party has upped its monthly commitment to state parties to more than $1 million a month, and said earlier this month it invested more than $3 million each into Virginia and New Jersey ahead of the elections there. But those commitments and giving to state parties have drawn down the funds the DNC has available for the next election. “We can’t win elections or fight back against Trump if the D.N.C. downsizes operations like it often does after a presidential cycle,” Martin told the Times. “I made a bet that investing early would build power, rack up wins and rally supporters back to the table. That bet is paying off.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/dnc-takes-15-million-loan-cash-reserves-run-low-rcna245063","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251120-Ken-Martin-ew-640p-d35d42.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-20 23:58:06","author":"Ben Kamisar","authors":["Ben Kamisar"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":381053420,"title":"Funeral held for former US vice president, Iraq War architect Dick Cheney  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St","text":"A bipartisan group of former United States presidents and officials has convened in the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, to honour the life of Dick Cheney, a vice president who passed away on November 3.\n\nA powerful figure in Republican politics, Cheney served under President George W Bush from 2001 to 2009.

Discovery searches for a buyer, the White House is allegedly favoring a deal involving Paramount Skydance.\n\n That preference might stem in part from alleged talks that have taken place between Paramount's largest shareholder Larry Ellison and White House officials, according to reporting by The Guardian.\n\n Several insiders told the outlet that Ellison, 81, keeps in touch with various officials at the White House under President Donald Trump's leadership. At least once, he reportedly spoke with someone about potentially restructuring of CNN, a network that is currently owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n More specifically, the discussion was allegedly about firing reporters such as Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, who are not favored by Trump. The alleged discussion is said to have the White House \"animated\" about a deal between the two companies.\n\n Conversations have also reportedly included the possibility of airing CBS programs like 60 Minutes on CNN. The network is a subset of Paramount.\n\n Despite Ellison being involved in the conversations, The Guardian noted that he doesn't play a formal role in the company beyond being a shareholder. The company is actually run by his son, David Ellison.\n\n The White House is seen to have a favorable view of Paramount in part due to a $16 million settlement that the company made with Trump, 79, after he sued the company for $10 billion and accused them of deceptively editing a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\n In the aftermath of the settlement, CBS' popular late-night show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled.

For Republicans, it was just Trump being Trump. A select few lightly criticized the president. Others steered clear, claiming they hadn’t seen the Truth Social posts. And some Republicans only took issue with the group of Democrats who posted a video telling members of the military they can “refuse illegal orders.”\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sided with the president, telling reporters, “What I read was he was defining the crime of sedition.”\n“That is a factual statement,” Johnson continued.\nInstead of chastising Trump, the speaker denounced the Democrats, calling their message “wildly inappropriate.”\n“Think of the threat that is to our national security and what it means to our institutions,” Johnson said. “I just — we have got to raise the bar in Congress. This is out of control.”\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told reporters that Trump’s message to jail and hang Democrats was “hypothetical.”\n“Trump’s not going to ask somebody to do something that’s illegal,” Scott said.\nAnd Sen. Jim Justice, R-W. Va., told reporters that he was “not going to get into volleying back and forth with the president at all.”\n“I really support what our president’s doing, and I think he’s done a marvelous job,” Justice said.\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., also jumped to the president’s defense.\n“If this were any other time in history, those folks would be in chains and they’d be in prison,” Burchett said of the Democrats.\nAnd pressed on whether he was really comfortable with the president suggesting these Democrats should be hanged, Burchett asked a question in response: “Is that what the crime calls for? Is that what the law says the crime calls for?”\nOther GOP lawmakers hid behind the defense that they were unfamiliar with Trump’s latest social media posts. (The president posted and reposted on Truth Social more than a dozen times Thursday, personally calling the Democrats’ video “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS” and “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted one Truth post saying, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD.”)\nDespite the posts being the talk of Capitol Hill on Thursday, plenty of Republicans said they missed Trump’s comments.\n“I didn’t see it,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.\n“I don’t know anything about it,” House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said. “I’m not gonna comment on a tweet that I haven’t read. I don’t know anything about it.”\n“I have been at Vice President Cheney’s service all morning so I have not looked at my phone,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nAnd when MS NOW asked Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., about the president’s comments, Wicker said, “I haven’t been commenting.”\n\nOf course, not every Republican was ignoring the comments or completely jumping to the president’s defense.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Democratic video was “ill-advised” and “provocative.” But, he told reporters, he does not agree with Trump calling for the death penalty.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump, said that while the conduct of the Democrats was “despicable” — which he noted three times — he also said the president’s comments were “over the top.”\n“I don’t agree with the president they should be put in jail,” Graham said. \nPressed specifically by MS NOW about Trump calling for these lawmakers to be hanged, Graham said: “That’s not the right answer.”\nA pair of moderate House Republicans also pushed back. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who’s retiring at the end of next year, told MS NOW that while the Democrats’ video “was not wise,” the president’s post — “threatening capital punishment on those who made it” — was “even more unwise.”\nAnd Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of three GOP lawmakers representing a district Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, wrote on X that “two things are true.”\n\nThe President should not imply that Members of Congress should face death, no matter how ill-advised their comments are.”Rep. mike lawler, r-n.y.\n\n“Members of Congress should not be calling for active duty troops to defy orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief by trying to imply they have been given illegal orders and not being able to cite one,” Lawler said, while also saying “The President should not imply that Members of Congress should face death, no matter how ill-advised their comments are.”\n“The rhetoric needs to be brought down stat,” he concluded.\nDemocrats, for their part, were deeply concerned that a message that is factually true — members of the military actually have a “duty to disobey” an order that is unlawful — would be met with calls for political violence by the president.\n“What’s most telling is that the President considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law,” the Democratic lawmakers in the video wrote in a joint statement. (Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H. and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., were featured in the video and signed the statement.)\n“This isn’t about politics. This is about who we are as Americans,” the group added. “Every American must unite and condemn the President’s calls for our murder and political violence.”\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a top critic of the president, said Thursday’s social media saga was, in his opinion, the worst onslaught of the past 10 months of the Trump administration.\n“This isn’t like a normal political story,” Murphy told reporters. “This is perhaps the most reckless, irresponsible thing that he has done all Congress — and it’s gonna get a lot of us killed.”\nDemocratic leaders on Capitol Hill were similarly outraged.\nIn a statement, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other top House Democrats said Trump’s “violent and unhinged rhetoric against American patriots is consistent with his well-documented history of attacking prisoners of war, Gold Star families and war heroes.”\n“There is no bottom when it comes to Donald Trump,” they said, adding that they were in touch with the House Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police “to ensure the safety of these Members and their families.”\nAnd Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — who argued the Democrats had “an absolute right to say” what they did in the video — told reporters he has “never seen” a president “who has done more to encourage political violence.” \n“He is not saying this in a vacuum,” Schumer said. “He is throwing a match into a country filled with political extreme gasoline.”\n“It is dangerous,” he added. “It is devastating.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/trump-calls-democrats-seditious-traitors-republicans-rcna245028","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1763679929/251120-mike-johnson-es-2d1f11/251120-mike-johnson-es-2d1f11.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-20 22:59:13","author":"Kevin Frey,Mychael Schnell","authors":["Kevin Frey","Mychael Schnell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":381049126,"title":"Why Obama and Clinton Are Sitting Out Cheney’s Funeral: Invited, But Not Showing Up","text":"When former Vice President Dick Cheney’s funeral took place at Washington’s National Cathedral, there were a lot of big names in the pews, but Barack Obama and Bill Clinton weren’t among them.

For Obama, some reports note that he and Michelle have skipped other funerals this year. This could be part of a broader pattern, maybe.

Cheney was deeply influential, especially in conservative politics, and seeing major figures from both sides would have sent a strong message of unity at a time when the country is very divided. Especially because Cheney himself was a divisive figure.\n\nTrump was also not a fan of the Cheneys. He criticized Dick and his daughter Liz Cheney, and so it didn’t come as a surprise that he didn’t issue a presidential proclamation after Cheney’s death.\n\n🚨NEW: Liz Cheney did not invite Donald Trump to the funeral of her father, Vice President Dick Cheney.\nRETWEET if you stand with @Liz_Cheney against Donald Trump! pic.twitter.com/m6Y9yFhlUJ\n— Protect Kamala Harris ✊ (@DisavowTrump20) November 20, 2025\n\nHowever, on the day of Cheney’s funeral, Vance shared some thought about the old-school Republican. While attending the Breitbart event, he said, according to The Guardian, “Obviously there are some political disagreements there, but he was a guy who served his country. We certainly wish his family all the best in this moment of grieving.”\n\nThere’s also the fact that funerals are deeply personal. Not every invite means a public appearance. For some, it’s less about paying political respects and more about managing energy, public exposure, or family obligations.

ABC lifted the suspension following a public outcry.\n\nKimmel’s show Wednesday night began with a blistering monologue about Trump, the first 10 minutes concentrated on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Congress’ vote this week to release more material from Epstein’s correspondence. He noted the country was carefully following the movements of “Hurricane Epstein.”\n\n“We are ever closer to answering the question: What did the president know, and how old were these women when he knew it?” Kimmel said, riffing off a question Sen. Howard Baker Jr. asked about Richard Nixon during the Watergate saga in the 1970s. \n\nTrump struck back in a Truth Social post sent at 12:49 a.m. Eastern. “Why does ABC Fake News keep Jimmy Kimmel, a man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS, on the air? Why do the TV Syndicates put up with it?” Trump said. The latter was a reference to ABC affiliates, some of whom got the movement toward Kimmel’s brief suspension started in September by complaining about his Kirk content.\n\nABC said it would not comment about Trump’s statement on Kimmel, whose ratings saw a bump upon his return to the air in September. While Trump associated him with ABC News, Kimmel works for the network’s entertainment division.\n\nKimmel isn’t the only late-night comic to draw Trump’s ire lately. Over the weekend, he called for the firing of NBC’s Seth Meyers.\n\nThe Epstein case was one of three topics that ABC’s Bruce asked about in pointed questions during an Oval Office news conference Tuesday. The president called Bruce a “terrible reporter” and said he didn’t like her attitude. The Epstein story has clearly gotten under Trump’s skin. Late last week, Trump referred to a Bloomberg News reporter, Catherine Lucey, as “piggy” during a question-and-answer session on Air Force One.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House press office released a letter outlining grievances against ABC News, some dating back to the president’s first term. “ABC ‘News’ is not journalism,” the press office said. “It’s a Democrat spin operation masquerading as a broadcast network.”\n\nAmong the complaints: George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate claim that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll, for which ABC’s parent Disney Corp. agreed to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit; the network’s fact-checking of Trump during his 2024 presidential debate with Kamala Harris; and former ABC correspondent Terry Moran calling Trump aide Stephen Miller a “world-class hater.”\n\nThere was no immediate comment from ABC News about the criticism.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The sources said part of Paramount's interest lies in the idea that Ellison's closeness to Trump would help the deal pass a regulatory review. \n\nThe discussions reportedly included naming possible replacements for Burnett and CBS running its programming, like 60 Minutes, on CNN. \n\nAccording to the sources, the back-and-forth concerning what Paramount might do if it acquired Warner Bros Discovery were largely casual, as Ellison is not an executive at the company. His son, David Ellison, is the CEO of Paramount Skydance. \n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Ellison, Paramount, and the White House. \n\nParamount has previously submitted multiple unsolicited and unsuccessful offers to buy Warner Bros Discovery. \n\nTrump has been happy with the younger Ellison at the helm of Paramount Skydance and thus CBS News. Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to Trump over a 60 Minutes interview involving former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. \n\nIn addition to paying Trump the settlement, CBS News also placed conservative commenter Bari Weiss at the head of its news division. \n\nShould Warner Bros Discovery accept a purchase offer from Paramount, the only real hurdle the deal will face is an anti-trust review, which a former anti-trust division official told The Guardian was unlikely to kill the deal. \n\n“This won’t pose serious antitrust issues,” the former official said, noting that the White House likely wouldn't try to stop the deal. “That’s just how the government relations game is played.\" \n\nHowever, Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, said such a deal was not likely require any review by his agency. \n\n“I’d be very surprised if there was an FCC role at all in that type of transaction,” Carr said. \n\nParamount is not the only company interested in acquiring Warner Bros Discovery.

The turnout underscored a strange duality: Dick Cheney’s late-life rebellion against Trump left him isolated among his party, yet softened his image for some longtime critics.\n\nThe rift was cemented in 2022, when Dick Cheney warned that no one posed “a greater threat to our republic.” From that moment, the split with Trump was irreparable.\n\nAt first, someone close to the family claimed Vice President JD Vance had been invited. By Thursday morning, Vance’s aides clarified to Axios that he had not—and did not attend. Trump followed protocol by lowering flags to half-staff, but offered no public statement.\n\nMost of Trump’s inner circle stayed away. Republican lawmakers with political ambitions followed suit, careful not to cross a president who still sees Liz Cheney as a top nemesis.\n\nDemocrats weren’t guaranteed guests either. Many still hold Dick Cheney accountable for the Iraq War, torture programs, mass surveillance, and a foreign-policy worldview that left countless civilians and U.S. service members in harm’s way. Old wounds don’t heal just because someone becomes a Trump critic.\n\nStill, the room included political heavyweights. According to CNN, former President Joe Biden attended on his 83rd birthday. Former President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney’s wartime partner, was expected to speak. Liz Cheney and several grandchildren were on the program\n\nFour former vice presidents—Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore, and Dan Quayle—also attended, along with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan. Senior Cabinet officials from both parties showed up, as did congressional leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, John Thune, and Mitch McConnell.\n\nCNN called the guest list “a nod to a time when Washington was not so polarized.” Generous perhaps—but it captures the political oddity of Dick Cheney’s farewell: a bipartisan tribute for a polarizing figure, minus the sitting president of his own party.\n\nDick Cheney’s break with Trump deepened after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He called Trump a coward in an ad supporting his daughter’s reelection, which drew Trump’s ire. \n\nThe president responded predictably—with mockery and threats. He called Liz Cheney “one of the dumber people in politics,” labeled Dick Cheney an “irrelevant RINO,” an acronym meaning Republican In Name Only, and at one point suggested guns be “trained on [Liz Cheney’s] face.”\n\nLiz Cheney ultimately lost her 2022 primary to a Trump-backed challenger. But while still in Congress, she served as vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee, prompting Trump to suggest she should go to jail and even amplifying calls for a televised military tribunal.\n\nOf course, Dick Cheney’s defiance of Trump doesn’t erase decades of controversial decisions. He helped plan the Iraq War, which was built on false claims about weapons of mass destruction, a conflict that cost thousands of American lives and untold numbers of Iraqi civilians. As vice president, he presided over torture programs, intelligence abuses, a botched response to Hurricane Katrina, and the early cracks of the global financial collapse. Any attempt to cast his legacy as straightforwardly heroic ignores the trail of destruction he left behind.\n\nYet in death, some of that history has been softened. The White House offered no public comment about Trump’s absence.\n\nAnd so Washington was treated to a rare tableau of irony: a man with a catastrophic record freezing out a president with a catastrophic record. One awful figure refusing to host another awful figure, even in death.\n\nRepublican infighting rarely reads like poetry. This moment almost does.","summary":"President Donald Trump didn’t attend former Vice President Dick Cheney’s memorial service on Thursday.

Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) to smear Republicans, claiming a variety of Republicans had received donations from \"somebody\" named Jeffrey Epstein, but without verifying that that was actually the sex trafficker, Epstein. Her effort to defend her actions was truly wild. \n\nMoreover, Democrats lost the talking point about the files because President Donald Trump encouraged the House and the Senate to pass the bill to release the files, and he signed it on Wednesday. \n\nREAD MORE: New: Crockett Makes an Absolute Fool Out of Herself in Wild Justification for Epstein Donation Claims\n\nNew: Trump Announces He's Signed Bill to Release Epstein Files\n\nBut that didn't stop Kamala Harris, who always seems to be just a bit off in knowing what to say, from calling on Trump to release the files, just hours before he was going to sign it into law. And what was funny was that she was touting his power as the head of the executive branch. \n\nDid she not know he had already called to release them? As Trump noted when he signed the bill, Epstein was charged under Trump in 2019, and the DOJ has already released a lot of information to Congress. \n\nI have a question for Harris: why didn't the Biden/Harris team release the files? They had them for four years without doing anything with them. Where were her calls to release them? Strangely absent. \n\nAs Fox's Brit Hume noted during a recent segment of \"Special Report With Bret Baier,\" she occupied office for four years and was \"part of an administration which had complete control of those files, and we never heard a peep that I can remember from her or from...Joe Biden about doing that.\" Hume said it was only because Trump was in power. \n\n\"Democrats are once again struggling to find something, anything, that they can possibly get to try to stop the momentum of this president, who has so bedeviled them, and who they've made such fools of themselves trying to bring down for all these years. Here we go again, perfect example here.\" \n\nHarris really has no credibility when it comes to talking about the information now, particularly not with the Democrats' connections all over what has been released so far. \n\nBottom line regarding Trump? With all they've done to try to get him, if there had been anything in there, it would have come out. \n\nSo we'll have to see what the Department of Justice records reveal.

And Karl Rove, who was the chief architect of George Bush’s campaigns and political career was – could be found on all the TV stations, talking about the ‘permanent Republican majority’ that had been created.”\n\nThe former president continued, describing a similar sense of despair in 2004 that Democrats felt after 2024 when President Donald Trump swept all seven battleground states and decisively beat former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut it ultimately turned out well for Democrats two decades ago, Obama said.\n\n“And two years later, Nancy Pelosi was the first woman speaker of the House of Representatives. And four years later, somehow, I ended up being president. The reason I tell you that is not for you to, you know, feel complacent,” he said. “It’s to indicate that the work that you are doing right now, the investment you’re making, the focus that you’re applying, the issues that you are developing, the interactions that you’re having with your constituencies. All that is creating the momentum and the opportunity for change.”\n\nObama took five questions on several topics, including on lessons learned on the Affordable Care Act fight. On that point, he told Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.) that he overestimated Republicans’ willingness to work with him, saying he could have learned that lesson quicker.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/20/obama-meets-freshman-lawmakers-congress-00663615","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/1eda8f1/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0f%2Fda%2Ff684328f431f8b89a4bd1a4f39fa%2Felection-2024-harris-92521.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-20 21:59:00","author":"Adam Wren","authors":["Adam Wren"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":381035616,"title":"Jack White's Thanksgiving NFL show risks Donald Trump fury after rock star branded President 'low-life fascist'","text":"Jack White's Thanksgiving halftime show for the Detroit Lions next week could put the NFL on another collision course with Donald Trump, after multiple attacks from the rocker on the President in recent months. \n\nThe 50-year-old White, who wrote the anthem 'Seven Nation Army' and is widely considered one of the best guitarists in history, has compared Trump's MAGA movement to Nazi Germany, accusing him of 'dismantling democracy' since he returned to office last November.\n\nThe Detroit native will perform during the halftime interval of next week's game between the Lions and the Green Bay Packers. And after Bad Bunny's controversial hiring as the Super Bowl performer for February, White's Thanksgiving role is unlikely to impress Trump.\n\nAfter Trump's crushing election victory over Kamala Harris and the Demoracts, White slammed those who turned out in support of the Republican party.\n\nSharing a Turkish proverb about trees voting for an axe, part of White's lengthy rant on Instagram read: 'Trump won the popular vote. End of story. Americans chose a known, obvious fascist and now America will get whatever this wannabe dictator wants to enact from here on in.\n\n'We all know what he is capable of: Project 2025, deportations, nationwide abortion ban, ending his own 2 term limit, backing Putin and his war, shutting down the Board of Education, adding to climate change, limiting LGBTQ rights, controlling the DOJ, keeping the minimum wage down, etc. etc. etc.. Any or all of it. \n\n'It's absolutely dumbfounding that this con man succeeded in pulling the wool over so many Americans eyes.'\n\nIn August, White attacked Trump for how he has redisgned the Oval Office. Sharing a picture of Trump with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, he posted: 'Look at how disgusting Trump has transformed the historic White House. It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room.\n\n'Look at his disgusting taste, would you even buy a used car from this conman, let alone give him the nuclear codes? What an embarrassment to American history. Also pictured in this photograph, a REAL leader of a nation in a black suit.'\n\nThe White House hit back that time, with Trump's communications director Steven Cheung telling the Daily Beast: 'Jack White is a washed up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career. \n\n'It’s apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of \"The People's House\".'\n\nIt provoked another angry backlash from White, who compared Trump's movement to the rise of the Nazis in Germany.\n\nHe issued a lenghty statement on Instagram hitting back at Cheung's remarks and, alongside several pictures of Trump, added: 'I was raised to believe that we defeated fascism in World War II and that we would never allow it again in the world.\n\n'I don't always state publicly my political opinions, and like anyone I don't always know all of the facts, but when it comes to this man and this administration I'm not going to be like one of the silent minority of 1930's Germany. \n\n'This man is a danger to not just America but the entire world and that's not an exaggeration, he's dismantling democracy and endangering the planet on a daily basis, and we. all. know. it.'\n\nIn the longer statement he posted, he went as far as saying: 'No intelligent person can defend this low-life fascist.'\n\nWhite on Thursday took to social media once more to deny quotes circulating on social media that he has previously forbidden MAGA supporters from listening to his music or going to his concerts.\n\n'I'm getting shown a lot of nonsense from twitter of maga people and bots attributing false quotes to me about excluding people from my shows,' White wrote. 'I've never said anything about 'forbidding' anyone from coming to my concerts. \n\n'My own political views aside, I make music to share with anyone who wants to get something out of it, and I appreciate anyone who buys a ticket or an album to keep that train moving, if you're not interested, that's fine too.\n\n'I'm just not going to let people (or bots) make up false statements from me so they can get clicks. Not trying to make a news piece out of this either please, this is just for my fans (whom I love and appreciate) to know I never said that kind of thing.'\n\nFans of White can purchase a $30 'Icky Trump' protest t-shirt on his White Stripes or Third Man Records (White's own record label) website - the name is a pun on another big White Stripes hit called 'Icky Thump'.\n\nWhite's role as a halftime performer comes days after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Los Angeles. \n\nRapper Eminem, also from Detroit, will serve as executive producer for White's halftime show.\n\nTrump was recently at the Lions game in Washington, where they beat the Commanders 44-22. Star Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown copied Trump's YMCA dance when he scored a touchdown.","summary":"Jack White's Thanksgiving halftime show for the Detroit Lions next week could put the NFL on another collision course with Donald Trump if he attacks the President again.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15310699/Jack-Whites-Thanksgiving-NFL-Donald-Trump-fury-fascist.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/20/20/104056167-0-image-m-43_1763669700264.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-20 21:48:36","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.039},{"id":381045364,"title":"Newsom's Press Office Says Joe Biden Had 'Physical Stamina — and a Functioning Brain'","text":"California Gov.

I hate it,' Behn can be heard saying in the resurfaced clip from the GRITS podcast in February 2020.\n\nShe has also previously called sororities 'a staple of white supremacy,' as well as referring to the whole of Tennessee as a 'racist state.'\n\nBehn attended the Webb School of Knoxville, Tennessee, which is a private school. She graduated from there in 2008 before going on to study at the University of Texas at Austin. \n\nShe is in an uphill battle against Republican Matt Van Epps, a former Tennessee General Services commissioner, running to fill the state's 7th congressional seat formerly occupied by Republican Mark Green, who resigned earlier this summer to take a job in the private sector.\n\nThe seat is rated an R +10 by the Cook Political Report, despite Green's prior win being by over 20 points. The race has also shifted slightly towards Democrats, going from 'solid Republican' to 'lean Republican' last week.\n\nTrump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc jumped into the race as well last week, with a small expenditure of $15,000 for phone banking.\n\nSignificant Democratic electoral victories earlier this month have drawn substantial media attention and money to the race in the last few weeks. \n\nFormer Vice President and failed 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail in person to boost Behn earlier this week, calling her race 'the most competitive race in America.' However, she did not mention the candidate by name or appear alongside her.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, supported Van Epps via a tele-rally last week, calling him a 'true America First patriot who has dedicated his entire life to serving our country.' \n\nBehn has been endorsed by groups such as the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, AFL-CIO, and the Working Families Party. At the same time, Van Epps is boosted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the Club for Growth PAC, and the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nGreen's sudden departure from Congress was a surprise.\n\n'It is with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from Congress,' he said in a statement at the time.\n\n'Recently, I was offered an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up,' Green added.\n\nGreen called it 'an honor of a lifetime' to work in Congress, he also touted many of his achievements as committee chairman.\n\nHe also addressed his previous retirement announcement and subsequent reversal.\n\n'Though I planned to retire at the end of the previous Congress, I stayed to ensure that President Trump's border security measures and priorities make it through Congress,' he wrote.\n\n'By overseeing the border security portion of the reconciliation package, I have done that. After that, I will retire, and there will be a special election to replace me.'\n\nThe announcement also came after Green was publicly embroiled in an alleged affair in 2024 and roasted by his former wife online.","summary":"Aftyn Behn, the Democratic Party's nominee for the 7th Congressional district, made the shocking remarks on a podcast.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15309871/Damning-audio-exposes-Democrat-snobbishly-sneering-southern-city-shes-supposed-represent-hate-country.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/20/20/104057973-0-image-m-19_1763669889910.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-20 21:24:08","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":381030576,"title":"Funeral held for former US vice president, Iraq War architect Dick Cheney  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily","text":"A bipartisan group of former United States presidents and officials has convened in the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, to honour the life of Dick Cheney, a vice president who passed away on November 3.\n\nA powerful figure in Republican politics, Cheney served under President George W Bush from 2001 to 2009.
