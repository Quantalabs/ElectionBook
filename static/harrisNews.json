We’ll start there, and then briefly examine California’s Proposition 50. \n\nMany will understandably be talking about Mamdani’s identity, his youth, and his exciting campaign. \n\nI wanted to examine what his victory implies with regards to big money and Zionism in politics, and what the trends are worldwide with regards to political ideology. \n\nMamdani represented himself as a clean break from the establishment – which of course was fun to watch. \n\nOne of my favourite things about him is how decisively and boldly he broke away from Zionist influence. \n\nIt is becoming vastly clear that Zionist influence in American politics has reached levels of blatantness that bends reality and any notion of rationality and normal human compassion. \n\nThis influence has traditionally crushed and silenced any American politician who dares to speak up against the unceasing brutal violence and genocide perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinians – exposing a moral rot so thorough it turns the stomach. \n\nThe Zionist attempt to influence and control every echelon of American politics, both Republican and Democrat has been unrelenting and virulent. \n\nIn a memorable scene from the very first mayoral debate back in June 2025 as part of the Democratic primary, all nine candidates featured then were asked where they would make their first foreign visit to; four of the five answered Israel.\n\nWhen it came to Mamdani, he answered that instead of going on a foreign visit, he would focus on staying in New York City – a completely neutral answer. \n\nIn a strange and telling follow up question (which no other candidate received), one of the moderators in that debate then immediately asked him whether he would visit Israel, and kept pressing him on his position on Israel. \n\nThe way the original question was asked would lead the more conspiracy theory inclined among us to feel like it was planted as some kind of Zionist test. The way that moderator randomly jumped in and pressed Mamdani (and no one else) on whether he would visit Israel, and recognise its right to exist, would I feel be persuasive even to those of us not inclined to conspiracy theories. \n\nWatching Mamdani boldly stand up and refuse to be cowed and dance to this Zionist tune, in such stark contrast to the other candidates who were all too happy to suck up to Israel, was deeply refreshing - and now, five months later, also deeply vindicating. \n\nIn this regard, perhaps one of the sweeter aspects of Mamdani’s victory is to send a clear and strong signal to the rest of America not only that Zionists should be resisted as a matter of principle, but that it is an electorally winning strategy to do so. \n\nThere have already been other smaller signs that American politicians are finally coming around to the fact that taking Zionist money may be more of an electoral liability than an electoral asset, as politicians here and there start politely declining AIPAC contributions. \n\nIf those were little drips from the tap, let’s hope that Mamdani’s landslide win in a city with a relatively high Jewish population opens the floodgates. \n\nMamdani also faced down a high number of billionaires who backed his opponents, showing us once again that money alone may not sway an election.\n\nOn the flip side of that divide, we can even recall how Kamala Harris outraised Donald Trump by a considerable margin in 2024. \n\nWhile that shows encouraging data that there are ways to defeat big money, the last thing it should imply is that it is ok to let down our guard when it comes to the ways in which big money is trying to influence democracy. \n\nIt’s difficult to be complacent on this front when we still have Zionist billionaires like Larry Ellison working to buy TikTok, a platform that likely contributed to Mamdani’s win, this time around. \n\nWithout vigilance and activism, such buyovers may eventually lead to complete and total dominance of every media space and platform. \n\nThere was also recent news that Youtube removed over 700 videos related to Israeli human rights violations. \n\nThe lust of the rich and powerful to completely control all kinds of media, and attempt to distort reality to an unimaginable degree continues unabated. Should they continue to succeed, victories like Mamdani’s may become a thing of the past. \n\nMamdani also appears to be yet another nail in the coffin of establishment politics. \n\nOpenly campaigning as a socialist, a word that could have been a political death sentence not so very long ago, Mamdani has proven that bold ideology is far more attractive that feeble centrism. \n\nThe other living proof of this is of course Donald Trump, and the manner in which he has in barely over a decade completely redefined the Republican party - turning it into a vehicle of extremism that would be unrecognisable to the types of Ronald Reagan or even George Bush. \n\nI believe this is a trend that is being seen in much more than just one place. \n\nA recent poll in Britain showed that the far left Green Party is now polling higher than the Labour Party; with the Reform Party polling even further ahead of the Tories. \n\nAt this rate, by the next election, we can expect British politics to be almost unrecognisable from what it was for most of Britain’s existence, with its traditional two-party system being completely upended in favour of parties that insist on going further and harder away from the centre. \n\nLabour (especially under shameless and impotent Zionist Keir Starmer), the Tories, and the old school Republicans have all essentially been run out of town by people who are sick and tired of the rot inherent to establishment politics. \n\nSuch establishment politics have helped a select few grow fat and contented with the old ways, enslaved to personal profiteering and wining and dining in the state room while the rest of the ship sinks below the waves. \n\nIt is only a matter of time before the Democrats in America suffer the same fate, as suggested by Mamdani’s meteoric rise. Harris refused to come out strongly against Israel, and in sticking closely to establishment politics, failed to inspire and/or instigate the masses the way Trump and Mamdani do. \n\nOf course, there is a question of whether Mamdani will eventually upend establishment politics, or whether he will be consumed by it, suffering fates similar to that say of Barack Obama - someone who was good in many ways, but not someone who made as much change as he could have. \n\nOne good first step is the announcement of Lina Khan, as part of Mamdani’s transition team. The young former chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission has a reputation for being a fearless and ardent crusader, representing the interests of ordinary citizens against mega corporations. \n\nAt the end of the day, we will have to see whether Mamdani will, like so many others before him, ultimately be pulled into the centres of gravity that are establishment politics and be bent by them; or whether he really can be at the epicentre of a genuinely new way of doing things. \n\nLet’s look at another battlefront in democratic systems - how we draw the borders of our electoral districts. \n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 50, which was just passed, essentially allows California to engage in what is basically gerrymandering to ensure more Democratic seats in the House of Representatives. \n\nThis move was a seen as a ‘proportional’ response to states like Texas who took similar measures, in favour of Republicans. \n\nWhile some may understandably rejoice, in the bigger picture, the very concept of a neutral democratic system is being eroded more and more, replaced by pure partisanship. \n\nIn essence, this gerrymandering has become something of an arms race. If your opponent is doing it, and you are not, you face annihilation. \n\nBut as each party ramps up their own gerrymandering efforts to skew electoral borders in their favour, what used to be a semi-functional democratic system will quickly turn into a chaotic, partisan-obsesssed mess that becomes harder and harder to untangle. \n\nIn other words, many of us may understandably want to rejoice at what is ‘good’ for Democrats, with the passage of Proposition 50. We should know however that while it is a victory for Democrats, it is not necessarily a victory for democracy. \n\nThere is a seemingly inexorable tide which is insistent on making functional democratic institutions and the way they were originally envisioned as neutral arbiters, into tools of partisan war. \n\nPerhaps more than anything else, what this implies is that we should be paying greater attention to a complete overhaul of those institutions, to make them more resilient and immune to manipulation by the rich and powerful. \n\nNathaniel Tan is communications consultant.

Harris didn’t help herself when she flubbed a softball question from Sunny Hostin and couldn’t come up with anything she’d do differently from Biden. Voters responded by handing President Donald Trump a commanding victory.\n\nAt the time, only 24% of voters said their personal finances were improving, according to RMG Research’s polling for the Napolitan Institute. Conversely, 41% said their personal finances were getting worse. \n\n“People’s perception of whether their personal finances are improving is the single most important indicator of how they will vote,” Rasmussen told me last year, shortly before Election Day.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and it’s now Trump who is facing his own challenges on the economy, which remains the single most important issue on the minds of Americans. Rasmussen asked the question again last week and found that just 26% of respondents think their personal finances are improving compared to 39% who say they’re getting worse.\n\nAmericans haven’t been this pessimistic since they elected Trump to clean up the Biden-Harris mess.\n\nIf these poll numbers aren’t already a warning sign for Trump and Republicans in Congress, they need to recognize the threat. The window will quickly close on the GOP’s governing agenda, putting their political prospects in peril ahead of next year’s midterms. \n\nDemocrats are already salivating at the prospect of turning Trump’s economic advantage into a liability. Look no further than last week’s elections in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger used voters’ economic anxiety against their Republican rivals—and won decisive victories as a result. The outcome was even worse for Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates, where Democrats will have at least 64 of the 100 seats in January.\n\nEven more alarming, New York City voters elected an unabashed socialist who promised to make affordability the centerpiece of his agenda as mayor. When have socialists ever made anything affordable? It didn’t matter.\n\nIn response to Zohran Mamdani’s win, Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy warned his fellow Republicans to take notice. \n\n“Our side needs to focus on affordability,” Ramaswamy said in a viral social media video. “Make the American dream affordable. Bring down costs—electric costs, grocery costs, health care costs and housing costs—and lay out how we’re going to do it.”\n\nRasmussen attributed some of voters’ economic anxiety to the government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 and is nearing an end this week.\n\n“This is a stunning collapse in confidence, coming as more and more people feel the impact of the government shutdown,” Rasmussen told The Daily Signal. “We have been tracking this measure of economic confidence for years because it is the most important political indicator for any election cycle. People were very pessimistic throughout the Biden era, but pessimism began to decline as soon as Trump won the election. Now, all of those gains have been wiped out and voters are just as pessimistic about their finances as they were on the even of the 2024 election.”\n\nTrump, to his credit, has turned his attention to the economy in recent days. But he’ll need more than the president’s bully pulpit to convince Americans that things are improving. Another poll from the Napolitan Institute this week found voter sentiment heading in the wrong direction with 39% believing we’re already in a recession.\n\nThe question isn’t whether the economy matters—the polls make that abundantly clear. The question is whether Republicans can turn sentiment around before voters hand Democrats an opportunity to stymie Trump’s agenda.\n\nJust as Biden-Harris paid the price for inflation and stagnation, Trump now faces the same reckoning. The economy remains the unmistakable kingmaker in American politics—and right now, it’s sending a warning the GOP cannot ignore.","summary":"During the 2024 presidential campaign, pollster Scott Rasmussen predicted that voters would pick their preferred candidate based on how they perceived their personal finances.  Needless...

It wasn’t the landslide that boosters claim, but it was decisive. And Trump’s record-breaking success with Latino voters played a crucial part. In 2020, Joe Biden won Latinos by nearly 2 to 1 (61% to 36%). Four years later, Trump nearly tied Vice President Kamala Harris for the Latino vote (Harris 51% to Trump 48%). He won Latino men by 10 points (54 to 44) — a 33-point swing in his favor from 2020, according to Edison Research. Along with an impressive showing with Black men, the results led many Republicans to claim the GOP was reborn. “The Republican Party is now a multiethnic, multiracial coalition of hardworking Americans who love their country,” then-Sen. Marco Rubio proclaimed. Here’s how Trump put it in his victory speech: “They came from … all quarters. Union, nonunion, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American, we had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment. Uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense. You know, we're the party of common sense.” In typical fashion, Trump overstated things (Harris won eight in 10 Black votes, roughly six in 10 Asian votes, and union voters broke narrowly for Harris). Still, Trump had every reason to celebrate. Republicans have wanted to gain traction with Latino and Black voters for decades and Trump made serious inroads. According to every poll, the overriding priority for Latino voters was the economy. COVID and inflation hit working class Latinos very hard and nostalgia for the pre-pandemic Trump economy ran high. Trump’s immigration rhetoric focused on deporting criminal gangs and shutting down the border, moves that Latinos saw as common sense. The Trump campaign’s most effective ad ran a video of Harris vowing to support taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for prison inmates and illegal immigrants in federal detention. The tagline: “She’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.” The ad was controversial for being “anti-trans” but that wasn’t its appeal. It was the message that Harris cared too much about boutique ideological activist causes, not the “common sense” concerns of regular voters. Fast forward one year, and Latinos are in a very different place than they hoped. For the first time, a majority of Latinos (65%) say it’s a “bad time” to be Latino in America (though only 38% of Republican Latinos agree). Slightly more than half say they fear for their physical safety and believe that all Latinos — regardless of citizenship status — are targets of Trump’s deportation efforts. In the recent off-year elections, Latinos swung massively back toward Democrats, more than erasing GOP gains a year ago. It’s worth noting that these voters still said that their top concern was the economy, not Trump’s immigration policies. Though one does wonder how many voters, worried about being wrongly detained, didn’t risk showing up at the polls. In the modern era, the single biggest mistake political parties make is overreading the election returns. The Trump-led GOP is particularly guilty. Every time Trump does something outrageous, self-indulgent or just weird, his biggest fans declare, “I voted for this.” That may be true for them, but it’s not true for the majority-making swing voters who took a flier on Trump based on economic concerns or frustration with Democrats. When a Latino truck driver sees a video of a Latino mother arrested while picking up her kid from daycare, it doesn’t take a genius to understand he’s probably not saying, “This is what I voted for.” Ditto the endless pardons of crooked cronies, the surprise demolition of the East Wing or the tariff-driven chaos working its way through the economy. Trump’s pride in the diversity of his coalition was understandable, but didn’t account for the fact his coalition was diverse in its reasons for voting for him. Not every Trump voter is a MAGA diehard. The “I voted for this” crowd isn’t a majority. The rest increasingly feel like he’s for him not us — which is why Trump’s approval rating is in “free fall.” The Trump-pushed redistricting effort in Texas was based on the idea that working-class Latinos were as locked in for Trump as the billionaire attendees of his Great Gatsby party at Mar-a-Lago. If current trends continue — still a big if — Democrats could gain Texas seats in the midterms. One in five Texas Latinos who voted for Trump say they regret it. The debate over “Who lost Latinos?” is looming on the horizon, though it won’t be hard to answer.

Instead it has a promise to hold a vote on the Obamacare credits in December. \n\nEven more gutting for Democrats, that deal came on the heels of an unequivocal blue wave election in Virginia just a week ago, which made the decision by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) to support the initiative even more surprising. \n\n“We're going to have a debate in full view of everyone, without the background noise of all the shutdown consequences kind of taking people's attention away from it,” he told The Independent this week. \n\nBut so far, it does not look like Republicans are that interested in renewing the tax credits. For one, Republicans failed at every attempt to find an alternative to Obamacare, as the ACA is more widely known. \n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who once called Trump a “jackass” but now makes himself servile to the president, said that in the coming months, Republicans would craft an alternative to the subsidies. \n\n“My belief is we should have block-granted the thing back a long time ago — the outcomes on Obamacare are horrible,” Graham told The Independent. \n\nAfter his late friend John McCain delivered the thumbs-down vote that killed the Obamacare repeal in 2017, Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), tried to craft an alternative, which McCain would also kill. \n\nNow Cassidy has discussed transforming the health subsidies into federal flexible spending account. Cassidy is largely doing this to stave off a primary challenge and earn Trump’s favor after Cassidy voted to convict Trump for the January 6 riot. \n\nBut the proposal seems to have legs with Senate Republicans, including moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski. \n\n“Think about what that health savings account is all about,” she told The Independent. “It's not saying that the subsidies go away. It's just it's delivered in a different way. It's delivered to you instead of the insurance company.”\n\nThe fact that Murkowski, who had voted against repealing Obamacare and voted to convict Trump, seemed open to savings accounts rather than extending the subsidies shows how much Republicans have an allergy to simply extending them. \n\nAnd this is to say nothing of the fact that House Speaker Mike Johnson could choose not to take up the legislation. But if Republicans choose to not take up the subsidies are even significantly pare them down, they risk a biblical Blue wave. \n\nAccording to a poll from KFF, a health care nonprofit, three quarters of Americans and about the same amount of independents say Congress should extend the subisides. \n\nAnd a look at the election results last week shows endangered Republicans have an extra incentive to support extending them. According to VoteHub, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger won Virginia’s 2nd district, held by Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans, and it 1st district, held by Republican Rob Wittman. \n\nThis might be why Kaine felt confident that Johnson might have no choice. \n\n“If we do something that gets bipartisan support here, he will not be able to stiff arm it, because he's got both all the all the Democrats and many Republicans saying we got to fix this ACA tax credit thing,” Kaine told The Independent. “And if it comes out of here bipartisan, he cannot not take it up without having November 2026 make November 2025 look like a picnic.” \n\nThat likely explains why Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, perhaps the most endangered Republican incumbent, seemed the most open to voting to extend the subsidies. \n\nCollins also voted against the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which included sweeping changes to Medicaid, including work requirements and limiting the taxes that states use to collect revenue for Medicaid to receive matching funds from the federal government. \n\n“I certainly anticipate and hope that there'll be a bipartisan effort to come up with a bill that can pass,” she told The Independent. Collins said she would like there to be an income cap to make sure “self employed individuals, a lot of individuals working for small businesses will not face the prospect of unaffordable health insurance.”\n\n Collins hails from a state that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 and she pulled off a miracle win in 2020. If she does not vote for legislation to extend the subsidies, she could be uniquely vulnerable. \n\nThis might be why she said while she is not leading negotiations, she is happy to bring out her old “talking stick” for bipartisan negotiations to make sure everyone is heard.","summary":"Sen.

We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,\" Trump was shown to say.\n\nTrump actually said: \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\" Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to \"fight like hell.\"\n\nIn a letter to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologised for what he called an \"error of judgment\" over how Trump's speech was edited, which he conceded \"did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.\"\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿UK government is caught up in a feud between Trump and the BBC\n\nHow did the scandal originate?\n\nLast week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a right-wing editorial slant, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n\nIn his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC's news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n\nHe also criticised the \"completely misleading\" edit of Trump's speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series \"Panorama.\n\n\"If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people 'say' things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation's guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\" he wrote.\n\nFormer BBC journalists have criticised the broadcaster for failing to address concerns about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n\n\"They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott's report,\" Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two's \"Newsnight\" program until last year, wrote on his Substack. \"It's a serious mistake, why hadn't they gripped it sooner?\"\n\nEven when The Telegraph's story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC's media editor, reported on Sunday that a statement on the documentary had been \"ready to go for days.\" Instead, the BBC board decided to apologise in Shah's letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah's letter was published, the BBC reported Trump's threat to sue.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Tractor among nine vehicles stolen from Victorian farm\n\nHave heads rolled?\n\nYes. The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned on Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n\nIn a statement, Davie conceded \"there have been some mistakes\" for which he had to take \"ultimate responsibility,\" but stopped short of mentioning the \"Panorama\" documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Australia Post's urgent Christmas scam warning\n\nTurness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.\"\n\n\"The buck stops with me,\" she said in her resignation statement.\n\nDespite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. \"I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿'Drop crocs': Evidence of ancient crocodiles that climbed trees found in Queensland\n\nWhat is the BBC? Who owns it?\n\nThe broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A \"royal charter\", which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n\nIt is funded by a \"license fee\" – an annual payment of £174.50 (AU$351) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster's streaming service. It is a criminal offence not to pay the fee.\n\nSince its founding, the BBC's mission has been to \"act in the public interest\" and provide \"impartial, high-quality and distinctive output\" to \"inform, educate and entertain\" its audiences.\n\nMore profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n\nIs the BBC impartial?\n\nNominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\n\nBut the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarised political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation's television and radio sets.\n\nThe BBC has long been criticised by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n\n\"The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,\" Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said on Monday, calling for \"a very much slimmed down BBC.\"\n\nFarage said he spoke to Trump about the \"Panorama\" report last week. \"He just said to me, 'Is this how you treat your best ally?'\"\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Liberal party to thrash out united stance on net zero target\n\nWhat has Trump threatened?\n\nIn a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by \"intentionally and deceitfully\" editing the \"Panorama\" film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump's team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\"\n\nTrump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate\" him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5pm ET to respond.\n\nThe letter said that if those demands were not met, \"President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"\n\nCould the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n\nProbably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion (11.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n\nIt closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n\nAny payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade.\n\nThe latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Missing dog reappears after seven weeks in South Australian scrub\n\nWhy is the case being brought in Florida?\n\nIn the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n\nStill, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump's argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n\n\"The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?\" Stephens told CNN. \n\n\"He's going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this 'Panorama' and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?\"\n\nHas Trump threatened media outlets before?\n\nYes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nIn July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay $16 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nAs with the BBC, Trump's grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n\nAnalysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n\nStephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since \"he doesn't have the sort of leverage\" over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

She knew that there were problems disproportionately affecting women of African descent.\n\nShe stated, per Fox News, “There are very specific issues that impact Black women in America that should be some of the highest priorities. I made them priorities when I was vice president, such as Black maternal mortality.”\n\nStill on the Black women’s health agenda, the former vice president, noted that postpartum care and maternity care was also important in the election race. Harris added that more research was needed on fibroids. Harris shared that Black women were more likely to get it.\n\nThe implication was clear that those agendas were important to black women, a key voter group for Democrats. She asserted herself as the one who looked after those interests when she was in a position of power.\n\nHarris didn’t stop there. She also criticized the Donald Trump administration. She noted, “And then you look at what’s happening now with this guy in office, and they’re cutting funding for scientific research if it has the word ‘woman’ or ‘Black’ in it.” \n\nIt seems as if Harris isn’t just blowing smoke. The Center for American Progress shared real-life stats about how the Department of Government Efficiency has cut programs that would have potentially helped women, in particular Black women. \n\n“There are very specific issues that impact Black women in America that should be some of the highest priorities.” — #KamalaHarrishttps://t.co/9bHePypPiS\n— Black Information Network (@blackinfonet) November 10, 2025\n\nThey found that the loss of funding in the health care sector, particularly around reproductive issues like fibroids, preeclampsia, and maternal mortality, will affect these women the hardest. The Center stated that the lack of funding reinforced gender inequities, and that in especially, longitudinal research, the loss could not be recuperated.\n\nHarris seems to be targeting Black women in the interview. This group is an important demographic for Dems, and Harris is particularly telling them that she sees their needs. She could be setting herself up for future political campaigns, or she could even just be validating these women at a basic level.\n\nEither way, Harris is positioning herself as a voice of those who feel under-represented, even by her own party. She’s reaching out to Black women, and letting them know that she sees them, and she worked for them.\n\nHer bluntness comes as she promotes her new memoir, 107 Days, and embarks on a national tour. She said, “I’m never going to shy away from who I am.” Adding, “I’m never going to feel burdened that, because of who I am in terms of my race and my gender, that I should pretend not to be.”\n\nSocial media responded fast. Many people reacted to the interview. One X user reacted to Harris’ statement that the Democratic Party took Black women for granted by saying, “Are they just now figuring this out?” And a lot of people had the same kind of reaction, as if it was the norm.\n\nKamala Harris has dropped a verbal bombshell. She’s calling out her own party and offering a fresh narrative to a key demographic. Whether this leads to real change is yet to be seen.","summary":"On a viral podcast, Harris says Democrats ignored Black women, and that now they're being sidelined.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-slams-dems-for-taking-black-women-for-granted","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kamala-Harris-had-claimed-herself-as-a-capitalist.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 21:24:02","author":"Tracey Ashlee","authors":["Tracey Ashlee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":378010546,"title":"The Most Powerful Drug in the Modern Era That's Controlling Nearly Everything You Do","text":"SCHUMER SHUTDOWN SALE\nFINAL HOURS!

He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.“If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box and inside is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about the ‘steal,’” said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the U.S. and U.K.The BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hour-long documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.BBC Chairman Samir Shah apologized Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action.”Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.A lawsuit in England is unlikely because the one-year deadline to bring one expired two weeks ago, experts said. If successful in overcoming that barrier, libel awards in the High Court rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000), experts said.Trump could still bring a defamation claim in several U.S. states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.Filing a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury.Before any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC program was not aired in the U.S., and the BBC’s streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a program they could not watch, Stephens said.“The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan. 6,\" he said. “Alleging ‘Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters ... is a tough sell.”Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.The letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.It also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”The letter cites Florida's defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organizations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.If the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 p.m. EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.“The BBC is on notice,” it said.While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies.In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount's need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.London lawyer David Allen Green dismissed the litigation letter for failing to spell out any actual harm Trump suffered. But he said Trump's willingness to use lawsuits as a form of deal-making could leverage a payout because the edit was indefensible.“Putting aside the theatrics of a bombastic letter with its senseless $1 billion claim, there is a power play here which Trump has done many times before,\" Green said on The Law and Policy Blog. “The real mistake of the BBC (and the production company) was opening itself up to such a play of power.”Stephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.But he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage from revisiting the Jan. 6 events that would be dredged up at trial.He said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.\"The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?’\" he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.”Also Read | US To Deny Visas To Applicants With Certain Medical Conditions, Insufficient Funds","summary":"Trump threatens to sue BBC for $1 billion over edited speech.

Americans could not have thought less of him because of a program they could not watch, Stephens said.\n“The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan. 6,” he said. “Alleging Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters … is a tough sell.” Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.\n The demands Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.\nThe letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\nIt also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.” The letter cites Florida’s defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organizations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.\nIf the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 p.m. EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.\n“The BBC is on notice,” it said.\n Other media lawsuits While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies.\nIn July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\nThat settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.\nLast year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ‘ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.\n Litigation threat could leverage payout London lawyer David Allen Green dismissed the litigation letter for failing to spell out any actual harm Trump suffered. But he said Trump’s willingness to use lawsuits as a form of deal-making could leverage a payout because the edit was indefensible.\n“Putting aside the theatrics of a bombastic letter with its senseless $1 billion claim, there is a power play here which Trump has done many times before,” Green said on The Law and Policy Blog. “The real mistake of the BBC (and the production company) was opening itself up to such a play of power.” Stephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.\nBut he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage from revisiting the Jan. 6 events that would be dredged up at trial.\nHe said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.\n“The question is, Did it cause harm in people’s minds?'” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.” (AP) NB NB","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trumps-1b-lawsuit-threat-casts-shadow-over-the-bbc-but-it-could-also-be-bluff-9700416.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 21:12:26","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":378009708,"title":"Kamala Harris Cackles, Says She Was Determined To Not Get ‘Played’ By Trump In ‘Three-Dimensional Chess’","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris said on “Storehouse & Friends” Sunday that she was determined to prevent President Donald Trump from beating her at “three-dimensional chess” during her 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nHarris lost all seven swing states and the national popular vote to Trump in 2024. The former vice president said on the show that she recognized the Trump campaign’s strategy and sought to ensure it did not affect her own. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary Cleaning Up Kamala HERE)\n\n“I was aware of my opponent’s strategy. And I wasn’t about to fall prey or fall into those traps,” Harris said.” And part of his strategy, and those around him, was to try and take me off our game and message.”\n\n“And I wasn’t about to be distracted by those flames that he was trying to throw to get me away from one of my highest priorit[ies], which was talking to people about the economy and their well-being, in terms of their financial well-being,” she added. “I understood the game that was being played and I made a decision that I wasn’t going to get played.”\n\nHarris then cackled for several seconds while at least one of the hosts said, “Chess, not checkers.”\n\n“Yeah. Three-dimensional chess,” Harris responded.\n\nHarris was on the show to promote her memoir “107 Days.” During her media tour, she has asserted a significant reason for her loss was that she only had 107 days to campaign after former President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed her on July 21, 2024. When she made the claim on “The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart” in October, host Jon Stewart told Harris he believed she actually would have won had her campaign been shorter.\n\n“I do believe one of the biggest factors that was at play in the 107 days — we just didn’t have enough time,” Harris said. “We didn’t have enough time.”\n\n“Or was it too much time? I mean, if you had done the election after 60 days, I think you win, honestly,” Stewart replied. “There seemed like a stagnation point. And then if you look at the lines … what would have changed?”\n\nToward the end of the campaign on Oct. 20, 2024, Trump donned an apron and served up french fries at a McDonald’s restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania. The stunt was a jab at Harris, who claimed she worked at McDonald’s while in college, though Trump and media reports disputed her claim.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Katie Porter at 11%. The survey found that 44% of voters remain undecided on who should succeed Newsom. \n\n“Now that Proposition 50 has passed, the candidates will need to seize the opportunity to get voters’ attention,” Eric Schickler, director of the Institute for Government Studies, said.\n\nPorter has gotten the “attention” of voters, but for all the wrong reasons. She made national headlines after nearly storming out of a CBS interview and old footage of her berating a staffer surfaced. \n\n“A botched interview is a gift that keeps on giving,” political analyst Steve Swatt said. “Katie Porter is trending backwards, and that is not what you want to do when you’re a candidate for governor or anything else.”\n\nDemocrats in the 2026 race had been forced to wait for Vice President Kamala Harris, who hinted for months that she may run, only to announce at the end of July she would not enter the race. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) also had name recognition and it was widely believed the Democratic Party would throw its support around him but he, too, decided to pass. \n\nSo far, there are 12 declared Democratic candidates and 11 declared Republican candidates. \n\nCalifornia’s gubernatorial primary isn’t until June 2, which gives hopefuls eight months to lay out policy agendas and appeal to voter concerns. \n\n“This race is as open as it gets — 40% of voters haven’t made up their minds, and no one’s cracked much beyond the mid-teens,” Adin Lenchner of Carroll Street Campaigns, told the Washington Examiner. “What people are craving is simple: someone who’s focused on them, who wants to make their lives a little better, who has their back. We’ve seen over and over again — in NJ, VA. PA, MA, and here in New York — that when candidates center their campaigns on affordability, rooted not in scarcity or shutdowns but in vision, investment, and safety, they can win.” \n\nThe problem for Democratic candidates in California is that to land the governor’s job they will have to work around all of the things Newsom ambitiously promised but never delivered on — like healthcare for all and affordable housing — when applying for the same position. California’s child poverty rate has almost tripled from 2021 to 2024. The state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, was expanded, but during the latest state budget, healthcare for illegal immigrants was scaled back. \n\n“There is no heavyweight in the ring,” Steven Maviglio, a Sacramento-based Democratic strategist, told the Washington Examiner. “Partly because Newsom is leaving behind double-digit billion-dollar structural deficits, and the job simply isn’t attractive. And partly because winning requires raising tens of millions and mobilizing a restless electorate.” \n\nMaviglio added that there was a possibility that if there is no clear frontrunner emerges among Democrats, they could “divide the pie so that the two major Republican contenders could sneak in.”\n\n“If that looks likely, there will be enormous pressure for some of the campaigns to drop out,” he added. “That is the danger of the top two primary.”\n\nPolitical strategist Kaivan Shroff told the Washington Examiner that despite some missteps by Porter, he sees her in the top two heading into next November’s general election.\n\n“I still think this is Katie Porter’s race to lose without a bigger name jumping in, which could still happen,” he said. “She has taken a hit, but can easily regain ground with a few viral moments showing her as the fighter Californians need. And she certainly knows how to go viral. Right now, Democratic support is split on the jungle primary, but there is no real chance Bianco wins the general election once Democrats coalesce around the candidate(s) that proceed to the general election.”\n\nJeff Le, former deputy Cabinet secretary to former California Gov. Jerry Brown, told the Washington Examiner that the June primary is “light years away from the electorate.”\n\n“The lack of a clear standout reflects the importance of voter outreach even more and crisp messaging that meets rhetoric anger and frustration of the democratic base,” he added. “This is even more the case after the shutdown deal. California is still clearly a deep blue state with a significant voter registration for Democrats. A Republican still faces significant headwinds and the president’s unpopularity in the state and the diminishing Republican political infrastructure will continue to hamper any Republican aspirant.”\n\nBianco is betting that his long career in law enforcement will help him defy the odds and win the governor’s office. \n\nFirst elected sheriff in 2018 after decades with the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, he secured reelection in 2022 and publicly expressed interest in running for governor in June 2024. He drew widespread attention during the pandemic when he refused to enforce vaccine mandates for his employees, arguing that vaccination should remain a personal choice.\n\nCHRISTINE PELOSI RUNNING FOR CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE, NIXING OPPORTUNITY FOR MOTHER’S HOUSE SEAT \n\nHe also came under fire after a data leak in 2014 outed him as a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right, anti-government militia group whose members participated in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. Bianco has since said he is no longer a member of the organization because it “did not offer me anything.” \n\nOn his campaign website, he lists 11 priorities for the state, including, but not limited to, public safety, affordability, immigration, homelessness, insurance, energy, and emergency response. \n\nOn Bianco’s heels is former Fox News host Steve Hilton. \n\nHilton has spent the past three years traveling around California and listening to what voters are looking for. He recently told the Washington Examiner that affordability is the No. 1 concern. \n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the last Republican governor of California. He left office in 2011.","summary":"Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and fierce critic of Gov.

Also on board is Republican ad maker Pat McCarthy of DMM Media, best known for producing Trump’s viral “They/Them” ad targeting then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMcCarthy’s past work includes commercials for Gov.

A Democratic Socialist was elected mayor of New York City. And voters approved a redistricting proposal in California in response to Republican efforts to gain seats through gerrymandering in Texas and elsewhere.\n\nHere in Maine, voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to adopt a Republican proposal for Voter ID and additional restrictions to absentee voting, while also approving a gun safety measure with more than 60% of the vote.\n\nAs attention turns to 2026 races, political parties and pundits are pondering what it all means for Maine’s most consequential election cycle in recent history, beginning with the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate that pits an upstart progressive against an experienced two-term governor.\n\nBut Tuesday’s results do little to settle the internal dispute in the party between progressives and moderates — a dynamic that will play out in Maine’s senate primary between Gov. Janet Mills and Graham Platner.\n\nAll of it comes with a big caveat, too. The marquee matchup between Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and whoever wins the Democratic primary is still a year away. A lot can happen in that time.\n\n“(The election) couldn’t be summed up as anything other than a great day for Democrats,” said Mark Brewer, chair of political science at the University of Maine. “And it wasn’t a great day for any particular kind of Democrat. It was a great day for all kinds of Democrats.”\n\nProgressives are pointing to Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist state representative who won a three-way race to become New York City mayor. Mamdani, a 2014 Bowdoin College graduate, triumphed over Andrew Cuomo, who lost the primary to Mamdani and then ran as an independent.\n\nSigns also point to Democrats being less inclined to hold candidates to purity tests as they have in the past. Voters in Virginia, for example, elected Jay Jones as the state’s attorney general, despite text messages he sent three years fantasizing about killing Republican opponents.\n\nThat could help Planter’s campaign, which has been shaken by a series of old racist, sexist and homophobic Reddit posts and a tattoo of Nazi imagery that has since been covered.\n\nPlatner has said those posts were made when he was struggling from undiagnosed PTSD and depression and don’t represent him or his political views. He also says he didn’t know his tattoo, which he got in 2007 while drunk on liberty in Croatia, was a Nazi symbol until recently. \n\nModerates have a case to make as well, beginning in Virginia. Democrat Abigail Spanberger was elected governor with 57% support — a larger margin than Jones, who got 52%. And in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill, another moderate, was elected governor with 56% of the vote.\n\nMills celebrated those results by posting a photo of herself with Sherrill and Spanberger, congratulating “my good friends.”\n\nThe most surprising result in Maine last week was the overwhelming approval of a red flag law, which allows family and household members to petition a court to remove firearms access to people who are a threat.\n\nIn the past, voters have rejected gun safety measures and Question 2 was opposed by Mills, law enforcement and sportsmen. But it didn’t matter. The measure was approved with 63% support.\n\nJordan Wood, a 36-year-old Bristol resident who is running as a progressive in the U.S. Senate race, endorsed Question 2. The passage of Question 2 over Mills’ objection shows that “the governor was out of step with her electorate.”\n\nReading the national results, Wood believes voters were leaning towards younger candidates, though he conceded “Democratic voters are energized, engaged and showing up, and all of this, in spite of their anger at the Democratic Party.”\n\nNeither Mills’ nor Platner’s campaigns responded to interview requests.\n\nWhile the election may offer little guidance for the party’s identity crisis, Dan Shea, a political scientist at Colby College, said that exit polling shows major weaknesses for Republicans. \n\nShea said Trump voters proved they don’t show up unless his name is on the ballot and Democrats flipped voters who previously supported Trump.\n\nThat spells trouble for 72-year-old Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the only Republican running in a state won by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last year and who’s suffering from low approval ratings, Shea said. Collins’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Even though she’s been a little bit of a thorn on Trump’s side, she’s still part of the team,” Shea said. “She’s going to do the best she can to get out from under there, but there is some degree of guilt by association.”\n\nDemocrats thought they had Collins on the ropes in 2020 only to watch her win by 9 points over former state House Speaker Sara Gideon. But Trump was also on the ticket, boosting turnout of conservative voters that Shea said helped Collins, along with split ticket voters.\n\nTrump won’t be on the ballot in 2026 either.\n\n“They’ve got to be really worried,” Shea said.","summary":"Progressives and moderates both have cases to make as they battle for the Democratic party's identity.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/11/11/what-democratic-wins-last-week-tell-us-about-maines-u-s-senate-race/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/mills-platner-1.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 20:04:52","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":377994972,"title":"Trump's $1B Lawsuit Threat Casts Shadow over BBC, but It Could Also Be Bluff","text":"London (AP): President Donald Trump's threat to bring a billion-dollar lawsuit against the BBC has cast a shadow over the British broadcaster's future, but it could also be a bluff with little legal merit. The president's lawyer sent the threat to the BBC over the way a documentary edited his Jan 6, 2021, speech before a mob of his followers stormed the US Capitol. Trump's history of suing news media companies sometimes winning multimillion-dollar settlements is part of a long-running grievance against the industry he describes as fake news that has often focused a critical eye on his actions. But Trump faces fundamental challenges to getting a case to court, never mind taking it to trial. He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him. If he sues, he opens a Pandora's box and inside is every damning quote he's ever uttered about the steal,' said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the US and UK. The BBC's Panorama series aired the hourlong documentary titled Trump: A Second Chance? days before the 2024 US presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and fight like hell . Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. BBC Chairman Samir Shah apologised Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave \"the impression of a direct call for violent action. Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing. Trump's options to sue in the UK evaporated two weeks ago, when the one-year deadline to file a lawsuit expired. Trump could still bring a defamation claim in several US states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC. Filing a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury. Before any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC programme was not aired in the US, and the BBC's streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a programme they could not watch, Stephens said. The other ticklish problem for Trump's lawyer was that Trump's reputation was already pretty battered after Jan 6,\" he said. Alleging Panorama' caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters ... is a tough sell. Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate. Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for no less than $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form. The letter demanded an apology to the president and a full and fair retraction of the documentary along with other false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements about Trump. It also said the president should be appropriately compensated for overwhelming financial and reputational harm. The letter cites Florida's defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organisations five days before any lawsuit can be filed. If the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 pm EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said. The BBC is on notice, it said. While many legal experts have dismissed the president's claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against US media companies. In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded. That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount's need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media. Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the US Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding. George Freeman, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Centre in New York, said the billion-dollar figure cited by Trump's lawyer was totally meaningless . ...","summary":"Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/news/trumps-1b-lawsuit-threat-casts-shadow-over-bbc-but-it-could-also-be-bluff-1916413","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/11/1977182-g5bxg9bcamf7xv.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 19:39:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":377984246,"title":"Editing video takes on new significance, as BBC uproar shows","text":"In the space of a few months, one of the more straightforward journalistic tasks — editing tape for broadcast — has been behind a $16 million legal settlement, a network’s change in how it offers interviews on a news show and, now, the resignation of two top leaders at the BBC.\n\nThe other common denominator: President Donald Trump.\n\nBritain’s BBC is reeling this week following the resignations of its director-general, Tim Davie, and news chief Deborah Turness amid accusations of bias in the editing of last year’s documentary, “Trump: A Second Chance.” The BBC admitted filmmakers spliced together quotes from different sections of the speech Trump made before the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol to make it seem like he was directly urging violence.\n\nTrump sued CBS’ parent company over a “60 Minutes” edit of Kamala Harris’ interview, resulting in this summer’s settlement, and the complaints of his Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, about her “Face the Nation” interview in August caused a policy change.\n\nIn a different time, the BBC episode would likely have led to a quick admission of a mistake, a correction, apology and everyone would have moved on, said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive and now dean of Hofstra University’s School of Communication.\n\n“But in an era where every editing decision taken in a newsroom is now under a microscope and can be weaponized for political purposes,” he said, “it’s got to be something that is causing real caution in newsrooms all over the world now.”\n\nEditing decisions were once largely behind the scenes\n\nQuestioning edits is another tool for the president to strike back at journalists who displease him. He has restricted access by The Associated Press after its decision not to follow his lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico, sued outlets like The New York Times and Wall Street Journal and stripped funding for public broadcasting because he doesn’t like its news coverage.\n\nMuch like print reporters who search through notebooks for the perfect quote, video editors often labor to identify footage that will advance a story.\n\nSometimes the perfect image does not exist, or a quote isn’t as succinct or sharp as a medium under constant time constraints demands. That can lead to the temptation to rearrange or even manipulate.\n\nNBC News got in trouble more than a decade ago for a story about George Zimmerman — who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a young man who was in his Florida gated community. It quoted Zimmerman talking to a police dispatcher about Martin, saying “this guy looks like he’s up to no good. He looks Black.”\n\nIn reality, Zimmerman’s description of Martin’s activities last longer, and his speculation about Martin’s race was a direct response to a police dispatcher’s question about it. Zimmerman sued NBC News for libel, a case later thrown out by a judge. NBC apologized to its viewers.\n\nKatie Couric apologized in 2016 when an editor for her “Under the Gun” documentary inserted an eight-second pause after footage of Couric questioning guns right activists about background checks. The activists actually responded right away.\n\nQuotes artificially compressed in BBC documentary\n\nIn the BBC edit, different parts of Trump’s 2021 Capitol speech are edited to appear as a single quote: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” \n\nBut the second two sentences of that quote were actually said nearly an hour later than the first sentence, and part of his speech where he said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully was omitted.\n\nIn teaching video editing to students at Syracuse University, Jamie Hoskins said she repeatedly emphasizes the need not to be misleading. She’s a former news producer who worked in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I talk about that in every class at every level,” she said. “You don’t want to mischaracterize what people are saying or change their meaning by piecing things together.”\n\nThe proliferation of video — ever shorter, ever snappier — on TikTok and Instagram adds to pressure placed on journalists. The ability of AI to manufacture completely false video is yet another complication. Fake, racist video of Black food assistance recipients complaining about missing benefits due to the government shutdown spread online; a Fox News digital story linked to some of the videos earlier this month and had to be corrected.\n\n“We live in a world now where people can get content from everywhere,” Hoskins said. “There is a difference between content and journalism.”\n\nA new way to protect against complaints\n\nAt the root of Trump’s complaint about “60 Minutes” was an exchange between correspondent Bill Whitaker and Kamala Harris, the president’s opponent in last year’s election. CBS aired two different reports — on “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” — depicting Harris giving two different answers to a Whitaker question about the war in the Mideast.\n\nCBS News said both responses were part of Harris’ long-winded answer to the same question. But to people who saw both broadcasts, the effect was jarring; other news outlets say they have a strict policy, when they show an interviewer posing a question, that the immediate, direct response is aired.\n\nCBS News defended it as routine editing. But it gave Trump an opening to charge that it was done to benefit Harris’ campaign.\n\n“I don’t think the practices and standards are worse today than they were a few years ago,” Lukasiewicz said. “I think the consequences of mistakes are more serious than perhaps they used to be,” he said, because of the ability and willingness of politicians to seize on them.\n\nIn Noem’s pre-taped talk with “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan this summer, the Homeland Security secretary complained CBS News had “shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth.” The network had shortened the interview, removing some accusations Noem had made about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the immigrant deported by the Trump administration.\n\nIn response, the network said that it would only air interviews on “Face the Nation” that were conducted live or, if taped in advance, would have to air in full.\n\nMore often, networks are defusing potential editing controversies by posting online full, unedited transcripts of key interviews, Lukasiewicz said. CBS News did that immediately when it aired a pre-taped edited interview with Trump on Nov. 2, along with video. The network didn’t release a transcript of its Harris interview for more than three months — not until Trump had sued and the FCC launched an investigation of the news division.\n\nThe Trump transcript release created its own issues, with dozens of amateur editors comparing the transcript to the shorter, edited interview that aired on “60 Minutes” to see what producers had decided to leave out.\n\nThis time, though, Trump had no complaints.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\n“If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box and inside is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about the ‘steal,’” said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nThe BBC documentary\n\nThe BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hourlong documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nBBC Chairman Samir Shah apologized Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.\n\nFrom to letter to lawsuit\n\nA lawsuit in England is unlikely because the one-year deadline to bring one expired two weeks ago, experts said. If successful in overcoming that barrier, libel awards in the High Court rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000), experts said.\n\nTrump could still bring a defamation claim in several U.S. states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.\n\nFiling a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different.

But he said Trump’s willingness to use lawsuits as a form of deal-making could leverage a payout because the edit was indefensible.\n\n“Putting aside the theatrics of a bombastic letter with its senseless $1 billion claim, there is a power play here which Trump has done many times before,” Green said on The Law and Policy Blog. “The real mistake of the BBC (and the production company) was opening itself up to such a play of power.”\n\nStephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.\n\nBut he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage from revisiting the Jan. 6 events that would be dredged up at trial.\n\nHe said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.\n\n“The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?’” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

Without water, no life could persist. She is a creator with the power to destroy. Her rage can wash away whole cities in the frenzy of tsunami waves. Before we know our mothers, we know water. She is the first sound we hear in our mother’s womb before we come into life on this planet. \n\nIt seems fitting then, that for its final act, Norwest Gallery of Art is choosing to honor the spirit of water. The Black-woman owned space in Grandmont-Rosedale is preparing to close its doors with a final exhibit titled, Water, on display now until Dec. 21. December will mark eight years since the gallery first opened.\n\n“I’m tired,” Norwest Gallery owner and artist Asia Hamilton tells Metro Times, citing financial strain. “It made sense financially to shut this down. And that is what’s driving me. If I go on sentiment alone, I would not be able to close this space… We’ve shown hundreds, and I’m not exaggerating, hundreds of artists have come through here. We’ve had local celebrities, international talent and celebs, our government officials. This has definitely been an anchor and beacon of light in the community. It’s time to wrap it up.”\n\nWater was curated by Doug Jones, a self-professed water nerd. \n\n“It’s all interconnected, just like water,” he says. He’s talking about the pieces in the exhibit, but perhaps he means everything — the greater ecosystem of all life on this planet, human or otherwise. He continues, “Our rain is our ocean, is our river, is our stream.”\n\nThe gallery is permeated by the sound of a shifting sonic installation by Maro J. Kayira and Ethan Marshall Cohen that reacts to the number of people, movement, and sounds in the space. The pair created the installation by embedding submersible microphones in ice to record the sound of it melting. Rather than a simple loop, the installation will change as it interacts with gallery visitors. \n\n“From the minute I push play, our presence in this space is contributing to what we’re hearing,” Jones explains. Going back to his idea of everything being interconnected, he says about the installation, “Even as this water evaporates, so to speak, it’s going to visit us again in another form.”\n\nOther featured artists include Hamilton, Shirley Woodson, Senghor Reid, Ijania Cortez, LaPorcshia Winfield, Gyona Rice, Oshun Williams, Joe Cazeno III, Ian Solomon, and more, across paintings, illustrations, photography, video, and sculptures. \n\nIjania Cortez tells us her painting “Lusteration” is about baptism, recreating the feeling when a person comes into contact with water, and how it changes their spirit.c\n\nLike water, Hamilton has had to be fluid in the face of obstacles — like a stream rolling gracefully around the rocks and debris in her path — to keep the gallery open. \n\nThe Yoruba Orisha Yemoja, a motherly deity of the ocean, is present. Not only figuratively, but literally in the many depictions of cowrie shells across the show and in Nawili’s sculptural collage dedicated to her. \n\n“I’ve been threatening to close the gallery for years,” she tells Metro Times. “But every now and then we’d get a lump sum of money and then it’d be like, oh, we can keep going… We wouldn’t have survived this long without [community support]. But we needed more support. It was just enough support to pay the bills, not to pay me. I was still out here freelancing. I’ve also had full-time jobs while I’ve had this business.”\n\nShe had planned to close the gallery back in 2024 after having to pay the gallery’s rent and bills out of her own pocket. Then she got a call about hosting a campaign party for former presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter three visits by Harris’s campaign team (including about 20 secret service agents checking her internet and phone connections) and being sworn to secrecy, it finally hit Hamilton that Harris was actually coming to Norwest.\n\n“It wasn’t so much that she was running for president. She was the Vice President of the United States of America. You know what I’m saying?” Hamilton reminisces. “They shut this whole block down. They had helicopters and secret service people. You could not come over here at all.”\n\nShe continues, “Mind you, a week before this, I had just prepped Simone [the gallery assistant] and told her that I’m closing the gallery. That week, a few days before Kamala came in, someone got engaged in the gallery… We done did everything. We done had weddings, baby showers, and repasses. They’ve seen it all right here at Norwest. So that happened, and now [Harris] came. So I was like, all right God, whatchu trying to say? You said keep it open one more year? Bet.”\n\nWhen she first opened the gallery, Hamilton wanted to create a space for emerging Black artists to showcase their work, which she felt Detroit was lacking at the time. \n\n“I had been through so much as an artist coming along, just being just turned down,” she remembers. “Back then, you’d go into galleries with your portfolio, and you either had to have a following, which was not [on] Instagram, or know somebody. You had to create a following based on your own footwork. So when I started the space, there weren’t any spaces really for emerging artists. There was a huge gap there, and since then that gap has been filled, and not just by Norwest. There’s so many other spaces that are now showcasing emerging and contemporary Black artists.”\n\nShe adds, as a final thought, “I would’ve loved to have kept the space open. But we can’t just keep the space open on love alone. We need to support as a community, our art spaces, our institutions, and not just the [Detroit Institute of Arts] that gets paid by the millage.”\n\nThough Norwest Gallery is closing, Hamilton plans to do pop up art installations and continue her Womxnhouse Detroit artist residency. She is also hosting a summit at Art Basel Miami Beach for arts administrators in December.\n\nNorwest Gallery of Art is located at 19556 Grand River Ave., Detroit and is open noon-6 p.m., Friday and Saturdays, and noon-4 p.m. Sundays for viewings of Water.\n\nEditor’s Note: This writer was a featured artist of Womxnhouse Detroit 2022.","url":"https://www.metrotimes.com/arts/arts-stories-interviews/norwest-gallery-of-art-set-to-close-with-final-exhibit-water/","image":"https://www.metrotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6462-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 18:33:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":377982386,"title":"'Three-Dimensional Chess:' Kamala Harris Once Again Rewrites Her Disastrous 2024 Election Performance","text":"Kamala Harris is back once again with an extremely interesting new angle on her 2024 election failure. \n\nHer memoir \"107 Days\" was released a couple of months ago, and she is about to wrap up her book tour (one that Democrats aren't too wild about, by the way) with a final stop on November 20. Not too terribly long ago, Harris told Stephen Colbert she was stepping away from politics because the \"system is broken\" — only to tease a 2028 run at the end of October.\n\nNow she's back, and she's rewriting history once again with a wild claim she was playing \"three-dimensional chess\" against President Trump.\n\n🚨NEW: Kamala Harris on campaigning against TRUMP🤣\"I understood the game that was being played. And I made a decision that I wasn't gonna get played.\"*CACKLES*\"Three-dimensional chess!\"Maybe she lost because Trump was playing 4D chess while she was playing 3D😂… pic.twitter.com/0EHXYIwuo4— Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) November 11, 2025\n\n\"I was aware of my opponent's strategy, and I wasn't about to fall prey,\" Kamala said, laughing. \"Part of his strategy, and those around him, was to try and take me off our game and message. And I wasn't about to be distracted by those...flames that he was trying to throw to get me away from my highest priority, which was talking to people about the economy.\"\n\n\"So I understood the game that was being played. And I made the decision that I wasn't gonna get played,\" Harris added.\n\nOf course, Harris did talk about the economy during the campaign. Namely, she admitted that the price of groceries skyrocketed during the Biden-Harris administration. \"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans. Like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic...a loaf of bread cost 50 percent more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50 percent.\"\n\nHer \"economic plan\" relied on $1.7 trillion in handouts and a ban on grocery store \"price gouging\" that didn't play well with economists. At the time, Adam Michel, the director of Tax Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, told The New York Post, \"The CRFB estimates make it clear that the Harris agenda—like Biden’s before it—will be fiscally reckless and economically damaging. Writing people large checks and enforcing price controls is a recipe for expanding demand and shrinking supply, creating shortages and necessitating rationing.\"\n\nIn 1971, Republican Richard Nixon attempted to combat rising grocery prices by banning price gouging. What happened instead was \"ranchers stopped shipping cattle to the market, farmers drowned their chickens, and consumers emptied the shelves of supermarkets.\" There was no reason to believe such a measure under President Harris would have any different outcome.\n\nAnd the cherry on top of this sundae? When asked on The View if she'd have done anything different from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris repeatedly said no. That's when she lost the election.\n\nHarris wasn't playing \"three dimensional chess\" against Trump. She was trying to play three dimensional chess against her own failed record and the disaster that was the Biden-Harris administration. And she lost.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/11/11/kamala-3d-chess-trump-n2666258","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/304/971a5fa0-863a-455b-b915-b95c317fcfc8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 18:30:07","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":377963974,"title":"Who is Jessica Alba's ex-husband?

Jessica also included a poem by the poet Cleo Wade, which in part read: '\"Yes I am voting for my daughters and mama and neighbors and friends but I am also voting for damn myself.\"\n\nWhat did Cash tell HELLO! about raising children with Jessica?\n\nCash previously spoke with HELLO! about balancing the responsibilities of parenthood with work, and creating an \"open line of communication\" between the parents and their children. \"Family dinner is extremely important for us,\" he said. \"I think it's just learning how to communicate and talking through it, and allowing for mistake-making. At least with our 16-year-old, it's proven super valuable.\"\n\nThe film producer noted that each of their kids was \"so different,\" adding: \"So there is no manual, there's no playbook, there's no kind of, 'What works here is definitely going to work over there.' Each kid is different, so it requires a unique approach to anything you're going through or dealing with.\"\n\n\"That has been one of the harder things, that each kid is so different, and so they require their own new set of rules and parameters,\" he added. \"It's enjoyable. It keeps us on our toes, and it keeps us young. Having kids, having teenage girls, keeps Jessica and I young.\"\n\nWho is Jessica dating now?\n\nJessica took her romance with Top Gun: Maverick actor Danny Ramirez public in late 2025 after they sparked buzz of a relationship when they were spotted together in July, six months after Jessica announced that she and Cash were divorcing.\n\nJessica and Danny have been quietly attending public events together, putting their relationship in the spotlight at the annual Baby2Baby Gala in Los Angeles on Saturday, November 8 where they were snapped together inside, posing alongside stars like Orlando Bloom, Simu Liu and Serena Williams. \n\nThey also hard-launched their romance on social media, sharing pictures of each other from their glamorous night out.","summary":"Jessica Alba and Cash Warren shared the heartbreaking news in January 2025 that after almost 20 years of marriage, they had split.

Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021. Gibb also sits on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) along with BBC chair and committee head Samir Shah, Tim Davie and independent director Caroline Thomson.\n\nThe BBC, responding to queries from the Guardian, said Gibb was only one of the four board members who approved Prescott as a consultant to EGSC. Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nOctober 28, 2024: BBC Panorama programme airs\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He was not directly referencing the march on the Capitol in the second part, and the Panorama documentary did not include a part where Trump said he wanted supporters to “peacefully” make their voices heard.\n\nJanuary 16, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed by EGSC\n\nConcerns about the editing of the Trump speech were raised at a meeting of the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board (EGSB). However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFebruary 2025: BBC forced to remove Gaza documentary\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through Israel’s war on Gaza had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nMay 12, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed again by EGSC\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nMay 13, 2025: Prescott emails concerns to BBC chair Samir Shah\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nJune 2025: Review of the EGSC’s processes begins\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since 2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear. \n\nJune 2025: Prescott leaves the BBC\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nJuly 2025: BBC journalists complain about Gaza coverage\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nOctober 17, 2025: Prescott’s memo is reviewed at a full board meeting\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nNovember 3, 2025: Prescott’s memo is leaked to the Daily Telegraph\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Parliamentary committee writes to BBC chair\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote in the letter. \n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: BBC pushes back\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Memo discussed at heated BBC board meeting\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nNovember 5, 2025: Prescott to give evidence to Parliament\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: The White House comments\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson steps in\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nNovember 9, 2025: Davie and Turness resign\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nNovember 9, 2025: US President Donald Trump weighs in\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Samir Shah denies institutional bias\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited. However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Trump threatens $1bn law suit\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits. \n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”. \n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages. The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY”.\n\nNovember 11, 2025: BBC bosses address staff\n\nOutgoing Director-General Davie and BBC chair Samir Shah spoke to staff for 40 minutes. Davie admitted a “mistake” in the Panorama documentary and said that pressure following criticism of the film had contributed to his decision to resign. However, he also sounded a defiant note, and told staff, “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/inside-the-year-long-bbc-saga-that-led-to-trumps-1bn-lawsuit-threat/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T115643Z_179756922_RC2MTHAJ47XM_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-BBC-1762869067-aIobyo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 18:06:22","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.111},{"id":377969028,"title":"Inside the year-long BBC saga that led to Trump’s $1bn lawsuit threat  - Trinidad Tribune – Latest Trinidad","text":"US President Donald Trump has threatened the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over the editing of a 2021 speech he gave shortly before protesters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s threat on Monday evening is the latest turn in a saga which has embroiled the corporation for the past week, following the leak of a memo which criticised the BBC’s impartiality in a number of areas of its coverage.\n\nIn particular, the memo, which was written by a former BBC journalist and independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board, Michal Prescott, singled out the misleading editing of Trump’s speech, which was featured in a Panorama documentary aired shortly before the US election last year.\n\nThe leaked memo has prompted outrage, mostly from right-wing media organisations and politicians, and prompted the resignations of Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness on Sunday.\n\nAs a public broadcaster that is funded by a mandatory licence fee for all households in possession of a television, the BBC faces intense scrutiny from all sides of the political divide, with some claiming it is too conservative in its coverage, and others saying it is too left-leaning.\n\nThe organisation has also weathered several scandals in recent years over the behaviour of some of its presenters, as well as complaints from its journalists over its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThis year, it was forced to drop former professional footballer and sports commentator Gary Lineker over a pro-Palestine Instagram post that was widely seen as anti-Semitic.\n\nSome media insiders say this is all part of a push by right-wing figures in the BBC to reassert control over the BBC’s editorial content.

However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Trump threatens $1bn law suit\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits. \n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”. \n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages.

As RedState reported, the failed 2024 Democrat nominee and former vice president is peddling a new book, doing her best to rewrite history in her favor. Part of that requires convincing Americans that she wasn't given a fair shot, both because of Joe Biden's late exit from the race and the dynamics surrounding President Donald Trump. \n\nRELATED: Kamala Harris Explodes With Profanity-Filled Tirade Against Trump\n\nOf course, that's not really the truth, is it? She's going to try, though, and that apparently includes claiming her 2024 campaign was \"3D chess\" in which she outmaneuvered Trump.\n\nHARRIS: I was aware of my opponent's strategy, and I wasn't about to fall prey, or fall into those traps, and part of his strategy and those around him were to try to take me off our game and message. And I wasn't about to be distracted by those little flames, those flames that he was trying to throw, to get me away from what of, my highest priority, which was talking to people about the economy and their wellbeing in terms of their financial wellbeing. And that's, so I understood the game that was being played, and I made the decision that I wasn't gonna get played.(Laughter)HOST: Chess, not checkersHARRIS: Yeah, three-dimensional chess, I'm telling you!\n\nMan, she's not good at this. I know it's an overused joke at this point, but she sounds inebriated with her fumbling over words and slow pace of speech halfway through. Whether she actually is or not isn't really the point. The point is that whatever is to blame, her delivery and personal connection to any audience are severely lacking. Even the way she constantly changes her accent and grammar comes across as nakedly inauthentic, which has been her biggest downfall from the beginning. You can convince people to vote for bad ideas, as sad a reality as that is, but it's hard to convince people to vote for someone who is so clearly manufactured. \n\nThe mistake for Democrats would be assuming she can finally turn a corner. It's like sticking with a starting quarterback who played an entire season and never won a game. Whatever redeeming qualities you might think exist, you can't keep running it back with someone so flawed. None of this would be a question if Harris didn't check multiple intersectional boxes that provide an immediate boost within the party. Heck, none of us would know her name because she never would have gotten as far as she did. That's the minefield Democrats had to navigate in 2024 in handing her the nomination without a fight, and they'll have to navigate it again in 2028. \n\nAs for the idea that she was playing (and allegedly winning) \"three-dimensional chess\" against Trump, I think the results speak for themselves. Bragging about a strategy that failed miserably speaks to a clinical level of hubris, but again, the point here is to pretend she was facing a no-win situation. In her mind, if she had just been given the entire cycle, her message would have pierced the hearts of voters, and everything would have been different. That was never the case, and if anything, the shortened timeframe following Joe Biden's pull-out ranged from benefiting her (especially early on) to being a wash. Harris is who she is. She's never going to get better at this, and Democrats can fail to learn that lesson at their own peril. Nothing would make Republicans happier, though. \n\nEditor’s Note: After more than 40 days of screwing Americans, a few Dems have finally caved.

Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021.

Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nOctober 28, 2024: BBC Panorama programme airs\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He was not directly referencing the march on the Capitol in the second part, and the Panorama documentary did not include a part where Trump said he wanted supporters to “peacefully” make their voices heard.\n\nJanuary 16, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed by EGSC\n\nConcerns about the editing of the Trump speech were raised at a meeting of the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board (EGSB). However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFebruary 2025: BBC forced to remove Gaza documentary\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through Israel’s war on Gaza had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nMay 12, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed again by EGSC\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nMay 13, 2025: Prescott emails concerns to BBC chair Samir Shah\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nJune 2025: Review of the EGSC’s processes begins\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since 2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear. \n\nJune 2025: Prescott leaves the BBC\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nJuly 2025: BBC journalists complain about Gaza coverage\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nOctober 17, 2025: Prescott’s memo is reviewed at a full board meeting\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nNovember 3, 2025: Prescott’s memo is leaked to the Daily Telegraph\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Parliamentary committee writes to BBC chair\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote in the letter. \n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: BBC pushes back\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Memo discussed at heated BBC board meeting\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nNovember 5, 2025: Prescott to give evidence to Parliament\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: The White House comments\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson steps in\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nNovember 9, 2025: Davie and Turness resign\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nNovember 9, 2025: US President Donald Trump weighs in\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Samir Shah denies institutional bias\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited.

He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n “If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box and inside is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about the steal,’” said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the US and UK.\n The BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hourlong documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 US presidential election.\n It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell”. Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n BBC Chairman Samir Shah apologised Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action”.\n Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.\n Trump’s options to sue in the UK evaporated two weeks ago, when the one-year deadline to file a lawsuit expired.\n Trump could still bring a defamation claim in several US states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.\n Filing a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury.\n Before any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC programme was not aired in the US, and the BBC’s streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a programme they could not watch, Stephens said.\n “The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan 6,” he said. “Alleging Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters … is a tough sell.” Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.\n Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.\n The letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\n It also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.” The letter cites Florida’s defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organisations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.\n If the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 pm EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.\n “The BBC is on notice,” it said.\n While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against US media companies.\n In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\n That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.\n Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the US Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.\n George Freeman, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Centre in New York, said the billion-dollar figure cited by Trump’s lawyer was “totally meaningless”.\n Freeman told BBC Radio that Trump’s frequent — and often unsuccessful — litigation against the media is surpassed by the threatening letters that don’t lead to lawsuits.\n “They’re just there to threaten and to scare media he doesn’t like,” Freeman said.\n Stephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organisation that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the UK.\n But he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage that could come from revisiting the events of Jan 6 that would be dredged up in any trial.\n He said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.\n “The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.” (AP) SCY SCY","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trumps-1b-lawsuit-threat-casts-shadow-over-bbc-but-it-could-also-be-bluff-9700318.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 17:42:30","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":377953880,"title":"Inside the year-long BBC saga that led to Trump’s $1bn lawsuit threat  - Dominica Gazette – Dominica &amp;","text":"US President Donald Trump has threatened the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over the editing of a 2021 speech he gave shortly before protesters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s threat on Monday evening is the latest turn in a saga which has embroiled the corporation for the past week, following the leak of a memo which criticised the BBC’s impartiality in a number of areas of its coverage.\n\nIn particular, the memo, which was written by a former BBC journalist and independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board, Michal Prescott, singled out the misleading editing of Trump’s speech, which was featured in a Panorama documentary aired shortly before the US election last year.\n\nThe leaked memo has prompted outrage, mostly from right-wing media organisations and politicians, and prompted the resignations of Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness on Sunday.\n\nAs a public broadcaster that is funded by a mandatory licence fee for all households in possession of a television, the BBC faces intense scrutiny from all sides of the political divide, with some claiming it is too conservative in its coverage, and others saying it is too left-leaning.\n\nThe organisation has also weathered several scandals in recent years over the behaviour of some of its presenters, as well as complaints from its journalists over its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThis year, it was forced to drop former professional footballer and sports commentator Gary Lineker over a pro-Palestine Instagram post that was widely seen as anti-Semitic.\n\nSome media insiders say this is all part of a push by right-wing figures in the BBC to reassert control over the BBC’s editorial content.

However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFebruary 2025: BBC forced to remove Gaza documentary\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through Israel’s war on Gaza had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nMay 12, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed again by EGSC\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nMay 13, 2025: Prescott emails concerns to BBC chair Samir Shah\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nJune 2025: Review of the EGSC’s processes begins\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since 2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear. \n\nJune 2025: Prescott leaves the BBC\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nJuly 2025: BBC journalists complain about Gaza coverage\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nOctober 17, 2025: Prescott’s memo is reviewed at a full board meeting\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nNovember 3, 2025: Prescott’s memo is leaked to the Daily Telegraph\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Parliamentary committee writes to BBC chair\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote in the letter. \n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: BBC pushes back\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Memo discussed at heated BBC board meeting\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nNovember 5, 2025: Prescott to give evidence to Parliament\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: The White House comments\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson steps in\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nNovember 9, 2025: Davie and Turness resign\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nNovember 9, 2025: US President Donald Trump weighs in\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Samir Shah denies institutional bias\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited. However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Trump threatens $1bn law suit\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits. \n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”. \n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages. The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY”.\n\nNovember 11, 2025: BBC bosses address staff\n\nOutgoing Director-General Davie and BBC chair Samir Shah spoke to staff for 40 minutes. Davie admitted a “mistake” in the Panorama documentary and said that pressure following criticism of the film had contributed to his decision to resign. However, he also sounded a defiant note, and told staff, “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/inside-the-year-long-bbc-saga-that-led-to-trumps-1bn-lawsuit-threat/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T115643Z_179756922_RC2MTHAJ47XM_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-BBC-1762869067-j6T9OZ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 17:32:52","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":0.111},{"id":377954666,"title":"PA Election Results Signal Danger For The GOP in 2026","text":"Authored by John Hinshaw via RealClearPennsylvania,\n\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is pretty evenly divided, so why did voters send such a lopsided signal?\n\nIn terms of voter registration, Pennsylvanians divide their loyalty between the Republican and Democratic parties. Yet more than 60% of voters supported the retention of Democratic Supreme Court justices. \n\nDecennial off-year elections for judges are notoriously quirky things, and only one justice has lost a retention election since 1968. And as the GOP’s base has become less country club and more country, Democrats hold an edge in more educated voters, who reliably vote even in municipal elections.\n\nHowever, this was not a particularly low-turnout election. About 40% of the electorate showed up, or about two thirds more than in 2015, when these justices were first elected. This reflects the large amounts of money that Republican and Democratic groups spent to raise awareness and to encourage participation.\n\nMoreover, in two judicial elections where a Republican faced a Democrat, Democrats won around 56% of the vote. Other down ballot elections tell a similar story of a blue wave. Democrats swept control over the Luzerne County Council. In Allegheny County, Republicans lost all but eleven elections they contested. School board elections in suburban Philadelphia likewise saw a Democratic sweep.\n\nThe elections signal the erosion of once-stalwart Republican strongholds, such as Lancaster County. In 2015, Democrats won just under 36% of the vote in that year’s judicial election. In 2025, that figure was 48%. Likewise, Democrats increased their share of the electorate from 45% to 62% of the vote. In more rural counties, like Perry or Juniata, Republicans held onto voters. The problem is that increasingly voters are living in Southern or Eastern counties that more closely resemble counties like Lancaster or Chester than Perry or Juniata.\n\nDemocrats were energized by the Trump presidency for a host of reasons that you can imagine for yourselves. Likewise, Republican voters were not particularly energized, if for no other reason than President Trump was not on the ballot.\n\n* * *Please consider supporting ZeroHedge with the purchase of a hat or a multitool...\n\nOf course, one swallow does not make a summer, but if this is the electorate that shows up in 2026, Republicans would likely lose some vulnerable seats in the House of Representatives (like Mackenzie and Perry) and likely control over that body. Republicans certainly hope that the economy improves for everyday voters by the midterms and are downplaying these election results.\n\nIn our era of nationalized elections, local elections are reasonably good indications of how, and who, will show up to vote. So, let’s glean what we can from the races in Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia.\n\nUntil Tuesday, Republicans had high hopes that they were assembling a diverse working-class coalition. In 2024, significant numbers of working-class Latinos and African Americans voted for Trump. That support evaporated on Tuesday. \n\nIn Virginia, Republicans lost whatever ground the GOP had gained with Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. The spread between the 2024 and 2025 races indicate a loss of 20% of the vote share of Latino voters, 11% of Blacks, 42% of Asian Americans, and 17% of those with incomes under $100,000. This is why Abigail Spanberger won, and Democrats picked up 13 seats in the House of Burgesses. The shift in Latino voters was also evident in New Jersey. In Union City, a city that is more than 80% Latino, more supported Sherill than had voted for Kamala Harris last year. \n\nGeorgia also had elections on Tuesday, and Democrats won their first state-wide elections since 2006, flipping two seats on the Public Services Commission. This was a low turnout election, with about 20-30% of the rate of the last presidential race. (Morris breaks down figures by county). Morris observes a consistent shift in Democratic vote share, consistent with the new reality that Democratic voters tend to show up for off-year elections more so than Republican voters.\n\nBut Virginia and New Jersey’s elections were not low turnout affairs. There, turnout was about 65-80% of the size of 2024 presidential election. There, the same pattern emerges of a strong shift toward Democrats. \n\nExit polls showed that around two thirds of voters concerned about the economy voted for Democratic governors. In 2024, Trump won 81% of those voters. That’s a 93% shift in voter sentiment on that issue and should be a klaxon for Republican elected officials. These election results indicate that Democrats are overperforming their 2024 baseline by 8% points. That’s a strong indication of a blue wave like in 2018.\n\nIt’s quite possible that the electorate’s mood will sour more by 2026. Today, voters are dealing with higher prices, which they hate, and levels of economic pessimism are growing due to tariffs, the threat of AI on jobs, etc. The labor market is not booming, but we have not yet experienced the kinds of layoffs that typically accompany recessions. Last Tuesday voters were worried about rising costs of health insurance, or the possibility of hospital closures; by 2026, those will be realities they are living with. \n\nIt's likely that the government shut down had raised the profile of the cuts to health care subsidies, or Medicaid, or SNAP, and that voters’ anxiety or anger about that has peaked. Perhaps forces will shift voters’ attentions to culture war issues.\n\nIf not, or if the economy deteriorates further, voters’ moods would darken further and likely take it out on the party in control of government. In this election cycle, Democrats came close to winning the partisan judicial races in ruby red counties like Washington (where Trump won 63% of the vote), or Adams, where Trump won 66% of the vote. In that scenario, Republicans would likely lose control over the state Senate.\n\nBuckle up, we’re in for a heck of a ride.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/pa-election-results-signal-danger-gop-2026","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/701899_jpg_92.jpg?itok=V02UnrJP","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 17:25:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":377957140,"title":"Inside the year-long BBC saga that led to Trump’s $1bn lawsuit threat  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily Puerto","text":"US President Donald Trump has threatened the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over the editing of a 2021 speech he gave shortly before protesters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s threat on Monday evening is the latest turn in a saga which has embroiled the corporation for the past week, following the leak of a memo which criticised the BBC’s impartiality in a number of areas of its coverage.\n\nIn particular, the memo, which was written by a former BBC journalist and independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board, Michal Prescott, singled out the misleading editing of Trump’s speech, which was featured in a Panorama documentary aired shortly before the US election last year.\n\nThe leaked memo has prompted outrage, mostly from right-wing media organisations and politicians, and prompted the resignations of Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness on Sunday.\n\nAs a public broadcaster that is funded by a mandatory licence fee for all households in possession of a television, the BBC faces intense scrutiny from all sides of the political divide, with some claiming it is too conservative in its coverage, and others saying it is too left-leaning.\n\nThe organisation has also weathered several scandals in recent years over the behaviour of some of its presenters, as well as complaints from its journalists over its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThis year, it was forced to drop former professional footballer and sports commentator Gary Lineker over a pro-Palestine Instagram post that was widely seen as anti-Semitic.\n\nSome media insiders say this is all part of a push by right-wing figures in the BBC to reassert control over the BBC’s editorial content. Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021. Gibb also sits on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) along with BBC chair and committee head Samir Shah, Tim Davie and independent director Caroline Thomson.\n\nThe BBC, responding to queries from the Guardian, said Gibb was only one of the four board members who approved Prescott as a consultant to EGSC. Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nOctober 28, 2024: BBC Panorama programme airs\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell.

However, this might simply be a strategic move with minimal legal grounding.\n\nThe legal warning from Trump’s attorney was prompted by the BBC’s editing of a documentary concerning Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021, just before a group of his supporters launched an attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump is no stranger to litigating against media organizations, having previously secured significant settlements in some cases. This is part of his broader campaign against what he terms “fake news”—a media landscape that has frequently scrutinized his conduct.\n\nDespite his litigious history, Trump could encounter significant obstacles in advancing this case to the courtroom. Moreover, the legal proceedings might reignite media attention on his contentious remarks made during a rally on the day Congress was set to affirm Joe Biden’s presidential win—a victory Trump has persistently and falsely claimed was illegitimately taken from him.\n\n“By initiating a lawsuit, he risks unleashing a Pandora’s box that includes every incriminating statement he’s made regarding the ‘stolen’ election,” commented Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer with experience in both the U.S. and U.K.\n\nThe BBC’s documentary continues to draw attention as the situation unfolds.\n\nThe BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hourlong documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nBBC Chairman Samir Shah apologized Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.\n\nFrom to letter to lawsuit\n\nTrump’s options to sue in the U.K. evaporated two weeks ago, when the one-year deadline to file a lawsuit expired.\n\nTrump could still bring a defamation claim in several U.S. states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.\n\nFiling a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury.\n\nBefore any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC program was not aired in the U.S., and the BBC’s streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a program they could not watch, Stephens said.\n\n“The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan. 6,” he said. “Alleging ‘Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters … is a tough sell.”\n\nTrump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nThe demands\n\nTrump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.\n\nThe letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\n\nIt also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n\nThe letter cites Florida’s defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organizations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.\n\nIf the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 p.m. EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.\n\n“The BBC is on notice,” it said.\n\nOther media lawsuits\n\nWhile many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies.\n\nIn July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\n\nThat settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.\n\nLast year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.\n\nThreats that don’t materialize\n\nGeorge Freeman, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center in New York, said the billion-dollar figure cited by Trump’s lawyer was “totally meaningless.”\n\nFreeman told BBC Radio that Trump’s frequent — and often unsuccessful — litigation against the media is surpassed by the threatening letters that don’t lead to lawsuits.\n\n“They’re just there to threaten and to scare media he doesn’t like,” Freeman said.\n\nStephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.\n\nBut he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage that could come from revisiting the events of Jan. 6 that would be dredged up in any trial.\n\nHe said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.\n\n“The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLONDON – President Donald Trump has recently issued a billion-dollar lawsuit threat&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s $1 Billion Lawsuit Warning Looms Over BBC – Is It a Serious Move or Just a Bluff? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-1-billion-lawsuit-warning-looms-over-bbc-is-it-a-serious-move-or-just-a-bluff/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trump039s-1B-lawsuit-threat-casts-shadow-over-the-BBC-but.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 17:05:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":377945408,"title":"Donald Trump booed and given the finger by hundreds of football fans in humiliating spectacle","text":"Donald Trump was booed, jeered at and given the finger by hundreds of American football fans in a humiliating spectacle. The US President attended the game over the weekend alongside Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and House Speaker Mike Johnson. The special game was to mark Veterans Day - and saw him perform a mass swearing in of some new military recruits. But as he was introduced to the crowd, it was clear they were decidedly unimpressed. The game saw the Washington Commanders play at home against the Detroit Lions, at Northwest Stadium on the outskirts of DC. DC is famously one of the most liberal places in America, and voted for Kamala Harris by a higher margin than any other state or territory. The crowd is also very likely to have included a high proportion of government workers or contractors, many of whom will have lost work due to the six-week government shutdown. And they certainly made their feelings known to the US President, turning to him as he stood in a glass box above the stadium and holding their middle fingers in the air and loudly booing him. He was the first sitting President in more than half a century to attend a regular season NFL game. While speaking to Fox Sports during the broadcast, Trump indicated he was involved in the Commanders' plans to build a new stadium in the city - despite previously threatening to deny them approval unless they changed their name back to the 'Redskins'. “They’re going to build a beautiful stadium. That’s what I’m involved in, we’re getting all the approvals and everything else,” he said. “And you have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. And you’re going to see some very good things.” The $3.7 billion stadium is scheduled to open in 2030, and Trump is reportedly pressuring the team to name it after him. A senior White House official told ESPN that Trump has conveyed his wishes directly to a member of investor Josh Harris’s ownership group. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” the official sad. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added in an email: “That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”","summary":"The US President attended an American football game between the Washington Commanders and the Detroit Lions.

The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape. Here’s what you need to know. What is the scandal about? In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?” At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK – the Guardian praised it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US. And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech. “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say. Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.” In a letter to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” How did the scandal originate? Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial slant, that has long been hostile to the BBC. In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights. He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote. Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January. “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his Substack. “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?” Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor, reported Sunday that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue. Have heads rolled? Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo. In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself. Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.” “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement. Despite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said. What is the BBC? Who owns it? The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter”, which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government. It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee. Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences. More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country. Is the BBC impartial? Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences. But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets. The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors. “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.” Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’” What has Trump threatened? In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.” Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond. The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.” Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages? Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits. It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for. Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives. Why is the case being brought in Florida? In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint. Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London. “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?” Has Trump threatened media outlets before? Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos. In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay $16 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him. Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July. Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-10t074924z-1066812129-rc2ithajlk87-rtrmadp-3-britain-bbc.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 16:49:12","author":"Christian Edwards","authors":["Christian Edwards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":377936676,"title":"Fetterman's Answer About Who the Leader of the Dem Party Is Tells You Why They're in Such Trouble","text":"Who would have ever bet money that Sen.

Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021. Gibb also sits on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) along with BBC chair and committee head Samir Shah, Tim Davie and independent director Caroline Thomson.\n\nThe BBC, responding to queries from the Guardian, said Gibb was only one of the four board members who approved Prescott as a consultant to EGSC. Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nOctober 28, 2024: BBC Panorama programme airs\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He was not directly referencing the march on the Capitol in the second part, and the Panorama documentary did not include a part where Trump said he wanted supporters to “peacefully” make their voices heard.\n\nJanuary 16, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed by EGSC\n\nConcerns about the editing of the Trump speech were raised at a meeting of the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board (EGSB). However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nFebruary 2025: BBC forced to remove Gaza documentary\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through Israel’s war on Gaza had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nMay 12, 2025: Panorama documentary discussed again by EGSC\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nMay 13, 2025: Prescott emails concerns to BBC chair Samir Shah\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nJune 2025: Review of the EGSC’s processes begins\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since 2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear. \n\nJune 2025: Prescott leaves the BBC\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nJuly 2025: BBC journalists complain about Gaza coverage\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nOctober 17, 2025: Prescott’s memo is reviewed at a full board meeting\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nNovember 3, 2025: Prescott’s memo is leaked to the Daily Telegraph\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Parliamentary committee writes to BBC chair\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote in the letter. \n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nNovember 4, 2025: BBC pushes back\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nNovember 4, 2025: Memo discussed at heated BBC board meeting\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nNovember 5, 2025: Prescott to give evidence to Parliament\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: The White House comments\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nNovember 7, 2025: Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson steps in\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nNovember 9, 2025: Davie and Turness resign\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nNovember 9, 2025: US President Donald Trump weighs in\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Samir Shah denies institutional bias\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited. However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nNovember 10, 2025: Trump threatens $1bn law suit\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits. \n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”. \n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages. The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY”.\n\nNovember 11, 2025: BBC bosses address staff\n\nOutgoing Director-General Davie and BBC chair Samir Shah spoke to staff for 40 minutes. Davie admitted a “mistake” in the Panorama documentary and said that pressure following criticism of the film had contributed to his decision to resign. However, he also sounded a defiant note, and told staff, “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”","summary":"The broadcaster, one of the UK&#039;s most trusted news networks, is under fire for alleged bias in its coverage.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/inside-the-year-long-bbc-saga-that-led-to-trumps-1bn-lawsuit-threat?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T115643Z_179756922_RC2MTHAJ47XM_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-BBC-1762869067.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 16:09:31","author":"Apps Support,Shola Lawal","authors":["Apps Support","Shola Lawal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.111},{"id":377923144,"title":"MIKEY SMITH: 11 unhinged Donald Trump moments as UK 'stops sharing intelligence' with US","text":"Donald Trump is threatening to sue the BBC, because why wouldn't he? He's repeatedly threatened American news organisations who refused to report his weird obsessions, lies and falsehoods as fact with court action. He threatened ABC for saying he'd been found \"liable for rape\", when in fact he'd been found \"liable for sexual abuse\", which has a specific definition in New York law. He threatened CBS over a perfectly normal edit in a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. And he's got similarly frivolous suits pending with the Wall Street Journal and New York Times for pretty straightforward reporting of his flaws. Unfortunately, despite both the ABC and CBS suits being declared entirely meritless by legal experts, both corporate entities settled them out of court, fearing their business deals might get held up by regulators in retaliation. But in doing so, they handed him not only millions of dollars, but also a massive stick to beat them with until the end of time. We started the week in the bizarre situation where the Director General of the BBC and the CEO of BBC News felt the need to resign over a year-old, entirely accurate but perhaps clumsily edited report of a speech by the former President of a foreign country. No complaints was made to the BBC about the Panorama programme at the time, not least because its assertion that Donald Trump encouraged violence in his backed up by countless legal authorities, including the Supreme Court of Colorado, the DC District Court and the House of Representatives. The US Supreme Court decided Trump couldn't be prosecuted for crimes committed in his capacity as President, but did not quibble with rulings by other courts that he did, in fact, commit those crimes. Editing a speech is only a problem if it changes the character or meaning. In this case, it did not. But by accepting on any level the premise of the complaint, outgoing Director General Tim Davie has handed Trump - and a bunch of prominent right-wingers in this country - an enormous stick with which to beat not only the BBC, but any journalist who dares question his false narrative of the 2020 election. It's given credence to what amounts to international gaslighting, and it's going to have disastrous repercussions. Watch out for allegedly serious people - (including many who have an ideological objection to the BBC license fee and no shame in putting the concepts of facts and journalism at risk to pursue it) - starting to suggest there's some merit to Trump's claim that the election was rigged in the coming days and weeks. Meanwhile, in Trumpworld Here's everything you need to know... The UK has stopped sharing intelligence with the US about suspected drug trafficking ships in the Caribbean - because it believes deadly air strikes on boats near Venezuela are illegal, it has been reported. According to CNN, the UK made the decision because it does not want to be complicit in what it believes are illegal strikes on boats, which the White House claim are 'drug boats' bound from Venezuela to the United States. No10 refused to comment on security matters but said the US remains the UK's \"closest partner\". The UK has previously shared intelligence with the US to help the coast guard locate suspected drug boats - but previously that amounted to ships being stopped and boarded. But in September the US started launching lethal strikes on boats, killing 76 people. The UK is said to believe the strikes violate international law. A legal letter, from Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, has demanded that \"false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements\" made about Mr Trump be retracted immediately. The letter says if the BBC \"does not comply\" by Friday evening, Mr Trump will be \"left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than 1,000,000,000 dollars in damages.\" For context, $1 billion dollars is roughly 50 years worth of Strictly Come Dancing , Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is due to give a ministerial statement in the Commons on \"BBC Leadership\" at about 5.30pm UK time. In remarks to BBC staff Tim Davie said: \"We have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are a unique and precious organisation, and I see the free press under pressure, I see the weaponisation. I think we've got to fight for our journalism. I'm really proud of our work, and the amazing work locally, globally, that we're doing is utterly precious.\" He added: \"We have made some mistakes that have cost us, but we need to fight for that. And I'm fiercely proud of that, and don't let anyone stop you from thinking that we are doing a fantastic job.\" Mr Davie also alluded to \"enemies\" of the corporation, telling staff: \"We will thrive and this narrative will not just be given by our enemies: It's our narrative.\" Over the weekend Trump announced a new policy on Truth Social - one that hardly anyone in his administration knew was coming, and which has sparked an extraordinary backlash. According to Politico, Trump was convinced it was a great idea to extend the limit on mortgage terms from 30 years to 50 years by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Pulte is said to have turned up at Mar a Lago over the weekend with a poster board bearing Franklin D Roosevelt's face alongside his own. Beneath FDR it read \"30 year mortgages.\" In 1934 FDR's New Deal introduced long-term fixed-rate mortgages backed by federal loan guarantees. They were originally for 15 or 20 years, but the limit was increased to 30 in the 1950s, and that became the standard. And under Trump's it said \"50 year mortgages\". And there was a big headline along the lines of \"Great American Presidents\". Trump tweeted the major policy change the same day, blindsinding almost everyone in the administration and sending both the MAGA and finance and housing worlds into a tailspin. The main arguments against it are that it would only reduce mortgage payments by a nominal amount, while massively increasing the total to pay back. It would also cause all kinds of regulatory headaches and cause massive unpredictable upheaval in the housing market. And when he was asked about it by Laura Ingraham on (where else?) Fox News last night, he appeared not to know anything about it - or even what the current limit was. Policymaking at its finest. Trump is in a bit of a hole about the \"affordability\", or as we would call it in this country, \"cozzie lives\". For ages he's been claiming that grocery prices are down, with the exception of beef - which he intends to resolve by dumping a bunch of cheap Argentinian beef in to the market. And it's only in the last couple of days that people have started whispering to him \"actually, Mr President, we who actually shop for food know that's not true.\" (Seriously, I was talking to a friend who lives in DC the other day and they were absolutely furious over the price of a head of broccoli). Anyway, when Laura Ingraham pointed this out to him, he literally shushed her. Donald Trump has sent Sergio Gor, who we've mentioned in previous roundups, to be the US Ambassador to India. He's the latest in a long list of people being given a \"soft landing\" by Trump, to prevent him losing face by having to fire them. In his case, there has been a long running claim in the New York Post that Gor's real last name is Gorokhovsky, that he was born not in Malta, but in Soviet Uzbekistan. There's also been a bit of a kerfuffle over the vetting form White House staff all have to fill in. Gor, whose job was to vet hundreds of White House staff, reportedly failed to do so for months, but finally submitted his in August. Anyway, he was sworn in as Ambassador last night, on a bible. But not just any bible. A \"Donald J Trump 45th President of the United States of America Signature Edition\". And not only that, it was a signed copy, bearing the President's signature in big thick marker pen on the cover. This particular edition is one of twelve created and sold by Trump in association with patriotic country singer Lee Greenwood. They range in price from $59.99 for the standard \"God Bless the USA\" edition, through to this ultra premium version, which costs $1,000. Other versions to collect include one commemorating the death of Charlie Kirk, yours for $64.99, a Red \"First Lady\" edition ($99.99) and editions in pink and gold and green camouflage ($74.99). Trump decided it would be a good idea, during the longest shutdown in history, to go to a Washington Commanders American football game....where many of the people in attendance will have been either government workers or contractors or other people who have lost work due to the shutdown. And that's probably one of many reasons why he, \"War Secretary\" Pete Hegseth and House Speaker found themselves on the business end of a hail of boos and flipped birds as they took their seats. The longest shutdown in history is almost over, after a small group of Democrats lost their nerve and - against the wishes of their party - agreed to vote with Republicans to re-open the government. The seven Democrats and one independent senator secured no commitment from Republicans to negotiate an extension to healthcare tax credits that expire in January, which was the whole point of forcing the government to shut down. That and doing damage to Donald Trump's approval ratings, which was working. Americans on average continued to blame Republicans for the shutdown, and Trump was pretty much on the ropes. But the group, which included former Hillary Clinton running mate Tim Kaine, New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, Democrat whip Dick Durban (who is about to retire) and John Fetterman (who is barely a Democrat at all these days). None of the senators who voted to end the shutdown are up for re-election in 2026. Trump floated the idea of a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers who stayed on the job during the shutdown - during a furious rant at those who didn't. Asked by Ingraham where he'd get the money from, he replied, \"I don't know. I'll get it from someplace. I'll get it from -I always get the money from someplace. Regardless. It doesn't matter.\" Another one for the imagine if Biden had said that...\" file. The Supreme Court is currently deliberating on whether Trump was actually allowed to slap Tariffs on the entire world without consulting Congress. There is every chance they will decide that, legally, no he didn't. And if that happens it's possible the US will suddenly have to refund something like $3 trillion worth of tariffs - although as with all the numbers Trump uses, there's every chance that number is just made up. Still, Trump appears on Truth Social to be preparing the ground for such a decision - and the potentially devastating consequences for the US economy that could follow... I have frequently struggled to explain the concept of rare earth minerals to people - not least to readers. They are metals that are quite rare but essential for the manufacture of high tech products from phones to drones. China has or controls most of the world's supply. Unfortunately someone in the White House appears to have tried to use a pretty basic example to explain them to Trump and it has backfired spectacularly. Whenever he's asked about them now, he gets stuck on \"magnets\". \"President Xi was willing to do the rare Earth thing,\" Trump said to Ingraham. \"That's magnets. Now nobody knows what a magnet is. If you don't know what a magnet is, you don't make a car. You don't make a computer. You don't make televisions and radios and all the other things. You don't make anything.\" For the record, some rare earths are permanent magnets which are useful in manufacturing. But many of them are not. Also, with the exception of the Insane Clown Posse, people absolutely do know what a magnet is.","summary":"The UK is said to have made the decision because it does not want to be complicit in what it

after he threatens $1 billion BBC legal action","text":"Donald Trump has threatened to sue the British Broadcasting Corporation after it aired an edited version of a speech he gave ahead of the 2021 Capitol Riots. \n\nThe edited speech was included in part of a Panorama episode, prompting Trump’s lawyers to demanded that the BBC remove the documentary before apologizing and compensating him appropriately.”\n\nThe letter from the sitting president’s lawyers claims that failure to comply with his demands will lead to the broadcaster being slapped with a lawsuit of “no less” than $1 billion (£760 million).\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah is still considering how to respond to Donald Trump, whom he called a “litigious fellow.”\n\nHowever, this is far from the first time that Trump has threatened a media company with legal action over perceived damages to his reputation. \n\nTrump sued The New York Times for a staggering $15 billion, in a lawsuit aimed at four journalists and three articles written before the 2024 presidential election. \n\nIn a Truth Social post, he called the NYT “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the nation’s history” over stories which covered topics raised in the book Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success. \n\nHowever, the president was forced to refile an amended and shortened version of the lawsuit after a judge threw it out for being “florid and enervating.”\n\nSentences which described Trump’s 2024 win as “the greatest personal and political achievement in American history” were removed in an effort which halved the complaint to 40 pages.\n\nDonald Trump sued The Wall Street Journal in July 2025, after the newspaper published a story which claimed that Trump had allegedly written a lewd letter for convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. \n\nThe WSJ claimed that the letter had been included in a 50th birthday book for Epstein and that it included a drawing of a woman’s torso, with Trump’s signature above her navel. \n\nThe president has sued the Wall Street Journal, its publishing company Dow Jones and Company, Down Jones’ owner News Corps and its owner Rupert Murdoch as well as two WSJ journalists for $10 billion (£7.5 billion) in damages. \n\nThe publication since filed a motion to dismiss Trump’s claim, on the grounds that they believe the letter to be authentic. \n\nTrump has denied writing the letter. \n\nWalt Disney, which owns ABC News, settled a lawsuit for $15m against the company after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeatedly made claims that Trump had been liable for raping E Jean Carroll. \n\nWalt Disney agreed to pay $1m for Trump’s legal fees and donate $15m to Trump’s future presidential library foundation. \n\nThe lawsuit focused on Stephanoplous referring to a civil case, in which Caroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in a New York department store in the 1990s. \n\nIn fact, Trump had been found as being liable for defamation and sexual abuse, but not rape, which is considered a separate offence. \n\nIn October 2024, Trump sued CBS News over claims that it had released two different clips of an interview with Kamala Harris from its 60 Minutes program. \n\nHe claimed that this amounted to deceitful manipulation to harm his bid for reelection as President of the United States. \n\nIn July 2025, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million towards Trump’s presidential library and to release full transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates on 60 Minutes. \n\nCritics slammed the broadcaster’s decision, accusing it of settling with Trump in order to get approval for a planned merger. \n\nThe president sued board members of the Pulitzer Prize after awards were given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for stories related to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. \n\nHe filed the lawsuit in 2022, almost six years after the election, and claimed that the articles were defamatory, according to court documents seen by Politico. \n\nThe 4th District Court of Appeal in Florida ruled that Trump’s lawsuit could proceed since he was a “willing participant,” despite being president, meaning the Floridian Supreme Court will need to review the case and decide whether it can move forward. \n\nTrump was defeated in a lawsuit after a judge delivered a bombshell ruling that CNN’s use of the phrase “big lie” was not defamatory. \n\nThe president had sued the broadcaster for $475 million over the phrase, which was used in reference to Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was “stolen,” and also for allegedly comparing him to Adolf Hitler. \n\nHowever, Trump’s case was dismissed after District Judge Raag Singhal, one of the president’s own appointees, said that neither claim meets the standards of defamation. \n\n“CNN’s use of the phrase ‘the Big Lie’ in connection with Trump’s election challenges does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people,” Singhal wrote, according to CNN. “No reasonable viewer could (or should) plausibly make that reference.”\n\n“Being “Hitler-like” is not a verifiable statement of fact that would support a defamation claim,” Singhal added, while noting that Nazi references made by any political party are “odious and repugnant.”\n\nIn 2014, Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin settled a $5 million arbitration judgment against her after alleging that the Miss USA 2012 results were rigged. \n\nTrump owned the pageant from 1996 until 2015.\n\nMonnin alleged that another contestant had told her that she had seen a list of which five women would make it to the final. She added that the women were allegedly called in the same order as they were listed, according to The Guardian. \n\nThe settlement meant that Monnin did not need to retract her statements, which the Trump Organization’s lawyer suggested had discouraged women from taking part in the Miss USA.\n\nThe New York City born businessman sued an author named Timothy L. O'Brien for $5 billion, after the writer suggested that Trump’s real net worth was between $150 and $250 million.\n\nHe made the claims in his book TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald. \n\nAt the time, Trump claimed that his net worth was numbered in the billions and suggested that the author had made his claims in malice. \n\nHowever, an appellate court upheld a New Jersey Superior Court judge’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that three of O’Brien’s confidential sources made claims which were consistent. \n\nIn October 2023, Trump filed a lawsuit in London against Orbis Business Intelligence and ex-British spy Christopher Steele. \n\nHe alleged that Orbis had violated British data protection laws by compling a 2016 dossier about Trump which was named the Steele Dossier. \n\nThe president claimed that Steele had made \"'shocking and scandalous claims’ that were false.”\n\n\"I can confirm that I did not, at any time engage in perverted sexual behaviour including the hiring of prostitutes to engage in 'golden showers' in the presidential suite of a hotel in Moscow,” Trump wrote in his witness statement.\n\nHowever, Steele’s name was later removed from the lawsuit and the High Court sided with Orbis and dismissed Trump’s claim in February 2024 on the basis that he was filing outside of the six-year period of limitations. \n\nIn March 2024, Trump was ordered to pay legal fees of £300,000 to Orbis.\n\nTrump’s legal battles with the media date all the way back to 1984, when he sued Paul Gapp, an architecture critic for The Chicago Tribune, according to ABC News.\n\nHe claimed that Gapp had \"virtually torpedoed\" his plan to build a 150-storey skyscraper off the southern tip of Manhattan in his column. \n\nAt the time, Gapp wrote that the tower was \"one of the silliest things anyone could inflict on New York or any other city.”\n\nDistrict Judge Edward Weinfeld ruled that Gapp’s opinion column was protected by the First Amendment and dismissed Trump’s $500 million lawsuit.","summary":"BBC chair Samir Shah called the American leader a ‘litigious fellow’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-sue-bbc-media-b2862554.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/11/03/d363e44af366d56e44efff97e7ed26c4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzYyOTE2NzE5-2.81662992.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zBqSd8FD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-11 15:31:47","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":377914532,"title":"Woke radio host shares photo of herself proudly kissing the feet of firebrand Democrat congresswoman Jasmine Crockett","text":"A progressive radio host proudly shared images of herself kissing the feet of firebrand Democrat Jasmine Crockett. \n\nStephanie Miller, 64, host of 'The Stephanie Miller Show', hit the ground in front of the Texas representative during the bizarre interaction.\n\nImages show Miller crouched on the ground in front of Crockett and later embracing her.\n\nStunned bystanders were seen laughing at the unusual encounter.

The Chicago Tribune\n\nTrump sought $500m from the Chicago Tribune way back in 1984, long before he got close to the White House.\n\nHe claimed an architecture critic for the newspaper had “virtually torpedoed” his plans to build a 150-story skyscraper in Manhattan.\n\nBut the case was dismissed as the judge decided the column in question was protected by the First Amendment (right to free speech and free press).\n\nTrump sought $475m in damages from CNN back in October 2022, accusing the outlet of trying to sabotage his political prospects.\n\nHe pointed to five examples of articles or aired comments that referred to Trump’s claims of election fraud as his “big lie” – a comment which has been associated with the Nazi regime.\n\nBut the case was thrown out because “no reasonable viewer could (or should) plausibly make that reference”.\n\nTrump sued after comments made by an ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos, in March 2024, who falsely claimed the president had been found “liable for rape”.\n\nABC, which is owned by Disney, ended up paying out $15 million in a defamation lawsuit – choosing to settle rather than fight.\n\n4. Paramount\n\nTrump filed a case in Texas in October last year against the parent company of CBS News, Paramount.\n\nHe claimed the company had violated consumer protection laws by editing a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris in a misleading way.\n\nWhile Paramount was expected to win any legal battle – because Trump’s claim.was under an unrelated statute and Trump was evidently not harmed by the segment after winning the election – the company still paid him $16 million.\n\nParamount also wanted the White House’s approval of a merge with Skydance Media, and so needed the president on side.\n\n5. The Wall Street Journal\n\nIn July this year, the Wall Street Journal published an article stating Trump had written a sexually suggestive birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein back in 2003.\n\nThe following day, Trump sued the reporters who wrote the article, as well as the newspaper, its publishing company Dow Jones & Company, its owner – and the parent company’s chief, Rupert Murdoch.\n\nHe claimed the letter was “fake”and meant to harm his reputation.\n\nDow Jones said it stands by its reporting and will challenge the lawsuit.\n\n6. New York Times\n\nThe president tried to start a $15bn defamation lawsuit against the New York Times in September, claiming it had been “allowed to freely lie, smear and defame me for far too long”.\n\nHowever, a judge struck down that claim due to issue with its contents, giving Trump’s team 28 days to file a new complaint.\n\nHe filed a new complaint in October, targeting individual reporters and a book publisher.\n\n7. Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe late-night talk show host – owned by ABC – was sacked from his show in September after making controversial comments on the assassination of pro-Trump campaigner Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe news was welcomed by Trump – but Kimmel was soon rehired following intense backlash, and insisted it was “never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man”.\n\nBut he also claimed Trump had “tried his best to cancel me” – only for Kimmel’s show ratings to go through the roof after his return.\n\nTrump said Kimmel’s return would escalate his legal battle with the comedian and his network.\n\nHe said that this issue could be “even more lucrative” than his last £15m pay-out from ABC.\n\nWill the BBC have to settle?\n\nThe BBC is not part of a wider corporation like many of the organisations mentioned above which often have deep pockets.\n\nIt is independent and publicly-funded instead, with its licence free model up for review in 2027 – and this incident will add to wider calls for major reform within the BBC.\n\nYet legal experts have also questioned just how successful this legal bid will be, considering it’s been more than a year since the original Panorama episode aired.\n\nOthers have questioned whether Trump will realistically be able to argue that the BBC did damage his reputation, considering he has already been under scrutiny by congressional hearings, global coverage of January 6 and ongoing civil lawsuits in Washington.\n\nHe also still won the presidential election last year, after the programme had aired.","summary":"President Donald Trump attends a dinner with leaders from countries in Central Asia, Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025, in the East Room of the White House in Washington.

And ABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found “liable for rape”.\n\nAs a lawyer told City AM: “Of course, these are very serious allegations of wrongdoing and [the BBC] knew that they were editing the speech.” \n\nHowever, the BBC is headquartered in London and the Panorama programme was targeted towards a UK audience, which means there are some additional considerations for the President and his legal team. \n\nTo start, the figure of $1bn seems far-fetched. \n\nAs Iain Wilson, managing partner of Brett Wilson, explained, “a $1bn claim would be an absurdity under English law, where libel damages are compensatory and typically capped around £350,000.”\n\nIn terms of the law surrounding the blunder, Daniel Astaire, managing partner at Grosvenor Law, explained, under English defamation laws, “Trump must show that the video caused ‘serious harm’ to his reputation.”\n\nHe also noted that “doctoring a video can certainly give rise to claims for defamation and infringement of a person’s moral rights under Copyright legislation”, adding, “if Trump pursues this, he must establish that the creation of the video was done maliciously.”\n\nHowever, under the rules of English law, as Jessica Sarwat, a lawyer at Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, pointed out, “the limitation period for any libel claim in the UK—which is usually one year from the date of the publication—has now passed.”\n\nLawyers in sunny Florida\n\nNot surprisingly, the case might, if it reached that point, end up in a court in Florida instead of London. \n\nTrump’s lawyer, in his legal letter to the BBC, quoted the law under Florida Statute.\n\nAs Prateek Swaika, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, stated, the “threat against the BBC isn’t just another media skirmish—it’s a masterclass in weaponising cross-border defamation law”.\n\nHe explained: “The case hinges on a fundamental transatlantic legal divide: UK defamation law favours claimants with its ‘serious harm’ standard and defendant-carried burden of proof, while US law shields media through nearly insurmountable ‘actual malice’ requirements for public figures”, adding that his “legal team is exploiting this divide by threatening Florida litigation.”\n\nWhile claims are time-barred in England within a year of publication, in Florida, the time limit is two years. \n\nHowever, the problem Trump’s team might face in trying to litigate in Florida is jurisdictional hurdles, as neither the BBC nor the programme is directed at a Florida audience.\n\nCourtroom hurdles for US President \n\nAs a lawyer added, “There are many hurdles in defamation claims, but they seem to have a good grounding here.”\n\nHowever, if the BBC decides against paying Trump compensation and issuing a second apology – Chairman Samir Shah has already apologised for the ‘error of judgement’ – and Trump’s threat becomes real, the damage to his reputation from having this played out in open civil court might not be ideal for the US President.\n\nAs Swaika explained, “litigation would force detailed examination and disclosure in connection with his 6 January statements—potentially creating more reputational damage than the original edit.”\n\n“Ultimately, this claim looks more symbolic than legally sustainable,” added Sarwat.","summary":"US President Donald Trump&#8217;s threat to sue the BBC for $1bn over the misleading edit of a Panorama programme has thrown the Corporation into crisis.

The paper had seen an internal memo in the BBC pointing to editing on its October 2024 Panorama programme of two parts of US President Donald Trump’s speech in January 2021. The sin was not in the editing but its liberal manner, suggesting that Trump had explicitly incited the Capitol Hill riots of January 6. Through spliced footage, Trump is initially shown promising to walk with his supporters to the Capitol where he would “fight like hell” when he had said he would walk with them “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.\n\nThe Panorama special, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?”, goes on to give the impression that flag-waving men had also converged with menacing intent after the speech. In the words of the dossier, this “created the impression Trump’s supporters had taken up his ‘call to arms,’” when the footage had, in fact, been shot before the address.\n\nThe internal leaked memo, running into 19 pages, was all the more stinging in coming from a former external advisor to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC), Michael Prescott. The document also alleged that senior executives, including the BBC chairman Samir Shah, had given the cold shoulder to various serious complaints submitted by an advisor to the EGSC. There was a general refusal “to accept there had been a breach of standards”. Indeed, at the EGSC meeting on May 12, 2025, the corporation’s deputy director of news, Jonathan Munro, blandly asserts it as “normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.” Nor did he see any need to balance the Trump Panorama special “with an equally aggressive look at [Democratic candidate Kamala] Harris”. In Munro’s words, there was no need “for due impartiality to have companion programmes”.\n\nThe Conservatives, scrounging for every morsel to claw back some electoral appeal, saw a gaming chance in barking at the corporation. Former Tory prime minister Boris Johnson was seething in calling the revelations a “total disgrace”. Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch was all in favour of seeing heads roll. “The BBC license fee,” stated shadow culture secretary Nigel Huddleston, “is justified on the basis of impartiality and trust.” There could be “no justification for this kind of deliberate manipulation and the spreading of misinformation.” And, he argued, the corporation had form. “This is not the first time that evidence of bias at the BBC has emerged, but it is one of the most stark and alarming examples to date.”\n\nHeads did roll, and not merely because of the Panorama program. The corporation has also been assailed regarding its coverage of Gaza and such topics as transgender rights. Tim Davie, the Director-General of the BBC, along with Deborah Turness, CEO of news, stepped up to the chopping block. In his statement, Davie had “been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times” allied to “the fact that I want to give a successor time to help the Charter plans they will be delivering.” Admitting merely “some mistakes” in the organisation, the BBC remained “the most trusted news brand globally.”\n\nTurness was more explicit. “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.” While taking her share of responsibility for the debacle, she remained “absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nFor his part, Shah preferred a letter of tardy contrition to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee. He conceded that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgment.”\n\nIt had been a foolish thing to do. The Panorama mangle gift wrapped the claims of bias to British politicians and figures best exposed. It also gave the White House more grist to the mill in arguing that the Fourth Estate was not to be trusted and worthy of being hounded. Trump has already made something of a habit of raging against the American networks and successfully settling claims. In December last year, ABC News settled a lawsuit with Trump in which it agreed to give $15 million to Trump’s presidential library. Trump claimed that anchor George Stephanopoulos had inaccurately asserted on-air that he had been liable for raping E. Jean Carroll.\n\nIn July, Paramount settled with Trump’s legal team to the sum of $16 million also intended for the future Donald Trump Library. CBS’s parent company had folded under pressure, despite frivolous claims regarding editorial decisions on a CBS interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024. The settlement was undoubtedly helped along by the presence of Trump’s Federal Communications Commission appointee Brendan Carr.\n\nSuch settlements can only sully the networks and their news divisions. CBS news anchor John Dickerson is hard to fault in points made in his Reporter’s Notebook segment: “Can you hold power to account when you’ve paid it millions? Can an audience trust you when you’ve traded away that trust?”\n\nWith the BBC admitting to error, and a few high-level resignations, Trump’s desire to extend his bullying approach to a foreign broadcaster has been stirred. His lawyers seek three actions from the corporation: a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and compensation. Failing to do this, legal action for $1 billion in damages will be sought.\n\nThe chastening question in all of this was why the Panorama crew even felt the need to splice and adjust footage, despite being aware that news coverage, at least of the BBC brand, must be above reproach. The corporation’s former North America editor Jon Sopel, aware of Trump’s snarling disposition to the press, summed it up: “You do not leave any room for error; you just have to be scrupulous.” Trump is more than able to do the work for documentary makers without elaborate abridgments or forced edits, very much a man capable of being hoisted by his own petard. Unfortunately, those in the news business just can’t help themselves.\n\nDr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He currently lectures at RMIT University.

At the outset of the government shutdown last month, a veteran named James called VetComm in tears. His question was simple but heartbreaking: “Will I still get paid next week? Because I can’t afford groceries if I don’t.”\n\nJames served his country with honor. Yet he worried about feeding his family because Democrats in Washington insist on prioritizing illegal immigrants over the very men and women who defended this nation.\n\nEnough is enough. Stop putting illegal immigrants ahead of the heroes who built and defended this country.\n\nI’ve dedicated my life to fighting for veterans like James — those who bled for this country, only to watch so-called representatives in Washington bend over backward for people who entered it illegally. With this latest government shutdown, Democrats have again slammed the door on veterans while rolling out the red carpet for illegal aliens.\n\nA manufactured crisis\n\nFor over a month, Democrats held the entire nation hostage, demanding a $1.5 trillion, poison-pill-stuffed funding bill that includes “free health care” for illegal aliens while programs for veterans teeter on the brink. It’s not just reckless — it’s cruel. These are the same priorities that helped drive a 19% spike in veteran homelessness while illegal migrants got luxury hotel rooms on the taxpayer’s dime.\n\nAs the shutdown ends, the facts are clear. The House passed a clean continuing resolution to keep the lights on, maintain VA funding, and avoid chaos. But Senate Democrats — led by Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York — rejected it, choosing to plunge the country into an unnecessary shutdown to appease their left-wing base.\n\nThe Democrats’ alternative was loaded with giveaways: subsidies for illegal immigrants’ doctor visits, hospital stays, and “health care rights,” while hundreds of thousands of veterans remain stuck on VA wait lists — some dying before they’re seen.\n\nStaggering hypocrisy\n\nSchumer once said avoiding a shutdown “is very good news for the country, for our veterans … all of whom would have felt the sting.” More recently, he warned that “a shutdown would mean chaos and pain and needless heartache for the American people.”\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared, “It is not normal to shut down the government when we don’t get what we want.” Jeffries said shutdowns are \"about the harm.”\n\nThose very same politicians ended up leading one — weaponizing activist wish lists and pet projects against the GOP and the nation.\n\nRELATED: Disabled vets denied dignity as VA claim backlog becomes unbearable\n\n Johnrob via iStock/Getty Images\n\nThis pattern of betrayal isn’t new. Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the VA was caught reimbursing health care for illegal immigrants and their families, draining resources from veterans. I’ve seen it firsthand in San Diego — hotels packed with migrants while homeless veterans sleep on sidewalks, dodging needles and despair.\n\nOver 10 million illegal crossings have occurred under the Biden administration’s watch. The result: big money for migrants, broken promises for veterans. The audacity to continue putting invaders ahead of patriots is shocking — and unforgivable.\n\nThe real human cost\n\nEveryone knows a shutdown hurts troops, veterans, and families. Yet Democrats embraced it anyway, in service to radical ideology over national duty. Americans overwhelmingly oppose this madness.\n\nEnough is enough. Stop putting illegal immigrants ahead of the heroes who built and defended this country. It’s time to restore sanity and start prioritizing America again.\n\nAt VetComm, we see the toll every day. The sleepless nights. The panic over missed paychecks. The spiraling PTSD and anxiety triggered by uncertainty. Veterans have already given everything; they shouldn’t have to fight their own government for stability and dignity.\n\nOur mission is simple: Stand in the gap for those who stood for us. We help veterans understand their rights, claim the benefits they earned, and remember that their service still matters. A shutdown tests that mission — but it also steels our resolve.\n\nBecause while Washington bickers, we will keep fighting for every veteran, every day, not just Veterans Day.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/washingtons-priorities-are-backward-and-veterans-know-it","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/washingtons-priorities-are-backward-and-veterans-know-it.jpg?id=62136108&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C32%2C0%2C32","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 14:00:00","author":"Kate Monroe","authors":["Kate Monroe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.254}]}
