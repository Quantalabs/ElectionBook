{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":611,"news":[{"id":287152016,"title":"Trump says Palestinians should leave Gaza and US will ‘take over’","text":"By Kevin Liptak | CNN\n\n(CNN) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the US “will take over” the Gaza Strip, after saying earlier that he doesn’t think there is a permanent future for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said during a joint press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. “We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings.”\n\nAsked whether he was willing to send US troops to fill a security vacuum in Gaza, Trump did not rule it out.\n\n“As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece that we’re going to develop it,” he said.\n\nTrump’s comments are a remarkable assertion from a sitting American president, particularly one who rose to political power in the United States through his criticism of America’s longest wars in the Middle East.\n\n“I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,” Trump told reporters in the East Room.\n\n“This was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”\n\nTrump, a former real estate developer, said he had studied the matter “closely, over a lot of months.”\n\nSpeaking earlier Tuesday, Trump suggested Gazans move to a new location provided by one or more nations in the Middle East.\n\n“I mean they’re there because they have no alternative. What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now,” Trump said moments before hosting Netanyahu for Oval Office talks.\n\nTrump’s suggestion that Gazans leave the strip permanently amounts to a provocative stance that will endear him to Israel’s most conservative politicians but is generally a non-starter for Israel’s neighbors, who have said they are unwilling to accept new Palestinian refugees from the enclave.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump framed the matter as a humanitarian one, saying it was impossible to believe anyone would want to remain in the war-torn territory.\n\n“Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,” Trump said, ignoring a reporter who cried out: “Because it’s their home.”\n\nInstead of Gaza, he suggested the Palestinians be provided a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” to live.\n\nBut under repeated questioning, Trump made clear he did not see a world in which Palestinians ever return to Gaza.\n\n“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza. I think Gaza has been very unlucky for them.” He said, “Gaza is not a place for people to be living.”\n\nNetanyahu, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, smiled as Trump was speaking. The Israeli leader, under conflicting pressures domestically, was in Washington to ascertain exactly where Trump stands on the next phase of a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nBut Trump’s dim views of Gaza as a permanent home for Palestinians was certain to provide grist for far-right allies of the Israeli leader, who have called on Netanyahu to abandon the temporary truce that was struck last month.\n\nNetanyahu’s visit was expected to last several hours and include a joint press conference, all meant to demonstrate Trump’s solidarity with Israel.\n\nThe comity between the men could belie a relationship that’s more complicated than it sometimes appears – with nothing less than the future of the Middle East potentially riding on Trump’s words.\n\nTrump has claimed credit for the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement struck in the days before he entered office – and even officials in the outgoing Biden administration acknowledged Trump’s imminent arrival helped apply pressure on Israel and Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, perhaps seeking to ingratiate himself to his host, praised Trump’s efforts.\n\n“I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,” Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nBut for all of his prodding to get the deal inked, Trump will still need to oversee the remaining two phases of the three-phase plan. He didn’t sound particularly confident a day before meeting Netanyahu.\n\n“I have no assurances that it’ll hold,” he said in the Oval Office, where he’d summoned reporters to watch him sign some papers. “And I’ve seen people brutalized. I’ve never – nobody’s ever seen anything like it.”\n\nHe sounded slightly more optimistic a day later.\n\n“We’ll see what happens. We’re dealing with very complicated people, but a deal can absolutely get done,” he said alongside Netanyahu on Tuesday.\n\nThere’s plenty for Trump and Netanyahu to discuss beyond the immediate matter of the ceasefire agreement. There’s the question of Gaza itself, which Trump has previously said should be cleared out for rebuilding, with the Palestinians who live there moved to Egypt and Jordan (a topic of discussion likely to continue when Jordan’s King Abdullah visits the White House next week).\n\n“I would like to see Jordan, I’d like to see Egypt take some,” Trump said again Tuesday, just before Netanyahu arrived. “Look, the Gaza thing has not worked. It’s never worked.”\n\nAnd then there is the prospect of a broader normalization of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, that former President Joe Biden had been pursuing before the October 7, 2023, attacks. Trump, who openly pines for a Nobel Peace Prize, may see his opportunity in such a pursuit, which could transform the entire Middle East and create a new bulwark against Iran, a common foe to Jerusalem and Riyadh.\n\nWhether Netanyahu is interested in diplomacy – or whether he instead sees Trump’s arrival in Washington as a moment to take decisive action against Iran, potentially even taking out its nuclear program – remains to be seen.\n\nThere is already speculation Netanyahu could use the talks to take Trump’s temperature on a direct strike, seizing a moment when Iranian proxies have been decimated, Iran’s nuclear ambitions appear to be accelerating and while he has friendlier ties to Washington.\n\nFor his part, Trump has not sounded particularly enthusiastic about starting a new conflict with Iran.\n\n“Hopefully that can be worked out without having to worry about it. It would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step,” he said last month when asked about a strike on Iranian facilities.\n\nA complicated relationship\n\nBy the end of Biden’s term, relations were so strained between the American and Israeli leaders that they went months without speaking, despite the ongoing war in Gaza and intensive efforts by Biden’s aides to broker a cease-fire.\n\nIn the lead-up to last November’s election, there was little question among Biden’s team that Netanyahu favored a Trump victory, believing he would enjoy a far wider remit from the American government to prosecute his war aims with Trump in office instead of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThose predictions have not been wrong.\n\nAlready, Trump has lifted a hold on heavy bomb deliveries to Israel, rolling back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel amid its war in Gaza.\n\nHe could go even further this week. Netanyahu and his delegation plan to press Trump’s administration to move forward with billions of dollars in pending arms sales, including thousands of new bombs, missiles, artillery and other weapons, during this week’s visit.\n\nWhile some of the items could take a year or more to produce, deliveries of the bombs would begin within the next few months.\n\nIf Trump goes ahead, it would represent a new level of support to Israel from the United States, and a signal of Trump’s willingness to indulge Netanyahu’s requests at a moment of deep uncertainty in the Middle East.\n\nBut while Trump is popular in Israel, and Netanyahu enthusiastically welcomed his return to the White House, things haven’t always been so cheerful.\n\nWhen Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election victory in 2020, Trump was enraged at what he saw as betrayal. In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to the esteemed Israeli reporter Barak Ravid, now a CNN analyst: “F**k him.”\n\nEven three years later, after Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history on October 7, 2023, it was clear Trump’s sore feelings hadn’t entirely faded.\n\n“(Netanyahu) was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared,” Trump said in an interview shortly after the attacks, comments that drew condemnation even from Republicans.\n\nNetanyahu undoubtedly hopes the animosity will be forgotten when he visits on Tuesday. It seems almost certain his interactions with Trump will contain none of the open discord that colored his relationship with Biden in the final year of his presidency.\n\nWhat is clear is Netanyahu’s desire to gather a wide range of opinions while he is in town. The prime minister is planning to remain in Washington well beyond his Tuesday talks with Trump. He arrived to Blair House, the presidential guest residence, late Sunday and is expected to stay until the end of the week, including for meetings on Capitol Hill.\n\nFor all of their vast differences, Trump and Biden do share a philosophy when it comes to engaging with their foreign counterparts: dealing directly is the best way to make progress.\n\nMay’s early trip to Washington, designed in part to convince Trump not to withdraw from NATO, did not portend particularly warm ties for the rest of his term. He repeatedly criticized her handling of Brexit, although by the time May resigned from office they seemed to have patched things up.\n\nWith Netanyahu, however, Trump has an altogether more immediate task.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.","summary":"“Why would they want to return?

Emhoff remained one step behind his wife as they returned to their luxury property, accompanied by a member of staff.\n\nInside, Emhoff seemed almost bemused by the photographers, trying to hide a smile as he stared into the cameras and eventually giving a wave as Harris dutifully pushed her shopping cart along, before chatting to a clerk inside the store. \n\nWhite HouseKaroline LeavittElla Emhoff\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nKamala Harris' stepdaughter complains about price of eggs in tone-deaf social media whine\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Ella Emhoff , 25, posted a tone-deaf photo of herself complaining about the exorbitant price of eggs on Tuesday amid nationwide shortages.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14361037/Ella-Emhoff-egg-prices-bird-flu.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/04/23/94865681-0-image-m-19_1738712740474.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 23:56:56","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":287142504,"title":"‘60 Minutes’ boss on hot seat over Kamala Harris interview amid speculation he could get ousted if ‘Trump wants head on a stick’: sources","text":"The turmoil at CBS News over the controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris has put the show’s boss on the hot seat – and insiders are speculating the network could dump him if President Trump wants a “head on a spike,” The Post has learned.\n\nBill Owens – executive producer of “60 Minutes” since a sexual-misconduct scandal engulfed CBS and ousted his predecessor, Jeff Fager – has remained defiant amid fury from the rank-and-file over a possible settlement with Trump over his $10 billion lawsuit.\n\nThe president claims CBS edited the Harris interview to make her look better ahead of the election – an accusation the network has denied.\n\nOn Monday, 58-year-old Owens told staffers that the edit was “perfectly fine” and that “the company knows I will not apologize for anything we have done,” The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nNevertheless, CBS confirmed it reluctantly sent the full interview transcript on Monday to FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who has vowed to fast-track an investigation into any wrongdoing, as The Post reported.\n\nOn Monday, Carr told The Post he will vet the transcript in light of an FCC “prohibition against news distortion on our books for 50 years” that applies to TV broadcasters. Some CBS insiders fear the outlook for the probe isn’t good.\n\n“It might not matter what the transcripts show,” a CBS source told The Post. “Trump might want a head to roll.”\n\nIf Owens gets the boot, network sources are chattering that one of the people who could replace him is Susan Zirinsky, the legendary producer who inspired Holly Hunter’s character in the classic movie “Broadcast News.”\n\nLast month, the 72-year-old Zirinsky, was named interim executive editor of CBS News to help the Tiffany Network “quickly and effectively deliver balanced, accurate, fair and timely reporting, including highly complex, sensitive issues like the war in the Middle East,” CBS CEO George Cheeks said in a memo.\n\nAt the time, Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone praised Zirinsky’s appointment, saying the network is “fortunate” that she “stepped in.”\n\nThat was after “60 Minutes” drew barbs over a segment on the Gaza war – leading Redstone to voice concerns about the show’s direction, multiple sources said.\n\nA “livid” Redstone, whose family stands to pocket about $1.75 billion if the $8 billion merger with Skydance Media goes through, allegedly pressed CBS News president Wendy McMahon to fire Owens for airing the one-sided report, another source with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nRedstone and CBS declined to comment. \n\nThe segment also drew scorn from the ADL and the American Jewish Committee for being “biased” and “villainizing Israel” and the US’ support of the country.\n\nThe backlash against “60 Minutes” comes at a delicate time for Paramount as it tries to sidestep regulatory hurdles from Trump’s appointed FCC chair to complete the long-winding Skydance deal.\n\nOwens, who like his predecessors has run “60 Minutes” as an independent fiefdom apart from CBS news, isn’t happy about having his work vetted by Zirinsky, sources said.\n\nZirinsky and Owens declined to comment.\n\nThe pair were locked in a bake-off for the “60 Minutes” gig in 2019. Some “60 Minutes” staffers, including host Scott Pelley, were apoplectic over the idea that Zirinsky — then boss of crime-focused news show “48 Hours” — could get the job over Owens, as The Post previously reported.\n\nOwens did get the role after Zirinsky was promoted to CBS News president – a position whose bureaucratic duties she reportedly didn’t relish. She stepped down in 2021 to run See It Now Studios, a CBS documentary unit.\n\nOwens, in the meantime, has racked up criticism on his watch over the program’s allegedly leftward skid. \n\nIn addition to the Harris interview, in which CBS was accused of editing down her lengthy, “word salad” responses to tough questions, “60 Minutes” has taken heat for giving former President Joe Biden similar, soft-glove treatment during a fawning 2023 interview by Pelley.\n\n“Bill Owens has so many strikes against him,” another CBS insider told The Post, adding that Zirinsky may finally get her chance to run the prestigious program “if Trump wants a head on a spike.”\n\nOther bones of contention include Leslie Stahl’s 2020 sit-down with Trump in which she claimed the Hunter Biden Laptop story could not be verified.","summary":"Bill Owens – executive producer of “60 Minutes” since a sexual-misconduct scandal engulfed CBS and ousted his predecessor, Jeff Fager – has remained defiant amid fury from the rank-and-file over a possible settlement with Trump over his $10 billion lawsuit.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/media/60-minutes-boss-on-hot-seat-over-kamala-harris-interview-amid-speculation-he-could-get-ousted-if-trump-wants-head-on-a-stick/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/COMP-GettyImages-1247493718.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 23:37:48","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.268},{"id":287142138,"title":"Did a Fictional 1800s Book Series About 'Baron Trump' Predict Donald Trump's Presidency?

In the first two books, the character travels through time with his dog Bulger and meets various people from different cultures.\n\n The final book, however, focuses on the rise of a controversial U.S. president. According to a synopsis, the country is \"torn by division and dissent\" and there are \"references to a hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York,\" where Trump Tower is located.\n\n The president-elect is described as \"an outsider\" who causes a \"chaotic atmosphere.\"\n\n Politico wrote about the book series’ newfound popularity in 2017. The titular character was described as someone who \"can’t stop talking about his brain\" and, once, successfully sued his tutors, \"alleging that they owed him money for everything he had taught them.\"\n\n Despite certain characteristics of the baron and the real-life Trump being similar, such as their ability to spew insults, unwillingness to try new foods and inflated sense of sense, per Politico, the comparisons pretty much end there.\n\n Conversations about the book have continued into 2025 with people making similar comparisons.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n A recent video shared on X claims that the books have an \"eerily similar story to what we’re seeing today.\" The narrator says that, in the books, Baron Trump has a mentor named Don, which he related to President Trump's first name. Another video, recently shared on TikTok, dives into a time travel theory, going so far as to claim that the books are \"proof\" that Trump is a time traveler.\n\n More recently, Joe Rogan explored the similarities in a Jan. 28 episode of his Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\n\n After reading the synopsis of the series, Rogan said, \"Is life real? I think life's mostly real but, you know, this is the problem with the whole idea of simulation theory. If it's true, if there is a simulation, and if we develop technology where the simulation becomes indiscernible from reality itself, how will we know? Maybe we'll know from goofy clues like that, like silly coding Easter eggs.\"\n\n Finding these sorts of parallels in popular culture is nothing new. For example, The Simpsons has often been credited with predicting the future, most recently with Kamala Harris’ presidential run. \n\n In July 2024, show writer Al Jean highlighted a 2000 episode — called “Bart to the Future” — which featured Lisa Simpson dressed in a similar outfit to Harris in an episode where the cartoon character became the first female president of the United States.\n\n Previous episodes also seemingly predicted Richard Branson’s trip to space, the historic Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and Cypress Hill’s July 10 performance with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\n Executive producer and showrunner Matt Selman told Deadline in 2022 there is a method to the predictions, but keeping the show fresh is still the team's \"greatest creative challenge.\"\n\n \"Luckily the world keeps delivering things that need reflecting on in the Springfield mirror. So that's a thank-you to the world, but also the world needs to do better,\" he explained to the outlet.\n\n Perhaps, the same can be said for the Baron Trump books.","summary":"The titular character in the book series is introduced as a wealthy boy who lives in Trump Castle","url":"https://people.com/did-a-fictional-1800s-book-series-about-baron-trump-predict-donald-trump-s-presidency-8786073","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ixnplh2xHhl-YPp9Ypftw2COzNg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(748x317:750x319)/the-baron-trump-collection-book-Lockwood-Ingersoll-Donald-Trump-escalator-trump-tower-2015-020425-7c91dc35c3854fcb93d840b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 23:35:50","author":"Raven Brunner","authors":["Raven Brunner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.066},{"id":287142704,"title":"Barely a simmer: Trump's nominees avoid grilling and skirt through confirmation process despite initial public outcry","text":"On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee voted to refer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. \n\nRight as the committee came to order, Kennedy and Donald Trump received a lucky break when Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican physician who repeatedly grilled Kennedy about promoting the debunked link between vaccines and autism, said he would vote for him.\n\nA few hours later, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted behind closed doors to refer Tulsi Gabbard to be Trump’s director of National Intelligence. \n\nThat came after Trump’s contentious confirmation hearing where Republicans questioned her about her past criticism of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. government to gather intelligence on non-U.S. persons outside the United States, as well as her call for Trump to pardon Edward Snowden.\n\nBut Sen. Susan Collins, who had numerous reservations about Gabbard, said on Monday evening that she would vote to confirm Gabbard. Shortly thereafter Sen. Todd Young threw his support behind Gabbard as well, despite the fact he repeatedly asked her about Snowden. \n\nThe votes in committee all but guarantee that Kennedy and Gabbard will be confirmed on the Senate floor with either minimal or zero Republican opposition, signifying Trump’s conquest of one of the final bulwarks of opposition toward him: the Senate.\n\nWhen Trump first came to Washington, he faced heavy opposition to his nominations from Republican senators. Mike Pence’s first tie-breaking vote came when he had to vote to confirm Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. Republicans blanched at making Andrew Puzder to be secretary of labor after reports of spousal abuse.\n\nFor someone who moved aggressively and threw bombs like Trump, the Senate proved to be a frustration. The Senate had Republican senators who told him “no,” such as Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and later Mitt Romney. John McCain delivered the infamous thumbs down that killed his attempt to repeal Obamacare. That failure notwithstanding, Mitch McConnell resisted Trump’s calls to remove the filibuster. \n\nWhen Trump tried to strong-arm McConnell to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, McConnell and a majority of Republicans resisted the temptation and only eight Republican Senators objected to the results. \n\nNow, Republicans offer only tacit opposition to him. Last month, only three Republicans--including McConnell, Collins and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska--opposed Pete Hegseth’s nomination, knowing he would become secretary of Defense thanks to Vice President JD Vance. \n\nSo far, Republicans have only sunk one nomination: former Matt Gaetz’s push to be attorney general. And that came not because of the Ethics Committee investigation into whether he had sex with underage girls; it came because Gaetz had consistently antagonized Republican senators.\n\nAfter the vote in committee, Cassidy, who had wrestled with whether to confirm Kennedy, gave a speech to the Senate floor that sounded more like an apology than a vote of confidence. He said how he had received messages from pediatricians saying they had to fight back on misinformation about vaccines spread by people like Kennedy.\n\n“Regarding vaccines, Mr. Kennedy has been insistent that he just wants good science and to ensure safety,” he said. “But on this topic, the science is good, the science is credible. Vaccines save lives. They are safe. They do not cause autism.” \n\nBut he said that he aligned with Kennedy on reforming the National Institutes of Health and focusing on chronic diseases and said they would work together. \n\n“We will meet or speak multiple times a month,” he said. “This collaboration will allow us to work well together and therefore to be more effective.”\n\nCassidy’s speech read similar to how Collins said that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh assured her that they would protect Roe v Wade before the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson decision. But the evidence that Kennedy would continue promoting lies about vaccines came with the fact that Del Bigtree, another anti-vaccine activist was on hand to watch Kennedy’s confirmation vote on Tuesday. \n\nCassidy’s words came after Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa both voted to confirm Hegseth after pressure from their right flank. \n\nBut doing so could come at a cost. Cassidy, who voted to convict Trump for his actions on January 6, already faced a primary challenger in Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming. This will do little to sate the appetite of conservatives who want to take him out.\n\nThe same goes for Tillis, who faces a difficult re-election campaign in the Tar Heel State. Mark Robinson, the disgraced former lieutenant governor, may have passed on running against Tillis. But now he has to answer for his votes against a Democrat like Roy Cooper. \n\nAnd Collins, who is also up for re-election in a state that Kamala Harris by about seven points, will have to answer for her votes on Gabbard and Kennedy.\n\nAnd as for Puzder? The disgraced former Labor secretary nominee? Trump nominated him to be U.S. ambassador to the European Union.","summary":"Trump has finally bent the Senate to his will.

Glenn Youngkin (R-VA).\n\nYoungkin won the 2021 governor’s race over Terry McAuliffe by about two points in a state that former President Joe Biden carried by over nine points against President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nDuring his election, Youngkin successfully walked the line of appealing both to Trump supporters and never-Trump voters. Youngkin’s victory proved that Republicans can still win a statewide election in Virginia, even though the state has moved left over the last two decades.\n\nYoungkin has enjoyed positive approval ratings throughout his term and some polls indicate that he is one of the more popular governors in the nation. His name was floated in vice president considerations before Trump picked JD Vance. Although there is no incumbency advantage in the race, the fact that Virginia has a popular Republican governor may be helpful to other Republican candidates looking to win in November.\n\nTwo Republicans and one Democrat have declared their candidacy. Current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA) will face investigative reporter Merle Rutledge in the Republican primary, and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is currently running unopposed in the Democrat primary. However, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) is considering a run and could challenge Spanberger for the nomination.\n\nThe most likely matchup currently looks to be Earle-Sears against Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District from 2019-2025 until she decided to step down from her seat to run for governor.\n\nEarle-Sears’s path to nomination got easier after Youngkin gave her his endorsement, and current Attorney General Jason Miyares sought to run for reelection rather than challenge her for the nomination.\n\nThe primary elections for both parties will take place on June 17.\n\nEarly polling indicates a small lead for Democrats. Spanberger currently leads Earle-Sears by between one and five points. Democrats will also be running on a high after they took control of the House of Delegates in the 2023 midterm elections.\n\nHowever, Republicans have reason to be optimistic.\n\nFirst, Earle-Sears proved that she could win a statewide race when she won the lieutenant governorship in 2021.\n\nSecond, voting numbers in the state indicate a shift to the right. Although Biden beat Trump by nine points in 2020, former Vice President Kamala Harris only carried the state by five points. Harris was more unpopular than Biden was in 2020, which may account for the difference, but the numbers indicate a path for Earle-Sears.\n\nAlso, although the polls show Spanberger leading, most feature a high percentage of undecided voters. When those voters begin to break, there will be a clearer picture of where this race is heading.\n\nThe Virginia governor’s race is currently a toss-up. Democrats will be looking to ride the trend from the last midterm elections, as well as historical state trends, while Republicans will be looking to bank off Younkin’s popularity to elevate Earle-Sears to the governorship.","summary":"In the next set of off-year elections, the Virginia governor&#8217;s race will likely be the most contested.

President Donald Trump and his supporters have threatened to punish political enemies who, they believe, used the mechanisms of government to target them. But they've also acted to shrink the state. To the extent that efforts to defang intelligence and enforcement agencies like the FBI precede and prevail over attempts at retribution, such vindictiveness will be less possible. That would reduce the danger of the government in the hands of the current president and those to come.\n\nThreats Against Political Enemies\n\nWhen he was running to return to the White House, Trump threatened to \"go after\" then-President Joe Biden and his family with a special prosecutor. He also said members of Congress who investigated the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot \"should go to jail.\" He told a crowd that his main opponent in the presidential race, Kamala Harris, \"should be impeached and prosecuted.\" He has a nasty habit of threatening to punish opponents, even if he later hedges his comments with promises that \"retribution will be through success\" in helping the country.\n\nTo be fair, Trump himself faced investigations and prosecutions that looked like political hit jobs. In June 2023, 62 percent of respondents to a Quinnipiac University poll thought the Department of Justice's case against Trump was politically motivated. A year later, 57 percent of those polled by Monmouth University believed the same about the New York \"hush money\" trial in which he was convicted. But that's a legacy to repudiate and end, not perpetuate.\n\nBut along with seething at enemies, Trump has promised \"to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\" And among the agencies targeted by this administration is one of the more dangerous to our liberty: the FBI.\n\nDefanging an FBI With a Troubled History\n\n\"On January 31, 2025, the Acting Deputy Attorney General instructed the Acting FBI Director to terminate the FBI's entire senior leadership team and the Assistant Director in charge of the Washington Field Office,\" complains the FBI Agents Association (FBIAA) in a letter to Congress. The letter goes on to object that bureau personnel are \"having their careers jeopardized for carrying out the orders they were given by their superiors in the FBI.\"\n\nThis came after news reports that top FBI executives had been told to resign or else be fired. The Cato Institute's Patrick Eddington confirmed that the firings included all executive assistant directors \"and over two dozen Special Agents in Charge.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, the FBI has frequently crossed the line to take on the role of domestic political police. It targets political dissidents across the political spectrum, spies on Americans, and acts as a thuggish enforcement arm for whoever is in power.\n\n\"The FBI, for example, has placed more emphasis on domestic dissent than on organized crime and, according to some, let its efforts against foreign spies suffer because of the amount of time spent checking up on American protest groups,\" the U.S. Senate's Church Committee reported in 1976.\n\nThe FBI hasn't really improved since then. In 2023, the bureau was caught abusing access to information collected under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to dig up information on activists and political donors. Three years ago, it issued bulletins claiming that a taste for Revolutionary War imagery, such as the Betsy Ross flag, might reveal people tending toward \"violent extremism.\"\n\n\"The FBI entraps hapless people all the time, arrests them, charges them with domestic terrorism offenses or other serious felonies, claims victory in the 'war on domestic terrorism,' and then asks Congress for more money to entrap more people,\" John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer and whistleblower, wrote in 2021.\n\nThe FBI has a long history of hostility to encryption and other efforts to maintain privacy even as Chinese hackers use government-mandated wiretapping backdoors in the country's telecommunications infrastructure to gain access to sensitive information. A 2018 Inspector General's report found the FBI to be meddling in politics in ways that offended all sides and even some agents.\n\nAccused, depending on who is on the receiving end of its abuses, of working for both Democrats and Republicans, the FBI is more accurately described as a tool for maintaining the position of the political establishment. But it's most dedicated to preserving its own power and prestige.\n\nSo, if President Trump wants to strip the FBI of its power and mount its seal on the wall as a trophy, all the best to him. But that's assuming he wants to remove or at least reduce the danger posed by the FBI rather than repurpose the bureau for his own political uses.\n\nThe FBI Could Become Less Dangerous, or a Tool for the New Boss\n\nAs I write, FBI officials have just complied with an order to turn over the names of employees who investigated the January 6 riot; agents are suing to keep the president from using the information. Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll has apparently become a rallying point for some sort of resistance to the White House's moves against the bureau. While Trump's opponents cheer that resistance, the prospect of a powerful government agency defying orders is disturbing—especially if what they're defying is an attempt to reduce their own power and privilege.\n\nWhether that's what the administration is doing, though, remains up in the air. Trump's nominee to head the FBI, Kash Patel, approached the job with a list of people he believes deserve attention once he's in a position of power. That's the exact opposite of what we should want in a new chief for a powerful bureau with a troubled history. But he's also referenced his own experience at the hands of investigators as a basis for opposing the politicization of government agencies.\n\n\"The only thing that will matter if I'm confirmed as a director of the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a singular standard of justice,\" Patel told the Senate Judiciary Committee during confirmation hearings.\n\nHopefully, that's true. An FBI led by a leader opposed to politicization would be refreshing.\n\nEven better, though, would be more firings at the FBI, along with reductions in its power and reach. If that happens, the intent of future presidents and FBI directors will be less important, since the bureau will no longer be such a dangerous weapon in the hands of government officials.","summary":"A defanged FBI could minimize our reliance on politicians’ (rarely) good intentions.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/04/trumps-fbi-purges-could-reduce-danger-posed-by-the-bureau-or-make-it-his-weapon/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/sipaphotoseighteen416171-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 22:00:41","author":"J.D.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:21:37 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:21:59 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nShirley Ballas beamed as she headed out in Nottingham while on the Strictly Come Dancing tour - hours after her stalker appeared in court. \nKyle Shaw, 37, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday accused of stalking the Strictly judge, 64, between August 31, 2017, and November 29, 2023, by sending her online messages. \nBrushing off the court appearance, Shirley was seen smiling as she left her hotel in Nottingham ahead of next instalment of the tour. \nShe kept it casual in a pair of black and white sports trainers paired leggings and wrapped up warm in a cream wool double-breasted coat. \nShaw's conduct was reported to have left Shirley 'seriously alarmed and distressed' and unable to continue her usual day-to-day activities.\nIt comes just months after Shirley was forced to phone the police when an alleged stalker 'lunged at her and took photos of her house and car'. It is unknown whether that incident is linked to Shaw. \n\nShirley Ballas beamed as she headed out in Nottingham while on the Strictly Come Dancing tour - hours after her stalker appeared in court\n\nBrushing off the court appearance, Shirley was seen smiling as she left her hotel in Nottingham ahead of next instalment of the tour\nFollowing the terrifying ordeal in July Shirley claimed that the man's phone and computer have now been confiscated by police as they investigate the claims.\nSpeaking on Mirror's Invite Only podcast, she said: 'There was one particular person who was kind of stalking me. That is under investigation at the moment, as we speak.\n'I know his computer and phone, everything has been confiscated. He was taking pictures of my house, he had my house, he had my car. So, yes, there have been times when I have been fearful.\n'I meet people and they really, the majority of people are fantastic, but then once or twice you'll, they lunge.... this one particular person will lunge at me, and he really feels he knows me. He feels he knows me. But he only knows me from the TV. Or from following me on social media. And that's quite alarming.\n'So, you know, I always have George, the guy who's driven me for the last five years, get out of the car first, always scanning.\n'I wouldn't say it's the healthiest thing. You know, I like to be kind of like a free bird, but we're coming into times now where you have to be more vigilant of yourself.'\nShaw, who is also charged with possession of a quantity of cannabis, appeared in court on Tuesday wearing a black coat over a shirt and tie. \nNo pleas were entered during the hearing, which lasted a few minutes, and Shaw spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood what had been said. \n\nKyle Shaw (pictured), 37, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday accused of stalking the Strictly judge, 64, between August 31, 2017, and November 29, 2023, by sending her online messages \n\nShaw is pictured leaving Liverpool Crown Court on February 4 after facing charges against Shirley \n\nIt comes just months after Shirley was forced to phone the police when an alleged stalker 'lunged at her and took photos of her house and car'. It is unknown whether that incident is linked to Shaw \nShaw was given bail with conditions including not to enter London and not to contact Shirley or her partner.\nA provisional trial date was set for January 12, next year, with the case expected to last five days. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones adjourned the case for a hearing on February 25.\nShirley has been head judge on the BBC show since 2017.\nHer ordeal comes just a few months after Gavin Plumb was convicted over his attempts to kidnap former This Morning host, Holly Willoughby.\nShirley previously told how she has changed how she is much more aware of her safety ever since Holly's ordeal was made public. \nShe said: 'I am a very vigilant person. When I go out, I'm careful not to go alone. If it's at night, I'm always a little bit nervous.\n'There's what you read on social media, (and then) particularly with Holly - her experiences. So, yeah, I don't take anything lightly. \n\nShirley previously told how she has changed how she is much more aware of her safety ever since Holly's ordeal was made public\n'There are many amazing people, but there are a few strange people out there. It's quite hard, and makes you always a little bit more precautious.\n'You're upping your level of alarms. And (now) I always tell my mum: \"I'm here, I've arrived\". \nI wouldn't bother normally but it's become a thing that we do. I always like to say: \"I'm safe, I'm in the right place, I'm where I should be.\" \n'Thankfully the BBC's duty of care towards me has been one thousand percent, they have been fantastic.\n'So, in some of these instances, when it was difficult - this stalker came from the north of England - I had somebody that was walking me from the hotel to here, they checked in on me to make sure that I was ok. I just felt very well protected.'\nNottinghamShirley BallasStrictly Come Dancing\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nShirley Ballas beams as she heads out in Nottingham while on the Strictly Come Dancing tour - hours after her stalker appeared in court\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nIs Kanye West taunting Kim Kardashian?

At the same time, the New York Times released a story based on Lively’s legal filing that accused him of orchestrating a negative publicity campaign against her - the pair are pictured in It Ends With Us \nA message from the Line Producer on the film dated April 25 2023 reads: 'Wardrobe's budget for spending is $185k.\n'Normally wardrobe overspends and then does tons of returns and ends up in budget. Our Wardrobe team told me they'd spend about $500k and then land back at $185k once returns are done\n'To date they've already spent $615K and they need their cashet cards all replenished because they've only shopped for Justin and Blake.\n'They had to reshop everything for Blake after creative changes but it's a lot of money.\n'I trust them of course but want to keep you all posted as this is way more than I've ever seen wardrobe go over budget with the initial spend.\n'At this point we have to replenish their cards because they haven't shopped for the other characters. Just keeping you all posted.'\nLegal documents claim Lively was 'ignoring the director’s vision for her character and disposing of the weeks of effort and creativity spent by the wardrobe team on shopping and carefully crafting her wardrobe' and 'sent hundreds of images to the Film’s costume designer'... depicting the style of wardrobe she wanted for her character.'\nThe court papers claim the costume designer had to 're-shop Lively’s wardrobe, far exceeding the allocated budget and diverting time and resources, while also preparing wardrobes for the rest of the cast. \n\nBombshell legal documents on Baldoni's explosive new website claim the budget for the film ballooned by $430,000 after Lively allegedly demanded her wardrobe be 're-shopped' to match her vision for the character of Lily Bloom - seen filming May 25, 2023 \n\nThe legal documents further claim Lively 'often' refused to go for fittings at the production office 15 minutes from her Manhattan home and allegedly demanded the outfits be shipped to her at great extra expense - pictured filming with Brandon Sklenar on May 18 2023 \n'At one point, Lively insisted that her character “had money” and could afford $5,000 shoes—despite being a fledgling small business owner. This forced Baldoni to rethink the entire script that had been in the works for well over a year and was approved by both Sony and Wayfarer – a script that Wayfarer had commissioned multiple drafts of and incorporated countless notes (including input from the book’s author, Colleen Hoover).'\n\n Blake Lively seen for first time in weeks amid Justin Baldoni lawsuit \nLively was also accused of 'insisting' that the 'costume department pack up wardrobe and deliver it to her personal residence. \nThe documents read: 'Loading the wardrobe department on trucks and delivering the contents to Lively’s home in the middle of congested Manhattan for fittings cost time and money—always in short supply on any major film. \n'Requests of this nature are typically made during contract negotiations; since Lively made no such request at the time, this added expense was not included in the budget. Lively, who had a greater obligation to the studios as an executive producer, paid no heed to budget constraints, let alone to the months of planning that had already been completed.'\nThe documents claim Baldoni and the studio 'ceded full control to Lively over her wardrobe' in an 'effort to maintain harmony' and 'avoid further delays' which would later prove 'regrettable.' \nThere was a reported backlash from Sony when paparazzi photos of Lively wearing her new wardrobe while filming on May 15 2023 were published - with the images 'widely reported as unflattering.'\nThe lawsuit claims: 'Baldoni received direct criticism from Sony, who voiced serious concerns about the impact of the photos on the Film’s public reception.'\nIt was further claimed Baldoni had approached Lively in her trailer while she was with her team to discuss 'necessary wardrobe adjustments, reassert his role as director, and get her on board with him having approval over her character’s wardrobe.'\n\nLively is pictured filming with Baldoni on May 15 2023\n\nThis comes after their lawyers raised new allegations in their hotly contested case in court on Monday; seen on December 4, 2024\n\nBaldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman pleaded with the judge to move the case forward as quickly as possible because his client was 'suffering greatly'\nThe lawsuit claims this chat was 'grossly misrepresented' in Lively's complaint which branded his exchange as a 'lengthy outburst' which delayed filming and caused the crew to wait while '[Baldoni] cried in Lively’s dressing room.'\nDailyMail.com has contacted Blake Lively's representatives for comment. \nThis comes after Lively's lawyers raised new allegations in their hotly contested case against Baldoni in court on Monday.\nBaldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, pleaded with the judge to move the case forward as quickly as possible because his client was 'suffering greatly.'\nLively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb, however, vehemently denied the claim that Lively was purposely dragging her heels in the lawsuit.\nJudge Lewis Liman denied a move from Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds to gag Team Baldoni following the series of bombshell claims made by his legal team.\nBut Gottlieb said they intend to hit Baldoni with fresh allegations in Lively's sexual harassment case, and insisted that protecting the couple's celebrity friends was going to be 'very important.'\nGottlieb told the court during the hearing that they intend to add 'both claims and parties' to a revised complaint which will be filed by Valentine's Day.\nLast week, Baldoni updated his own complaint in his $400 million defamation case against the Gossip Girl star which accused Lively of giving The New York Times advanced access to her complaint of sexual harassment during the filming of the movie It Ends With Us.\nGottlieb attacked Freedman for making statements outside of court which had challenged the ‘character, integrity and truthfulness’ of Lively.\nAfter complaining, Lively's lawyers were told was that 'we (Lively) started it' with the New York Times article, Gottlieb said.\nGottlieb cited an interview in People magazine in which Freedman accused Lively of a ‘pattern of bullying.’\nIn another statement Freedman claimed that if Lively really was sexually harassed she wouldn't have returned to the film.\nA skeptical Judge Liman said: 'isn’t that what’s stated in his complaint?' \nGottlieb said no and that lawyers were 'not supposed to launch attacks on another party’s character'.\nHe added that the leaking of raw footage from It Ends With Us was 'particularly concerning' because it could start an 'arms race' whereby lawyers have to appear in the media to fire back at every disclosure.\n'If there’s no guard rails in place….we (the attorneys) have to and go out on shows arguing on shows what a particular document or video means'.\nFreedman fired back that the statements had 'not been a one way street' and tried to walk the court through a number made by Lively's lawyers.\nAfter listening to them, Judge Liman said Freedman 'went a little bit further' than Lively's lawyers.\nThe judge said that he was adopting rules for lawyers known as Rule 3.6 which bars both of them from making extrajudicial statements that could influence the jury.\n\n Judge Liman said he was 'hesitant to adopt it' but after both sides agreed to it, he changed his mind.\nHe said: 'My expectation is the parties will comply with their ethical obligations. I don't expect this case to devolve into satellite litigation over the comments of a lawyer.\n'Both have said a lot in the pleadings that give the public plenty to feast upon'.\nFreedman tried to protest and said: 'Not to sound like a four year old fighting a four year old with 'but they started it' but once someone says something it becomes fact, there’s no way to fight against it.\n'You start to lose things without the ability to have the court’s adjudication. This was not started by us.'\nJudge Liman also warned that if both sides didn't behave themselves he could move the date of the trial forward from March next year.\n\nJudge Lewis Liman denied a move from Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds to gag Team Baldoni following the series of bombshell claims made by his legal team \nHe said: 'I’m not going to do that, I’m convinced the parties need the time for discovery.\n'But if it turns out that this ends up being litigated in the press in a way that would prejudice the opportunity of a fair trial…one of the tools the court has is to accelerate the date of the trial.\n'That’s something that is out there. I don’t want to do that.'\nEarlier in the hearing, Gottlieb, who also represents Reynolds, said that he would be seeking a protective order through the court for future filings to protect the couple's celebrity friends.\nWhile he did not name Taylor Swift, she would likely be one of those affected as she was referred to in Baldoni's complaint.\nGottlieb said: 'We do believe there will be provisions in a protective order that will be appropriate in this case given the nature of the allegations and the high profile nature of some of the individuals who will be involved.\n\nBaldoni's legal fight with Lively began after she sued him for sexual harassment just days before Christmas\n\n'There is a significant number of high profile individuals on both sides.\n'In particular addressing the interests and needs of third parties is going to be very important in this case.'\nGottlieb said he would plan to 'seek protections we believe will be very important particularly in a case where there's been a significant amount of leaking materials.'\nHe said: 'We do intend to propose a protective order in this case.'\nJudge Liman agreed and said that even before the other parties were named 'you already got a lot of high profile people' involved.\nBaldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman said he would be prepared to agree to the order.\nGottlieb also talked about discovery and how there will be a significant amount about how Baldoni and the other defendants used the media to 'shape and push forward' their retaliation strategy.\nHe also talked about finding material on 'individuals who may have been paid for taking certain positions in public.'\nFreedman, who represents Baldoni and his PR team, asked the judge in todays first court hearing to move the case forward as quickly as possible because his clients were 'suffering greatly.' \nNew York TimesBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Baldoni lawsuit claims Blake Lively blew It Ends with Us budget on her wardrobe\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nIs Kanye West taunting Kim Kardashian?

However, Rogan noted the authors “didn’t talk to us,” and also made several false statements, including claiming that Rogan’s crew “lied” about when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump would be interviewed.\n\n“No, we just didn’t tell you that Trump was coming on; he was already booked a long time ago,” Rogan said in a new episode of The Joe Rogan Experience. “This is how it worked: Trump was really easy to book, like super easy. We offered one day, he said yes, that was it. There was no, ‘What are we going to talk about? How long is it going to be? Is it going to be edited?’ There was nothing! ‘What’s the waiver? Here, give me that waiver, sign it.’ It was so easy. So, he was already booked, they never committed to doing the show.”\n\nRogan also detailed how his original intent was to release his interviews of Trump and Harris on the same day but was insistent that both interviews be held in his studio in Texas. He even offered to do the Harris interview on the same night he talked to Trump, but nothing ever happened.\n\nThe podcast host’s argument to conduct the interview in his studio stemmed from Harris’s interview with Fox News’s host Bret Baier that was cut after just 20 minutes. Rogan added that he needed “more time” to fully get to know Harris and have “a real conversation,” as the podcast host is known for talking to his guests for multiple hours on his show.\n\nRogan explained he also explored Harris coming on his show on Oct. 26, the day after he interviewed Trump. Rogan said he was willing to do this so long as it started by 8:30 a.m., as he was doing another podcast for the UFC.\n\n“So this idea that I sabotaged her, as a bunch of people say ‘I f***ed her over’ or whatever, that’s not true,” Rogan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile an interview with Harris ultimately never happened ahead of Election Day, Trump’s interview on The Joe Rogan Experience became widely popular, becoming one of the podcast’s most popular episodes with over 55 million views on YouTube. Trump made numerous podcast appearances ahead of the 2024 election, which has likely paved the way for future presidential candidates to make use of podcast interviews in future elections.\n\nRogan was one of several celebrities who attended Trump’s inauguration last month, which also had fellow comedian and podcast host Theo Von in attendance. Trump also went on Von’s podcast in August, which garnered 16 million views on YouTube.","summary":"Comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan pushed back against recent accusations he was uncooperative in setting up an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting there were “a bunch of different things that weren’t true.” A recently released excerpt from the upcoming book FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House featured discussion [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/entertainment/3310645/joe-rogan-rebuffs-claims-kamala-harris-interview/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Joe-Rogan-Harris-interview-claims-scaled.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 21:47:22","author":"Asher Notheis","authors":["Asher Notheis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":287121140,"title":"RFK Jr. nomination fight pits old GOP coalition against new","text":"Here are two examples of the split. A group aligned with former Vice President Mike Pence launched a six-figure ad buy on Fox News to try to sink Kennedy’s nomination, while philanthropist Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy’s former running mate, has vowed to “personally fund” primary challenges against senators who oppose him. “While Bobby may be willing to play nice, I won’t if you vote against him,” she said in a video posted to X last week.\n\nShanahan, like Kennedy, is a newcomer to the GOP electoral coalition. Both have a history of progressive politics. Kennedy is a literal son of the first family of American liberalism. Pence was President Donald Trump’s vice president during his first term. Also a former Indiana governor and Republican Study Committee chairman, he has deep roots in the conservative movement and is railing against Kennedy’s past advocacy of unrestricted abortion and government-run healthcare, in addition to his vaccine skepticism. Pence’s ad uses Trump’s own words against Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy and Shanahan ended their campaign as an independent presidential ticket and endorsed Trump last year. Pence split with Trump over Jan. 6 and the 2020 election results and did not back the president in 2024.\n\nTrump was able to win 82% of evangelicals, according to exit polls, without Pence’s support. He also carried Catholics by 20 points and won huge majorities among voters who believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, despite failing to endorse a federal abortion ban. Religious conservatives are Pence’s base and he was chosen as Trump’s running mate in 2016 to help build bridges to evangelicals.\n\nTrump also won the national popular vote in addition to the Electoral College this time around with at least some help from crossover voters who liked Kennedy. Exactly how much is unclear. Kennedy remained on the ballot in some states and received 756,393, or less than 0.5% of the total, for a distant fourth-place showing behind the Green Party’s Jill Stein. But he at one point polled as high as 16% nationally in a CNN-SSRS poll and was polling within the margin between Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris both nationally and in several battleground states when he dropped out.\n\nKennedy began to hemorrhage left-wing support in some polls after Harris replaced former President Joe Biden, whom Kennedy originally intended to run against in the Democratic primaries, at the top of the ticket. Some believe his remaining anti-establishment and disaffected conservative voters gave Trump a boost. (Trump’s anti-Kennedy comments that Pence quotes were made when Mar-a-Lago viewed Kennedy as an electoral threat.) The president rewarded Kennedy with a Cabinet slot after the election, if he can win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThere are also subsets of conservatives who were drawn toward Kennedy’s position on food and the pharmaceutical industry. The conservative journalist Rod Dreher published his book Crunchy Cons in 2006, which highlighted from a traditionalist perspective some of the health and lifestyle choices popular in these circles. Vaccine skepticism became more of a right-leaning than left-leaning phenomenon during COVID-19, despite Operation Warp Speed being a Trump administration initiative. \n\nA key Senate panel voted along party lines to advance Kennedy’s nomination on Tuesday. This included Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who appeared inclined to oppose Kennedy during the confirmation hearings. Cassidy is up for reelection in 2026 and could face a primary challenger.\n\nTen years ago, it would have been easy to imagine a Democratic president nominating Kennedy to a government position and him eliciting unanimous Republican opposition. \n\nIt did not look like smooth sailing for Kennedy even with Trump submitting his nomination to a Republican Senate majority. Even if Trump needed Kennedy’s voters to win, which some Republicans dispute, most red-state GOP senators don’t. \n\nBut Republicans may fall in line behind even the least conventional of Trump’s nominees. Tulsi Gabbard, a former progressive Democratic congresswoman who is Trump’s choice for director of national intelligence, is also thought to have won crossover votes for the 2024 GOP presidential ticket. Hawkish Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Trump allies who might have opposed her nomination under different circumstances, have both announced their support. So has Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), one of the three Republicans to vote against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nKennedy has softened or disavowed some liberal positions to win Republican votes, especially vowing to adhere to the Trump administration’s general opposition to elective abortion.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence’s rift with Trump has hurt his influence among Republicans. He sought the 2024 GOP presidential nomination but polled in the single digits and dropped out before the first primary or caucus. He has since sought to push back against Trump’s populist influence over the party, but the fight looks one-sided at the moment.\n\nKennedy can only afford three Republican defections to win confirmation with Vice President JD Vance’s tiebreaking vote. His nomination will soon proceed to the Senate floor.","summary":"Robert F.

He knew, as even the young children did, that Isis did not have jets to launch airstrikes. It was such an absurd question that he chose not to translate it because he didn’t want to upset the girls, the eldest of whom was 12.\n\n“From that point on, I’m sorry to say I was inaccurate in my translations of anything she said,” Moustafa told The Independent. “It was more like: How do I get these girls away from this devil?”\n\nEven before Gabbard left the Democratic Party, ingratiated herself with Donald Trump and secured his nomination to become director of National Intelligence, she was known as a prolific peddler of Russian propaganda.\n\nIn almost every foreign conflict in which Russia had a hand, Gabbard backed Moscow and railed against the US. Her past promotion of Kremlin propaganda has provoked significant opposition on both sides of the aisle to her nomination.\n\nHer journey from anti-war Democrat to Moscow-friendly Maga warrior began in Syria. The devastating conflict was sparked by pro-democracy uprisings in 2011, which were brutally crushed by the Assad regime. It descended into a complex web of factions that drew extremist Islamists from around the world and global powers into the fray.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground, documented the deaths of 503,064 people by March 2023. It said at least 162,390 civilians had died in that same time, with the Syrian government and its allies responsible for 139,609 of those deaths.\n\nBut Gabbard, a veteran of the Iraq War, viewed it all as a “regime-change war” fueled by the West and aimed at removing the dictator from power. She saw Assad – and Russia, when it entered the conflict – as legitimate defenders of the state against an extremist uprising.\n\nIn 2015, when Russia entered the Syrian war on the side of the dictator Assad, Gabbard expressed support for the move, even as the civilian toll from Moscow’s devastating airstrikes grew into the thousands.\n\n“Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated. Obama won’t bomb them in Syria. Putin did. #neverforget911,” she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt was precisely because of her support for Assad and Russia’s war that Moustafa was keen for her to attend the congressional delegation to southern Turkey to meet the victims of the conflict.\n\n“From experience, everyone that we bring over to the border, and they see the victims, they always come back with a realistic view of what’s happening and who is behind the mass displacement and killing and atrocities and so on, and so that was the objective,” he said. “What was shocking was her lack of empathy. She’ll sacrifice the facts, even when it came to little girls in front of her telling her they got bombed by a plane – it didn’t matter.”\n\nCharles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who testified twice on Syria to the House Foreign Affairs Committee when Gabbard was a member, spent years debunking her various conspiracy theories about the war.\n\n“Her consistent denial of the Syrian regime’s crimes is so wildly fringe that her potential appointment as DNI is genuinely alarming,” he told The Independent.\n\nLister said her views “appear to be driven by a strange fusion of America First isolationism and a belief in the value of autocratic and secular leaders in confronting extremism.”\n\nThey included a suggestion that Syrian rebels staged a false-flag chemical weapons attack against their supporters to provoke Western intervention against Assad — something the US intelligence agencies she will soon lead had concluded was false. She declined to call Assad a war criminal when pressed, despite masses of evidence, and used a video of Syrian government bombings to criticize US involvement in the war.\n\n“Her descriptions of the crisis in Syria read like they were composed in Assad’s personal office, or in Tehran or Moscow – not Washington,” Lister added.\n\nGabbard was not swayed by meeting the victims of Assad’s airstrikes in 2015. In fact, two years later, she went to Damascus to meet the Syrian president in person and came away even more convinced of her opinions.\n\nThe congresswoman said her visit to meet Assad – the first by a sitting US lawmaker since the conflict began – was aimed at bringing an end to the war.\n\n“I felt it’s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we’ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we could achieve peace,” she told CNN at the time.\n\nGabbard was forced to defend her embrace of Assad and other dictators during her 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination. During the Democratic primary debate, she clashed with Kamala Harris, who accused her of being “an apologist for an individual – Assad – who has murdered the people of his country like cockroaches.”\n\n“She has embraced and been an apologist for him in a way that she refuses to call him a war criminal. I can only take what she says and her opinion so seriously and so I’m prepared to move on,” added Harris, who would subsequently drop out of the race and later be selected as Joe Biden’s running mate.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, Gabbard again defended Russian aggression.\n\n“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/Nato had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns,” she posted on Twitter in 2022.\n\nGabbard appeared to fall for various conspiracy theories about the conflict that were promoted by Russia, as she had done in Syria. One of those conspiracy theories was a Russian claim about the existence of dozens of US-funded biolabs in Ukraine that were supposedly producing deadly pathogens.\n\nShe later walked back on those remarks, suggesting that there might have been some “miscommunication and misunderstanding.”\n\nGabbard’s frequent echoing of Kremlin talking points has earned her praise in Russian state media. Indeed, an article published on 15 November in the Russian-state controlled outlet RIA Novosti went so far as to call Gabbard a “superwoman.”\n\nThe possibility that Trump would tap someone with Gabbard’s history to be America’s top intelligence official shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who followed the president-elect’s first four years in the White House.\n\nDuring his 2018 summit with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the then-president was asked if he believed the US intelligence community’s assessment, which stated that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. \n\nThat assessment was based on analysis of what was determined to have been state-sponsored campaigns of fake social media posts and ersatz news sites to spread false stories about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as cyberattacks targeting the Democratic National Committee and prominent operatives associated with the Clinton campaign.\n\nBut Trump, who’d just spent several hours in a closed-door meeting with Putin, stunned the assembled press and the entire world by declaring that he trusted the Russian leader’s word over that of his own advisers.\n\n​​\"President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be,\" he replied.\n\nTrump would go on to repeatedly clash with his own intelligence appointees during the remainder of his term. He sacked his first DNI, former Indiana senator Dan Coats, after Coats repeatedly declined to back away from the government’s assessment of what Russia had done during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nLarry Pfeiffer, the director of George Mason University’s Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security, said Gabbard’s apparent susceptibility to foreign disinformation and her affinity for strongmen will give pause to American allies with whom the US routinely shares intelligence on common threats.\n\nIntelligence services, he explained, are notoriously territorial and tight-lipped on sources and methods – particularly when it comes to so-called human intelligence, or Humint, which refers to information collected by and from spies and sources within hostile governments.\n\nPfeiffer said foreign allies are likely already concerned about how a second Trump administration will handle intelligence, given the president-elect’s record. He also predicted that Gabbard’s confirmation as DNI would cause even more problems among skittish partners.\n\n“I think they wouldn’t feel like they’ve got an American confidant that they can deal with on a mature level,” he said. “I can guarantee you that the foreign intelligence services of Europe, including the Brits, are all having little side conversations right now about … what is this going to mean, and how are we going to operate, and what are we going to do now.”\n\nThe former US intelligence veteran also said Gabbard’s record of spreading foreign talking points calls into question whether she will be able to carry out the DNI’s important responsibility of briefing the president on threats to the nation.\n\nHe told The Independent: “Somebody like Tulsi Gabbard, you look at her long history of statements that seem to come out of the Kremlin’s notebook, her propensity to be influenced by their viewpoint – [it] raises questions as to whether she has the ability to present the intel community’s perspective as it is, or is she going to be one who’s going to want to discount it, influence it, color and change it, or ignore it and just present her own view?\n\n“I think it also raises questions of judgement. You know, here’s an individual who seems very prone to misinformation, prone to conspiracy theory. That should worry anybody who’s worried about America’s national security,” he added.\n\nTrump’s selection of the former Hawaii congresswoman could be a problem for the senators tasked with confirming her, on several different levels. For one, the position is unique among cabinet agencies in that there are strict requirements for who can serve in the director’s role.\n\nThe text of the 2004 law which established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington and the intelligence community’s failures leading up to the US invasion of Iraq, specifically states that any person who serves in the DNI job “shall have extensive national security expertise.”\n\nThe first person to serve as DNI, John Negroponte, was a widely respected foreign service veteran who had served as US ambassador to Iraq, Mexico, Honduras and the Philippines, as the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, and as a deputy national security adviser during the Reagan administration. The next three people to hold the office were flag-rank military officers with significant intelligence experience.\n\nPfeiffer, a US intelligence veteran of three decades’ standing who once ran the White House Situation Room and served as chief of staff to then-CIA director General Michael Hayden, told The Independent that Gabbard’s experience in the House and her military service, while admirable, do not match the standards envisioned by the authors of the 2004 law which established the office.\n\n“That’s national security experience … but she was a freaking military cop … operating at a largely tactical level, not that strategic, long-term national security perspective that one would expect,” he said.\n\nGabbard may have left the Syrian conflict behind, but Moustafa still works with its victims every day. And he believes the connection between her views on Syria and Ukraine is clear.\n\n“What happened in Syria is what allowed the Russians to feel that they could do the very same in Ukraine,” he said.\n\n“And what she is doing with Ukraine shows that it goes beyond her maybe misunderstanding one conflict. She is, hook, line and sinker, a Russian puppet.”","summary":"One expert says her views are ‘so wildly fringe that her potential appointment as DNI is genuinely alarming’, Richard Hall and Andrew Feinberg write","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tulsi-gabbard-russian-connection-dni-trump-syria-b2692244.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2020/11/27/18/GettyImages-1204959501.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Zqeo31c5-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-04 21:12:08","author":"Richard Hall","authors":["Richard Hall"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":287112630,"title":"Bear Grylls dramatically ABSEILS into Celebrity Bear Hunt premiere before posing with his rarely-seen wife Shara on the red carpet","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Feb 4th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoman, 32, 'drowns' after 'tripping over and getting trapped between rocks' on Suffolk beach: Tributes to 'beautiful' mother who died on seawall boulders as desperate rescuers tried to save her\n\n'Naked Carpenter' gets THIRTY years in jail: Naturist, 50, with a string of convictions for exposing himself is handed huge sentence for attempting to murder a policeman who he stabbed 23 times\n\nYoung dog owner, 20, goes into hiding after allegations of 'torturing' puppy prompt outrage - with vets reduced to tears\n\nFirst-ever recording of a dying human brain reveals what happens right before death\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Bombshell Lucy Letby evidence I saw today blows the case apart... and exposes an unknown gaping mystery at the heart of her trial\n\nKanye West appears to taunt ex Kim Kardashian over Bianca Censori's naked outfit at Grammys 2025\n\n'Around ten' dead in Sweden gun horror, cops reveal as terrifying new footage shows heavily-armed shooter stalking corridors as students flee for their lives\n\nMiracle of the Ozempic for alcohol: This cheap little-known pill works even if you're not a binge drinker and you can get it on the NHS - so many more should take it, reveals PROFESSOR DAVID LLOYD\n\nHow burglary gangs are using one simple tactic to steal millions from the rich and famous in a VERY exclusive neighbourhood... and did a beloved TV show give them the idea?\n\nCynthia Nixon reveals her son, her sister's kids and her friends' kids are all trans\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nIgnore what everyone else is saying about Kanye and naked Bianca...

She's just gentle, heart led. She was nervous.

What happened?' because I hadn't spoken to anyone [all day]. \n'Normally I'm at work and absolutely knackered, and so I'm like, 'All right kids?' and they're like, 'All right Mum,' and that's it - and suddenly I was, 'So, what happened today?' They were like, 'Mum, just because you've been at home all day — we've been at school, we're exhausted'.'\nHolly revealed she loved being able to return to doing the school run, something she knows other parents must have been jealous she usually got out of doing due to her early morning TV gigs. \nAs well as that, she said she had been able to go to so many more things her children - who she shares with her TV producer husband Dan Baldwin - were getting up to. \n\nCelebrity Bear Hunt: Meet The Cast!\n\nProfession: Spice Girl, TV presenter and X Factor judge \nLEOMIE ANDERSON\n\nProfession: Model, Victoria's Secret star and TV presenter for BBC Three's Glow Up: \nKOLA BOKINNI\n\nProfession: Actor and Ted Lasso star \n\nProfession: Singer and former member of The Saturdays\nLOTTIE MOSS\n\nProfession: Model and influencer\nSTEPH MCGOVERN\n\nProfession: TV presenter and journalist \n\nSHIRLEY BALLAS\n\nProfession: Former dancer and Strictly Come Dancing's head judge\nBORIS BECKER\n\nProfession: Former tennis star and Wimbledon champion \nLAURENCE LLEWELYN-BOWEN\n\nProfession: Interior design expert and Changing Rooms star\n\nProfession: Rapper and TV chef \nDANNY CIPRIANI\n\nProfession: Retired rugby player\n\nProfession: Actor and Inbetweeners star \n\nBear GryllsThis MorningUna HealyLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBear Grylls dramatically ABSEILS into Celebrity Bear Hunt premiere before posing with his rarely-seen wife Shara on the red carpet\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nIs Kanye West taunting Kim Kardashian?

This weekend, agents of the Department of Government Efficiency entered the USAID facility and the USAID website shut down. On Sunday, Trump named Secretary of State Marco Rubio acting head of the agency. \n\nThe administration placed about 600 USAID staff on leave Sunday night, and it will place 1,400 more on leave Tuesday, Politico reported. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment to confirm or deny this report.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned the “insane priorities” that USAID has funded, mentioning “$1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbia’s workplaces, $70,000 for a production of a DEI musical in Ireland, $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia, $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru.”\n\n“I don’t know about you, but as an American taxpayer, I don’t want my dollars going towards this crap,” Leavitt added.\n\nLeavitt’s remarks echo the White House’s policy against funding woke projects. As the now-rescinded memo from the Office of Management and Budget put it, the administration aims to stop funding “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.” (While the administration rescinded that memo, the White House clarified that its overarching goals remain unchanged.)\n\nThe Soros Connections\n\nYet this “crap” is exactly what the Left’s most notorious donor—George Soros—intends to fund. Soros, a Hungarian American billionaire who has funded nearly every leftist cause, established the Open Society Institute, which later became the Open Society Foundations. Open Society Foundations has worked with USAID to fund these kinds of programs.\n\n“Biden’s USAID and George Soros’s Open Society Institute frequently partnered by co-funding joint programs that promoted radical social agendas throughout the developing world,” Max Primorac, former acting chief operating officer at USAID, told The Daily Signal in an interview Tuesday. Pimorac served at USAID from February 2018 to January 2021. \n\nFormer USAID Administrator Samantha Power met with Open Society Foundations at least twice and with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation at least five times between 2021 and 2023, Fox News Digital reported. She also met with the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, left-leaning nonprofits that operate in similar orbits as Open Society.\n\nFoundations in the Open Society umbrella have worked with USAID for decades. In 2001, the Soros foundations network listed USAID among its “donor partners,” alongside other government aid agencies in countries such as Britain, Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria.\n\n2 USAID Supreme Court Cases\n\nThe Open Society Foundations’ connections with USAID run so deep, an Open Society nonprofit actually sued USAID not once but twice—and both cases reached the Supreme Court.\n\nThe story traces back to 2003, when Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act. The law provided federal funds to private groups to combat AIDS and other diseases across the world, but it came with one condition. Congress and Bush wanted to restrict funding to groups that pledge to oppose prostitution. Specifically, the law required “a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.”\n\nAIDS agencies preferred to remain neutral on prostitution to avoid alienating prostitutes who would spread the sexually-transmitted disease.\n\nAlliance for Open Society International sued, and the case reached the Supreme Court. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the anti-prostitution pledge, ruling that it violated the First Amendment.\n\n“By demanding that funding recipients adopt—as their own—the Government’s view on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects ‘protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program,'” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, warning that to strike down the requirement as unconstitutional would significantly hamstring the federal government’s ability to fund anything.\n\n“The First Amendment does not mandate a viewpoint neutral government. Government must choose between rival ideas and adopt some as its own: competition over cartels, solar energy over coal, weapon development over disarmament, and so forth,” Scalia wrote. “This Policy Requirement is nothing more than a means of selecting suitable agents to implement the Government’s chosen strategy to eradicate HIV/AIDS. That is perfectly permissible under the Constitution.”\n\nYet the Alliance for Open Society International sued again, this time arguing that requiring Open Society’s foreign affiliates to take an anti-prostitution pledge violates the First Amendment. This time, Open Society had gone too far. In USAID v. Alliance for Open Society International (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that foreign nonprofits affiliated with U.S. nonprofits do not have First Amendment rights under the Constitution.\n\nThe fact that USAID did so much work with the Open Society network that Alliance for Open Society sued not once but twice reveals the extent to which George Soros’ network has been working with USAID. The Open Society Foundations did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nAs I expose in my book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” the Open Society Foundations is part of the Left’s dark money network that funnels millions of dollars to the far-left nonprofits that staffed and advised the Biden administration. \n\nAlex Soros, the son of George Soros, took over at Open Society Foundations in 2022. Soros also accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom from then-President Joe Biden on behalf of his father in January. The foundation has bankrolled groups that advocate for critical race theory (the notion that America is systemically racist against black people), gender ideology, climate alarmism, and a preference for technocratic government.\n\nUnder Biden, it worked like this: The Open Society Foundations bankrolls a leftist group, say the Center for American Progress. That group then feeds staff into the federal government—more than sixty officials in CAP’s case. Working with those staff and via guidance documents, the group pushes the administration to take extreme stances on climate, immigration, gender ideology, and more. \n\nMy book highlights how these woke activist groups influenced policy on education, labor, energy, LGBTQ issues, the weaponization of law enforcement against conservatives, immigration, Israel, and elections.\n\nNone of these groups have disappeared since Biden left office. In fact, many of the woke activists who went from a nonprofit into the administration have since returned to woke nonprofits, creating a sort of government in exile. Others are planning to stay in the administration and oppose Trump’s agenda from within. A recent poll found that 64% of the D.C.-based federal bureaucrats who voted for Kamala Harris in the last election said they will refuse to follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.\n\nBy temporarily closing USAID and restructuring it long term, Trump is undermining one of Open Society Foundations’ key partners in pushing its woke agenda. Let’s hope the restructure lasts.","summary":"By pausing foreign funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, President Donald Trump has dealt a major blow to the ecosystem of nonprofits that...

That's cool but again that's blocking out the noise.\n\n'What am I going to do thinking about Donald Trump? How is that going to make me win the game?' \n\nDonald Trump is set to attend the Super Bowl on Sunday night for the first time as president\n\nEagles star Jordan Mailata insisted he would give no thought to playing in front of Trump\n\nChiefs linebacker Drue Tranquill said it will be 'cool to have the president at the game'\n\nNFL to make controversial Super Bowl decision over racism message with Donald Trump attending\n\nFellow Eagles lineman Lane Johnson replied: 'Ask him who he's pulling for?'\n\nAsked if he felt under more pressure to perform in front of the President, Eagles linebacker Zack Baun answered: 'No. There's gonna be a lot of big names and celebrities at the game. No pressure.'\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs tight end Noah Grey said it was going to be 'awesome' to have Trump in the Superdome. \n\nHis teammate, linebacker Drue Tranquill, said: 'Yeah. It will be cool to have the president at the game.'\n\nTrump, 78, is also recording an interview for Fox as part of their coverage on the day but is now expected to be the first President in attendance since 2002 - which was also held in New Orleans. \n\nThat day, George H. W. Bush took part in the coin toss before Patriots beat the Rams 20-17.\n\nIt will likely set up a battle in the stands at the Superdome for television airtime between Trump and Taylor Swift, who is expected to be there to cheer on her boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nWhen Trump went to New York Jets at Pittsburgh Steelers earlier in the NFL season, fans were dismayed that he was only shown on television once compared to how often Swift is shown at Chiefs games. \n\nTrump attended the Jets - Steelers game in Pittsburgh earlier in the NFL season \n\nTrump will likely rival Taylor Swift for TV airtime in the stands at the Superdome in New Orleans\n\nSwift publicly backed Kamala Harris at the last election but Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick, endorsed Trump. \n\nMahomes himself didn't reveal who he voted for but his mom Randi also publicly backed Trump. \n\nHe was also endorsed by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker and long snapper James Winchester before the election in November.\n\nTrump's scheduled appearance at the game has coincided with the NFL reportedly choosing to remove 'End Racism' messages from end zones at the Super Bowl for the first time in four years this weekend.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Sunday's showdown will be the first Super Bowl since 2021 to not include the statement at each end of the field. Instead, NFL chiefs have opted for 'Choose Love' and 'It Takes All of Us' to be used.\n\nTrump, who returned for a second term at the White House last month, has been highly critical of Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the US since his reelection; describing the programs as 'discrimination' while calling for 'merit-based' hiring to be restored.\n\nIt is believed the NFL's decision to axe the 'End Racism' messages from the Super Bowl led one high-ranking official to express concern in light of the president's controversial comments on DEI.\n\nThe Athletic's report went on to suggest that the move could well be considered 'a nod to the current political climate'.\n\nHowever, earlier this week NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was 'proud' of the league's diversity efforts while refusing to backtrack despite several organizations abandoning DEI programs in light of Trump's stance.\n\nLaw enforcement officers have flooded New Orleans after the terrorist attack last month\n\nThe NFL has chosen to remove 'End Racism' messages from end zones at the Super Bowl\n\nSuper Bowl end zones had included 'End Racism' messages since 2021, one year after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. \n\nTrump, a New Yorker who now calls Florida home, has not indicated which team he's supporting, but posted congratulations to the Chiefs after their AFC Championship win last month.\n\n'Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs,' Trump said on his social media platform.\n\n'What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers. Likewise, congratulations to the Buffalo Bills on a tremendous season. They will do a lot of winning long into the future!!!'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nChiefs and Eagles players speak out on playing in front of Donald Trump with president set to attend the Super Bowl\n\nAdd comment","summary":"MAX WINTERS IN NEW ORLEANS: When asked for their reactions to the news that Trump would be flying into Louisiana for the game, players on both rosters claimed they did not see it as a distraction.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14360551/Chiefs-Eagles-super-bowl-Donald-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/04/20/94862087-0-image-m-14_1738702134893.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 21:00:17","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.133},{"id":287140804,"title":"What New DNC Leadership Says About Direction of Democratic Party","text":"After bizarre and inadvertently comical candidate forums, the Democratic National Committee elected Kenneth Martin to be its next chairman and gun control advocate David Hogg to be one of its new vice chairs. \n\nWhile the DNC boasted of its racial, sexual, and gender diversity (and its quota system to fill party leadership roles), DNC voters ultimately chose two white men to address the party’s problems.\n\nMartin and Hogg emerged victorious in the DNC elections, but not before all the candidates delivered speeches and participated in candidate forums, in which they doubled down on absurd left-wing positions.\n\nWhen asked by a moderator at a candidates forum whether they believed “racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat,” all of the candidates raised their hands. \n\nThe DNC also highlighted its requirement for “gender balance” among its officers that factors in a “nonbinary” candidate. “Rules specify that when we have a gender nonbinary candidate or officer, the nonbinary individual is counted as neither male nor female, and the remaining six officers must be gender-balanced,” Jaime Harrison, the outgoing chairman, explained. \n\nThough Martin is not a nationally known figure, the committee appears to have picked a “true believer.”\n\nMartin hails from the liberal state of Minnesota, which lent its governor, Tim Walz, to Harris’ failed presidential campaign as her vice presidential running mate. As chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s affiliate of the national Democratic Party) since 2011, Martin presided over the party’s passage of the “Trans Refuge” law. The law restricts the state government from complying with subpoenas, arrest warrants, and other legal actions from entities outside the state that are directed against people who come to Minnesota from other states for transgender “treatments.”\n\nDemocrats in Minnesota also passed a law that enshrined a “right” to an abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022 as well as another law that opposed school choice, and proposed a bill to require all state agencies to refuse to comply with the federal government on border enforcement.\n\nThe little-known Martin faces a series of monumental challenges. The Harris-Walz ticket’s losing all seven swing states as well as the popular vote in November’s presidential election has sent the Democratic Party into a period of soul searching. Democrats lost ground nationally with minority, male, and young voters.\n\nGetting the message out was not the issue for Democrats. Voters heard them loud and clear, but the Democratic Party’s priorities do not align with those of most of the electorate. According to a January poll conducted by Ipsos and The New York Times, voters most frequently listed abortion, LGBTQ rights, and climate change as the Democrats’ top priorities. When asked to list their own top concerns, voters chose the economy and inflation, health care, immigration, and taxes.\n\nHarrison, the outgoing DNC chairman, encouraged a more assertive approach from the DNC that would not be a “rubber stamp to whatever the [next Democratic presidential] campaign wants.”\n\nHistorically, the chair of the DNC is responsible for leading fundraising and campaign organizing for the Democratic Party. The DNC also organizes the Democratic National Convention, which occurs every four years and features the party’s platform and presidential ticket. It’s likely that Martin will have an outsized impact on leading the party, given the lack of a Democrat president, speaker of the House, or Senate majority leader.\n\nHarrison also argued in a recent interview that Democrats should have kept then-President Joe Biden at the top of the 2024 presidential ticket, even after his disastrous debate performance. \n\n“I went into this thinking, OK, you’ve got probably the most successful of my lifetime legislative president who has poured tons of money into making sure that not just Joe Biden and Kamala Harris get elected, but Democrats get elected—not just in the battleground states, but all states who support a lot of resources and his own time fundraising in order to strengthen the state parties,” Harrison said.\n\nIn Martin, Harrison might have the fighter he desires. Martin has a reputation for competence and ruthlessness. When Martin took over the Minnesota state party, it was in debt, and he was widely credited with turning it around. “Ken will cut you if he has to, but that ruthlessness is what we need to achieve electoral success,” one DNC operative told Politico.\n\nMartin leaned into his reputation in his first press interview since his election, saying, “I’ve always viewed my role as a chair of the Democratic Party to take the low road, so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road; meaning, I’m going to throw a punch.” \n\nThe DNC also elected three vice chairs on Saturday, including Hogg.\n\nHogg, who is just 24, rose in prominence after surviving a mass shooting at his high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. Not long after the shooting, Hogg and several of his fellow students began appearing in the media and organizing protests in favor of greater restrictions on guns. \n\nAfter taking a year off before starting college, Hogg was accepted to Harvard University despite getting a 1270 on the SAT, compared with an average score of 1520 for admitted students at the time. \n\nHogg’s election as a Generation Z man comes after Democrats have struggled to attract young men in recent years. In 2024, Donald Trump won a majority of men under the age of 30, according to an AP VoteCast survey, a stark reversal from just four years earlier. \n\nIn an interview with Semafor’s David Weigel, Hogg explained why he thought young men in the United States had shifted right. He cited how COVID-19 had increased loneliness among young men, and he blamed the Democratic Party for not seeming to have a place for men anymore. \n\n“Then people reacted so viscerally to Donald Trump’s election that a lot of liberals started policing everybody around us. It gave us a sense that we’re morally superior, we’re better than other people,” he said, disapprovingly. The question remains whether the new vice chairman will heed his own advice, given his penchant for accusing public officials of immorality on the issue of guns. \n\nIn 2018, Hogg attacked then-Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for allegedly prioritizing campaign contributions over the lives of children. \n\n“I’m going to start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every student’s life in Florida,” Hogg said at a rally in 2018. Rubio had just a few weeks prior spent nearly two hours engaging with survivors of the Parkland school shooting during a CNN town hall. Today, Rubio serves as secretary of state.\n\nReactions to the DNC election were mixed.\n\n“By continuing to elect radical leftists to party leadership positions, the Democrats are doubling down on their failed policies. The landslide election of President Donald Trump should have shown the Democrats that Americans want secure borders, robust law enforcement, and to reduce the size and scope of government all while increasing individual liberty,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., told The Daily Signal.\n\n“Democrats appear to have learned nothing from the last election. They still think men can get pregnant, boys should compete in women’s sports, and hiring should be based on DEI, not merit. That’s just fine with me. They can keep appealing to their radical, woke base—and Republicans will focus on representing the rest of America who decisively rejected their message when they reelected President Trump in November,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.\n\nTyler Austin Harper, a professor at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, and contributing writer at The Atlantic, said the pick would not appeal to voters Democrats lost in November’s election.\n\nNoted conservative intellectual Robert P. George wrote on X that members of the DNC had concluded “they weren’t woke enough.” \n\nDemocrats’ extreme left-wing views had a real effect on alienating voters in the last election cycle. To take just two examples, Harris received only 83% of the black American vote, the Democrats’ most loyal base, compared with Biden’s 91% of that vote in 2020. And Harris received only 56% of the Hispanic vote, compared with the 63% Biden drew in 2020.\n\nTrump, for his part, seems committed to keeping his promises like reforming the deep state and securing the American border.","summary":"After bizarre and inadvertently comical candidate forums, the Democratic National Committee elected Kenneth Martin to be its next chairman and gun control advocate David Hogg...

Billionaire Elon Musk's grip on U.S. government spending raises questions","text":"The world's richest man, acting as an unelected \"efficiency\" consultant to President Trump, has in recent days managed the rare feat of overshadowing his boss — presuming to storm into and begin closing out government agencies at will. After two weeks of chaos caused by Trump's own unilateral executive orders to radically alter the federal government, it was suddenly Elon Musk whose name was everywhere in Washington this week, as he and his deputies in the new Department of Government Efficiency slashed at the federal bureaucracy in a purported effort to cut costs. Disregarding established security protocols while downplaying the budgetary authority of Congress, they accessed sensitive Treasury Department systems full of Americans’ most personal data and declared that the U.S. Agency for International Development — the agency long in charge of distributing American foreign aid to places such as Gaza, Ukraine and sub-Saharan Africa — was corrupt and being shuttered. They suggested anyone who stood in their way, including career civil servants with actual authority to safeguard Treasury and USAID data, were the real rogue agents. And they and their allies dismissed rising outrage among Democrats as the whining resistance of political sore losers. In one instance, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, tore into Musk for overreaching, saying \"we don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk.\" \"Elon Musk, you didn't create USAID. The United States Congress did for the American people,\" Raskin said. \"And just like Elon Musk did not create USAID, he doesn't have the power to destroy it.\" Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security, shot back on the social media platform X, which Musk owns. \"Democrat politicians hate democracy,\" Miller wrote. \"They don't believe voters have the right to elect a president to drain the permanent unelected DC swamp.\" The showdown continued a roiling debate over U.S. governance that defined the 2024 race between Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris and has continued to shape Trump's presidency in its first days. The battle is between legacy government and the legal checks and balances that have held it together for generations, a system Democrats are vociferously trying to defend — including in court — and Trump's new order, aimed at tearing down the status quo with the fast-paced, slash-and-burn tactics of venture capital and big tech, where breaking things in the name of innovation is celebrated. Trump and his supporters believe they have a sweeping new mandate to drive change, thanks to a slim win for Trump and tiny majorities for Republicans in the House and Senate, powered in part by nearly $300 million in campaign contributions from Musk. They say Trump chose Musk to ferret out fraud and waste, and that Musk as a result has all the authority he needs to proceed unimpeded. Trump, never one to appreciate being upstaged, has so far remained unmoved by the growing alarm over Musk usurping undue power — though those concerns have clearly reached him. In recent remarks, Trump has said he approves of Musk's work so far, but also that he remains in charge as president and won't always agree with the tech billionaire's playbook. \"Sometimes we won't agree with it, and we'll not go where he wants to go,\" Trump said. \"But I think he's doing a great job. He's a smart guy.\" Trump said he won't allow Musk to work in areas where he has a conflict, but hasn't seen anything of concern yet. In addition to being the primary owner of X, Musk is the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla. The companies hold dozens of contracts with the federal government worth billions of dollars. Democrats say it is impossible to untangle Musk from his conflicts, particularly if he is given sweeping spending authority across all of federal government. They say no president has the legal right to disregard budget decisions by Congress or the basic structure of government as outlined in the Constitution and other law — much less an unelected and clearly conflicted subordinate who has not been confirmed to any real government position by the Senate. And they warned that a system that hands government control over to rich campaign donors is not a democracy at all, but an oligarchy. \"Before our very eyes, an unelected, shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said during a news conference Monday. Schumer said DOGE employees doing Musk's bidding had on Friday \"forcefully gained access\" to the Treasury Department's payment system and \"the most sensitive information of virtually every U.S. citizen,\" including Social Security data, tax information and Medicare and Medicaid benefit data. Schumer took a similar message to X, attacking DOGE there as a made-up entity with zero legitimate power. \"DOGE has no authority to make spending decisions. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law,\" Schumer wrote. \"DOGE's conduct cannot be allowed to stand. Congress must take action to restore the rule of law.\" Musk, reportedly operating as a \"special government employee\" with limited responsibilities, called Schumer's response \"hysterical\" and proof that DOGE \"is doing work that really matters.\" \"This is the one shot the American people have to defeat BUREAUcracy, rule of the bureaucrats, and restore DEMOcracy, rule of the people,\" Musk wrote on X. \"We’re never going to get another chance like this. It's now or never. Your support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.\" How the American people feel about Musk's latest actions is not entirely clear. But polling in recent months has showed Americans are skeptical of his role in government, and of him personally. A Quinnipiac poll conducted toward the end of Trump's first week in office found that 53% of registered voters disapproved of Musk playing a prominent role in the administration, compared to 39% who approved. An AP-NORC poll conducted early last month, before Trump took office, found that two-thirds of U.S. adults said corruption and inefficiency were \"major problems\" in the federal government, and about 6 in 10 said the same about government regulations and bureaucracy. However, only a third of respondents had a favorable view of Musk, and about 6 in 10 said the president relying on billionaires for advice on government policy would be a \"very\" or \"somewhat\" bad thing. Late Monday, several unions representing federal employees sued the Treasury Department for sharing what they said was \"confidential data\" with Musk's team — alleging new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had abdicated his responsibility to protect the data by granting Musk access and by taking \"punitive measures\" against Treasury employees who had tried to block it. \"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE,'\" the lawsuit read. \"And federal law says they do not have to.\" Street protests have also erupted over Musk's moves, with one titled \"Nobody elected Elon\" scheduled Tuesday. Bessent had reportedly spent part of Monday behind closed doors with Republican lawmakers, reassuring them that Musk's team did not have control over a Treasury system that controls trillions of dollars in federal funding. Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, has also disputed claims that DOGE representatives accessed classified information without the proper security clearances. She and other Trump officials have backed DOGE's work in part by alleging that both the Treasury and USAID ran afoul of Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Katie Miller's husband, Stephen Miller, offered a particularly stunning assessment of USAID, an agency established by President Kennedy in 1961 and enshrined in law to distribute billions of dollars in foreign assistance. \"Bureaucrats at USAID cannot interfere in the affairs of foreign countries to prop up regimes, to thwart America's interests, to facilitate mass illegal immigration, nor to facilitate diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which violate federal civil rights law,\" Stephen Miller said on Fox News. Musk has said USAID is \"an arm of the radical-left globalists\" and responsible for \"insane spending.\" To Trump's decision to put Secretary of State Marco Rubio in charge of USAID amid a review of spending, Musk replied: \"Cool.\" USAID's budget, while massive in terms of overseas spending power, amounts to less than 1% of the current federal budget. And its programs have been lauded on a bipartisan basis for years for providing a vital lifeline to people around the world, including for HIV medications and other healthcare aimed at stemming infectious diseases. Dr. Atul Gawande, USAID's head of global health under the Biden administration, has called Musk's claims about the agency a \"willful distortion,\" and said the \"impending shutdown of USAID is unconstitutional and reveals complete ignorance or indifference to how vital its work — in global health, conflicts, disasters and beyond — is to Americans and humanity.\" Democrats have also strongly defended USAID. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on CNN that USAID supports an array of international initiatives, not just in support of vulnerable populations but American foreign policy priorities — from \"countering Chinese influence inside Africa\" to \"fighting back against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\" International aid organizations sounded alarm over potential disruptions to humanitarian aid in Gaza, which has been decimated by Israel in its ongoing war against Hamas, while others worried over cuts to Ukraine, which is fighting off a Russian invasion. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Musk and his team's foray into federal agencies was \"an illegal act\" that the Trump administration was trying to justify through sheer brazenness. \"They are depending on some sort of sense of swagger and inevitability to storm into buildings, and take over the servers, and to run the databases, and to relieve people of their duties,\" he said, \"like this is some hostile takeover of a tech company.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Americans should be extremely concerned about Musk gaining access to government data without any legitimate authority or clear limits on how the information may be used. \"Whether it's to boost his finances or expand his political power,\" she said, \"it is all up to Elon.\"","summary":"Billionaire Elon Musk was the focus of many in Washington this week, as his Department of Government Efficiency slashed at the federal bureaucracy.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-04/elon-musk-grip-on-federal-government-raises-questions","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cdb91b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F27%2F0f49380240a8849d858b4601b845%2Fhttps-delivery-getty","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 20:22:06","author":"Kevin Rector","authors":["Kevin Rector"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":287116842,"title":"Wikipedia blacklists Blaze News and other right-leaning sources, ensuring it's a one-stop liberal propaganda shop","text":"maintains that articles on its site \"should be based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered.\"\n\n new study by Media Research Center Free Speech America highlighted that Wikipedia has discounted right-leaning sources as reliable and prohibited their citation in articles, all but guaranteeing that the site is little more than a repository for liberal propaganda.\n\n It's no secret that Wikipedia's volunteer editors are predominantly ideological myopes favorable to leftist causes, ideas, and personalities and antipathetic to conservatives of various stripes.\n\n For instance, editors at Wikipedia, whose parent company \n blew 29.2% of its 2023-2024 budget on race-obsessive DEI programs, tried to hide Vice President JD Vance's military accomplishments in the lead-up to the 2024 election; strategically eliminated any mention of Kamala Harris' appointment as border czar on the list of executive branch czars; advocated deleting the entry detailing the mass killings executed by communist regimes, citing an anti-communist bias; labeled Elon Musk's temporary suspension of journalists who allegedly violated his platform's terms of service as the \"Thursday Night Massacre\"; and gaslighted readers about the history, existence, and nature of cultural Marxism, characterizing the well-defined and well-chronicled offshoot of Marxism as a a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\n 'Even in cases where the source may be valid, it is usually better to find a more reliable source instead.'\n\n 2024 study published in Online Information Review found that Wikipedia — now run by the former chief operating officer for Planned Parenthood Federation of America and previously run by a censorious alumna of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leader program who stated that \"our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that is getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done\" — suffers a \"significant liberal bias in the choice of news media sources.\"\n\n The Dutch researchers noted further that \"this effect persists when accounting for the factual reliability of the news media.\"\n\n Wikipedia, which now deals primarily in \"propaganda\" and exists only to \"give an establishment point of view\" \n according to co-founder Larry Sanger, has apparently leaned harder into its bias.\n\n The new MRC study noted that Wikipedia editors are permitted to cite a variety of leftist publications that have a reputation for pushing false narratives and fake news, including Jacobin, Mother Jones, NPR, and \n Rolling Stone, but are precluded from citing publications not similarly staffed by liberal activists.\n\n Citing the \n Wikipedia page on reliable and perennial sources, the study highlighted that numerous reputable right-leaning publications have been blacklisted.\n\n Wikipedia states, for instance, that Blaze News, the Daily Wire, the Daily Caller, the Epoch Times, Fox News, ZeroHedge, the Washington Free Beacon, the Federalist, RedState, the Media Research Center, and the Alexander Hamilton-founded New York Post \"should normally not be used\" as sources and \"should never be used for information about a living person.\"\n\n \"Even in cases where the source may be valid, it is usually better to find a more reliable source instead. If no such source exists, that may suggest that the information is inaccurate,\" added the Wikipedia entry on reliable sources.\n\n 'It is now only reliable for pushing a radical narrative.'\n\n Whereas most right-leaning publications were flagged as \"generally unreliable,\" Breitbart News appears to have been among the few singled out for a formal blacklisting. Wikipedia alleged that the \"site has published a number of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories as fact\" and complained that the publication had revealed the identity of multiple Wikipedia editors.\n\n The New York Times qualifies as reliable despite \n falsely accusing President Donald Trump of lying about Democrats' abortion ambitions; characterizing the suggestion that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab that conducted dangerous experiments on coronaviruses as a \"fringe\" \"conspiracy theory lack[ing] evidence\"; printing false Hamas propaganda; pushing the Russian collusion narrative; and misleading readers on various other issues.\n\n Rolling Stone, which has \n paid out millions in the past for false and defamatory reporting, appears not to have learned its lesson, lying, for instance, in recent years about an imagined Florida book ban and smearing Michael Knowles of the Daily Wire. It was also characterized as \"generally reliable.\"\n\n Politico similarly received a reliable rating despite — or perhaps as a result of — its willingness to help a cabal of former intelligence officials interfere with the 2020 election by mischaracterizing the New York Post's reliable Hunter Biden laptop story as \"Russian disinfo,\" and to mislead Americans about the working relationship between former President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for the benefit of the former vice president's campaign.\n\n According to the MRC study, only 16% of left-wing media sources were unable to secure Wikipedia's stamp of approval. Meanwhile, 100% of right-leaning sources were effectively blacklisted.\n\n The MRC study noted further that the predicable result is that \"conservatives, Republicans, and Trump appointees are smeared, maligned, and slandered by the most popular online source for information about people.\"\n\n Christopher Bedford, senior editor for politics and Washington correspondent for Blaze Media, noted, \"You've got to remember, none of this — none of it — is based in fact. We were right about COVID, right about Biden, right about immigration, right about trans. We were right about virtually every major contested issue impacting this country for the past 10 years, while over and over again outlets from the New York Times to PolitiFact were embarrassingly wrong.\"\n\n \"They can't handle that, and so the ideologues ban us,\" continued Bedford. \"It's pathetic, but it's also dangerous, and every penny you give to support this project is a penny given against speech and truth.\"\n\n Dan Schneider, MRC vice president, noted, \"There used to be a joke about how Wikipedia could not be relied on by historians and academics. Wikipedia has now become the joke.\"\n\n \"Its radical editors and staff reveal their contempt for conservatives in almost everything they inject into descriptions,\" continued Schneider. \"It was never something people could rely on for accurate information.

What happened?' because I hadn't spoken to anyone [all day]. \n'Normally I'm at work and absolutely knackered, and so I'm like, 'All right kids?' and they're like, 'All right Mum,' and that's it - and suddenly I was, 'So, what happened today?'

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:19:24 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:19:26 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nKelsey Parker says she has been bombarded with online abuse since confirming her pregnancy with new boyfriend Will Lindsay. \nParker has embarked on a new romance as she begins a fresh chapter following the death of pop star husband Tom Parker to brain cancer in 2022. \nAlready a parent to children Aurelia, five, and Bodhi, four, with The Wanted star, Parker, 34, surprised followers in January that she is now pregnant with a third - her first with Lindsay, 27. \nBut the announcement has divided followers, and she admits to being targeted by online trolls since breaking the news. \nShe told The Sun: 'It’s crazy. I knew I would be judged. But people who haven’t lost their partner, I don’t know how you can pass comment on me? I have been in such a dark place from losing Tom.\n'I was so lonely and so unhappy. I feel like there are people who want me to always feel like that.

I have two children (and another one on the way) that I have to get out of bed for. People are shocked I go to Tesco but I need to feed my kids.' \nParker was devastated after husband Tom lost his battle with brain cancer aged just 33, four years after they exchanged vows. \nBut she admits she must look forward and establish a future for herself and their children after coming to terms with the fact that he is gone, and won't be coming back. \nShe said: 'While it’s been difficult for me, it’s horrible for Will too. This is his first child and he’s preparing to be a dad. I’ve already had this experience. I feel like people are taking the excitement away from Will.\n'Although the best thing about Will is that he reads nothing. He has no clue. He goes, \"Kelsey, I don't know why you're looking at those comments.\"\nSpeaking about her baby news in a recent interview with The Mirror, Parker said Aurelia has already had ideas about the name of hr unborn brother or sister. \nShe said: 'I feel like Aurelia's been in this world before. And when I was eight weeks pregnant, she came up and started talking to a baby in my tummy.\n'Will and I just looked at each other in total disbelief! She has also said she'd like the baby to be called 'Parker' if it's a boy!'\n\nParker surprised followers in January that she is now pregnant with a third - her first with Lindsay\n\nEXCLUSIVE Kelsey Parker and The Wanted's Max George are locked in a secret FEUD, her friends tell KATIE HIND \nShe also admitted her pregnancy announcement means she's 'put herself out there', but insisted that she wanted people to be as 'happy' as she was.\nParker also said that she believes that the pregnancy would have got Tom's 'blessing', adding that he 'wouldn't want' her to be living in 'sadness.' \nShe started dating tree surgeon Lindsay last year told how her partner lives with her at the home she shared with Tom and the kids, remarking how he 'gradually moved in' when the time 'felt right'.\nThe couple stated that they didn't have a preference about the baby's sex and were currently 'undecided' about whether they wanted to know the news - which is waiting for them in an email.\n\nParker was devastated after husband Tom lost his battle with brain cancer aged just 33, four years after they exchanged vows \nKelsey ParkerThe WantedTescoTom Parker\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKelsey Parker reveals she's been targeted by trolls who 'think I should be sat at home dressed in black all day' after announcing pregnancy with new partner - three years after death of husband Tom\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nHolly Willoughby wows in a black dress as she joins Lottie Moss, Una Healy and Mel B at the premiere of new Netflix series Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nEXCLUSIVELip reader reveals Kanye West's brusque command to staff moments before Bianca Censori stripped off in shocking Grammys stunt\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy has THREE outfit changes as she wraps up warm in New York City in an eccentric off-white fluffy coat before swapping into chic co-ords\n\nSomething for everyone!

Being not only a First Amendment and communications lawyer but also having been a TiVo early adopter, I scrolled back and confirmed: Monday was going to be a busy day.\n\nAlmost immediately, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was investigating CBS for what became known as \"Nipplegate.\" The network then turned to my boss, who enlisted my help, to defend against indecency charges. Years of opposition before the agency and in appeals court followed. During that time, the FCC also proposed to fine CBS even more for an episode of Without A Trace with a scene depicting a teenage hook-up party, which the commission claimed was impermissible under its indecency standards.\n\nEventually, the network prevailed in court, and the FCC had to cut CBS a check returning the fines it had paid for the halftime show. (The Without a Trace matter ultimately got dropped.)\n\nNow CBS is back in the news. Less than two weeks into President Donald Trump's second term, the network's parent company Paramount is considering settling his lawsuit claiming CBS' coverage of the presidential campaign—and, in particular, an allegedly deceptively edited interview with Kamala Harris—was unfair and somehow harmed him. Reports have tied this possible settlement to Paramount's planned merger with Skydance, which Paramount shareholders fear the new administration could try to block or delay.\n\nNotably, this also comes against a backdrop of President Trump's appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr rattling his saber at broadcast networks that have earned the president's ire.\n\nShortly before the inauguration, under the guidance of its former, Joe Biden–appointed chair, the FCC dismissed complaints against ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC regarding broadcasts during the campaign—including CBS' 60 Minutes Harris interview. In doing so, the FCC emphasized the importance of honoring CBS' editorial discretion and broadcasters' First Amendment right to report on matters of public concern as they see fit. But Trump's handpicked successor has indicated the FCC will reconsider that dismissal, along with the NBC and ABC dismissals (but not the Fox dismissal, unsurprisingly). \n\nFreedom of the press protects journalists and the news media in publishing information—especially in the political sphere—free from official censorship. In that way, a free press serves a vital role as the \"Fourth Estate\" in our democratic society, keeping citizens informed so that individuals may oversee their government's actions. As Ida B. Wells stated, \"The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare with the press.\"\n\nThat's why it's concerning that CBS would go to the mattresses over a halftime show for a game it gets once every fourth year, or even a bread-and-butter scripted show like Without a Trace, but would capitulate when it comes to its news and political coverage. Already the network is reportedly poised to comply with an FCC demand for the transcript and camera feeds from the 60 Minutes interview. \n\nWhen parties to legal disputes resolve them with monetary payments rather than seeing them through to a decision, it is often said they are \"buying peace.\" Here, there is no peace to be bought, at least not without reassurance from the courts that CBS can cover political matters as its editorial discretion dictates, no matter how much it might displease the president or his appointees.\n\nLet's be clear: Paramount isn't buying peace—it's only buying CBS a four-year supply of lube.","summary":"Settling Trump’s CBS lawsuit won’t buy peace—it will sell out press freedom.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/04/paramount-shouldnt-fold-to-trump/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/trump-paramount-1024x576.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 19:20:07","author":"Jacob Sullum,Ronnie London","authors":["Jacob Sullum","Ronnie London"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.013},{"id":287092050,"title":"Republicans grill FBI over troubling discrepancy about Jan. 6 pipe-bomb suspect still roaming free","text":"GOP lawmakers are demanding answers from the FBI after a former head of the bureau’s DC office claimed a person who laid pipe bombs before the Jan. 6 riots has not been ID’d in part because of “corrupted” cellular data — a fact disputed by major US carriers.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia fired off a letter Monday to the bureau’s acting director, Brian Driscoll, about the troubling discrepancy.\n\nThe congressmen wrote that the cell carriers “indicated that they neither provided corrupted data to the FBI nor received any notification from the FBI of any issues accessing the data.”\n\nThe pols’ inquiry comes after FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D’Antuono — who led the probe of pipe bombs placed outside Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters before the riot four years ago — testified before Congress in June 2023 that “some data” had been “corrupted by one of the providers, not purposely.\n\n“It wasn’t purposely corrupted. I don’t want any conspiracy theories. But that could have been good information that we don’t have, right? So that is painful for us to not to have that,” D’Antuono told members and staff of the House Judiciary Committee at the time.\n\nThe discrepancy highlighted by the Republican lawmakers raises questions about whether the FBI abandoned its probe too early, thinking the wannabe bomber’s identity was not as important as rounding up other Jan. 6 criminals and thus putting its resources elsewhere.\n\nA report issued by House Republicans earlier this month noted that the agency’s probe into the bombs ended after about a month — leaving the would-be violent suspect still roaming free.\n\n“By the end of February 2021, the FBI began diverting resources away from the pipe bomb investigation,” the report said.\n\n“One possible explanation for the reduction in resources is that the number of credible leads began to decline, no longer requiring as many special agents to cover the workload.”\n\nA backpack-carrying person wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, mask, gloves, glasses and Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers had planted both explosives Jan. 5, 2021, according to security footage released by the bureau.\n\nThe perp had also used a cellphone when skulking around the major political parties’ HQs — and bureau agents used geofencing technology that initially “yielded a promising array of data and revealed numerous persons of interest,” according to a report last month from the House Administration Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight.\n\nOne of those people was someone who searched the term “pipe bomb DC” before the devices were found, a person who drove a vehicle that passed the RNC with a passenger matching the description of the suspect minutes after the bombs were planted, and a person who owned the same Nike sneakers worn by the suspect and who worked near the crime scene.\n\nThe “viable explosive devices,” as the House GOP report characterized the bombs, were discovered on the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, as President Trump headlined a “Stop the Steal” rally to delay congressional certification of the results of the 2020 election.\n\nD’Antuono testified that the FBI’s lab division confirmed the bombs were “viable” but added that they were “rudimentary, at best,” having been equipped with a 60-minute kitchen timer for detonation.\n\nIf detonated, their blasts could have shot shrapnel through the air into passing cars or trains, causing “serious bodily injury and or death,” the Republican report found.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were at the time “within feet” of the devices as they traveled to and from DNC headquarters that day.\n\nLoudermilk, who has been investigating the Capitol riot, quizzed the bureau in October about what happened to the data — but never heard back by the issuance of his panel’s report Jan. 2.\n\nJohnson, who chairs a permanent subcommittee on investigations in the Senate, Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, and Loudermilk also sent letters Tuesday to AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon demanding records about the feds’ request for cell data on the eve of the Capitol riot.\n\nThey asked the FBI for “communications between or among employees of the FBI” and “between the FBI and any cellular carrier, third-party contractor, other law enforcement agency” about the incident — as well as copies of the data received by the bureau and “all memoranda, reports, assessments, evaluations, or other records” on the analysis of it.\n\nThere’s still a $500,000 reward on the table from the bureau for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for planting the pipe bombs.\n\nThe FBI, asked by The Post about the congressmen’s letter, replied Tuesday, “The FBI received the letter. We don’t have any additional comment.”","summary":"Sen. Ron Johnson, Rep. Jim Jordan and Rep.

Although he'd found a passion in the budding industry, computers were still \"a big unknown\" at the time, Gates said.He spent a month working on Capitol Hill every day. At the time, Gates said he saw a career in computers as a \"possible path,\" but he was taken by the drama of working in politics.His stint in Washington. D.C., coincided with presidential candidate Thomas Eagleton dropping out of the 1972 race — Gates said he later sold Eagleton's campaign pins as collectors' items. Working as a page during that time \"was the closest thing to a political thriller I'd ever witnessed,\" Gates said.After a month on The Hill, Gates said he began to consider a career in politics and government as a serious path he could take, starting with studying law. By the time he was applying for college, Gates said he saw a \"tantalizing menu of different possibilities\" in university catalogs.In fact, he wrote in his application essay to Harvard that he didn't plan to continue concentrating on computers — telling the university that he was \"most interested in business or law.\" He told Yale that he wanted to go into government work.Gates said his breakthrough in computing came in December 1974 with the advent of the first successful minicomputer kit by MITS, a US-based electronics company. From there, Gates and his Microsoft cofounder, Paul Allen, worked on crafting a new programming language for the Altair 8800.Though he didn't end up becoming a politician or finishing his college degree at Harvard, Gates is politically active as a donor and philanthropist. He privately said he donated $50 million to pro-Kamala Harris super-PAC Future Forward, The New York Times reported in October.\"It's nearly impossible to spend time in Congress, even on that lowest level, and not get swept up by it,\" he wrote.","summary":"The uncertain future of computers and software led Microsoft's Bill Gates to explore other career paths &mdash; including becoming a politician.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-considered-politics-politician-instead-microsoft-computers-2025-2","image":"https://i.insider.com/67a248087bb3f854015badc5?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 19:16:48","author":"Jordan Hart","authors":["Jordan Hart"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.081},{"id":287086828,"title":"Kanye West appears to taunt ex Kim Kardashian over Bianca Censori's naked outfit at Grammys 2025","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Feb 4th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Around ten' dead in Sweden gun horror, cops reveal as terrifying new footage shows heavily-armed shooter stalking corridors as students flee for their lives\n\nWoman, 32, 'drowns' after 'tripping over and getting trapped between rocks' on Suffolk beach: Tributes to 'beautiful' mother who died on seawall boulders as desperate rescuers tried to save her\n\n'Naked Carpenter' gets THIRTY years in jail: Naturist, 50, with a string of convictions for exposing himself is handed huge sentence for attempting to murder a policeman who he stabbed 23 times\n\nThe 14 hospital 'failures' which experts claim exonerates serial child killer Lucy Letby\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Bombshell Lucy Letby evidence I saw today blows the case apart... and exposes an unknown gaping mystery at the heart of her trial\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nWhy do celebs pose in hospital beds with their surrogate babies?

Just desperate for the attention. Wasn't even 15mins, maybe like 2 mins of fame. \nBut Fox fired back at the troll, writing: 'He f***ing wanted me to!!!!' \nAfter West and Fox struck up a romance at the beginning of the year, sources claimed it was a ploy to make his ex 'jealous.'\n'Kanye is trying to make Kim jealous by being very public with Julia,' one source claimed to Entertainment Tonight. \n'He is trying to make a point. Julia thinks Kanye is really cool and is also just enjoying the ride while it lasts.'\nHowever, things imploded between Fox and West just as the rapper began to publicly declare his wish to one day reunite with his estranged wife.\n\nIn 2014 Kim K posed for a raunchy Paper pictorial - which included full-frontal nudity \n\nThe star followed up with 'we beat the Grammies' and a selection of Google Trends posts showing search for Censori demolished searches for 'Grammy winners 2025'\n\n Censori sparked worldwide outrage as she went completely naked at the 2025 Grammys on Sunday, alongside covered-up husband Kanye West \n\nBianca went underwear free in the shocking indecent exposure incident\n\nShe turned around to show off her topless chest and lack of underwear while West - nominated in the Best Rap Song category - looked on\nHe also made threats to Kardashian's new boyfriend Pete Davidson and then sent her roses to her LA home, despite her filing for divorce from West last year.\nMeanwhile, Fox confirmed her split with Ye in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\n Naked Bianca Censori horrifies with indecent exposure on Grammys Awards red carpet with Kanye West \n'Y'all would love if I was soooo upset! The media would love to paint a picture of me a sad lonely woman crying on a plane by myself but it's NOT TRUE!!' Julia told fans in a note on Monday. \nWest and Censori were hit by rumors they were 'escorted out' of the 2025 Grammys Sunday 'by police' after her naked red carpet stunt shocked the world. \nThe designer who has previously shocked with risque displays , bared it all in a completely see-through nude mesh dress, worn without underwear - much to the shock of social media and onlookers.\nBianca exuded confidence as she headed to the carpet clad in a furry coat, before theatrically dropping the garment and flashing her bare derriere to photographers.\nShe turned around to show off her topless chest and lack of underwear while West - nominated in the Best Rap Song category - leered at her nude body during the incident of indecent exposure.\nIt was reported the pair were asked to leave the event after turning up uninvited, and escorted out by cops after their 'crazy stunt.' However another source said they 'left of their own accord' and the exact narrative remains unclear.\nKanye has hit out at outrage to the stunt as he dismissed the ceremony as 'boring' and called Bianca's outfit 'art'.\n'People have called this a stunt but to Ye this is his art,' a source told The Sun. \n'He turned up, made headlines around the world and left. No one told him what to do and even if they had, he wouldn't have listened.\n'Ye always planned to do the red carpet and leave — he'd never sit through the Grammys because it's so dull and boring.'\nWest was seen issuing commands to Censori. A lip reader, Nicola Hickling, says that he told Censori, wearing a black fur coat over a mesh ensemble with no underwear: 'You're making a scene now.' \nShe nodded her head and he told her: 'Make a scene, I'll say it'll make so much sense.' He added: 'Drop it behind you and then turn, I got you.' She then tells him: 'Alright, let's go.'\nThe star paired this with a nude heels and a touch of make-up. In contrast, West, 47, donned a demure black outfit and shades.\nMusic industry insiders were also questioning if his swift exit was down to his feud with Taylor Swift. \nThe stunt is said to have lost Kanye a $20 million deal to play in Japan, according to sources in Tokyo.\nWest had signed up to do two shows at the Tokyo Dome in May, but following the naked stunt on the red carpet of the Grammys on Sunday night with his wife Bianca Censori, his investors have taken fright.\nA source said: 'Kanye is just ****ing up every opportunity that comes to him. The stunt was creepy beyond belief and has been greeted with horror in Japan.'\nHe added: 'Japan is having a cultural awakening about women's rights and the MeToo movement is really strong here. What he did is being seen as an act of coercive control which is utterly unacceptable. He has completely culturally misjudged Japan.'\n\nIn contrast, West, 47, donned a demure black outfit and shades\n\nCensori looked nervous as she prepared to drop her coat \nThis is unfortunate as he has been living in a hotel in Tokyo for most of the last year.\nWest and Censori left the event soon after the red carpet walk, and were pictured getting into a waiting limo.\nA source said: 'The investors in Japan who are backing the concerts are extremely upset by this. It is highly likely that they will pull the funding for the shows.\n'He has greatly misjudged the tolerance of the Japanese people towards these activities. He's just not welcome any more. This will be a big blow for him because he has been living in Japan for around a year now, almost full time, and I guess he did not see this coming.'\nThere have been increasing calls for Kanye and his wife Bianca to be barred from future red carpet events. \nFollowing the incident, many fans expressed their disapproval on social media and called for Kanye — who reportedly lost a $20million deal following the stunt — and his wife to be banned from future events. \nOn Monday, The View's host Alyssa Farah Griffin, 35, shared a similar sentiment, calling the moment a 'low' point, and stating that she didn't want Kanye or his wife on red carpets.\n'I don't even want to dignify this other than to say: Kanye West, I don’t want to see him on red carpets anymore,' she stated.\n'I hope that his partner is OK, because that whole thing was very uncomfortable, I think, for most women, to watch, and I just — I don’t want to see it or hear from it any further.'\nShe was not the only celebrity to publicly express her distaste at the X-rated stunt. \nFormer View co-host Meghan McCain shared in a since-deleted post on X, 'I just want and have wanted for years — for Kanye West to leave us all the hell alone. He’s a repugnant, vile piece of garbage and his wife looks like a victim and a hostage.'\nHer representative later told Entertainment Weekly that McCain deleted the post on 'accident' and that she still thinks West is a 'vile pig.' \nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy also slammed the shocking red carpet moment.\nHe took to X, sharing a photo of Kanye and Bianca from the red carpet, writing in the caption, 'I hate Kayne [sic] so much.'\nFans took to social media to brand the display 'disturbing' and say Censori should be 'kicked out' of the event. \nThey wrote: 'Bianca Censori needs to be saved from that man.

Trump would be the first sitting president to attend the game, according to the New York Post. Punchbowl News first reported the president was expected to head to Caesars Superdome for the game. The Associated Press confirmed the report, citing a White House official. SIGN UP FOR TUBI AND STREAM SUPER BOWL LIX FOR FREE A source familiar with the matter also told Fox News Digital he would be at the game. The president has attended college football games over the last few years. He made his presence felt at the Alabama-Georgia game in September and attended the Army-Navy game after he won the election over Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump didn’t attend many NFL games the first time around as he clashed with players’ decision to kneel for the national anthem as a form of protest against social injustice. He was at the Pittsburgh Steelers’ game against the New York Jets in October after a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. He will have plenty of fans in attendance at the game. Brittany Mahomes and her mother-in-law Randi both supported the president during his re-election campaign. HOW TO WATCH SUPER BOWL LIX BETWEEN CHIEFS, EAGLES STREAMED ON TUBI Before the game kicks off, Trump will speak with Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier. The pre-taped interview took place at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, and will air in the 3 p.m. ET hour on Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl LIX will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET. Pregame coverage can be seen on FOX beginning at 1 p.m. ET. Tubi will also stream coverage on its platform for the first time.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:18:15 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:18:37 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nArmie Hammer’s ex, Elizabeth Chambers, shared grave concern over Kanye West's treatment of his wife, Bianca Censori, at the 2025 Grammy Awards on Sunday.\nIn a fiery statement, uploaded to her Instagram Story on Monday, the TV personality, 42, accused West, 47, of forcing Censori, 30, into participating in a 'humiliation ritual.'\n'The number of messages I've received defending this behavior is abhorrent,' she stressed. 'If this brief interaction looked comfortable, balanced, and consensual to you, that's concerning.'\nChambers went on to say that West encouraging Censori to disrobe into a see-through slip on the red carpet was a case of 'misogyny and control at its finest.' \n'I've spent the past almost two years hosting and producing our show about coercion, control, and toxicity in relationships on @investigationdiscovery and this ticks all the boxes,' she claimed. \nThe mother-of-two also reposted influencer Tinx’s statement on the indecent exposure stunt, which she described as 'uncomfortable to see.'\n\nArmie Hammer’s ex, Elizabeth Chambers, shared grave concern over Kanye West's treatment of his wife, Bianca Censori, at the 2025 Grammy Awards on Sunday' Chambers seen in 2018\nIn Tinx’s post, she wrote: 'I really don’t buy that this was some mutual art experiment. To me, it looked like some sort of humiliation ritual. Of course women have agency, but there’s also an insane power dynamic at play here. Age, money, fame, etc.'\nThe TikTok star, 34, pointed out that West's ex, Julia Fox, detailed the rapper's manipulation tactics 'through fashion and styling' in her 2023 memoir, Down the Drain. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Kanye West's cold reaction to Bianca Censori on red carpet revealed by body language expert \nAdditionally, Chambers shared footage of West allegedly telling Censori to 'drop [her] coat' as she repeatedly shook her head.\nChambers split from Hammer back in 2020 after a decade of marriage, a year before he was accused of sexual and emotional abuse by other previous partners.\nIn 2023, she claimed to Elle that she learned of the allegations against him and his 'bizarre' sexual fantasies 'as the public was.' \nThat same year, the Los Angeles County D.A.'s office declined to charges charges against him due to insufficient evidence. \nChambers has since helped 'empower victims' on her Investigation Discovery, which aims to bring awareness to the 'complexities of toxic and traumatic relationships.' \nFollowing backlash over his red carpet stunt over the weekend, Kanye dismissed the ceremony as 'boring' and called Bianca's outfit 'art.'\n\nIn a fiery statement, uploaded to her Instagram Story on Monday, the TV personality, 42, accused West, 47, of forcing Censori, 30, into participating in a 'humiliation ritual' (seen on Sunday)\n\n'People have called this a stunt but to Ye this is his art,' a source told The Sun.\n'He turned up, made headlines around the world and left. No one told him what to do and even if they had, he wouldn't have listened,' the insider continued. 'Ye always planned to do the red carpet and leave — he'd never sit through the Grammys because it's so dull and boring.' \nDespite speculation that she is being controlled by West, a close friend of the couple, who married in secret in December 2022, furiously slammed the speculation.\nThe source insisted to DailyMail.com that Censori is a ‘willing participant’ who was empowered by her husband to make a statement about ‘simplicity and provocation’.\nThe the exclusive interview, the insider described how West creates the outfits with his Yeezy designers, Censori included, and declared an arrest for indecent exposure would have strengthened the couple’s message.\n‘Bianca is not being forced at all,’ they said. ‘She is a willing participant in this, and she is not controlled by Kanye. They build these looks together, sharing ideas and vision against the establishment of fashion and culture.\n‘Ye is empowering Bianca, and Bianca loves this. They are doing this together, so any suggestion that they are not in on this together is false.’\n\n'The number of messages I've received defending this behavior is abhorrent,' she stressed. 'If this brief interaction looked comfortable, balanced, and consensual to you, that's concerning'\n\nThe mother-of-two shared also reposted influencer Tinx’s statement on the indecent exposure stunt, which she described as uncomfortable to see'\nNotably, West and Censori have a 17-year age gap.\nThe stunt is said to have lost Kanye a $20 million deal to play in Japan, according to sources in Tokyo.\nWest had signed up to do two shows at the Tokyo Dome in May, but following the naked stunt on the red carpet with his wife, his investors have taken fright. \nA source said: 'Kanye is just ****ing up every opportunity that comes to him. The stunt was creepy beyond belief and has been greeted with horror in Japan.'\nHe added: 'Japan is having a cultural awakening about women's rights and the MeToo movement is really strong here. What he did is being seen as an act of coercive control which is utterly unacceptable. He has completely culturally misjudged Japan.'\nThis is unfortunate as he has been living in a hotel in Tokyo for most of the last year.\nOn Monday, The View's host Alyssa Farah Griffin, 35, shared a similar sentiment, calling the moment a 'low' point, and stating that she didn't want Kanye or his wife on red carpets.\n\nDespite speculation that she is being controlled by West, a close friend of the couple, who married in secret in December 2022, insisted to DailyMail.com that Censori is a ‘willing participant’ \n'I don't even want to dignify this other than to say: Kanye West, I don’t want to see him on red carpets anymore,' she stated.\n'I hope that his partner is OK, because that whole thing was very uncomfortable, I think, for most women, to watch, and I just — I don’t want to see it or hear from it any further.'\nShe was not the only celebrity to publicly express her distaste at the X-rated stunt.\nFormer View co-host Meghan McCain shared in a since-deleted post on X, 'I just want and have wanted for years — for Kanye West to leave us all the hell alone. He’s a repugnant, vile piece of garbage and his wife looks like a victim and a hostage.'\nHer representative later told Entertainment Weekly that McCain deleted the post on 'accident' and that she still thinks West is a 'vile pig.'\nJapanKanye WestArmie HammerBianca Censori\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nArmie Hammer's ex-wife slams Kanye West over Bianca Censori 'humiliation ritual' at Grammys 2025\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nHolly Willoughby wows in a black dress as she joins Lottie Moss, Una Healy and Mel B at the premiere of new Netflix series Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nEXCLUSIVELip reader reveals Kanye West's brusque command to staff moments before Bianca Censori stripped off in shocking Grammys stunt\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy has THREE outfit changes as she wraps up warm in New York City in an eccentric off-white fluffy coat before swapping into chic co-ords\n\nSomething for everyone!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:18:01 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:18:34 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen has revealed that he thought he was 'having a heart attack' during a terrifying raft exercise while filming brutal Celebrity Bear Hunt. \nThe interior designer and television personality, 59, - best known for appearing on the BBC programme Changing Rooms - is one of the 12 stars taking part in the new survival show with Bear Grylls.\nHe filmed the show - which comes out on Netflix on Wednesday - last year in the Costa Rican jungle but in a new interview on Tuesday described one of the more challenging tasks he took on.\nHe said he almost got caught up in a 'drowning thing' and was 'blacking out' while in the water after having to swim to a raft. \nMailOnline revealed last week Laurence nearly died during the freak raft accident. Sources said that he became entangled in a bungee rope and got stuck underneath the boat. \nHe was dragged underwater for several heart-stopping minutes before being pulled to safety by members of the team supervising the stunt, and lost consciousness.\n\nLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen has revealed that he thought he was 'having a heart attack' during a terrifying raft exercise while filming brutal Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nThe interior designer and television personality, 59, - best known for appearing on the BBC programme Changing Rooms - is one of the 12 stars taking part in the new survival show with Bear Grylls \nSpeaking to Jane Mulkerrins on Times Radio on Tuesday he said of the experience: 'In my head, I was some kind of Marvel superhero. Actually, by the time I got to the raft that I was supposed to swim to, it dawned on me quite quickly, I'm actually Granddaddy Pig and getting onto the raft was never going to happen. \n'I got stuck under the raft. I got tangled up in some equipment and stuff and that's when the drowning thing kind of happened. \n'But I managed to free myself. I should have stopped at that point and just sort of gathered myself but actually, no, I was then throwing myself into the challenge and then I started blacking out and suddenly, I've got Bear on top of me.\n'I didn't actually have to be resuscitated. Bear was puckering up, he was bearing down on me like a wet bag of spanners, more than happy to resuscitate me, but actually, I came to, at that point.\n'It wasn't a pleasant experience at all. I mean, it really, really wasn't. I was blacking out. I thought I was having a heart attack. \n'And having then been pumped full of, I think it's about three canisters of oxygen, which is wonderful stuff by the way...but it was a very solitary thing.\n'I always felt that I was quite physically resilient. I have regular medicals. I'm perceived as being reasonably fit for what I am but it did feel slightly like a moment of failure.'\nIt comes after Laurence said he felt like he was going through an 'end of life crisis' after signing up to the show.\n\nHe filmed the show - which comes out on Netflix on Wednesday - last year in the Costa Rican jungle but in a new interview on Tuesday described one of the more challenging tasks he took on\n\nHe said he almost got caught up in a 'drowning thing' and was 'blacking out' while in the water after having to swim to a raft\n\nMailOnline revealed last week Laurence nearly died during the freak raft accident. Sources said that he became entangled in a bungee rope and got stuck underneath the boat\n\nHe was dragged underwater for several heart-stopping minutes before being pulled to safety by members of the team supervising the stunt, and lost consciousness\n\nHe said on Tuesday while on the radio: 'I got stuck under the raft. I got tangled up in some equipment and stuff and that's when the drowning thing kind of happened'\nHe joked his wife Jackie said he was in a 'mid-life crisis' when he told her he was appearing in the Netflix show.\nLaurence said: 'Jackie's extremely amused. She feels it's got midlife crisis written all over it, although, as I keep telling her, I'm too old to have a midlife crisis, this is more like an end of life crisis. \n'She's actually, frankly, incredibly jealous. She would love to do it and has always been mildly irritated that no one's ever asked her to do something like this. \n'Because she literally has always had in her handbag, a SAS Survival Guide, to get herself out of all sorts. I meant to bring it actually and again, how foolishly, I completely forgot.'\nLaurence has joined a star-studded lineup including Boris Becker, Shirley Ballas and Una Healy on the new Netflix series, which sees stars dropped into the jungle in Costa Rica as prey for one of the world's most fearsome predators – Bear Grylls.\nAs part of the show, stars learn crucial survival skills while camping in the Costa Rican jungle, desperate to avoid being caught by Bear. \n\n Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, 59, says he's going through an 'end of life crisis' amid Celebrity Bear Hunt cameo - after 'nearly dying' from freak accident during filming \nMailOnline revealed last week Laurence nearly died during the filming of the Netflix show Bear Hunt after the freak raft accident.\nDuring filming in Costa Rica in May last year, Laurence was among celebrities taking part in a water challenge and was told to leap from a boat into the river.\nSources said that he became entangled in a bungee rope and got stuck underneath the boat. \nHe was dragged underwater for several heart-stopping minutes before being pulled to safety by members of the team supervising the stunt, and lost consciousness.\nLaurence, was then resuscitated on the shore by survival expert and former Chief Scout Bear Grylls, who is 'hunting' the celebrities in the show.\n\nL-R: Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, Lottie Moss, Danny Cipriani, Leomie Anderson, Boris Becker, Una Healy, Kola Bokinni, Joe Thomas, Big Zuu, Mel B, Steph McGovern and Shirley Ballas\nA source told MailOnline: 'Laurence was very shaken as was everyone. He said that he thought he was a goner.\n'It was a very serious situation and at the time we thought that maybe Netflix wouldn't show what happened because it was that bad, but now it looks as if it will be in the programme.\n'Netflix were very very apologetic about it afterwards.'\nThe show, which is presented by Holly Willoughby and is streaming from February 5.\n\nCelebrity Bear Hunt: Meet The Cast!\n\nProfession: Spice Girl, TV presenter and X Factor judge \nLEOMIE ANDERSON\n\nProfession: Model, Victoria's Secret star and TV presenter for BBC Three's Glow Up: \nKOLA BOKINNI\n\nProfession: Actor and Ted Lasso star \n\nProfession: Singer and former member of The Saturdays\nLOTTIE MOSS\n\nProfession: Model and influencer\nSTEPH MCGOVERN\n\nProfession: TV presenter and journalist \n\nSHIRLEY BALLAS\n\nProfession: Former dancer and Strictly Come Dancing's head judge\nBORIS BECKER\n\nProfession: Former tennis star and Wimbledon champion \nLAURENCE LLEWELYN-BOWEN\n\nProfession: Interior design expert and Changing Rooms star\n\nProfession: Rapper and TV chef \nDANNY CIPRIANI\n\nProfession: Retired rugby player\n\nProfession: Actor and Inbetweeners star \n\nBear GryllsBBCNetflix\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen reveals he thought he was 'having a heart attack' and 'blacked out' during terrifying raft exercise on Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nHolly Willoughby wows in a black dress as she joins Lottie Moss, Una Healy and Mel B at the premiere of new Netflix series Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nEXCLUSIVELip reader reveals Kanye West's brusque command to staff moments before Bianca Censori stripped off in shocking Grammys stunt\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy has THREE outfit changes as she wraps up warm in New York City in an eccentric off-white fluffy coat before swapping into chic co-ords\n\nSomething for everyone!

Find that hope in all of the allies that love you. And together, know that we are unstoppable.\"\n\n McBride made history in the 2024 elections when she was elected to Delaware's only seat in the House of Representatives. Four years earlier, she became the nation's first openly transgender state senator.\n\n Since then, she's been a strong advocate for young queer people in the United States, and has been vocal against conservatives' escalating attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n During the 2024 election, as Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign grew more serious about national issues and began catching up in the polls, Trump spent a stunningly large portion of his campaign dollars on ads that demonized the trans community, stoking fears among Americans to boost his support.\n\n One popular Trump ad — which accused Harris of promoting taxpayer-funded sex changes for transgender inmates and allowing \"men\" to play in girls' sports — ended on the phrase, \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\n Trump's divisive rhetoric helped send him back to the White House, where McBride claims his administration is continuing to use transgender people \"as pawns to advance their agenda of gutting the federal government.\"\n\n McBride tells PEOPLE that despite ongoing anti-LGBTQ+ attacks, she remains ready to defend her \"beautiful yet vulnerable community.\"\n\n \"We're not going to let that stand,\" she says. \"We're going to show the American people the strategy at play here ... and also highlight the very real harm — not just against trans people, not just against the LGBTQ community, but against people across this country who'll be negatively impacted by these anti-equality policies.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n In the meantime, McBride hopes that anyone who feels othered refrains from believing that they are not enough.\n\n \"I know this is a scary moment.

Both are battle-tested \"fighters\" who've stepped into the ring – whether in politics or boxing – to fight their way to the top. But, for Tyson, calling Trump a \"fighter\" is an understatement. As the 58-year-old boxing legend sat down for an exclusive interview with Sean Hannity for Fox Nation's \"Sean\" podcast series, he discussed his friendship with Trump and the obstacles the president has faced in manifesting his historic political comeback. \"I always tell people, if you didn't know who Trump was, and you heard about that person with all those cases, all that crime [accusations], all of those indictments, you'd think he was Black… that's what a lot of Black people see. That's what would happen to them,\" Tyson said. MIKE TYSON REVEALS HE SUFFERED NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE TRAINING FOR JAKE PAUL FIGHT: ‘LOST HALF MY BLOOD’ \"Iron Mike\" and Trump go way back. Tyson fought at Trump Plaza back in the day, with the future president standing ringside. Back then, Trump was a spectator, witnessing some of Tyson's best fights firsthand. Years later, in a national arena, Trump would face his own fight full of legal battles and two attempts on his life. Despite it all, he survived and went on to face then-Vice President Kamala Harris in a contentious election, where he won the top title. \"Most people would have given up. He didn't give up,\" Tyson said. JAKE PAUL PUTS MIKE TYSON ON HIS SHOULDERS DURING INAUGURAL BALL \"[He's] tough, but everything seemed to align with him. Everything lined up with him.\" Tyson and Hannity's conversation went beyond politics, however, with the boxing legend sharing details about his high-profile fight with Jake Paul late last year. Paul defeated the former heavyweight champion by unanimous decision in November, but he wasn't sure if it would be his final fight.

In a new interview with The New Yorker, Gates revealed that he met with Trump shortly after he won the election. \n\n“Well, President Trump was elected, and he is going to make a lot of policy decisions, and I would say the range of possibilities in many areas has never been as broad. I sought out President Trump and right after Christmas went down to Mar-a-Lago and actually had a really good, very long dinner with him,” Gates said in the interview. \n\nThe New Yorker’s David Remnick pressed Gates on what he discussed with Trump, noting that a number of other billionaires quickly flew to Mar-a-Lago to appease the newly elected president.\n\nGates explained that they talked about a number of issues, especially vaccines and how the COVID-19 vaccine could help develop a cure for HIV. \n\n“Well, we talked about the world broadly, but my first request was on H.I.V., where there’s a question of whether the U.S. maintains the pepfar program that’s over twenty years standing, that keeps over ten million people alive with H.I.V. medicines. I explained to him why we should maintain that, and that I think we can innovate to eventually cure H.I.V. and the need for that, but that that’ll take some time to do, and encouraged him to look at the kind of things he’d done with Operation Warp Speed,\" Gates said.\n\nHe also said that he will try to work with the Trump administration and offered praise for the president. \n\n“My foundation has the U.S. government—both for research and delivery in health—as a key partner, and I will do my best to work with this Administration. I got his ear for three hours. He couldn’t have been nicer. Doesn’t mean that other people won’t come in and say the H.I.V. money should be cut, but I did my best,\" he said.\n\nA number of billionaires, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla owner Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, flocked to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump after the election. Musk has emerged as Trump’s top adviser and has been tapped to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to slash government spending. \n\nBut many Democrats have sounded the alarm on the billionaires' influence in Washington. In the final days of his administration, former President Joe Biden warned that the U.S. was sliding into an “oligarchy” of tech billionaires. \n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAM LAWLEY and JULIE ANN TRAINOR \n Published:17:40 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:18:02 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nPetra Ecclestone has revealed she wants to adopt children 'in the near future' but will avoid raising them in the United States as it is not 'a safe environment for the kids'.\nThe British model, 36, has three children with her ex-husband James Stunt - two twin boys, nine, and a daughter, 11 - as well as a girl, four, with new partner, businessman Sam Palmer.\nThe daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone, Petra engaged in some fashion designing before marrying James in 2011 and splitting six years later.\nShe gave birth to second daughter Minnie in 2020 before tying the knot with Sam in 2022.\nNow the socialite has revealed she is planning to add to her clan but will be adopting on this occasion.\nShe told MailOnline: 'For now, no, [I'm not having more children] but I would like to adopt in the near future. That's something we're thinking about.\n\nPetra Ecclestone has revealed she wants to adopt children 'in the near future' but that she will avoid raising them in the US as it is not 'a safe environment for the kids'\n\nThe British model, 36, has a girl, four, with new partner Sam Palmer (pictured, left) as well as three children with her ex-husband James Stunt - two twin boys, nine, and a daughter, 11\n'[They will be] from wherever we are living. I think there is enough children in the UK or America who need homes.'\nPetra added that she was determined not to raise them in the US, as she lifted the lid on her desire to move away from the country due to its crime levels.\n'We're thinking about it. I do love London, but we won't move back here for personal reasons. \n'We are considering maybe the Middle East. The crime in America is awful, and we want a safe environment for the kids. \n'It's the gun crime and the shootings. We ice-skated with our kids just before Christmas, and a homeless person dropped dead next to us. And seeing people smoke crack is not an environment we want to be in.'\nAll this drove Petra to support Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Election despite backlash, and she even shared a clip of herself wearing a MAGA cap ahead of the election.\nShe said: 'Yes, I'm a huge Trump fan. I did [get abuse for supporting him], and that's the trouble with LA – they are kind of mostly anti-Trump.\n'I never have [met him]. I just really like his way – I think he's very honest. I think he's a great politician and a good businessman, and we need someone like him in America to turn it all around, because it's deteriorating so drastically. \n\nPetra added that she was determined not to raise any new children in the US, as she lifted the lid on her desire to move away from the country due to its crime levels \n\nAll the problems she has wife America drove Petra to support Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Election despite backlash \n'At the moment, the place is full of homeless, and inflation is insane, so I really feel like he could make a huge difference.'\nPetra also gave an update on the situation near her home in LA, after revealing that it had narrowly escaped the blazes which tore across the city.\nShe said: 'Things are really bad at the minute. We got evacuated, and that's why we're here [London] now. They only allowed us into our home five days ago.

'Because it was a relatively quick turnaround, suddenly I was on these big sets and then doing photoshoots and events and interviews. \n'The filming, I'm getting more comfortable with and it's becoming my safe haven.' \nIt comes after he revealed that objectification in his roles left him feeling 'vulnerable and exposed'.\n\nBridget Jones star Leo Woodall has revealed that being 'catapulted' to fame was 'terrifying' after his starring role in the new flick\n\nThe actor's latest role sees him play Bridget Jones' toy boy Roxster in the upcoming installment (pictured as Rockstar in Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy)\nIn terms of his rise to fame, he said: 'I don't like using the word \"catapulted\" but in terms of my career, it did have that effect.'\nHaving played the roles of love interests in most of his projects, Leo was asked if he ever feels objectified.\n'Yeah, it's a mixed bag,' he said. 'In some ways it's part of the gig. But also, there are sides of it that can make you feel quite vulnerable and exposed. That side isn't as fun. \n'When you're playing a role described like that, you can't help but look at yourself and go, \"Am I that guy?\" There's sometimes pressure in making people buy that.'\nThe actor, who is one of the faces of this years Red Nose Day alongside Claudia Winkleman and Olivia Atwood, said he thinks it's important to work on films involving a younger man and an older female lover.\n'It's a dynamic that has always existed in the real world' he said.\n'And for reasons I'm not sure of, it's now being portrayed on screen. That's important, because that's what film-making is best at: portraying all walks of life.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Times recently ahead of the release of Bridget Jones Mad About The Boy, Leo opened up about how quickly he shot to fame\n\n'It's terrifying in a lot of ways,' he said. 'Because it was a relatively quick turnaround, suddenly I was on these big sets and then doing photoshoots and events and interviews' \n\n'I didn't go into it thinking I wanted to explore that. I thought the script was beautiful and wanted to be a part of it. I've always loved the films.\n'There's only so many chances you'll get to be a part of something as special as Bridget Jones.'\nLeo recently revealed that his role in Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy was set to be drastically different. \nIn the fourth movie in the romantic comedy saga, Londoner Leo plays Hampstead Heath park worker Roxster, who meets the clumsy and lovelorn TV worker (Renee Zellweger) after rescuing her from a tree. \nThe film is set to shine a light on age gap romances, navigating how 51-year-old Bridget handles dating 29-year-old Roxster, and a love triangle with Mr. Wallaker - played by Chiwetel Ejiofor - a teacher at Bridget's son's school. \n\nIn terms of his rise to fame, he said: 'I don't like using the word \"catapulted\" but in terms of my career, it did have that effect'\nLeo approached the role very differently to how it was filmed, however, revealing his character was initially meant to be Scottish. \nJoining Renee, 55, on The Graham Norton Show, which aired on Friday night, Leo explained: 'He was supposed to be Scottish. I went into the audition prepared to do it in a Scottish accent and once I did it, they changed their minds!' \nLeo, also known for Netflix's One Day and HBO hit series The White Lotus, said he did not really get to know Hugh Grant during the filming of the movie but they have since mingled at the premieres and press events. \nHe said: 'I didn't get to work with Hugh, and I was too shy to say hello to him. Everyone keep asking me, \"What he's like?\" and I have to say, \"I don't know, I haven't met him\".'\nLeo Woodall\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBridget Jones's Leo Woodall reveals being 'catapulted' to fame was 'terrifying' after he admitted objectification in his roles left him feeling 'vulnerable and exposed'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nHolly Willoughby wows in a black dress as she joins Lottie Moss, Una Healy and Mel B at the premiere of new Netflix series Celebrity Bear Hunt\n\nEXCLUSIVELip reader reveals Kanye West's brusque command to staff moments before Bianca Censori stripped off in shocking Grammys stunt\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy has THREE outfit changes as she wraps up warm in New York City in an eccentric off-white fluffy coat before swapping into chic co-ords\n\nSomething for everyone!

Trump beat Democrat candidate and VP Kamala Harris in the United States general election in November 2024. Trump since his January 20 inauguration has been hotly threatening 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico due to weak border security. .UPDATED: Trump gives Canada a 30-day pause on 25% tariff threat.Twice now Trump has relented at the 11th hour and given temporary reprieve from the impending tariffs. Initially, they were to be imposed on inauguration day, and then they were delayed to February 1.The tariffs have now been postponed to March 1, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a litany of measures to secure the border, including appointing a “Fentanyl Czar” — fentanyl being a dangerous, illegal drug Trump accused Canada of allowing to be trafficked, resulting in it “flooding” into the US.Ford last week called a snap election, nearly a year and a half earlier than the next scheduled vote. He had earlier expressed confidence he will win an even stronger mandate than he did in the 2022 election — all with the focus of “fighting” Trump’s then-imminent tariffs..Ford to approach lieutenant-governor Tuesday to kickstart Ontario election.The Ontario election, scheduled for February 27, has turned into a rat race on who can come up with the best solution for combatting —- not working with — Trump’s administration and the still very real possibility of 25% tariffs.Now it has been revealed on video that Ford has been pulling for Trump’s presidency all along. He was caught on a hot mic (an active microphone) at his Etobicoke campaign office Monday evening stating his support for Trump — and lamenting the way the tables turned abruptly with the tariff situation.“On election day, was I happy this guy won? 100% I was,” said Ford on the hot mic.“Then the guy pulled out the knife and f***ing yanked it in me.”.Ontario party leaders launch campaigns as the province gears up for early election.Ford reportedly made the candid remarks in front of Tory candidates Christine Hogarth and David Piccini, as well as several members of the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association, a group that endorsed Ford and the PCs in the upcoming election.Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie capitalized on Ford’s admission and released an anti-PC campaign video..New Democratic Leader Marit Stiles commented on Ford’s remarks in a post to social media Tuesday.“Doug Ford keeps making the case for why he's not the guy for this job. He says one thing to you and another thing behind closed doors,” wrote Stiles.“We can't trust Ford to get the job done and we certainly can't trust him to defend Ontario.

The restaurant's two-egg breakfast, which comes with toast and a side, was listed at $7.75 on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe company said the change was a “temporary targeted surcharge tied to the unprecedented rise in egg prices.”\n\n“While we hope these price fluctuations will be short-lived, we cannot predict how long this shortage will last,” Waffle House said. “We are continuously monitoring egg prices and will adjust or remove the surcharge as market conditions allow.”\n\nThe average price per dozen eggs nationwide hit $4.15 in December. That’s not quite as high as the $4.82 record set two years ago, but the Agriculture Department predicts egg prices are going to soar another 20% this year.\n\nThe price of eggs became a political football during the presidential campaign last year, with now-President Donald Trump claiming that eggs were $5 under then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nBringing down prices was a key election pledge for Trump. However, in an interview with Time magazine in December, he admitted it wouldn’t be an easy task.\n\nWaffle House has 2000 locations in 25 states, with the majority in the South and Midwest. The restaurant serves 272 million eggs per year, making it the most-ordered item, according to CNN. \n\nMore than half the eggs consumed in their restaurants come from one supplier: Rose Acre Farms.\n\nHowever, last month the Indiana-based supplier said one of its farms had tested positive for the avian flu virus and workers had started to notice deaths. The American Farm Bureau reports roughly 75 million birds have been killed since January 2022, impacting approximately eight percent of the country’s supply. \n\nA US Department of Agriculture Egg Market Review report published last week found grocers nationwide are trying to discourage shoppers from buying eggs by limiting or ending promotional activity, placing limits on units allowed per shopping trip and holding prices at record or near-record highs. But the tactics are doing little to slow demand, the agency said. \n\nBird flu has resulted in the depopulation of 13.2m birds in December and as of last week, 16 outbreaks across seven states including Arizona, California, North Carolina, Ohio, Montana, Indiana and Washington, have resulted in the loss of an additional 14 million birds.\n\nLast month the first U.S. human fatality linked to the disease was reported in Louisiana. There have been 67 confirmed bird flu infections of humans in the U.S. since 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP.","summary":"Millions of egg-laying birds have been culled due to recent avian flu outbreaks","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/waffle-house-egg-shortage-b2692049.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/04/14/Waffle_House_Eggs_30103.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-04 17:32:57","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":287074882,"title":"Ella Emhoff’s Armpit Hair Is the MAGAverse’s Strange New Obsession","text":"Skip to Main Content\n\nNewsletters\n\nCSCHEAT SHEET\nNEWSLETTERS\n\nCheat Sheet\n\nManage Newsletters\nSubscription Offers\n\nElla Emhoff’s Armpit Hair Is the MAGAverse’s Strange New Obsession\n\nPITS OF DESPAIR\n\nRight-wing accounts on Elon Musk’s X are attacking Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter again, this time for having body hair. \n\nLeigh Kimmins \n\nUpdated Feb. 4 2025 12:28PM EST / Published Feb. 4 2025 12:26PM EST \n\nAngela Weiss/Getty \n\nLeigh Kimmins\n\nGot a tip?

Beattie wrote on X in October 2024 that “competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work” but that the nation’s ideology is currently “predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities.”\n\nCompetent white men must be in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.— Darren J. Beattie 🌐 (@DarrenJBeattie) October 4, 2024\n\nIn response, the congresswoman said Beattie “needs to go” and that “the coddling is for the white boys.”\n\n“Listen, if you are competent, you are not concerned,” Crockett said on CNN’s Laura Coates Live. “When I walk into Congress every single day, you know why I don‘t feel a way and why you can‘t make me doubt who I am. It’s because I know that I had to work 10 times as hard as they did just to get into the seat. When you look, and you compare me to Marjorie Taylor Greene or me to Lauren Boebert, there is no comparison. And that is the life that we have always lived. So the only people that are crying are the mediocre white boys that have been beaten out by people that historically have had to work so much harder.”\n\nCrockett went on to claim that this mentality is why the Trump administration is “trying to literally say ‘we won’t fund the HBCUs,’” referring to historically black colleges and universities. She added that this is due to the administration not wanting “any more Kamala Harris’s” or any lawmakers like herself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Texas Congresswoman’s accusations against the Trump administration come shortly after she claimed “a thug” is currently serving as the nation’s president.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy SEAN O'GRADY \n Published:16:47 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:16:58 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nKatherine Ryan has revealed a therapist told her she keeps talking over her husband. \nThe comedian has been in a civil partnership with Bobby Kootstra since 2019 and the couple have children Fred, three, and Fenna, two, together.\nThe pair recently went to see a marriage coach and Katherine was surprised to learn she frequently speaks over Bobby.\nSpeaking to The Mirror, she said: 'At first I thought, 'That's nonsense, he just doesn't speak that much. 'But it's true… I was interrupting him.'\nThe couple, who are both from Canada, first dated as teenagers but then reconnected several years later and got married.\nKatherine said: 'You have to say 'coaching' or boys get scared. I never saw myself as someone who'd get married. \n\nKatherine Ryan has revealed a therapist told her she keeps talking over her husband Bobby Kootstra\n\nThe pair recently went to see a marriage coach and Katherine was surprised to learn she frequently speaks over Bobby (pictured in 2024) \n'It wasn't an aspiration of mine for a lot of my life, and all of a sudden I reconnected with Bobby and we got married straight away.'\nBobby moved from Canada to the UK to be with Katherine and he has become stepfather to her daughter Violet, 16, who she had from a previous relationship. \nThe couple opened the doors to their private life in the second series of At Home With Katherine which also sees them visit an intimacy coach.\nThe comedian said she and Bobby have sex around five times a month and have to 'get creative' about it since they have three children in the house. \nKatherine and Bobby would like to have another child but she believes it could be difficult as they are both 41.\nIt comes after Katherine previously claimed she won't take part in Strictly Come Dancing because she's not ready to cheat on her husband.\nThe BBC show has long been known for the 'curse' that befalls some contestants who end up dating their dance partner, despite some being already in relationships.\n\nShe said: 'At first I thought, 'That's nonsense, he just doesn't speak that much. 'But it's true… I was interrupting him' (pictured in 2023) \n\nThe couple are parents to Fred, three, and Fenna, two, while Bobby is stepfather to Katherine's daughter Violet, 16\n\nAnd in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the comedian noted that she would decline the dance show because she's not ready to be unfaithful to Bobby - before quipping that it doesn't mean she wouldn't change her mind in the future.\nShe divulged: 'I would, but I don't think I'm a good enough dancer, and I'm not ready to cheat on my husband, but down the road.'\nKatherine added of the dreaded Strictly curse: 'I would be excited. I would be welcoming the curse.'\nKatherine RyanCanada\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKatherine Ryan reveals a therapist told her she keeps talking over her husband Bobby Koostra as comedian admits she never thought she'd marry\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nCelebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins star SPLITS from fiancée and deletes all traces of her from social media\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nRichard Osman reveals he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering 'unbelievable pain'\n\nRuth Langsford's eye-watering finances are revealed as star rakes in six-figure sum after shock split from Eamonn Holmes last year\n\nSomething for everyone!

Ariana Grande and Brad Pitt","text":"Former president Joe Biden has signed up with Hollywood’s Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which boasts A-list stars as Ariana Grande and Brad Pitt on its books, just two weeks after leaving the White House.\n\n“President Biden is one of America’s most respected and influential voices in national and global affairs,” CAA co-chairman Richard Lovett said in announcing his company’s newest client. \n\n“His lifelong commitment to public service is one of unity, optimism, dignity, and possibility. \n\n“We are profoundly honored to partner with him again.”\n\nBiden, now 82, previously worked with CAA between 2017 and 2020, the period between the conclusion of his role as Barack Obama’s vice president and his victory over Donald Trump in the latter year’s presidential race. \n\nDuring that first stint, the agency supported the Democrat in the publication of his memoir Promise Me, Dad (2017), a New York Times bestseller recounting the loss of his son Beau Biden to cancer and his subsequent response to the tragedy, which in turn inspired the 42-date American Promise book tour that is believed to have inspired his eventual run for the presidency against Trump.\n\n The Los Angeles agency also helped Biden to pick up a string of lucrative public speaking engagements, an avenue he could well explore once again.\n\nThe 46th president, who recently became a great-grandfather for the first time, has yet to spell out precisely how he plans to spend his post-presidency but did tell his supporters during his farewell speech last month that he and his wife Jill Biden would be “leaving office, but we’re not leaving the fight”.\n\nCAA also has a relationship with the Obamas through their production company Higher Ground, which produced the Oscar-winning documentary American Factory (2019), and with Hillary Clinton, overseeing the release of her book Hard Choices (2014) among others.\n\nThe company has further ties with Democrats like Joe Manchin, Susan Rice and Beto O’Rourke, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBiden, who declined to contest last year’s election in favour of allowing his deputy Kamala Harris to run against Trump, left the Oval Office warning of the fragility of democracy and the growing influence of Big Tech over politics.\n\n“Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,” he commented in his final address from the White House on January 15.\n\nHe also warned that a “crumbling” free press and social media companies giving up on fact-checking the content they host threatens to let loose an “avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power”.","summary":"Former president reunites with CAA after pledging he was ‘leaving office, not the

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy JUSTIN ENRIQUEZ and BRIAN GALLAGHER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:16:40 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:16:46 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nKelsey Grammer has finally revealed why he and Cheers co-star Ted Danson had a 30 year feud just months after they started the healing process on a podcast.\nGrammer, 69, appeared on Danson's, 77, podcast Everybody Knows Your Name, which he co-hosts with Woody Harrelson, back in October where they talked over their issues.\nDanson had not divulged specifics on what started the argument between them but did apologize to Grammer on the podcast and now the latter has finally revealed what started the rift.\nGrammer recently told the New York Post: 'It got a little blown out of proportion. There really wasn’t an argument. \n'It was at a time in my life when I was actually going through a lot of self-doubt, self-loathing, honestly.'\nThe star got candid about the issues he was dealing at the time which seemed at the center of why the two sitcom stars weren't seeing eye to eye.\n\nKelsey Grammer (pictured in August) has finally revealed why he and Cheers co-star Ted Danson had a 30 year feud just months after they started the healing process on a podcast \n\nGrammer, 69, appeared on Danson's (pictured), 77, podcast Everybody Knows Your Name , which he co-hosts with Woody Harrelson , back in October where they talked over their issues\nGrammer explained: 'It was when I was drinking a lot. Ted had just come up and said, \"You know, I’m kind of mad at you that sometimes you don’t show up ready to go.\" And I said, \"Okay, I respect that.\" And that actually was sort of it.'\n'Now maybe what happened for Ted was, he stepped away from what might have been a better friendship ... maybe he had to protect himself. I've always thought if him — it's the most loving kind of remembrance and fondness. Same with Woody. Woods and I have actually stayed in touch a bit more than Ted and I have. That's still an active sort of friendship — we were emailing just last week. We're still around.' \n\n Ted Danson apologizes to Kelsey Grammer for missing 30 years of friendship after Cheers \nThe two had previously talked about their 30 year feud on the podcast which was released on October 2024. \n'This isn't self-deprecating, but I wish — I feel like I got stuck a little bit with you during the Cheers years. I have a memory of getting angry at you once,' Danson said.\n'Yeah, you came and told me that one day,' Grammer replied, as Danson added, 'And it's stuck in both of our memories.'\n'But I feel like, f**k, I don't know. I missed out on the last 30 years of Kelsey Grammer, and I feel like it's my bad, my doing,' Danson added.\n'I almost feel like apologizing to you... no I don't feel like, I apologize to you and me that I sat back, you know, and didn't. I really do apologize,' he said.\nGrammer thanked him for that and said, 'I truly wish we'd spent some more time together,' before sharing an anecdote Danson told him that has always, 'quoted to other people.'\n\nGrammer (pictured in September) recently told the New York Post : 'It got a little blown out of proportion. There really wasn’t an argument. 'It was at a time in my life when I was actually going through a lot of self-doubt, self-loathing, honestly'\n\nThe two had previously talked about their 30 year feud on the podcast which was released on October 2024 \n\n'When I turned 40, you came up and said, \"You know what it means, don't you? Now that you're 40, it means you're finally worth having a conversation with,\"' Grammer said with a laugh.\n'I thought that was f***ing brilliant. I always loved that. And I thought about it, and I've repeated it. My love for you has always been as easy as the day. You know, as easy as the sunrise,' as Danson replied, 'Mine too.'\nDanson was one of the original cast members of Cheers, playing former Boston Red Sox pitcher Sam Malone, who opened the title bar in Beantown.\nGrammer didn't debut until the third season as psychiatrist Frasier Crane, initially only slated to appear in six episodes, but became a series regular who was a presence through the show's 11th and final season in 1993.\n\n'Yeah, you came and told me that one day,' Grammer replied, as Danson added, 'And it's stuck in both of our memories'\n\n'But I feel like, f**k, I don't know. I missed out on the last 30 years of Kelsey Grammer, and I feel like it's my bad, my doing,' Danson added\n\n'I almost feel like apologizing to you... no I don't feel like, I apologize to you and me that I sat back, you know, and didn't.

I mean, he’s done, you know, he does four shows in the last bunch and it’s been great working with him,' Grammer added of the iconic 83-year-old TV director.\nThey also recently reunited during one of many TV reunion segments during the Emmy Awards. \nWoody HarrelsonKelsey Grammer\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKelsey Grammer reveals why he really was in a 30 year feud with Cheers co-star Ted Danson\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nCelebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins star SPLITS from fiancée and deletes all traces of her from social media\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nRichard Osman reveals he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering 'unbelievable pain'\n\nRuth Langsford's eye-watering finances are revealed as star rakes in six-figure sum after shock split from Eamonn Holmes last year\n\nSomething for everyone!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MILLY VEITCH FOR MAILONLINE and MADISON BURGESS \n Published:14:16 GMT, 4 February 2025 |Updated:16:33 GMT, 4 February 2025 \n\nKanye West has hinted that Bianca Censori's viral 'invisible dress' could go up for sale, as he attempts to pull off what is arguably his most genius but controversial marketing move yet.\nThe rapper, 47, and his wife, 30, sparked worldwide outrage on Sunday night, when the Australian designer appeared in a completely see-through dress, leaving her entirely nude body on full display.\nSince then, Kanye has been cryptically communicating with his followers by frantically sharing and deleting a series of posts on social media.\nNow, we could be seeing the dress that everyone has been talking about on the streets as he seems to be gearing up to make it available for the world to buy.\nIn his most recent grid post, he shared what looks like a product picture of the controversial piece of clothing against a plain white background.\nHe penned: 'Crafted from a one-way stretch see through nylon with two darts and held together by a slightly darker nude colored 2-millimeter baby lock stitch. It took five toiles and multiple fittings to perfect the shape.'\n\nKanye West has hinted that Bianca Censori's viral 'invisible dress' could go up for sale, in a new post on his Instagram account\n\nThe rapper, 47, and his wife, 30, sparked worldwide outrage on Sunday night, when the Australian designer appeared in a completely see-through dress, leaving her entirely nude body on full display \n\nHowever, he quickly deleted the description and simply changed it to: 'THE INVISIBLE DRESS'. \nKanye is already making money out of his shock Grammys stunt, as he announced earlier today he is launching his first womenswear collection with his wife's sheer bodysuit as the hero product. \nHe shared a new image of Bianca modeling the look from his Yeezy women's line on Instagram.\nThe black bodysuit is the same design that Bianca wore to a Grammys after party on Sunday, hours after her naked stunt on the Los Angeles red carpet.\nKanye captioned the snap 'First women’s piece @yeezy.com,' with the skimpy piece priced at just $20 and sitting among sweats and sneakers on his website.\nThe thong design, which Bianca appears to have worn in the past, incorporates thin spaghetti straps and a revealing sheer black material.\nIt was previously roasted by fans after Kanye first teased it last month.\nBianca meanwhile tapped into the frenzy surrounding her naked stunt on the Grammys red carpet by returning to Instagram.\nShe deactivated her account back in October amid reports she and Kanye had split and were headed toward divorce.\n\nHe also shared a picture of 'the invisible dress' on his Instagram Story\n\nHowever, he quickly deleted the description and simply changed it to: 'THE INVISIBLE DRESS' \n\nIt comes after he announced earlier today he is launching his first womenswear collection with his wife's sheer bodysuit as the hero product\n\nThe $20 black bodysuit is the same design that Bianca wore to a Grammys after party on Sunday, hours after her naked stunt on the Los Angeles red carpet\n\nThe skimpy bodysuit is priced at $17 and is available in just three sizes \n\nThe rapper, 47, has shared a new image of his wife, 30, modeling the look from his Yeezy women's line on Instagram, following their controversial appearance at the Grammys\n\n Kanye West in bitter fight with fans as they call him an abuser over Bianca Censori Grammys stunt \nBut after their headline-grabbing stunt at Sunday night's Grammys, Bianca is back.\nHer page features just two posts - behind the scenes polaroids of her shocking red carpet look, with her follower count already at 247k, whilst her Stories show more naked snaps.\nKanye also unleashed a fresh attack on critics on Bianca's outfit, by attacking individual comments on his Instagram.\nDespite huge backlash, Kanye was so proud of the commotion his wife's outfit caused that he took to Instagram to show Google search results revealing Bianca was the most-searched term for the evening.\nGoogle Metrics showed 'Bianca Censori outift' received over 5 million searches and she even beat searches for 'Grammy winners'. \nKanye then shared a photo of Bianca wearing her see-through outfit from the back as she stood with her hands on her hips. \nHowever, Kanye's followers have criticised the performer for using his wife's body 'as clout'. \n\nBianca wore the bodysuit to a wild party at the Living Room Club, where she performed karaoke, after the couple left the Grammys red carpet\n\nKanye West has bragged that his wife Bianca Censori's nearly nude outfit at the Grammys broke the internet\n\nThe Australian designer, 30, sparked worldwide outrage when she arrived on the red carpet in a completely see-through nude mesh dress worn without underwear\n\nTaking to the comments section on his Instagram, they wrote: 'He's really proud of it'.\n'Everyone thinks this man is a genius for working out that sex sells, oldest trick in the book'... 'It's an easy win when a man puts a naked woman on screen'.\n'Kanye you are wild'... 'Girl blink twice'... 'That was your idea? bro your wild.' \nRapper Kanye has now hit out at outrage to the stunt as he dismissed the ceremony as 'boring' and called Bianca's outfit 'art'. \n'People have called this a stunt but to Ye this is his art,' a source told The Sun. \n'He turned up, made headlines around the world and left. No one told him what to do and even if they had, he wouldn't have listened.\n'Ye always planned to do the red carpet and leave — he'd never sit through the Grammys because it's so dull and boring.'\nBianca exuded confidence as she headed to the carpet clad in a furry coat, before theatrically dropping the garment and flashing her bare derriere to photographers.\n\nKanye was so proud of the commotion his wife's outfit caused that he took to Instagram to show Google search results revealing Bianca was the most-searched term for the evening\n\nKanye then shared a photo of Bianca wearing her see-through outfit from the back as she stood with her hands on her hips\n\nHowever, Kanye's followers have criticised the performer for using his wife's body 'as clout'\n\nShe turned around to show off her topless chest and lack of underwear while West - nominated in the Best Rap Song category - leered at her nude body during the incident of indecent exposure.\nKanye was seen issuing commands to Bianca. A lip reader, Nicola Hickling, says that he told Censori, wearing a black fur coat over a mesh ensemble with no underwear: 'You're making a scene now.' \nShe nodded her head and he told her: 'Make a scene, I'll say it'll make so much sense.' He added: 'Drop it behind you and then turn, I got you.' She then tells him: 'Alright, let's go.'\nThe star paired this with nude heels and a touch of make-up. In contrast, West, 47, donned a demure black outfit and shades.\nIt was reported the pair were asked to leave the event after turning up uninvited, and escorted out by cops after their 'crazy stunt.' However another source said they 'left of their own accord' and the exact narrative remains unclear. \nMusic industry insiders were also questioning if his swift exit was down to his feud with Taylor Swift. \nThe stunt is said to have lost Kanye a $20 million deal to play in Japan, according to sources in Tokyo.\nA source said: 'Kanye is just ****ing up every opportunity that comes to him. The stunt was creepy beyond belief and has been greeted with horror in Japan.'\nHe added: 'Japan is having a cultural awakening about women's rights and the MeToo movement is really strong here. What he did is being seen as an act of coercive control which is utterly unacceptable. He has completely culturally misjudged Japan.'\nThis is unfortunate as he has been living in a hotel in Tokyo for most of the last year.\n\nBianca exuded confidence as she headed to the carpet clad in a furry coat, before theatrically dropping the garment and flashing her bare derriere to photographers\n\nThe star slowly dropped the coat in front of the world's press \n\nCensori looked nervous as she prepared to drop her coat \n\nKanye and Bianca left the event soon after the red carpet walk, and were pictured getting into a waiting limo.\nThere have been increasing calls for Kanye and his wife Bianca to be barred from future red carpet events. \nFollowing the incident, many fans expressed their disapproval on social media and called for Kanye — who reportedly lost a $20million deal following the stunt — and his wife to be banned from future events. \nOn Monday, The View's host Alyssa Farah Griffin, 35, shared a similar sentiment, calling the moment a 'low' point, and stating that she didn't want Kanye or his wife on red carpets.\n'I don't even want to dignify this other than to say: Kanye West, I don’t want to see him on red carpets anymore,' she stated.\n'I hope that his partner is OK, because that whole thing was very uncomfortable, I think, for most women, to watch, and I just — I don’t want to see it or hear from it any further.'\nShe was not the only celebrity to publicly express her distaste at the X-rated stunt. \nFormer View co-host Meghan McCain shared in a since-deleted post on X, 'I just want and have wanted for years — for Kanye West to leave us all the hell alone. He’s a repugnant, vile piece of garbage and his wife looks like a victim and a hostage.'\nHer representative later told Entertainment Weekly that McCain deleted the post on 'accident' and that she still thinks West is a 'vile pig.' \nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy also slammed the shocking red carpet moment.\nHe took to X, sharing a photo of Kanye and Bianca from the red carpet, writing in the caption, 'I hate Kayne [sic] so much.'\nInstagramKanye WestBianca CensoriJapan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNow Kanye West 'wants everyone to dress like Bianca Censori': Star gets ready to launch THAT 'invisible dress' on Yeezy hours after he went live with $20 'naked' bodysuit\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nCelebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins star SPLITS from fiancée and deletes all traces of her from social media\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nRichard Osman reveals he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering 'unbelievable pain'\n\nRuth Langsford's eye-watering finances are revealed as star rakes in six-figure sum after shock split from Eamonn Holmes last year\n\nSomething for everyone!

And the doctor was like \"I don't think it is, but we'll just quickly pass you through\". And I mean, the NHS are fantastic. \n\nJamie Theakston, 54, was overcome with emotion as he shared a heart-wrenching call with a cancer survivor live on Heart Breakfast radio on Tuesday\n\nThe radio presenter announced he had been diagnosed with stage one laryngeal cancer in October 2024, after listeners had noticed there was something not quite right with his voice\n'Everything happened so quickly it was like dizziness, because it was all the hospital appointments, and got diagnosed beginning of August with early-stage breast cancer. \n'I had two operations and then I got the all clear. So, it's really important to get it checked as soon as you find anything.'\nJamie's co-host Amanda Holden added: 'That’s like the same timeline as Jamie basically.'\nJamie added: 'It was actually, August through to...Can I ask you, why didn't you get it checked? When you said you thought you found a lump, you didn't get it checked? Why was that?'\nShe replied: 'It was literally just because I just didn’t think about it. It just wasn't an occurrence to me that it could be breast cancer. No one in my family had ever had breast cancer. \n'No one had, it just wasn't a thing, and it really is stupid to ignore anything. It really is and I was one of the lucky ones and got it sorted straight away.'\nAfter undergoing three life-changing surgeries and being told he had 'a one in six chance he might not be able to talk again', Jamie revealed last month that he was free from the disease and would be back on the radio full-time.\nAs he began work again, Jamie said: 'Thanks to everyone for making this morning feel very, very special. Thanks for your (the listeners') messages as well.' \n\nA listener dialed in to send Jamie her well-wishes while revealing her very similar cancer story\n\nJamie made an emotional return to host his Heart FM Breakfast last month - after taking a four month break from work while he battled laryngeal cancer\nAmanda then added: 'We are so happy to welcome him back!'\nTo which Jamie said back: 'Four months I have waited for this moment!' as Amanda said: 'It feels longer it feels more like five months.'\nDuring the programme, audio clips were played from Jamie's colleagues, friends and family talking about his cancer diagnosis.\nHis wife, Sophie Siegle, said: 'Hello, darling. It's me, Sophie. When we found out you had cancer, it was wow, such a dark time'.\nHis son, Sidney, added: 'Well done for getting through these past few months.'\nAfter the audio played, Amanda said: 'What an amazing man you are. You really fought very hard, Jamie, you've kept your sense of humour, which is the most important thing, I think.\n'And isn't it wonderful? It's a terrible thing to go through, but it's a wonderful thing to see how many people love you.' \nAlso on the programme, Jamie encouraged listeners to check themselves and said: 'Ignoring cancer won't beat it.\n\nAfter undergoing three life-changing surgeries and being told he had 'a one in six chance he might not be able to talk again', Jamie revealed last month that he was free from the disease \n\nTaking to Instagram, Jamie recently wrote: 'Nice try cancer, but I'm still here! CANCER FREE. Difficult roads can lead to beautiful destinations, and after 3 surgeries and 4 months of vocal therapy, I'm back baby !!'\n\nJamie shocked fans with his diagnosis in an Instagram post last year \n\nBREAKING NEWS Jamie Theakston, 54, reveals he is cancer free after undergoing three life-changing surgeries as he makes an emotional return to Heart FM breakfast \n'Cancer loves being ignored. It's a coward that lives in the shadows, and I think that, if we can shine a light on that, then we can defeat the darkness.\n'If we just get ourselves checked, then stage one diagnosis, which is what I was very fortunate enough to be at, shouldn't be a problem, but I do, I urge you to go and get checked.'\nOn Friday Jamie revealed he was cancer free as he made a joyful appearance on Heart FM and told how he would be back full time on Monday.\nHe said: 'Today is the four-month anniversary of my cancer diagnosis. So it's been four months, and I've had enough of hospitals and operations, and it's just lovely to be back, and I've got some news for you. Because I can tell you that as of today, I'm cancer free. \n'Anyone who's been through what I've been through will know it's kind of you just get a barrage of statistics.\n'So they'll always tell you in the first one, when I got my diagnosis which came as an enormous shock, by the way, I was fully intended to be told that I had a sore throat. \n'And when I was told, 'oh, it's probably cancer', just, literally, I just didn't even know what to say. I mean, it just blew my mind. And so then it's all about statistics. So the first is go, 'well, you'll have a one in ten chance you won't survive it'.\n'And you kind of go, 'oh okay, I'll take that'. And then I had to do several surgeries. So, the first surgery wasn't as successful as we hoped. Had a second surgery, and then a third surgery, and each time, I was doing more and more damage to my vocal cords. \n'So, in actual fact, by the third one, they said, 'well, look, you've got a one in six chance you might not be able to talk again'.\n'And so, then you kind of think, 'oh, okay, that's like rolling a dice', yeah, I'll take that. And so, there's just a kind of, it's just statistics after statistics.'\nHis Heart FM co-host Amanda said: 'Well, you should be very buoyed by that because, yes, it was huge news when it all happened. \n'It was devastating for us all to hear it. But we are so thrilled that you sound great and you are in the studio.'\nTaking to Instagram, Jamie wrote: 'Nice try cancer, but I'm still here! CANCER FREE. Difficult roads can lead to beautiful destinations, and after 3 surgeries and 4 months of vocal therapy, I'm back baby !!\n'Come share the love, Heart Breakfast, Monday morning @thisisheart @noholdenback.' \n\nWhat is laryngeal cancer?\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box).\nThe larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). It plays an important role in helping you breathe and speak.\nIn the UK, there are more than 2,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year.\nThe condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It's more common in men than women. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoads of Jamie's celebrity pals flooded his comments in relief, with his co-star Ashley Roberts writing: 'He's back!! ❤️',\nPiers Morgan added: 'Great news Jamie', Vicky Pattison wrote: 'Woohooooo!!!! Best news ever', Sean Walsh added: 'Get in'.\nAt the time he revealed his diagnosis last year, Jamie said: 'Hi folks, as you know - I recently had an operation to remove a lesion from my vocal chords.\n'The biopsy has identified this as Stage 1 Laryngeal cancer. So I have cancer but cancer doesn't have me!\n'The prognosis is very positive and I'm hoping to be back with you in October. Until then, I've been told to give my voice a rest and leave you in the mostly capable hands of JK and Amanda.\n'Huge thanks to them and all the Global family who have been unbelievably supportive. Be thankful for this day, and when I see you next, I'll have a great story to tell.'\nIn September 2024, Jamie had said he had got himself checked out after some of listeners had noticed something wasn't quite right with his voice. \nAccording to the NHS, symptoms of laryngeal cancer include a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse, pain when swallowing, a lump or swelling in your neck, a long-lasting cough or breathlessness, a persistent sore throat or earache and, in the most severe cases, difficulty breathing.\nIn the UK, there are more than 2,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year. The condition is more common in people over the age of 60, and it's more common in men than women.\nJamie - who is married to Sophie Siegle - wrote on Instagram: 'Sooo - a few of you listeners have noticed my voice hasn't sounded right these past few weeks - I've got you to thank.\n\nOn September 1, he shared this post thanking listeners for spotting something wrong with his voice which he quickly got checked out\n\nJamie pictured with wife Sophie Siegle in 2017\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child Sidney in April 2008, before having their second son, Kit, September 2009\n'Got it checked. Doctors found a lesion on my vocal chords which I've had removed this weekend - thanks for all the kind messages - should be back on my feet soon - in the meantime...' and finished the post with a zip-up mouth emoji. \nPrevious posts on Heart FM's Instagram account showed fans expressing concern for Jamie's voice, with one comment under a clip from August 22 saying: 'Jamie you need to sort your bad throat out.' \nJamie also appeared in a clip posted on August 23, where he and Zoe announced the winners of a £30,000 giveaway. \nListen to Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden weekdays from 06:30 – 10:00 across the UK and on Global Player.\nAmanda HoldenJamie Theakston\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJamie Theakston, 54, is overcome with emotion as he shares heart-wrenching call with cancer survivor - following his four-month battle\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDavid Beckham reveals major Hollywood star is his 'long-lost twin brother' in Stella Artois Super Bowl advert\n\nCelebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins star SPLITS from fiancée and deletes all traces of her from social media\n\nMartin Clunes' ex-wife reveals the harsh comment she claims ended their marriage: 'We both knew it was over'\n\nRichard Osman reveals he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering 'unbelievable pain'\n\nRuth Langsford's eye-watering finances are revealed as star rakes in six-figure sum after shock split from Eamonn Holmes last year\n\nSomething for everyone!

It could involve compromised democratic principles, according to Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo, who recently spoke out against billionaire Elon Musk‘s space exploration plans.\n\n“Elon Musk wants his Empire on Mars,” The Avengers actor posted on his X account @MarkRuffalo on Feb. 3., 2025. The lengthy tirade on the Musk-owned platform has over 464.2K views, 13K likes, 3.7K reshares and 943 saves. \n\n“The reason he wants to shut down USAid is that he wants tax payer money to fund and build his empire there. I know that sounds insane, and it is,” the post continues.\n\nWhat is Mark Ruffalo saying about Elon Musk?\n\nRuffalo tried to justify his reasoning by providing personal encounters with Musk for more context:\n\n“The one thing Elon pressed upon me when I first met him was that he was going to go to Mars and set up a civilization there. He stopped being a humanitarian and ‘good guy’ when he realized there was no way to get there without cleaning out government coffers, and there was no way to do that without stopping humanitarian aid here in the USA and abroad.”\n\nThe Spotlight star described the irony behind Musk’s potential motivations, and how the tech mogul’s actions seemed to only serve one purpose: his own.\n\n“Keep your eye on the ball. When Elon slashes costs, it’s for his own pocket and no one else’s. It’s stealing, is what it is. He sees those trillions as his. Not ours. He thinks he is ‘saving humanity’ by going to Mars. He is clearly ending humanity and humanitarian aid to get there.” \n\nThe post ends with a chilling warning for those who are skeptical:\n\n“We are Elon’s stepping stone. Be aware. He is already rich off government contracts. Now he is gaming the system. Trump has become his lapdog. Watch all the things Trump gives Elon now. Elon has seized him.”\n\nIn a threaded X post, Ruffalo linked to an article from The Guardian related to what he described in his initial post. \n\nOn Feb. 4., 2025, Ruffalo wrote a follow-up post on X about the potential dangers involved in Musk having so much power and control, without being an elected official. He also reshared an editorial on Musk’s Treasury and USAID takeover, from the X account @zeteo_news.\n\n“Musk appears to be having his cronies…trawl through government data (that they’re not supposed to have access to) and identify random items they dislike,” Ruffalo states. “If Musk thinks it sounds sketchy or wasteful, he announces his intent to flip off the money flow. He then congratulates himself on X for ‘cutting costs.’” \n\nMark Ruffalo has taken shots at Elon Musk in the past\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ruffalo has gone full-blown Hulk on Musk. The actor has a long history of taking shots at the cofounder of PayPal via social media.\n\n“Elon. Please—for the love of decency—get off Twitter,” he wrote in a post from Nov. 4., 2022, resharing commentary by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Hand the keys over to someone who does this as an actual job, and get on with running Tesla and SpaceX. You are destroying your credibility. It’s just not a good look.”\n\nMusk fired back at Ruffalo, commenting, “Hot take: not everything AOC says is accurate.” The response has 124K likes, 9.4K reshares, and over 5.8K comments.\n\nRuffalo supported the political campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, and didn’t hold back his feelings when the subject came to Musk’s involvement with Donald Trump.\n\n“Elon Musk is such a two-faced, turn-coat traitor,” he exclaims in a video clip shared by X account @beatsinbrief posted on Sep. 22., 2024. “He was a climate champion and he sold himself out for a buck.”\n\nIs Elon Musk planning to build a colony on Mars?\n\nIt’s well-known that Musk is obsessed with the universe beyond Earth. The SpaceX founder doesn’t hide his desire to potentially move to Mars, and dedicates much of his time and resources to figuring out how.\n\nSpaceX has a landing page related to how their progress towards a Mars landing, and Musk actively posts his enthusiastic feelings on the subject any chance he gets.\n\n“AMERICA IS GOING TO MARS” Musk posted on X on Jan. 20., 2025, with a video clip of himself giving a thumbs up sign, shortly after he appeared at the presidential inauguration for Donald Trump.\n\nMusk estimates that his Starship rockets will reach Mars by 2026, with humans following by 2028, in an X post from Dec. 29., 2024. As far as how the government will work on the Red Planet, Musk stated, that “the Martians will decide how they are ruled. I recommend direct, rather than representative, democracy.” \n\nX users are calling Ruffalo ‘dumb’\n\nComments have been turned off for the post, but that didn’t stop X users from voicing their opinions on Ruffalo’s original statement.\n\n“Mark Ruffalo just released his most insane post yet,” posted X user @Bubblebathgirl. “He’s now falsely accusing @elonmusk of ending the corrupt USAID so that Musk can move to Mars. Ruffalo ignores the fact USAID was being used on nonsense that doesn’t help Americans but does make politicians richer.”\n\n“Apparently Gamma radiation made Mark Ruffalo as dumb as the Hulk, as weak as Bruce Banner & a liar like a CNN host,” posted X user @FERMOR_23, resharing Ruffalo’s post.\n\n“It’s really harder to get any dumber than Mark Ruffalo,” X user @catturd2 also posted, with a screenshot of Ruffalo’s post, to which X user @blueunicornJan replied, “Mark Ruffalo has Hulk brain. Elon is a genius exposing the graft that is destroying our country. I think I will listen to Elon.”\n\nSome X users sounded off on their approval of the Hollywood star’s commentary. X user @goodhazelgraces reshared Ruffalo’s words, with a caption that read, “i f*cking love mark ruffalo because i mean he’s not wrong that’s all elon’s ever been actually passionate about.”\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Mark Ruffalo via Instagram DM for comment.\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

The aim is to test new lines of attack against the Liberals.\n\n\"The start of a tariff war with the United States is changing voters' moods. It's harder to talk about a broken Canada when there's a growing sense of patriotism,\" another Conservative source said.\n\nCanada's political landscape is changing rapidly.\n\n\"The challenge is to demonstrate that the party can adapt quickly, that the leader can go beyond slogans and that he has more than one trick up his sleeve,\" warns a third source close to the party.\n\nRadio-Canada is not identifying the sources because they were speaking about internal party matters.\n\nAdjustment in progress\n\nThere's been an adjustment in Poilievre's rhetoric since Donald Trump was sworn in, and his threats of tariffs have become increasingly real.\n\nPoilievre promises that \"Conservatives will take back control of our border and put Canada first,\" echoing one of U.S. President Donald Trump's reasons for threatening to impose tariffs on Canada. \n\nOn Monday morning, before Trump announced a 30-day reprieve on his planned 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods, Poilievre proposed sending troops and helicopters to the border, adding 2,000 new border officers and expanding the powers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) across the entire border.\n\nBut in the same breath, he blamed the Liberal government for its failure at the border. According to Poilievre, Trump is in a strong position because the Liberals prevented the development of pipelines in Canada.\n\n\"President Trump has been given an incredible gift by these radical, anti-development Liberals when they block the projects that would have made us more self-reliant.\"\n\nPoilievre is calling on the Liberals to recall MPs to the House of Commons to adopt his own Canada First plan. \n\nBut he hasn't committed to negotiating with the other parties on a plan. And he refuses to commit to bringing down the minority government at the first opportunity if the House were to come back.\n\nOne of the challenges, according to Conservative sources, is to strike the right balance in attacking the Liberals. \n\n\"Voters want us to stand up for Canada. But in times of crisis, they may be less receptive if we are too critical of the government.\"\n\nContinuing the carbon tax attack?\n\nAccording to sources, there are differences of opinion within the Conservative Party's decision-making apparatus on whether or not it's important to keep hammering away at the carbon tax.\n\nA faction close to Poilievre continues to believe that the carbon tax strategy should not be dropped, because it goes to the heart of the Conservative message on affordability. \n\nFor months, Poilievre has been calling for a \"carbon tax election\" to get rid of Trudeau. But all the Liberal candidates who want to replace him promise to abolish, transform or suspend the carbon tax increase on individuals. \n\n\"We can't let the Liberals pull the rug out from under us,\" one source said. \"By saying Carbon Tax Carney or Carbon Tax Chrystia, it's a way of tying them personally to Justin Trudeau's legacy. It's at the heart of our strategy.\"\n\nSeveral Conservatives also point out that a lot of money has been invested in this game plan, and there's little time left to change course.\n\n\"They don't want to reinvent the wheel at one minute to midnight, but I don't think they'll have a choice,\" a Conservative strategist said. \"Canadians' minds are elsewhere.\"\n\nHow best to handle Carney?\n\n\"We'll have to manage the next Liberal leader differently,\" one Conservative source said. \"People hated Justin Trudeau, but are more neutral towards Mark Carney, because they don't know him.\"\n\nAccording to many Conservatives, former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney embodies novelty, while former finance minister Chrystia Freeland is easier to tie to Justin Trudeau's legacy.\n\nLast week, the Conservatives seemed to be keeping close tabs on Carney. Two Conservative MPs held press briefings in front of buildings where the Liberal leadership candidate was attending events.\n\nThe Conservatives didn't give the same treatment to other aspiring leaders such as Freeland and Karina Gould. \n\n\"It just goes to show you who we think is going to win,\" a Conservative source said.\n\n\"This is our chance to define Mark Carney in people's minds. But the window is slim, especially if he declares a snap election,\" the source said. \"We have to tell the world that Carney, he's not an outsider. He was behind Justin Trudeau's policies, he was pulling the strings.\"\n\nHolding the lead\n\nThe Conservatives also recognize that the Liberals are enjoying a slight bump in the polls, with Trudeau's departure and Trump's bellicose rhetoric.\n\n\"There may be some Liberals fed up with Trudeau who had come to the Conservatives and are now going back to the Liberals,\" admits a former Conservative campaign manager. \"But our base is there. It's solid and it's going to stay with us.\"\n\nPolls show a slight decline for the Conservatives and a small increase for the Liberals in recent weeks. According to Abacus Data, the Conservative lead has dropped from 26 to 21 points. According to Léger, the Conservative lead has shrunk to 18 points.\n\nThe CBC Poll Tracker shows the Liberals have made gains over the last few weeks, but the Conservatives still hold a wide and decisive lead.\n\nSeveral Conservatives said this burst of enthusiasm for the Liberals won't last.\n\n\"The size of the victory may shrink, but we'll win just the same,\" a former Conservative strategist said.\n\nSome Conservatives acknowledge they may lose some seats in Ontario or Atlantic Canada that they were hoping to win, \"but not enough to hurt us.\"\n\n\"Look at [Democratic presidential candidate] Kamala Harris in the U.S. That didn't last long,\" said one Conservative. \"We're not afraid, but we don't take anything for granted.\"\n\nAccording to this strategist, Carney will have a hard time winning support from middle-class Canadians.\n\n\"Pierre Poilievre has been courting the working class for two years,\" says a former Conservative campaign manager. \"If Mr. Carney tries to present himself as an ordinary person, it's not very convincing. It's hard for people to believe that a banker really understands their day-to-day challenges.\"\n\nAlthough the Liberal race has barely begun, the Conservatives' target is already clear.","summary":"A possible tariff war with the United States, Justin Trudeau's departure and the Liberal leadership race are all upsetting Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's campaign plans.
