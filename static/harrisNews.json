What do you remember when you hear Rolling Stones? Michael Jackson? Films bring families and friends together, sitting side by side, sharing a collective moment.\"\n\n Her musical references lacked context at the time, but are now understood to play a significant role in setting the tone of her documentary right at the beginning, with \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones — a band who previously delivered a cease-and-desist to President Donald Trump — kicking off the opening scene, followed quickly by Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" as she travels from Mar-a-Lago to Manhattan to begin inauguration prep.\n\n Jackson, as the movie reveals, is her favorite musical artist, and \"Billie Jean\" her favorite song by him. Partway through the film, she recalls meeting Jackson with her husband once, adding, \"He was very sweet. Very nice.\" Then \"Billie Jean\" plays again, and she quietly sings along to it in the car.\n\n Several other hits get their moment in the spotlight during the film, including Aretha Franklin's \"Amazing Grace,\" Boney M.'s \"Sunny,\" The Crystals' \"Then He Kissed Me,\" and Tears for Fears' \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\" the last of which plays when she and Donald make their final voyage to Washington before the inauguration.\n\n Fine-tuning the inauguration hat \n\n The film documents Melania's back and forth with designers about her various outfits for inauguration weekend, showing her providing mostly positive feedback at fittings. When she sees her black-and-white inaugural ball outfit, for example, she says, \"Very my colors, black and white. Very me.\"\n\n It also shows the behind-the-scenes conversations surrounding her unforgettable inauguration hat. The wide-brimmed accessory, which she wore for the first half of Inauguration Day, immediately turned into an internet meme when she was pictured at formal events throughout the morning with her face almost entirely covered, and her husband was caught struggling to kiss her on the cheek before taking the oath of office.\n\n The documentary reveals that the hat had potential to be even bigger. When her designer pulled it out at a fitting to seek her approval, she looked at it and said, \"What do you think if we do not so wide?\"\n\n Insights about Barron \n\n Little is revealed about Barron Trump, the only child that Donald and Melania share, in the first lady's movie, though she delivers plenty of quotes about her pride in her son. Eighteen at the time of filming, Barron is only briefly mentioned or shown until the latter part of the film when inauguration weekend arrives.\n\n Melania describes him as a \"confident man\" in voiceover audio and at one point reminisces about him taking swim lessons at Mar-a-Lago with her father, Viktor Knavs, before later taking tennis lessons with her. She later chuckles on camera when she hears Jake Tapper comment on his height while watching live CNN coverage of Inauguration Day.\n\n The most telling moment about how Barron handled the turbulent events of 2024, while he was beginning his freshman year of college, comes as she discusses security for the inauguration alongside Donald, sharing that she has safety concerns after the assassination attempts toward Donald and noting that Barron would not feel comfortable getting out of a vehicle in public view. \"I respect that,\" she says. \"It's his decision.\"\n\n Barron's voice — which became an unexpected point of curiosity on the internet after a childhood video of him with a Slovenian accent resurfaced — is notably omitted from the film, with only one brief bit of audio captured on camera that comes out muffled.\n\n Melania does not interact with any of Donald's other children \n\n Donald's four older children with Ivana Trump and Marla Maples appear in the documentary at various events along with their own families, though Melania is never shown interacting with any family members outside of her husband, her father and her son.\n\n The $40 million Amazon deal gets addressed \n\n Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has worked to rebuild his relationship with Donald since his 2024 election victory and donated generously to his inaugural fund, raising questions about Amazon MGM Studios' decision to buy the rights to Melania for $40 million, which The Wall Street Journal claimed is the most the company has ever spent on a documentary.\n\n Seemingly anticipating criticism surrounding the $40 million price tag, the film briefly addressed the negotiations. In one scene, an aide for Melania gets a phone call where she is warned that a journalist at Puck is asking questions about how the deal came to be. The aide hangs up the phone and suggests in front of the camera that she's not interested in dealing with the reporter to try and defend it.\n\n Marc Beckman, Melania's senior adviser and agent, recently pushed back on the idea that the deal involved politics in a statement to PEOPLE, saying, \"I negotiated the $40 million dollar deal on behalf of Melania Trump. My negotiation included several key players in Hollywood, such as Amazon MGM, Disney, Paramount, and Netflix.\"\n\n \"Although record-breaking, our decision was equally motivated by Amazon MGM’s best-in-class team, its ability to launch in theaters worldwide, plus the docuseries, and its commitment to support a massive global marketing campaign,\" Beckman added.\n\n WSJ reported that Netflix and Apple declined to bid for the documentary, and that Paramount only bid $4 million. The outlet says the second-highest bid was from Disney, who offered $14 million.\n\n Jimmy Carter's funeral \n\n The documentary spends a surprising amount of time on President Jimmy Carter's funeral on Jan. 9, 2025, though primarily because of the date's significance in Melania's personal life: Her mother, Amalija Knavs, died one year earlier on the same day.\n\n After the funeral service in Washington, during which she said she was caught up thinking about her mother, she returned to N.Y.C. and brought the documentary crew into St. Patrick's Cathedral to show her lighting a candle in Amalija's honor.\n\n Asking powerful political wives for guidance \n\n While preparing her first lady initiatives in January 2025, Melania revealed in the documentary that she called on a couple of notable political wives for advice on how they've approached advocacy in their roles.\n\n She takes a video call with French first lady Brigitte Macron in Trump Tower, asking her how she has made progress tackling cyberbullying among children. As Macron talks about France's guidance that children should not have smartphones younger than 11 years old, Melania jots down on a blank pad of paper, \"No phones until 11.\"\n\n She later invites Queen Rania of Jordan for a meeting to throw ideas around.\n\n Donald's reaction to realizing he has to ride with the Bidens \n\n During a briefing on the Inauguration Day schedule with Donald and Melania, the couple were filmed learning that they would have some forced quality time with outgoing first couple Joe and Jill Biden. After the Bidens hosted them for a morning tea at the White House before the swearing-in ceremony, the Trumps were to join them in the same vehicle to ride over to the U.S. Capitol.\n\n \"That's interesting,\" Donald reacts with skepticism. \"That'll be an interesting drive.\"\n\n Though the documentary didn't capture the Trumps saying anything negative about the Bidens behind their backs on Inauguration Day, Donald was open about his dissatisfaction with Biden to the outgoing president's face during his public inauguration speech, portraying the Democrat as incompetent and saying, \"From this moment on, America's decline is over.\"\n\n Kamala Harris' sigh before the transition \n\n Moments before President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were welcomed into the Capitol Rotunda to watch the transition of power to the incoming administration, Melania's documentary crew captured them backstage, appearing distraught by the moments to come.\n\n Two months earlier, Donald had defeated Harris in the presidential election, earning 312 Electoral College votes to her 226.\n\n Harris, in particular, looks agitated, and just before walking through the curtains to take her place on stage, lets out a heavy sigh.","summary":"'Melania' premiered globally in theaters on Friday, Jan. 30, sharing selective glimpses of the first lady's transition back to the White House","url":"https://people.com/most-surprising-moments-from-melania-trump-documentary-barron-safety-concerns-kamala-sigh-and-michael-jackson-singalong-11896456","image":"https://people.com/thmb/c95CEEUmSfPT7eSShDT23JvbUqo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(712x288:714x290)/melania-trump-inaugural-parade-022125-1-11eafb998f804664947494d8e35ab9b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 23:40:06","author":"Kyler Alvord","authors":["Kyler Alvord"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.443},{"id":397868500,"title":"Where Were You When Don Lemon Was Arrested (and Democracy Died)?","text":"With all due respect to Don McLean and his masterpiece “American Pie,” his song has resonated with me all day as I’ve been beside myself now that Don Lemon has been arrested. Someday, this day will be known as the day democracy and journalism died. Just like that day when the music died. \n\nI can't remember if I cried,When I read about his widowed bride,But something touched me deep inside,The day the music died.\n\nBear with me while I cope, but if I may, I can’t remember if I cried / When I heard about his prison ride / But something touched me deep inside / The day the news biz died. Okay, enough of that. Let’s get to the good stuff, which is the terrible, awful, horrible week the left is having. \n\nHow about that Fulton County election investigation, which our own Chris Queen and Matt Margolis wrote about? And what do you think about the investigation into Rep. Ilhan Omar’s finances? Or that Walz-Trump negotiation that somehow enabled the Minneapolis Police to actually do their jobs, and the bonus news that it looks like Walz is ruling out public office forever? (If you can believe him.) \n\nThe lemon icing on the cake, however, is the conniptions the left is having over the arrest of Don Lemon for his very active and proud role in the invasion of Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn. TMZ, that upstanding pillar of the Fourth Estate, is worried that the arrest of low-IQ Lemon might change democracy forever. \n\n🚨 Don Lemon has been arrested.

Both journalism and democracy are dying, that is, if you listen to purple-haired Rep. Rosa DeLauro and the Associated Press. Being indicted by a jury of your peers is nothing short of an attack on the truth itself, and of course, our values. \n\nArresting journalists for doing their jobs is an attack on truth and our values as Americans.The freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy. Don Lemon and other journalists arrested today must be released. https://t.co/q16rzDEtC5— Rosa DeLauro (@rosadelauro) January 30, 2026\n\nNow, if you were to ask anyone at the AP who Steve Baker is, they probably couldn’t tell you, unless they were one of the hacks who wrote the slanted AP story about when Baker was arrested for the simple act of reporting on the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. You may want to notice something here. All of a sudden, AP is calling Lemon a \"journalist\" now that he's been arrested. But when Baker was arrested, AP called him a \"Texas-based writer for a conservative media outlet.\" See the difference? That's Steve below, wearing his Biden bracelets.\n\nDon Lemon says his arrest is “unprecedented” because he’s a “journalist” practicing his First Amendment rights.I’m sure JOURNALIST Steve Baker would like to debate that “unprecedented” argument after the Biden regime had him arrested for covering J6.pic.twitter.com/RWVkDP4Scx— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) January 30, 2026\n\nThe real crime is that we live in a world where you could get punished for coordinating logistics with raid organizers to invade a Christian church while services are going on, shouting the congregants down, traumatizing kids, and forcing people to flee to their cars. That’s journalism. \n\nIf we lose our free press, we lose our democracy. The arrest of Don Lemon and other journalists should be a reminder to our press to continue to aggressively and unabashedly pursue and report the truth for the good of our country. pic.twitter.com/njZNw195G4— Rep. Mike Thompson (@RepThompson) January 30, 2026\n\nI mean, all Lemon was doing was reporting on what he saw, objectively, as any true journalist would. Except for the parts where he points to parents rushing little children to their cars in the snow for fear of their safety, as he says, “I imagine it’s uncomfortable and traumatic for the people here… but that’s what protesting is about.” \n\nYou have to give Lemon credit. He expressed empathy and understanding for the people in real time while he was among those making it traumatic (his word) for those kids. \n\nDon Lemon led a group of protesters to shut down Church services.They screamed in the face of crying children.They blocked parents from reaching their kids in Sunday School.50 parishioners were prevented from leaving.One even broke an arm.Evilpic.twitter.com/joOYGi6tMR https://t.co/UrisFyjAp2— Lucky Teter (@TheMagaHulk) January 30, 2026\n\nIsn’t that what all journalists do? Doesn’t the First Amendment protect your right to invade a church in the middle of services to disrupt them, and then to ambush congregants and clergy by putting them on camera and hitting them with hostile questions and argumentation? I guess we’ll find out. Lemon’s going to have his day in court. \n\nIt’s at this point that I’m supposed to leave you with something to think about, and I really can’t quit thinking about how James Woods put this into perspective. He did so on X with fitting words, and perhaps an even more fitting Norman Rockwell painting that truly does represent the people Lemon & Co. traumatized on that snowy Sunday. And so, I’ll leave it here. \n\nSo much of Lemon’s arrest is perfect. After several activist judges failed to do their duty, a grand jury of citizens indicted Don Lemon on a serious act, the terrorizing of children and others praying at church services.So fitting that The People indicted Don Lemon.🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/gfmXvcvaRN— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) January 30, 2026\n\nFind out what you’re missing behind the members-only wall.

The trio takes an ill-advised shortcut through a remote gated community, where they find themselves trapped after witnessing a murder. Over the course of the night, they are blamed, hunted and fractured by their own differing belief systems, while the perpetrator — played by Van Der Beek — emerges as the cunning patriarch who holds the entire community under his influence.\n\n“This script is the most personal story I’ve ever written,” Burr said in a statement to TheWrap. “It’s set in the community I lived in for the first half of my life, and its characters are an amalgam of myself and my closest friends growing up.”\n\n“Growing up as a biracial person who identified strongly as half-black but who was afforded the occasional benefits that came with being able to pass as white, my perspectives often did not align with those of my white friends, while my experiences did not always align with those of my black friends,” Burr said in a statement. “Trusting authority figures was a privilege. Understanding that not all of my friends had that privilege was a journey. This film explores that journey through a propulsive genre lens.”\n\nThe film is produced by Nancy Leopardi (“The Cure”) of Indy Entertainment, Ross Kohn (“Maggie Moore(s)”) of the newly launched Core 4 Films, and Gary Glushon (“24 Hours to Live”).\n\nExecutive producers include Michael Cassutt, John Harris, J.

Most estimates place the number at 300,000. Until recently, we didn't know what had become of those children.\n\nNow, we have nearly half of them back.

President Trump promised that we would find these children, and under his strong leadership and with his unwavering support, the patriots at these, and other partner, agencies have been—and will continue to do—just that.\n\nMr. Homan doesn't mention what these kids may have been doing when they were found, and that may be for the best.\n\nRead More: Walz Reiterates Priorities in Face-Off With Border Czar Tom Homan\n\nHere's the thing: Civilized people don't exploit children; they protect them.

They are, in effect, supporting the trafficking of children. They are, in effect, supporting the exploitation of children, for purposes that don't bear contemplation.\n\nHow did we get to this sad state of affairs? We might note, yet again, that millions entered during the four years of the Biden administration's non-enforcement of the borders. Many children entered, accompanied and unaccompanied. Only a cursory effort, if even that, was made to determine which kids belonged to which adults. As with the adults, we don't know where many of these kids are or where they are being forced to do. But we're finding out, thanks to the efforts of Tom Homan and the men and women working for him.\n\nNeed any more reminders of what a joke the Biden presidency was? Need another good reason to go vote this fall? This is the work of years. It's amazing what the administration has accomplished in one year. 145,000 kids, now safe from whatever fate awaited them.

Journalists, he said, “have their own agenda and it’s not your agenda. ... We're gonna do something about it.”\n\nThe quote came to mind anew on Friday morning. MS NOW reported:\n\nTwo journalists, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, and two people active in Democratic circles in Minnesota have been arrested by federal agents investigating an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a church service.\n\nLemon was in Los Angeles to cover the Grammy Awards when he was taken into custody Thursday.\n\nThere was a recent protest during Sunday services at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the disruption was reportedly driven by demonstrators’ belief that the church’s pastor works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSoon after, federal agents arrested three of those involved with the protest, including civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. Lemon, who was on hand for the developments, has now also been taken into custody, despite the longtime journalist’s insistence that he was at the church to cover the protest, not to participate in it.\n\n“I’m just here photographing, I’m not part of the group ... I’m a journalist,” Lemon is heard saying in one video of the event.\n\nThe Trump administration had tried to secure charges against Lemon in recent days, but to no avail. On Friday morning, however, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted that he’d been arrested anyway — a development the White House celebrated in an unusually provocative way.\n\nTime will tell what becomes of the criminal case, and Lemon’s lawyer said he will “fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.”\n\nBut as the details of the case emerge, it’s worth pausing to appreciate the larger context.\n\nTrump’s approach to the freedom of the press has never been especially healthy — we are talking about a president who’s echoed Joseph Stalin in his attacks on journalists — but his campaign against the media has gotten especially aggressive in recent months.\n\nIn September, for example, the Republican suggested that “evening shows” are “not allowed” to criticize him and that networks that give him “only bad publicity” risk losing their broadcast licenses. At one point, the president went so far as to claim that broadcasters that air evening news programs are doing something “illegal” if the White House disapproves of their coverage.\n\nThe list doesn’t stop there. Trump has sued news outlets that produce coverage he doesn’t like. He’s threatened media outlets over polling data he doesn’t like. He’s threatened to sic federal prosecutors on news organizations that publish reports he doesn’t like.\n\nThe FBI even searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and took her devices.\n\nI’m not talking about tantrums the president has thrown over the last decade, I’m referring to specific incidents that have unfolded over the last six months.\n\nThat journalists have now been arrested is a dramatic escalation, but it’s not a development that came out of nowhere. On the contrary, Trump and his team have launched a systemic campaign against the nation’s free press that is without modern precedent in the United States — and it’s clearly getting worse.\n\nIn the run-up to Election Day 2024, Trump was nearly as eager to attack the free press as he was to attack Kamala Harris. The Republican referred to journalists as “the enemy of the people,” media outlets as “evil,” and news professionals as “scum.”\n\nBut we’re well past the point of ugly taunts and name-calling. What we’re seeing is an authoritarian leader reading from the same playbook Viktor Orban used in Hungary, targeting journalists and journalism in the hopes of bringing it to heel.\n\nIn hindsight, “no one loves the First Amendment more than me” might very well be one of the most offensive lies Trump has ever told.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-arrest-of-journalists-is-the-latest-front-in-his-effort-to-orbanize-the-media","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769806672/260130-donald-trump-viktor-orban-es_11638879f361_1163887d31e1_1163887fa70d/260130-donald-trump-viktor-orban-es_11638879f361_1163887d31e1_1163887fa70d.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 21:51:33","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":397858412,"title":"The Melania ‘documentary’ might play in Orange County... but falls flat in NYC. Here’s why","text":"On a freezing January morning in New York City, I joined 19 fellow moviegoers in Auditorium 10 at AMC 34th Street 14 to watch one of the earliest public screenings in the U.S. of Melania, the $40 million Amazon “documentary.”\n\nIt was obvious from the notepads resting on the tables of the 60-seat theater that most were members of the press, but at least two members of the public had also bought tickets. \n\n“I came mostly out of curiosity,” 55-year-old New Yorker and astrologer Alan Lin told The Independent. \n\nAnother civilian who arrived halfway through the 104-minute movie, and left again a short time later to get a soda, started vaping as the credits rolled. “I liked it,” he told The Independent after the movie ended. “But I might have to go see it again because I missed most of it.” \n\nIf more people went to see the movie twice, it could give ticket sales a boost. Unsurprisingly, sales are proving stronger in more conservative areas like Orange County, California, and Miami, Florida. According to a Wired analysis, only two screenings in the U.S. have completely sold out — one at an AMC in Independence, Missouri, and one at an AMC in Vero Beach, Florida, an hour’s drive north of the Trumps’ residence, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump played down the weak ticket sales at his wife’s premiere at the Kennedy Center. “It’s a very tough business in theaters selling movie tickets after Covid,” he said Thursday night.\n\nWhile Melania has been released with much fanfare, you wouldn’t know it from this New York theater, where it was competing with Academy Award-nominated Marty Supreme and Hamnet, alongside reruns of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \n\nThe 10:10 a.m. screening — never likely to be the busiest — was on the highest level of the four-storey complex. Promotional posters for Melania were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe first lady is said to be pocketing more than 70 percent of the $40 million Amazon paid to license the film, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was directed by Brett Ratner, the disgraced Hollywood director behind Rush Hour, who first met the Trumps in 2011. He hopes, it’s been reported, that this film will be his big comeback moment following a string of sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, which he denies and has not been charged over.\n\nWhile much has been made in the film of the first lady’s inauguration day “Hamburglar” hat; the golden eggs filled with caviar that guests were served at a banquet on the eve of the ceremony; and several mentions of how tall Barron is, the so-called documentary also serves as a vehicle to promote the MAGA-Trump agenda. \n\nMelania was paid as an executive producer and given direct control over everything in the film’s editorial content, culminating in a product that provides viewers with a narrow window into the “reality” of what kind of first lady she planned to be the second time around.\n\nMuch of the film focuses on the first lady’s messages of “unity” and “humanity,” themes that now jar with scenes that have played out in Minnesota, and other U.S. states, over the past year as a result of the president’s anti-immigration operation. \n\n“The weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant ... is a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,” Melania says in the film. “No matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.” \n\nThere are glimmers of causes that the first lady admires. There is a brief video call with First Lady of France Brigitte Macron, where the women share their concerns about the harms of social media on children, and Melania touts her “Fostering the Future” initiative. \n\nBut the second half of the film focuses on behind-the-scenes-style footage - the buildup to and of inauguration day - where the viewer learns nothing new.\n\nDuring one of the glitzy inaugural banquets, there are glimpses of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the president’s former “first buddy” Elon Musk — a reminder of the role Big Tech has played in the making of the film and bankrolling other parts of the Trump administration’s agenda, such as his new ballroom, and donating to the inauguration itself.\n\nThere are a couple of not-so-subtle digs at Democrats. A shot of former Vice President Kamala Harris checking her watch during the inauguration was included, footage of the Trumps waving at the Bidens as they depart the White House aboard Marine One, and a portrait of former President Barack Obama in the White House that has since been moved to a hidden stairwell. \n\nThe movie is packed with flashy shots of Mrs Trump jetting between her home in the gold-plated Trump Tower penthouse in New York City and Mar-a-Lago. \n\nThe occasional interactions between the first lady and the president — including one where she cannot get him off the phone quickly enough and cuts him short with a “Congrats” after he calls to brag about election results — also shed no further light on their marriage.\n\nAt the end, Boney. M’s Sunny accompanies footage of Melania posing for her official portraits as first lady, with the lyrics “the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here” playing.\n\nWhatever the first lady’s vision was for a “unifying” a second term, it’s clear that the nation is more divided than ever.","summary":"There were 20-odd people in Auditorium 10 of AMC 34th Street 14 in New York City to watch the morning screening of Melania – most of whom were journalists, writes Rhian Lubin","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/melania-trump-movie-ticket-sales-new-york-b2911226.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/30/21/27/Premiere-of-Melania-at-the-Kennedy-Center-for-the-Performing-Arts-in-Washington-ohhhob8e.jpeg?crop=4641,3094,x429.5,y0&trim=0,430,0,429&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/luqaBorb-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-30 21:38:17","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":397852950,"title":"The ‘Melania’ Reviews Are Scathing: “Two Hours of Endless Hell”","text":"Skip to main content\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 1:13pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump calls children while taking part in the NORAD Santa Tracker on Christmas Eve at the Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 24.\n\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nCan anybody be entirely impartial when reviewing Melania?\n\nPerhaps not. The Amazon MGM documentary about the first lady directed by scandal-plagued filmmaker Brett Ratner with a whopping $75 million price tag (or “bribe,” as Jimmy Kimmel called it) provokes all sorts of feelings — regardless of one’s political leanings — before you even enter the theater.\n\nBut reviews are rolling in just the same, and below are samples of some of the (almost entirely scathing) critiques. Melania is billed as an inside look at Donald Trump‘s partner as she prepared to return to the White House during the 20 days before the 2025 inauguration. The film is rolling out into more than 1,500 theaters across the U.S. this weekend, and its box office returns are being closely watched as a political barometer of sorts.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSelling 'Melania': Brett Ratner and the First Lady Discuss the Making of Their Controversial $75 Million Amazon Doc\n\n'Melania' Review: Brett Ratner's Melania Trump Documentary Is an Unabashed, Fly-on-the-Gilded-Wall Fawn Job\n\nThe reviews below are coming out just as the film is hitting the screens. Mainstream press were reportedly blocked from attending the film’s premiere at the Kennedy Center on Thursday. While screenshots of theaters with unsold seats have been circulating on social media, tracking service NRG has predicted a launch in the $5 million range — which would be enormously successful for a documentary. Exhibitors are less certain, however.\n\nHere are some of the early critiques:\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: “This is a film that fawns so lavishly over its subject that you feel downright unpatriotic not gushing over it … The expensive propaganda doc is glossily shot and lushly scored, although for some reason Ratner keeps inserting segments shot on what looks like Super 8 film, as if to infuse the Trumps with some of that Kennedy-era aura. Before the film ends with onscreen graphics listing Melania’s achievements as first lady in such laudatory fashion that North Korea would blush, she’s shown posing for her official portrait. Doing her best to look both sexy and authoritative, she seems most in her element.”\n\nThe Atlantic called the film “a disgrace,” saying, “Ratner seems desperate to find action, but there is none. The pace is stultifying … Mostly, Ratner captures his subject walking from liminal place to liminal place in five-inch heels, the camera trailing her like a lap dog … Melania the movie isn’t a documentary; it’s a protection racket. It’s a reminder that the richest people in the world are investing in entertainment brands not because they care about art but because the public does, and because all of these vanity projects and capitulations are a way to consolidate their own power and fortune.”\n\nThe Guardian: “Ratner’s film plays like a gilded trash remake of Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest in which a button-eyed Cinderella points at gold baubles and designer dresses, cunningly distracting us while her husband and his cronies prepare to dismantle the Constitution and asset-strip the federal government … the fun’s not infectious and the guests are a nightmare, and two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast: “I don’t want to blow anyone’s minds here or throw you off your balance when I inform you the Melania documentary is terrible. Were it not for scattered laughter-inducing scenes — most of which, I would gather, were not intentionally humorous — I would rule it an abomination.”\n\nVariety: “It feels like it’s been stitched together out of the most innocuous outtakes from a reality show. There’s no drama to it. It should have been called Day of the Living Tradwife … Its very existence is a pure expression of that control. By the time Melania arrives at the Inaugural festivities, the film has given itself over to a series of rituals (the candlelight dinner, the Inaugural itself, the luncheon, the Starlight Ball), which feels weirdly fitting since the filmmaking itself is so ritualized. It never lets the air of experience in.”\n\nThe London Evening Standard gave the film its only positive review so far (thus ensuring Melania will not have a 0 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes): “If you take this film for what it is, Melania’s own, curated take on herself, then there’s one thing she wants to get across, it’s that there’s human warmth there under the cheekbones and the slanting feline eyes. May I say right now she looks extraordinary for 55? … Is the film worth $40 million? I can’t see it myself, except for the shot of Kamala Harris at the inauguration, which is worth the entrance ticket … She’s a phenomenon. What, exactly, is her relationship with Trump, who was effusive about, ‘my beautiful wife’? We don’t know. The enigma remains.”\n\nThe Independent: “To call Melania vapid would do a disservice to the plumes of florid vape smoke that linger around British teenagers. She calls herself a ‘mother, wife, daughter, friend,’ yet is only depicted preening and scowling … Trump himself is an instantly more charismatic presence on screen. His scenes offer a relief from Melania’s mask of pure nothingness … It will exist as a striking artifact — like The Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will — of a time when Americans willingly subordinated themselves to a political and economic oligopoly.”\n\nMore to come.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBox Office: ‘Melania’ Pacing for $8 Million Opening Weekend\n\nSundance Film Festival Reviews\n\n‘If I Go Will They Miss Me’ Review: Lyrical Dreams and Bittersweet Reality Collide in a Moving, Gorgeously Imagined Father-Son Drama\n\nMelania Trump\n\n‘Melania’ Review: Brett Ratner’s Melania Trump Documentary Is an Unabashed, Fly-on-the-Gilded-Wall Fawn Job\n\nSundance Film Festival reviews\n\n‘Frank & Louis’ Review: Kingsley Ben-Adir and Rob Morgan Bring Transcendent Grace to Prison Drama About Dignity and Compassion\n\nsundance 2026\n\nChanning Tatum and Gemma Chan-Starrer ‘Josephine’ Wins Two Top Awards at Sundance\n\nThe Oscars Are Giving Serious ’70s Vibes\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2026 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

That, for whatever honest artistic or nefarious political reasons, is what Amazon has paid for the rights to distribute Melania, the new documentary – the most expensive ever made – charting the 20 days before Melania Trump’s return to the White House in 2025, and how the enigmatic First Lady seeks to “reinvent”, “elevate” and “break old norms” of the job of being Donald Trump’s wife.\n\nMelania has been controversial from the moment it was announced. There’s the money – with an additional $35m budget for marketing – and the obvious fact that the project, with 55-year-old Melania herself serving as executive producer, is shameless propaganda.\n\nThere’s the unconscionable choice of director Brett Ratner, of Rush Hour fame, who has been excommunicated from Hollywood since six women accused him of sexual assault allegations in 2017 (no charges were brought). And there are the rumours of unrest on the production itself: Amazon mandated that no staff could opt out of the project for political reasons, two-thirds have reportedly removed their names from the credits, and many have made complaints about Ratner’s on-set behaviour.\n\nIt has been secretive – no advance press screenings have been held. The box office sales have reportedly been “soft” in the UK, despite Donald Trump’s insistence otherwise on Truth Social. At the showing I went to, four people in the seven-strong audience were journalists. \n\nAnd the timing could not be worse. The United States is a country in turmoil, with Trump threatening to take over Greenland and two people fatally shot by federal forces in Minnesota amid mass protests of an immigration crackdown. This glitzy documentary is simultaneously in horrible bad taste, and a news event promising to shed light on one of the most powerful women in the world.\n\nFor a few moments, as Melania’s opening scene swept us over the beach at Mar-a-Lago and zoomed in on a snakeskin Louboutin stiletto with Mick Jagger wailing along to “Gimme Shelter”, I was afraid that Ratner might have delivered a work of glamorous, self-aware high camp that I might have to report I enjoyed.\n\nThis was swiftly kiboshed, however, as Melania’s voiceover – as monotone as her wardrobe – kicked in. She introduces herself “navigating the complexities of life” and takes us into a suite at Trump Tower overlooking Central Park, as she and a group of sycophantic seamstresses compare different shades of navy blue.\n\nWhat follows are a series of loose and mostly unconnected diary events from January 2024. Melania is fitted for a ballgown; Melania assesses the champagne coupes for a candlelit dinner and the “beautiful shades of greige” for the White House interiors; Melania hires her new staff; Melania has a Zoom call with Brigitte Macron about “children” – all while explaining how detail-oriented and fashion conscious and focused on her initiatives she is.\n\nIf there was any reflection whatsoever into the messages she intends to project with her fashion, how she feels about hosting thousands of people at official events, how and why she has redecorated the White House, what she looks for in the team around her and what she expects them to do, or the reasons behind her chosen philanthropic causes, this might threaten to be a film of substance. Alas it – beautifully shot, and with a killer soundtrack featuring Spandau Ballet, Tears for Fears, and Michael Jackson, Melania’s favourite – is all style. (The only takeaway about her style is that she likes the colours black and white.)\n\nWe travel on Trump Force One as the Slovenian-born former model jets between New York, Washington and Mar-a-Lago, which she calls her “refuge from the outside world”. Watching this, in which opulence is everywhere, it is very difficult to imagine she was ever in it.\n\nThe real world is ignored, with some vulgarity, but when reality does encroach, it is with detachment: she watches the California wildfires on TV with sympathy from a luxuriant sofa (it may as well be an ivory tower), attends the funeral of Jimmy Carter and is reminded of her own mother’s death a year before, and meets a freed Israeli hostage, Aviva Siegel, fighting for her husband Keith to be released from Gaza.\n\nThat scene is moving and as emotional as Melania gets – Trump helped secure her husband’s rescue days after he was sworn in – and Melania displays warmth and compassion in the face of raw distress. But you would have to be a monster not to. Nowhere else do we see her bond, there is no suggestion of any friendships, we don’t see anything candid or vulnerable or even, really, human.\n\nWhich is not to say she comes across as badly as she quite obviously must be, given her marriage – she seems nice, composed, and articulate – she is just not interested in letting anyone in. Even in the long sequence at St Patrick’s Cathedral, as she pays tribute to her late mother and discusses her ongoing grief, she does not share details about what she was like or display emotion of any kind.\n\nThis is true of the whole film, which – instead of a personal portrait or a reflection on her experiences in the White House and how they changed her, how she feels about a second term, her nerves about the inauguration and returning to a life of duty – is really a string of platitudes. About America, about her husband, about fallen soldiers, about the momentousness of returning to the White House, about the immigrant experience.\n\nIn Washington she “felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant” (given the anger and despair of American immigrants at the moment, this feels especially crass). At Arlington National Cemetery she is humbled by the servicemen and women defending her rights and reminded that we are all “bound by humanity”. Inauguration Day was “so rich with meaning”.\n\nThose of us who watched news coverage of the day are forced to relive much of that rich meaning again here, with a bonus shot of Kamala Harris checking her watch. Each moment of that 22-hour media opp, Melania insists, was “filled with historic purpose”. Conspiracy theorists who accuse her of being a body double or dead will have to concede that from the way this woman speaks, it is obvious she has spent several decades around the bluster of Donald Trump. Whom, if it wasn’t obvious enough, we learn little about.\n\nWe see one conversation in which he drones on and she tries to get him off the phone, another in which she wryly offers edits for his inaugural speech (which he reluctantly takes). I did enjoy hearing them catch up about 19-year-old Barron, the president revealing “I love him, he’s cute, we have cute conversations” to his wife, as if discussing a neighbour’s toddler rather than their own nearly adult son.\n\nMelania is worse than a bad film – it’s a boring one. A documentary must have failed its subject if you come away less curious about them than before, and I found myself much more interested in the people around the First Lady, those desperate for proximity to her gilded cage, than the woman herself. The White House staff, the drivers, the stylists, the young women interviewing for jobs in the East Wing.\n\nA documentary also must have failed its subject if you wind up wanting to hear more from her husband. Which is the worst part of all: in the hope of comedy, in the hope of drama, in the hope of a twist, I watched Melania and found myself wishing there had been more of Donald Trump.\n\nMelania is in cinemas now","url":"https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/melania-trump-reveals-nothing-gross-glitzy-ropaganda-4202678","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SEI_278362803.jpg?crop=356px%2C21px%2C844px%2C476px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:42:39","author":"Sarah Carson","authors":["Sarah Carson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":397855152,"title":"What’s a ‘Yinzer’? Our reporters’ roundtable with Gov. Josh Shapiro.","text":"Reporters packed the room Thursday for a Monitor Breakfast event with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. And there were plenty of national issues to discuss – immigration raids, political violence, rising antisemitism.\n\nBut when a reporter introduced herself as having “Pittsburgh roots,” Governor Shapiro couldn’t resist going local.\n\n“Great, another Yinzer!” he said, using Pittsburgh slang for a city resident. “Are you still a Steelers fan?”\n\nYes, she assured him. “Stillers,” Mr. Shapiro threw in, again shifting to Pittsburghese. (He’s from Philadelphia, but is apparently bilingual.)\n\nThe governor is on a book tour, promoting his memoir, “Where We Keep the Light.” The book paints a self-portrait of a man who’s all about his family, his Jewish faith, and “getting stuff done.”\n\nBut for the media, the interest is all about 2028 and the widely held assumption that Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, will run for president. At a time of deep national division, he prides himself on his ability to work across the aisle.\n\nStill, ask Mr. Shapiro straight up if he’s running, as the reporter from Pittsburgh did, and he demurs. Because he has to. He’s up for reelection this November, and while he’s strongly favored to win, the midterm elections are on a razor’s edge – both for control of the U.S. Congress and his state legislature. Pennsylvania is the nation’s biggest swing state, and he enjoys high approval ratings.\n\n“I don’t think we should be thinking about anything other than curtailing the chaos, the cruelty, and the corruption of this administration,” Mr. Shapiro says, as quoted in the Monitor’s coverage.\n\nBut the governor’s book did make waves earlier this month, pre-release, when a reporter got an advance copy and highlighted the controversy over his vetting by Kamala Harris’s team for the vice-presidency in 2024. Mr. Shapiro expressed upset over this question: “Have you ever been an agent for the Israeli government?”\n\nIn the book, Mr. Shapiro cries antisemitism. The issue of vetting came up last week in our Monitor Breakfast event with another prominent Jewish Democrat, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Mr. Emanuel expressed sympathy with both sides, saying the question was “not artful, but you have to ask.” Yet another top Jewish Democrat, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, also defended the process as “tough” but necessary.\n\nNotably, all three men are widely viewed as eyeing the presidency. And thus the issue of rising antisemitism could be a dominant theme in 2028. Indeed, the night before our roundtable with Mr. Shapiro, a motorist rammed his car multiple times into a major Jewish institution, the Chabad-Lubavitch world headquarters, in Brooklyn, New York. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nIn fact, I told Mr. Shapiro after our event had ended, I have personally experienced antisemitism. I have received nasty emails from people who assume I’m Jewish, I said. “Lovely, just forward them to me,” Mr. Shapiro responded.\n\nOn a lighter note, in our post-roundtable chit-chat, we got back to the subject of football. The night before, while doing a book event in Boston, Mr. Shapiro mentioned visiting with Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who is also working to fight antisemitism. My ears perked up.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” I said, “but I’m from Boston. Go Pats!”\n\nAfter several bad years, the Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Mr. Shapiro was gracious, given that his hometown Philadelphia Eagles, who won the Super Bowl last year, won’t repeat.\n\n“I lived through those lean years with the birds, with the Eagles,” the governor said, “and so it’s kind of neat to see them [the Patriots] as good as they are.”","summary":"Josh Shapiro’s book tour may be laying the groundwork for a presidential run.

But for a documentary about the lead-up to President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, the commander in chief stays very much in the periphery.\n\nHere are the most noteworthy moments of the film, which is executive produced by the first lady and directed by disgraced Hollywood filmmaker Brett Ratner:\n\nPresident Trump jokes that Melania is ‘very difficult’ but an ‘incredible’ first lady\n\nTrump only appears a handful of times throughout “Melania.” Early in the movie, he can be heard in voiceover as she chats with him on the phone. “Hi, honey,” he says, to which she responds, “Hi, Mr. President.” He calls the election results “a big win,” adding that he won the popular vote in a landslide and had not anticipated such high numbers.\n\nLater, he greets Melania as she gets off the plane in Washington, kissing her on the cheek as he says she looks “very beautiful” like “a movie star.”\n\nThe few occasions that Trump does speak to the film cameras, it’s to compliment his wife. “She’s the most incredible first lady … She’s very difficult, but there’s nobody like her,” Trump says with a laugh, adding that she’s “not difficult” before bidding her goodnight.\n\nDonald Trump wonders why his inauguration has to ‘compete’ with football\n\nDuring a visit to their Florida home of Mar-a-Lago, Trump and Melania meet with staffers to nail down Inauguration Day plans. His team tells him that he’ll be riding with President Joe Biden to the U.S. Capitol on the day. “That’ll be an interesting drive,” Trump says with a smirk.\n\nThe couple proceeds to ask questions about their safety, as well as why the College Football Playoff national championship game between Ohio State and Notre Dame is being broadcast on Inauguration Day.\n\n“We have to compete with the championship? How did that happen?” Trump queries, adding “I think they did that on purpose.”\n\nIn that same exchange, he looks at a photo from his 2017 inauguration, where Melania wore a sky-blue Ralph Lauren dress with matching gloves. Trump then turns to Melania and asks, “You have a good dress? You have a nice dress? This one blew everyone away.” He asks if her 2025 inauguration outfit can compete, to which she laughs. \n\nBarron Trump is mostly MIA during the 'Melania' movie\n\nBarron has largely stayed out of the spotlight during both of his father’s presidential terms, and he is now in his second year at New York University.\n\nOn the rare occasions that he does appear in the documentary, he is filmed from the back or in side profile, save for a shot of him waving to the crowd during an inauguration celebration at Capital One Arena in Washington, which is soundtracked by “It’s a Man’s, Man’s, Man’s World” by James Brown & the Famous Flames.\n\n“Barron is a very confident young man,” Melania says in voiceover, adding that he got “quite the reception” at the event. At other points in the film, she praises her son for having a good head on his shoulders, explaining that she’s excited to see him forge his own path and start a family one day.\n\nMelania Trump does the ‘YMCA,’ sings along to Michael Jackson\n\nAs noted, “Melania” is short on genuine insight into the first lady and her duties. The film briefly features both virtual and in-person meetings with Queen Rania of Jordan, France’s first lady Brigitte Macron, and freed Israeli hostage Aviva Siegel, as Melania gets involved with various humanitarian causes.\n\nShe speaks broadly in platitudes about serving the American people and leading with love: “I’ll move forward with purpose,” Melania says at the end of the film. “And, of course, a sense of style.”\n\nThe few times that we really get to see the more human side of Melania are while she dances and half-sings along to both Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” and Village People’s “YMCA.” at various points. She laughs at a CNN inauguration broadcast, as the anchors marvel at how tall Barron is. (He is 6-foot-9, to be fair.)\n\nAnd although she doesn’t cry, per se, Melania appears visibly emotional during one scene as she watches news coverage of last year’s Los Angeles wildfires. \n\nDonald Trump chats with President Joe Biden, pats him on the shoulder\n\nA handful of famous faces appear throughout the documentary, including tech giants Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg at different inaugural events, as well as Trump’s presidential opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, during the ceremony itself. None of them are heard speaking in the film.\n\nBiden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, also appear a few times, as they pose for a picture with the Trumps on Inauguration Day. Before boarding Air Force One, Trump looks back at Biden and gives him a tap on the shoulder, and the two men can be seen chatting by the helicopter outside the U.S. Capitol.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/30/melania-movie-trump-documentary-revelations/88361149007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/29/USAT/88415363007-20250120-t-195040-z-710889320-rc-2-udca-9-nxpd-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpinauguration.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6272,3528,x419,y277&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:15:28","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.215},{"id":397817794,"title":"Nevada's first-in-the-nation primary bid gets boost from Latino Victory","text":"An influential Latino political group is arguing that Nevada should be the first state to vote in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, directly challenging New Hampshire's traditional claim on the first-in-the-nation primary. CBS News has learned that Latino Victory is endorsing Nevada's push as national Democrats consider which states should have the earliest â and likely most influential â say in who the party's next presidential nominee is, after stark setbacks in the 2024 presidential election. \"Maintaining the status quo or prioritizing less diverse states like New Hampshire would be a disadvantage to our party's presidential nominee,\" Katharine Pichardo, the president and CEO of Latino Victory said in a letter directed to influential DNC members. \"Bottom line: Nevada is a diverse battleground that will produce a battle-tested nominee â and that is exactly what Democrats need at this moment to win back the White House.\" The show of support for Nevada's bid comes as the state continues on a collision course with New Hampshire and South Carolina. Internal party documents show they're also competing to be the first state to kick off the Democrats' 2028 presidential primary season. Being among the first states carries enormous influence, with candidates often frequenting those chosen with campaign events and showering them with money and attention that can help bolster party building efforts and build support among voters. The debate may seem esoteric, given the party brand issues Democrats have contended with and the fact that the 2028 election is still years away. But which states Democrats christen with the first positions in the political calendar could prove to be pivotal in the future identity of the party. The Democratic Party's primary calendar has been a point of contention in recent years. Standards had long held that the Iowa caucuses would start the season, while New Hampshire would have the first primary. South Carolina, with its deeply influential base of Black voters, was given an early state slot starting with the 2008 cycle, as was Nevada. But the relative lack of racial diversity in Iowa and New Hampshire, and a chaotic Iowa Caucus finish in 2020, led the party to overhaul its calendar for the 2024 cycle. Those changes jettisoned Iowa, put South Carolina first and led to a standoff with New Hampshire â which ended up holding a primary not sanctioned at the time by the party. Democrats are now rethinking the calendar once again, following a 2024 election that saw GOP President Trump win all seven of the nation's presidential battleground states, including Nevada. Nationwide in the 2024 election, Trump narrowly trailed former Vice President Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, a shift towards the president that represented a major improvement from his past runs for the White House. Federal census data shows in Nevada, more than 30% of the population is Hispanic or Latino. Four or five states will be picked by Democratic leaders to have their respective 2028 nominating contests before Super Tuesday. Regional considerations are key here: one state each will be picked from the East, Midwest, South and West. The party's influential rules and bylaws panel is expected to start considering the applications at a Saturday meeting in Puerto Rico. Under its own longstanding state law, New Hampshire attempts to have the first presidential primary in the country. In a pitch to DNC members, New Hampshire's Democratic party argued the state \"serves as a critical testing ground for whether candidates can attract independent votersâan issue that couldn't be more pressing for the Democratic Party nationally.\" \"Moreover, the state's importance to winning the general election cannot be overstated: it was the closest state that Vice President Harris won in 2024, and history reminds us that had Al Gore won New Hampshire in 2000, which he lost by just over 7,000 votes, he would have been president regardless of Florida's outcome,\" the document reads. Whether DNC members follow that thought process remains to be seen. Meanwhile South Carolina, which then-President Joe Biden helped vault to the top slot for the 2024 cycle after voters in the state essentially saved his 2020 presidential primary campaign, remains incredibly influential in Democratic politics. \"South Carolina offers the Democratic Party a proven, disciplined, and consequential first test of presidential candidates, one grounded in the voters who are the backbone of the Democratic coalition and in the real-world demands of building majorities,\" the state's Democratic party said in their initial pitch this year. Nevada has been working for months to try and become the first 2028 presidential primary state for Democrats. State party officials have also received support from Somos Votantes, a large national Latino organizing group. \"The primary calendar shapes whose voices get to be heard first, so the order of the states in the presidential primary directly affect which voters candidates are forced to listen to early and then consistently,\" said Melissa Morales, founder and president of Somos Votantes. \"Any process that fails to center Latinos early risks repeating mistakes of past cycles.\"Documents reviewed by CBS News show that Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, New Mexico, Delaware, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia have started making pitches to the DNC to be among the first four or five states to hold 2028 nominating contests. Amid this debate, there are clear tensions among Democrats about how to address the left's stumbles in the 2024 presidential election, when Democrats lost the White House, Senate and failed to retake the House. The latest stage of the national party's work on the primary calendar comes weeks after a highly scrutinized decision by DNC chairman Ken Martin to not publicly release a full report centered on the 2024 election cycle. The party of the incumbent president usually faces congressional losses in the midterms, and the Republican Party under President Donald Trump is already facing that prospect this fall. But even a successful midterm cycle for Democrats doesn't necessarily inoculate them from struggles and challenges in 2028. The fear of an outcome like the 2024 election is a dynamic that haunts the party's longer-view outlook. Setting the 2028 primary calendar could represent one of the first major signals about how the party is addressing its setbacks in the last presidential election. \"We know that the Democratic electorate is becoming more and more diverse with Latinos being the fastest growing demographic,\" Pichardo, the Latino Victory leader, told CBS News in an interview. \"If Democrats are serious about winning back the working class, Latino, African-American, and AAPI voters, Nevada should be the first as it is a microcosm of America.\"","summary":"Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina are vying to be the first state to vote in the 2028 Democratic presidential primaries.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nevadas-first-in-the-nation-primary-bid-gets-boost-latino-victory/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/30/e3f1583f-bf8b-4b05-a1c3-bd045b18afec/thumbnail/1200x630/9ca0e80adc169dc83ae53d64a5aca432/gettyimages-1986211188.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 19:00:00","author":"Hunter Woodall,Nidia Cavazos","authors":["Hunter Woodall","Nidia Cavazos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.135},{"id":397806962,"title":"Melania film review: She's not Princess Di but she wants us to know she cares","text":"It’s the heels you see first…vertiginous white stilettos. Then the front of the shoes… leopardskin with a red trim. Eventually the camera moves up and there’s a striking white cotton dress, nipped in waist, full skirt. Then a shot of Melania from the back. And only in the limousine do you see Melania full-on, almost smiling. \n\nThat’s the big reveal in this film. The enigma smiles, she actually does. Her face in repose looks closed, but that, I think, is the Balkan look. If you take this film for what it is, Melania’s own, curated take on herself, then there’s one thing she wants to get across, it’s that there’s human warmth there under the cheekbones and the slanting feline eyes. May I say right now she looks extraordinary for 55? \n\nShe thanks the staff who say goodbye at Mar-a-Lago, and she seems genuinely glad to see everyone at the White House when she gets back there. She’s plainly a friend of her designer, Herve Pierre - they talk shop about her dress. She hugs a former Israeli hostage after she sobs in front of her and admires the picture of her husband, Keith, on her t-shirt. She goes to the Arlington memorial and thinks about the families of the boys that were lost in the Afghan withdrawal. She’s not Princess Di, but she wants us to know she cares. She has herself filmed at the back of her limousine singing along – though we don’t really hear what her voice is like – to Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. At the second of the three balls on inauguration night, she lets herself go a bit to YMCA, and jives just a little, momentarily like the flirty teenager she once must have been, before returning to her default reserve.\n\nThis is, remember, all her own work, or at least as mediated by Brett Ratner, the producer (who has a lot to thank her for in rehabilitating him after some years in the Holly wood doghouse), so what we see is what she wants us to see. And at the front of what she gives us is a devoted daughter. She attends with Donald the funeral of the former president, Jimmy Carter, but it’s the first anniversary of her mother Amalija’s death, and she’s still mourning. She tells us “I think about her every day”. She’s impassive in black at Washington cathedral, but it’s her own mother she’s thinking about. \n\nAfter she returns to New York, she makes a trip – “some time by myself” – to St Patrick’s Cathedral to light a candle (actually a few) for her mother. She stands before the high altar silently – she’s meant to genuflect, bend the knee, but it may be tricky in those heels to get up again- and we can only surmise what her own relationship with God is. One of the two beaming clerics at the entrance, who are plainly loving all this, offers to bless her as she leaves, and she says, yes, that would be nice. But she doesn’t cross herself. She tells them, “My mother came here often when she was in New York”, and that’s why she’s there. She gets her father, Viktor, to pay tribute to the nearly 60 years the couple spent married. “My parents’ marriage was an example of life-long love,” she says, which puts her own union with Trump into a new perspective. Slovenia, her country of birth, as she puts it, gets a look in with the Slovene crystal coupes at the dinner.\n\nWhat you also get from the off is a sense of her steely self discipline. She puts us in our place at the off by saying that her architecture degree (she left university after a few months, but no matter) means that she has an eye for symmetry, but she insists more than once on her “artistic vision”. That means in practice an awful lot of work on the detail of the official entertainments for the inauguration…we see her consultant, at one point, unveiling a big reveal in tissue paper. What can it be? It’s the official invitation for the inauguration ball. “Red. Your colour,” he breathes. “It’s beautiful, she murmurs. And when it comes to the entertainments, she’s on that too: caviar in gold eggs. Really.\n\nShe put in, she tells us, a lot of work from her teenage years into her career as a model. If you factor into that her mother’s job as a tailor/dressmaker, it’s plain she doesn’t regard being a clotheshorse as something rather shameful. We see a lot of the discussion that goes into the making of her outfits. Pierre Herve is a class act; “She’s very different”, he tells us, because she knows what she’s talking about. “My mother taught me” she says, “That it’s all about the discipline of the craft”. And so we find her talking about the width of her lapels for the inauguration outfit, or asking for her skirt to be closer at the hip (my God) with the eye of an expert. She’s not ashamed of it because she knows the work that goes into it.\n\nBut she also wants us to know, because she tells us, that she has remade the role of the First Lady. We see her talking about screen time with Brigitte Macron – polished, in brown leather jacket – on Zoom. We see her face to face with Queen Rania of Jordan, about her special project, care for children in foster care, and they promise to work together. She gives, in the closing credits, an account of her achievements in the role: the banning of non consensual sexual images, the letter to President Putin that secured the release of kidnapped Ukrainian children, the release of that Israeli hostage (if only she’d met some Palestinians too, heaven knows what might have come from it); and the work for foster children. She’s done things, she wants us to know.\n\nIs the film worth $40 million? I can’t see it myself, except for the shot of Kamala Harris at the inauguration, which is worth the entrance ticket, but if Jeff Bezos and his millions are that easily parted, good luck to her. The greatest relief in the whole thing came when she actually took her heels off, after three balls, and, as she says, 22 hours without sleep. She’s a phenomenon. What, exactly, is her relationship with Trump, who was effusive about, “my beautiful wife”? We don’t know. The enigma remains.\n\nMelania is in cinemas now","summary":"This documentary - with a limited cinema release before it hits Amazon - follows America’s First Lady in the 20 days leading up to her husband’s second inauguration","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/melania-film-review-b1269002.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2026/01/30/6/23/Premiere-of-Melania-at-the-Kennedy-Center-for-the-Performing-Arts-in-Washington-qx6imi5w.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 18:18:17","author":"Melanie McDonagh","authors":["Melanie McDonagh"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.236},{"id":397819020,"title":"Opinion: California’s existential issues scare off top candidates for governor","text":"This commentary was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nCalifornia faces a half-dozen existential issues that threaten the state’s future economic and social well-being, and they have persistently defied attempts to resolve them over the last 25 years.\n\nThey are — in no particular order, and often intertwined — high living costs, high poverty levels, homelessness, a housing shortage, uncertain water supply and subpar public education outcomes. There are also a number of lesser issues, some being components of what I would consider the “Big 6,” such as a deficit-ridden state budget and a shaky and increasingly expensive power supply.\n\nGavin Newsom will vacate the office a year hence and probably run for president, leaving some issues slightly better, some slightly worse but all still unresolved.\n\nCollectively, they should dominate the agenda of those we will be electing to office this year, particularly the man or woman who emerges as the next governor. However, they continue to threaten the future because, in a state as large and complex as California, forging a civic and political consensus to resolve them is numbingly difficult.\n\nCould that be the reason why so many potentially viable candidates have decided not to make the run? Is this why the field remains so unsettled, even at such a relatively late point in the political cycle?\n\nCould it be that those who dropped out or never dropped in looked at the daunting array of potentially intractable issues they would face and concluded that failure would be their most likely fate?\n\nWe’ll never know for certain what unmotivated them, but the intriguing fact is that several of those who decided not to run would have potentially led the pack, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Rob Bonta, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla and Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso.\n\nThose still in the race are interesting in their own way, but none stands out as an obvious or natural frontrunner and their credentials tend to be on the thin side.\n\nCaruso, who ran a credible campaign for Los Angeles mayor four years ago, was the latest to take himself out of not only a campaign for governor but also one for mayor. He said he was “deeply disappointed to step back from an election I believe is so critical to California’s future.”\n\n“Though my name will not be on a ballot, my work continues,” Caruso said on X. “Public service does not require a title. It is, and always will be, my calling.”\n\nCaruso’s announcement came just a few days after Bonta, who had initially shunned a campaign for governor before saying he was weighing a run, finally announced that he would seek another term as attorney general.\n\nThat seemingly leaves just a field of second-tier candidates, as measured by standard political odds-making. In true 2026 fashion, as some drop out, others emerge as potential gubernatorial candidates.\n\nThe latest to do so is San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, a Democrat who has been a sharp critic of how Democrats in Sacramento, including Newsom, have been running things. On the day Bonta pulled the plug, Mahan let it be known that he was considering a run, and then officially announced his candidacy on Wednesday.\n\nMahan told the San Jose Mercury News that none of the remaining candidates had articulated a “clear and compelling” vision or the “bold and independent leadership” needed to tackle the state’s thorny problems, especially homelessness.\n\n“I see business as usual in Sacramento,” said Mahan, who was at the Capitol advocating for reforms aimed at making housing more affordable. “I don’t see anyone acting like it’s a crisis.”\n\nWith backing from Silicon Valley, Mahan could be a formidable contender for the state’s top-two primary in June.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.","summary":"Could it be that those who dropped out or never dropped in looked at the daunting array of potentially intractable issues they would face?","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2026/01/30/california-existential-issues-scare-off-gubernatorial-candidates/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1536%2C1024&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 18:00:00","author":"Dan Walters • CalMatters Columnist,Fred Greaves","authors":["Dan Walters • CalMatters Columnist","Fred Greaves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":397781918,"title":"'Washington Post' journalists plea to Bezos: Don't gut our newsroom","text":"When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013, the staff hailed him for rescuing it from mounting financial struggles. For years, the storied newspaper flourished as he invested in its journalism and business innovations.\n\nMore recently, the paper has lost tens of millions of dollars annually. And now Post reporters — by the scores — are writing letters and social media posts, appealing to Bezos not to eliminate their jobs.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed and find it contrary to what [Bezos] said at the time,\" former Post Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. tells NPR. \"There's been no announcement about this, no rationale about this. No vision for what the paper ought to be. I'm disturbed and surprised by that.\"\n\nWhile the Post has not made any public announcement, the letters speak to the bleak belief that layoffs are imminent.\n\n\"We are The Washington Post's international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper's global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts,\" one such appeal read. \"Our coverage — thanks to your investment — shapes conversation and global policy at the highest levels each day.\"\n\nAt full force, the current newsroom stands at just shy of 800 journalists. Union members say they have been warned the newsroom could lose anywhere from 100 to 300 people, though that higher figure could also include employees who work outside the newsroom.\n\nWarned about assignments, encouraged to job hunt\n\nThis story is based on interviews with 10 current and former Post staffers drawn from both the newsroom and the business side of the paper. The Post declined detailed requests to comment.\n\nThe silence about the paper's future from Bezos and Chief Executive and Publisher Will Lewis has further damaged trust, Post editors, reporters and business-side staffers said. They spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of putting their jobs in jeopardy.\n\nThe fact the letters are directed to Bezos reflects the journalists' lack of faith in Lewis, according to six Post staffers. \n\nThey note that Bezos has not weighed in publicly to support Post reporter Hannah Natanson after her computers and other devices were seized by FBI agents over an investigation of a leak of national security documents. Even so, Lewis and Executive Editor Matt Murray have strongly supported her and the paper's attorneys are fighting in court to get the the Justice Department to return her materials. \n\nEditors are still asking reporters to break news and meet their deadlines, as they have done throughout the paper's 148-year history, which includes leading roles in covering the Pentagon Papers, the Watergate scandal, the Clinton impeachment, and the Trump years.\n\nYet they are also now offering some unusual guidance.\n\nOn the international desk, some editors have told correspondents not to accept some assignments that would take them to dangerous spots abroad after Sunday, according to three Post journalists with direct knowledge of events. The fear is that the reporters might be laid off while in personal peril.\n\nAdditionally, some editors on the foreign, metro and sports desks have quietly suggested to the journalists who work for them that they should seriously consider any outside job offers they receive.\n\nSports reporters were recently told to cancel plans to go to Italy to cover the Winter Olympics next week, even though the paper had put down a significant deposit to reserve work facilities and hotel rooms. Executive Editor Matt Murray relented and is sending a scaled-back team of four journalists, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday. \n\nCalls for Bezos to sell the Post\n\nThe paper went through buyouts in the newsroom in fall 2023 as part of company-wide job reductions. The business side experienced layoffs a year ago.\n\nThe Post Guild, which represents hundreds of newsroom employees, wrote in a public statement that it vehemently opposes any additional cuts.\n\nA new round of cutbacks \"only stands to weaken the newspaper, drive away readers and undercut the Post's mission: to hold power to account without fear or favor and provide critical insight into communities across the region, country, and world,\" the Guild wrote. \"If Jeff Bezos no longer supports that mission, then the Post and its readers deserve a steward who does.\"\n\nIn the years right after acquiring the paper, Bezos — the billionaire founder of Amazon — had embraced the Post's reportorial zeal. In 2017 the paper adopted the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" motto suggested by the paper's legendary Watergate reporter Bob Woodward.\n\nHe backed then-Executive Editor Marty Baron as a partner during the Post's aggressive coverage of President Trump's first term, despite increasing pressure from the administration and Trump himself.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Amazon alleged the Trump administration found a way to hit Bezos on the bottom line: the Pentagon awarded Microsoft a $10 billion cloud computing contract for which Amazon had been widely perceived as the leading bidder. The decision followed Trump's public criticism of Bezos. Court rulings led the Pentagon to settle Amazon's suit by splitting up the contract among four companies, including Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nTo this day, Bezos has never interfered in newsroom decisions, according to interviews with two dozen senior Post journalists over the years. But he has been silent on its future and fate for an extended period.\n\nBezos has a lot to keep him occupied. Besides his stake in Amazon, he owns several companies — including Blue Origin and the AI startup Project Prometheus — and he remarried last summer in a lavish, multi-day affair in Venice. Post journalists have questioned Bezos' commitment to the paper, particularly after he concluded Trump was likely to return to office well before the 2024 elections.\n\nSubscriptions are up, but the paper is losing tens of millions\n\nIn late 2023, Bezos named Lewis, who had edited the Telegraph in Britain and led Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal as chief executive, to lead the paper as CEO.\n\nLewis appealed not just because of his successful push for digital experimentation at the Journal, the British Telegraph and his own start-up, but because he had been a senior aide to two idiosyncratic conservatives: Murdoch and Boris Johnson when Johnson was prime minister. As NPR has previously reported, Bezos believed Lewis would be able to help the paper navigate Trump's return to office.\n\nLewis last held a town hall with staffers in June 2024, when he told them the paper had lost $100 million in 2022 and $77 million in 2023. Several people with knowledge of the company's finances say the losses spiked again last year. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they have not been authorized to speak about internal corporate matters. \n\nLewis has not met with the newsroom since that 2024 town hall, which coincided with intense scrutiny from NPR, the New York Times and the Post about questionable episodes in his journalistic past in the U.K. and his efforts to block coverage of it.\n\nWith much fanfare, Lewis has introduced several initiatives involving artificial intelligence. He has launched WP Ventures, promoting non-traditional journalism, and a free service compiling opinion pieces from other outlets to draw in new readers. Last year, the paper sold 675,000 subscriptions, its highest sales volume in five years, as first reported by the media newsletter Status.\n\nSo far, these measures have not adequately stemmed the red ink.\n\nA warm relationship with Trump\n\nIn late October 2024, Bezos killed a planned editorial endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. He argued that making presidential endorsements eroded trust with the broader public and said he was not doing so to advance his investments. \n\n\"While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight,\" Bezos wrote at the time. \"The stakes are too high... To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles. Some changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions. Criticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course. This is the way of the world.\"\n\nBezos later announced a new libertarian emphasis for the editorial page, which had been a center-left voice opposing many of Trump's assaults on democratic institutions. Bezos instead urged a focus on \"personal liberties and free markets.\"\n\nMore than 375,000 digital subscribers canceled over the twin changes, as NPR reported. The editorial page editor resigned and numerous columnists and reporters departed for other publications. Despite those defections, the Post has not let up on its vigorous coverage, including on the Ukraine-Russia war, the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's president, and the Trump administration.\n\nBezos has, meanwhile, struck up a working and warm relationship with the president.\n\nHe and his wife have dined with the Trumps at Mar-a-Lago; Amazon contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration last January and Bezos sat on the dais during the ceremony. The Amazon Prime streaming service paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported she is to receive the lion's share of that fee.\n\nAnd under the leadership of its new editor, Adam O'Neal, Bezos's editorial page has failed several times to cite his direct financial interests in the matters it opines about.\n\nUpon acquiring the Post, Bezos told its then-media reporter Paul Farhi that the paper was an important institution worth preserving for the nation.\n\n\"I don't want to imply that I have a worked-out plan,\" Bezos said. \"This will be uncharted terrain, and it will require experimentation.\"\n\n\"There would be change with or without new ownership,\" he said in the August 2013 interview. \"But the key thing I hope people will take away from this is that the values of The Post do not need changing. The duty of the paper is to the readers, not the owners.\"\n\nAmazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to deliver some of its content.","summary":"Members of the newspaper's union say they have been warned the company could cut as many as 300 jobs, although no announcement has been made.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/30/nx-s1-5692923/washington-post-bezos-layoffs","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x5504+0+0/resize/8256x5504!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F05%2F46d307854f77aded50ad6abbb591%2Fgettyimages-2221816293.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 17:00:00","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":397793374,"title":"Why We Already Know Year Two of Trump 2.0 Will Be Worse Than the First","text":"It was already a pretty weird week, what with Tulsi Gabbard—the official in charge of gathering foreign intelligence—showing up at a Georgia election office for an FBI raid. But then, on Thursday, the president of the United States filed a lawsuit that is an obvious shakedown of the government he runs. Donald Trump, his two older sons, and their business are suing the IRS and the Treasury Department for $10 billion for allowing a government contractor to gain access to their tax filings (the contractor later leaked the files to the press). It reads like a transparent attempt to steal a few billion dollars from the U.S. Treasury while he can get away with it.It’s an interesting twist of fate that the Gabbard raid and this lawsuit both dropped in the same week, because they actually go together quite well in the Venn diagram of Trumpian iniquity. Both developments prove a core point about our system that everybody had better learn and be prepared to act on after Trump leaves office (assuming that happy day comes): namely, that Trump has shown that a conscienceless and corrupt person can pollute the system in endless ways because previous generations never anticipated that someone this comprehensively conscienceless and corrupt could win high office. There simply aren’t laws that prohibit much of what he does because it never occurred to anyone that a holder of high public trust would ever even try such stuff.Let’s look first at this IRS suit, beginning with a little historical background. First of all, as The New York Times reported when it got the leaked documents, Trump paid no federal taxes in 10 of 15 years from 2004 to 2019. We don’t know that that was a crime; maybe it was just fancy accountants. But one way or the other, it sure isn’t right.But OK, they got leaked. That’s against the law. Of course, one could argue that the only reason they had to be leaked was that Trump refused to release his tax returns publicly, making him the first presidential candidate since Richard Nixon not to do so. Had he complied with that honorable custom—one that requires that people adhere not to a law but to a democratic norm of behavior—there would have been no leak.But fine. They were leaked. That’s illegal. And guess what? The guy who did it is in prison! He started serving a five-year sentence in May 2024. We can debate whether, in breaking that law, Charles Littlejohn in fact performed a public service (historical fact of note: Nixon’s returns also were leaked, and for that crime, no one was ever indicted). But Littlejohn broke a law, and he was convicted. The system, on paper, worked.For normal human beings, that would have been enough. Justice was served. But not for the Trumps. The slightest whiff of an opportunity to scam someone or someones—in this case, the taxpayers he was elected to serve—gets them salivating like hyenas over a springbok carcass. So now we have the unprecedented and frankly insane circumstance of the sitting president of the United States suing the government of the United States, over which he himself presides, trying to use his office to line his pockets. They’ll pick that carcass to the bone if they can.Now you might ask: Shouldn’t there be some kind of law preventing the president of the United States from suing the federal government, at least while he’s in office? I’m not a lawyer, so maybe there is some such law from 1856 or whatever, and someone will discover it. But assuming there’s not, I can tell you why there’s not: It never occurred to people that a president could be so petty and venal as to do something like this! Now let us turn to Gabbard. She has been sidelined for some time, ever since she made the error, fatal in Trumpworld, of saying something true to the factual record—that U.S. intelligence services saw no evidence that Iran was building a nuclear weapon. “I don’t care what she said,” Trump said at the time, “I think they were very close to having one.” More recently, she was frozen out of the action on Venezuela.So, needing a way to get back in Dear Leader’s good graces, she boned up on a topic that she knew would demonstrate her value: the “fraudulent” 2020 election. How can she possibly claim jurisdiction over this obviously domestic matter, many have been asking since this week’s raid? Well, she can’t, on real Earth. But on Trump Earth, you might recall that back in 2020, there were some wild conspiracy theories that involved foreign governments and intelligence agencies. Remember “Italygate”? I thought you might not. It never really gained traction among us flat-earthers. But it was a QAnon favorite for a while there, and it held that an Italian aerospace company and an Italian Army general worked with the American Embassy in Rome to use Italian satellites to remotely switch votes from Trump to Joe Biden. Yes, that is what they believed. Then there’s the China angle, which Trump was touting on social media just the other day. In case the Italygate story isn’t ominous enough for you, Trump tossed China into the mix. “China reportedly coordinated the whole operation,” he posted. “The CIA oversaw it, the FBI covered it up, all to install Biden as a puppet.” This is the stuff of mad dogs and March hares, to put it mildly. But if you’re Tulsi Gabbard, it’s ample reason to claim that a conspiracy this immense not only allows for the nation’s chief intelligence officer to be involved, it veritably demands it!So now we are about to launch—at the expense of the same taxpayers whose pockets la famiglia Trumpa is trying to pick in the IRS suit—into an investigation into “crimes” that are more than five years old (and thus likely beyond the statute of limitations) and were never committed anyway. But Trump wants people to go to jail, and Gabbard and Pam Bondi—who meanwhile is 41 days late delivering the Epstein files and thus in clear violation of federal law—will move heaven and earth to make sure someone does.Again, we might ask: Why is there no law preventing a president from using his government to pursue such obviously baseless revenge lawsuits? Because no one imagined a president would behave so sleazily. Or they thought that, if one did, surely Congress, regardless of party loyalty, would step up and assert its constitutional authority and make an unequivocal statement about what is right and wrong in a democratic society. Yeah. Right.So this is where we stand, as we begin this second year of the second Trump presidency. Three more years of this. It’s getting harder and harder to see how we survive it, but if we do, Congress is going to have to pass a bunch of laws that were never thought necessary until we elected a gangster as president.Editor’s PickSenate Democrats’ ICE Proposals Are a Huge and Inexcusable Whiff Most of the obvious reactions to Jack Smith’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday have already been delivered, and I agree with them. It’s hard to imagine what on earth Chairman Jim Jordan—and hearing his whiny, tinny, angry, lying voice awoke involuntary physiological reactions I’d spent years trying to vanquish—and the Republicans thought they were accomplishing. To any non-Kool-Aid-drinking American, they looked ridiculous. Smith was calm. The Republicans were jumping out of their skins competing to get their sound bite featured on Fox News. All they managed to do was to remind people that Donald Trump is a criminal and that in a sane world, the Senate would have convicted him on the second impeachment (the January 6 one) and barred him from holding federal office for life.I want to focus on one matter I’d forgotten all about. I’m thinking maybe you had too. That’s the question of this second volume of Smith’s report on Trump’s crimes, which focuses not on January 6 but on Trump’s theft of those classified documents he took down to Mar-a-Lago. It was written by Smith and his team back when the investigation was active. It is generally presumed to contain details about the matter that are heretofore unknown. Its release to the public was blocked by—speaking of memories I’d successfully repressed—Florida Judge Aileen Cannon. I trust you remember her track record here. She tossed the classified documents case in July 2024, ruling that Smith had been improperly appointed to his position as special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland. From the moment the case landed on her docket, Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, barely concealed her obvious partisanship in her actions, which brought her some jaw-dropping reprimands from the Eleventh Circuit Court, which employs her. She was a judicial joke. But she didn’t stop during the campaign. No! Once Trump was safely back in the White House, she ordered, on the second day of Trump’s second presidency, that the Department of Justice could not release the second volume of the Smith report (the first part had been released by Garland’s Justice Department the week before, in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency).A couple of nonprofit legal outfits sued. Cannon dragged her feet. She spent 2025 ignoring petitions from the two nonprofits that were seeking to get the volume released. Finally, last November, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit—which, by the way, included one Trump appointee—chastised Cannon’s delays and gave her 60 days to do something. The 60 days came and went at the beginning of this month, and—shocker—nothing happened. Then, as fate would have it, just this Monday, three days before Smith’s public testimony, the matter of the second volume vaulted back into the news as a lawyer for Trump filed a motion asking Cannon to permanently block the Justice Department, “as well as its current, former, and future officers, agents, officials, and employees” (note well: future officers!), from making the second volume public.Two points here. First, we have the rather odd spectacle of Trump, as Politico’s Kyle Cheney put it on Bluesky, “litigating in his personal capacity against the Justice Department he runs.” But of course the key word in the motion, as noted above, is “future.” If Cannon grants this motion and a Democrat wins the White House in 2028, even that future attorney general won’t be allowed to release Volume II.Second—about Trump’s lawyer. We’ve seen the basket of deplorables Trump has hired to defend either him or his government in court: Alina Habba, illegally installed as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, who resigned after a court disqualified her; Todd Blanche, still the number two at Justice, famous for his softball interview with Ghislaine Maxwell and for defending moving her to a cushier prison; Emil Bove, who while at Justice ordered the sleazy dropping of all charges against then–New York Mayor Eric Adams, which led to nearly a dozen resignations. Now we must add to that sorry menagerie a certain Kendra Wharton, who filed this week’s motion to Cannon. Who is Wharton? She was a white-collar criminal defense attorney in 2023 when Blanche announced that she and Bove would be joining Trump’s legal team to defend him against Smith’s charges. Later, when Trump took office the second time, he tapped Wharton to serve as the Justice Department’s senior ethics official. The prior one resigned after he was reassigned to a unit charged with cracking down on sanctuary cities. “Trump ethics official,” one suspects, is all we need to know about her.So let’s take a step back. Trump took thousands of documents, more than 300 marked classified, with him to Mar-a-Lago in 2021. For months, he rebuffed polite requests by the FBI to cooperate with an inquiry. Finally, they raided the place. Naturally, Trump turned this into a deep-state persecution, and his willing propagandists complied in pushing that lie.Then the roulette wheel of fate gave the case to the hackiest federal judge imaginable. She tossed the case. And she has spent her time since then making sure that the public never learns any more details about what Trump did. Next up, she’ll surely agree to the motion filed by a lawyer who played a willing role in helping Trump and Pam Bondi wreck the Justice Department.And even if somehow Cannon denies the motion and Volume II somehow gets released? Well, it’s Bondi who’ll decide how much of it we get to see!The Epstein files were supposed to be released in full on December 19. Bondi has done nothing. Volume II by rights should have been released some time last year. But Cannon did nothing. This is banana republic democracy, hiding corruption from public view while the president they’re all protecting seeks to destroy NATO and boost Vladimir Putin, and as he sends a quasi-gestapo force of ill-trained goons out into the streets of our cities to shoot people. And doing all they can to play along, as they showed us Thursday, are House Republicans, who’ll never stop debasing themselves in the race to prove to Trump which among them can be most servile.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

Then the Story Got Even Darker.Most Recent PostNext up for the very fine people of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement: Maine. President Donald Trump, in his\nspeech in Detroit Wednesday, signaled that the Pine Tree State was in his\nsights. Why? Well, no doubt partly because he’s never won the state in three\ntries (although he has carried the rural 2nd district each time, and Maine is\none of two states that awards electoral votes by congressional district). But\nmainly because Maine has something notable in common with Minnesota. Can you\nguess? Yep: a sizeable Somali population.“They’re scammers,” Trump said,\njust putting the plain old racism out there for all to see. “They always will\nbe, and we’re getting them out. In Maine, it’s really crooked as hell, too.” In\nresponse, Democratic Governor (and Senate candidate) Janet Mills released a video\nin which she made her position plain: “To the federal government, I say this:\nIf your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil\nrights of Maine residents, do not be confused. Those tactics are not welcome\nhere.” The key word there, of course, is “residents” (as opposed to\n“citizens”).The several thousand Somalis who\nhave settled in Maine since the 1990s are based chiefly in Portland and\nLewiston. They’ve been on alert since at least mid-December, when Trump\nreferred to Somalis as “garbage.” Hundreds of Mainers gathered\nat a December 15 rally in Lewiston to support the Somali population—who were\nnotably absent from the rally because, in the words of one Somali resident, “people\nwere afraid of, ‘OK, what if somebody shoots us, or something happens?’”As Americans, our minds are trained\nby involuntary habit to assume, when we see excess and violence, that the\ngovernment will step in and bring order. Things get a little crazy at a\nprotest, the cops break it up. Yes, there have been times when it’s the cops\nthemselves who incite violence, like in Chicago in 1968. But when that has\nhappened, the state has usually seemed at least a little sorry\nafterward.Certainly, there were and always\nare reactionary forces working to throttle such examinations, and sometimes\nthey succeed. But at least the impulse to investigate has generally been there.\nIndeed, a government commission appointed after the ’68 confrontations between\ncops and protesters during that year’s Democratic convention had a staff of 200\nconducting thousands of interviews; in its report, it actually used\nthe phrase “police riot.” That’s how things work in the United States—there\nexists a shared assumption that violence of that sort is undesirable, and that\nwhen it happens, some gesture toward accountability is what a democratic\nsociety requires. Well, there existed such\nassumptions. All that’s out the window now. Now the federal government is the\nunapologetic bringer of violence. And it’s further important to understand: No\namount of criticism, no amount of forensic or video evidence, no poll\nexpressing mass public disapproval will change this. In fact, precisely the\nopposite. Any and all criticism will just be taken by Trump and MAGA world as\nfurther proof that they are right. Evidence will be dismissed and countered\nwith fake “evidence,” like the video Vice President JD Vance trumpeted that\npurported to show that Renee Nicole Good had it coming. Bad-news polls will be\ndismissed as fake. The Trumpian state will dig in its heels. The only question\nStephen Miller will ask himself will be: How can we turn up the heat?This is what makes what’s happening\nin this country today different. The state is the perp. The government is\nbeyond the law. The United States is now closer to Bashar Al Assad’s Syria, or\nperhaps even today’s Iran, than to anything we recognize as fitting within the\nunderstood norms of American history. That’s a pretty big statement, I realize,\nbut it is not an exaggeration.True—the Trump administration isn’t\nkilling people by the thousands. It isn’t dropping those hideous barrel bombs\non its own people. But mentally, psychologically, we as a country are edging in\nthat direction. Until Minneapolis, I would have told you that as bad as Trump\nis, he’s not capable of ordering ICE agents to shoot people (citizens or not)\nat random, and that as bad as ICE is, they’d refuse such orders. Now I no\nlonger believe either of those things. This man and his government are clearly\ncapable of mass violence against immigrants and all who support them. It seems\nonly a matter of time now before some of these thuggish ICE agents, under\norders from the thug president, shoot some people down.Remember, ICE is still on a hiring\nspree. And it’s not simply that ICE is recruiting—it’s how they’re doing it,\nand what kind of recruits they’re targeting. Earlier this week, The Intercept reported\nthat just two days after Jonathan Ross executed Renee Good, the Department of\nHomeland Security posted a recruiting effort on Instagram using the phrase\n“We’ll Have Our Home Again.” The background music in the post was a song of the\nsame name by a group called Pine Tree Riots. The song’s lyrics, the story\nreported, have been cited by extremists and neo-Nazis in the past. According\nto the Southern Poverty Law Center, Pine Tree Riots “is a little-known a\ncappella group affiliated with the Mannerbund, which the [SPLC] has previously\nlisted as a white nationalist group.” The Pine Tree Riot was an uprising\nby some New Hampshire colonists against the British in 1772. The Pine Tree Flag\nhas recently been linked to Christian nationalism, and at least one was carried\nby January 6 insurrectionists. And more recently—just so you know how deeply\nMAGA marinates in this stuff—an official at the Department of Education had\none set up outside his office. It’s also the same flag that was spotted\noutside Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s vacation home a few years ago. And\nnow, ICE is using if not the flag itself then the same far-right sentiment it\nevokes to recruit people to whom it is, after the most minimal training\npossible, handing masks and Glock 19s.And Trump himself? Soon, in\nMinnesota or somewhere, he will invoke the Insurrection Act against the will of\nlocal elected officials and send in the military. It’s hard to say where that\nwill lead. But no place good. Again—all evidence that it isn’t working will be\nrejected as fake, and Americans who disapprove will be dismissed as having\n“Trump Derangement Syndrome,” a phrase that allegedly describes people like you\nand me. We’re the sane ones. The only Trump\nDerangement Syndrome is that of Trump himself, and his supporters, and it is\ndestroying the country we thought we knew. \nThis article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

Then the Story Got Even Darker.Most Recent PostOn January 3, four days before the horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good, the Department of Homeland Security put out a press release. The headline bragged: “ICE Announces Historic 120% Manpower Increase, Thanks to Recruitment Campaign That Brought in 12,000 Officers and Agents.”The statement went on to boast (bolded language in the original): “After receiving more than 220,000 applications to join ICE from patriotic Americans, ICE blew past its original hiring target of 10,000 new officers and agents within a year. In fact, we have more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000. With these new patriots on the team, we will be able to accomplish what many say was impossible and fulfill President Trump’s promise to make America safe again.”It appears that Good’s executioner—and it’s hard to think of a more apt word for someone who fires three point-blank shots at the head of an obviously unarmed civilian who is trying to drive away—was not one of these “new patriots.” The incident his defenders have taken to invoking, in which he was dragged by a car and ended up with 33 stitches, reportedly happened last June, before the hiring spree. But even that raises the obvious question: If he was injured, if he was “traumatized” by that event, as Vice President JD Vance said Thursday, what in the world was he doing still out in the field?An investigation may answer that question (or, since it’s going to be led by Kash Patel’s FBI, maybe it won’t). But our common sense, and what we have learned in the last year about these people, tells us that he was still in the field for the same reason that ICE has hired 12,000 people in six months, recruiting specifically for people with an enthusiasm for guns and the military. The Trump administration wants to force showdowns that lead inevitably to what happened in Minneapolis Wednesday.Take a look at the recruitment social media post that DHS placed on X last August: “Serve your country! Defend your culture! No undergraduate degree required!”Let’s break that down. “Serve your country.” OK, nothing objectionable about that. But then we take a very Trumpian-Millerian turn: “Defend your culture.” Who is that aimed at? What set of emotional reactions is that command supposed to fire, and in whom? What “culture,” precisely, is it referring to? And finally, the reassurance that the job is open to practically anyone. Well, anyone of a certain mindset, that is. On New Year’s Eve, ICE announced that it was initiating a new $100 million recruitment campaign that it referred to as a “wartime recruitment” strategy. The campaign, as The Washington Post put it, will target people “who have attended UFC fights, listened to patriotic podcasts, or shown an interest in guns and tactical gear.”Any organization that goes from 10,000 to 22,000 in six months has hired some very unqualified people. If that organization is, say, the Candy Stripers, that might not be much of an issue. But if the organization is one that gives its employees badges and masks and riot gear and SIG Sauer P320 semiautomatic pistols (or maybe a Glock 19, to which the agency began transitioning last year), you’ve got a problem.That’s exactly what Donald Trump, Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, and Corey Lewandowski (whose exact role at DHS is the focus of many questions) have done. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill passed last July, you might recall, tripled ICE’s budget, from around $10 billion a year to close to $30 billion. All told, as Margy O’Herron of the Brennan Center pointed out last year, the bill “allocates more than $170 billion over four years for border and interior enforcement, with a stated goal of deporting one million immigrants each year. That is more than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies combined across the entire United States.” She added that “the largest percentage increase goes to finding, arresting, detaining, and deporting immigrants already living in the U.S., most of whom have not committed a crime and many of whom have had lawful status.”It’s clear what all this adds up to. There will be more Renee Goods. And they will all be smeared and trashed by Trump and his followers. Vance said Thursday, as have any number of MAGA-ites on social media, that she was driving right at the shooting officer. Proof of this, they say, lies in the fact that first bullet hole went through her windshield.Yes, it did. But look at where it went through the windshield. It’s all the way over to the right, just a couple of inches from the driver’s-side pillar. If she was driving right at him, wouldn’t that bullet hole be closer to the center of the windshield? The video shows clearly that she was turning the car to the right. But even if there is ambiguity about the first shot, there is no ambiguity whatsoever about the second and third. Good was executed. And now her reputation and life and values are being killed. Perhaps taking cues from Noem, who accused Good of an act of “domestic terrorism,” Vance referred to the victim as part of a left-wing conspiracy. A reporter asked him to amplify on that, and he couldn’t. He also said Good represented a “lunatic fringe.” No, Mr. Vice President. Renee Good represents tens of millions of honest, decent, and patriotic Americans. Tens of millions of us who want to live in a humane and compassionate multiracial democracy where citizens, even if they are trying to obstruct a law enforcement action they object to (there is still some question whether Good was doing this), are subjected to the legal process and given their rights and not shot point-blank, where people who aren’t citizens but are otherwise law-abiding don’t have to live in fear, and where the “culture” we “defend” is a culture based not on blood and soil but the rule of law.The real lunatic fringe in this country is the one that sanctions the execution of a citizen and then spends days smearing her and that imagines itself to be at war with its own people and precipitates these kinds of confrontations in the first place. That fringe is doubling down, and hiring and hiring and hiring. This is going to get much worse.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

We’ll do that. We’ve got to bring it down,” he told a Wisconsin crowd that October.Well. Guess what? Prices are up. And they’re not just up, at least in some cases, because of random, impersonal market forces. They’re up because Trump raised them, through his tariffs. But mostly, they’re up because politicians, even presidents, don’t have the power to lower prices quickly and unilaterally.I thought everyone knew this. I thought everyone was at least sophisticated enough to understand that inflation is kind of complicated and has to do with a number of factors that can’t be easily erased or reversed. I mean, that’s not a particularly advanced political or economic concept. A president can’t just say, “Beef prices, I command thee down!” and beef prices go down. We live in the real world, not some fairy-tale land; there’s no legal limit to the snow here, as there was in Camelot.And yet—apparently a lot of people did believe him. Well, you know what? I’m not in the habit of calling people idiots. Elected Republicans, yes. A lot of them are idiots, and hypocrites and liars and worse. But regular people—I try to stay away from calling them idiots. They have pressures, they don’t really follow politics, and even in the present case, I understand that a few million voters turned to Trump because Joe Biden seemed to be responsible for inflation (and was, to a certain extent), Kamala Harris didn’t plausibly explain how she’d do things differently, and Trump was the only other entrée on the menu. Those people, I sort of get.But if you really, truly, deeply believed that Trump would lower prices quickly? I’m sorry. You’re an idiot.I keep wondering how people could have fallen for this. How could people not know, after living through Trump’s first term, that he’ll say anything—whatever works for him in the moment? Did people really just forget that? Apparently, they did. I have to keep reminding myself: There are a lot of people who pay attention to politics the way I pay attention to gymnastics—for a few weeks every four years. They’ve never understood that Trump is worse—far, far worse—than your average pol in the way he’ll just say whatever sounds good at the time.Did they think he could fix things because he’s a businessman? You know—a businessman with six bankruptcies? Anyone capable of even a semblance of critical thinking who spent 10 minutes examining Trump’s business career could see that what he mostly did was drive companies into the ground, stiff contractors, fend off lawsuits, and skate through it all because he was a celebrity, which he figured out how to parlay into profit by selling the right to put his name on buildings.And finally, I suspect a lot of people bought it because a lot of other dishonest people were pushing it. And here, of course, I mean the right-wing propaganda machine—from Fox News to podcasters to the algorithmic narcotics pushers on social media who are rapidly turning half the nation into a bunch of rage-baited nitwits—that helped elect him and that helps keep his poll numbers, anemic as they are, from being even worse.It’s not as if it was some deeply held secret last year that presidents can’t just lower prices, or that tariffs increase prices. Plenty of people said so and warned that Trump had no answers. But the propagandists drowned the sane voices out.Imagine that Kamala Harris had said she was going to lower grocery prices immediately, on day one. You know what would have happened? She’d have been laughed off the campaign trail. Mocked relentlessly. And not just by the right wing. By mainstream economic commentators. By liberal pundits. By me. That’s because we—mainstream commentators, liberal pundits, and the millions of Americans who still do actually read stuff, weigh evidence, connect dots—would have known it was a preposterous and desperate lie. And we’d have said so. She’d have been savaged. She and her people no doubt knew this, which is why she didn’t talk like that.She did address the issue. She did say she’d bring prices down. But she didn’t say silly things like “from day one,” and she offered some specifics about how she’d try to bring them down. She vowed to go after corporate price-gouging. You’ll recall that she was attacked even for this, on the grounds either that such gouging was allegedly rare or that most states already had laws against it, or it was just more proof she was a not-so-secret Marxist.Otherwise, her plan to lower prices consisted of the usual dreary, time-consuming, reality-based stuff: expanding the child tax credit to reduce the costs of raising children; expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, to give more money back to lower-income taxpayers; providing housing tax credits to make homeownership more affordable. Oh, and one more thing: She proposed extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies—exactly the hammer that’s about to thwack 20 million Americans over the head because Trump refuses to do this and has ordered the Republicans in Congress to follow suit.So she put forward some plans. But plans are so ho-hum. Trump, in contrast, promised he’d cut the cost of a new home in half. Half! How? By slashing regulations! What regulations? You know—regulations! The evil, very, very bad ones! Sing along with me, to the tune of “Camelot”: “No regulation ever shall raise prices …”So he goes back to Pennsylvania, as he did this week, and face-plants at the first MAGA rally of his second presidency by making fun of the whole idea of “affordabili-tee,” even pronouncing the word in such a way as to make light of the idea. Of course he did. He has no idea what to do about all this. So he has to make it sound like a “Democrat” hoax. Oh—and that “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” he gave himself on the economy in that Politico interview. That’s five pluses. I’ve noticed on cable news a lot of people reducing it to four. Understandable. Four has a more natural rhythm to it, as we know from the world of music. But Trump, of course, had to gild the faux-gold lily and add a fifth. That fifth “plus,” for those attuned to the psychological trip wires that exist in that swampy brain of his, is his secret admission that he knows things aren’t good. Yet he had the gall to lecture his rallygoers: “You’re doing better than you’ve ever done.” Imagine Joe Biden having said that in 2023.So, to those who voted for TRUMP in the belief that he would “lower prices” on DAY ONE, I ask you: Do you think this man who lives in a Gilded Mansion gets what you’re going through? Do you think he’s EVER been to a supermarket in his life? Do you think he could guess the Price of a Gallon of Milk? A head of his beloved Iceberg Lettuce? I beg of you. PLEASE. WAKE UP!! He is Playing You. Thank you for your attention to this matter!Latest From Politics\nTrump’s ICE Agents Arrested Don Lemon. Then the Story Got Even Darker.Most Recent PostPete Hegseth is having one of the worst weeks a Cabinet secretary has had in recent American history. It’s very richly deserved. He’s a bombastic idiot. He’s a liar. And he’s a weasel: Under fire for a second military strike on an alleged drug boat, which killed two survivors of the first strike and was possibly a war crime, he has publicly shifted all responsibility to a uniformed Naval officer who cannot defend himself in public. Finally, I’d add that he has utter contempt for the historic rules of honorable military engagement, but the video that emerged this week of him paying rhetorical homage to those rules back in 2016 when Democrats ran the Pentagon proves that he doesn’t even live according to that benighted “principle” and instead operates on the basis of no principle other than the usual Republican ones—political advantage and power.He’s a disaster as defense secretary. But here’s a question that must be pondered this week: Didn’t we all know this? Wasn’t there ample reason to suspect that a talk-show host would be in way over his head in running the largest corporation in the U.S. government? Could anyone—anyone—look in the mirror back in January and say to themselves: “Yes, of all the possible nominees in this vast country to run the Department of Defense, Pete Hegseth is the best possible choice”?Of course we knew this. And yet, he made it through. Why? I see three reasons, all tangled up with one another, because they all describe different aspects of the total moral decay of the Republican Party. Let’s start with the most obvious reason: Trump wanted him. In other words, no President Trump, no Secretary Hegseth, not in a jillion years. It took an ill-informed demagogue who dodged the draft and thinks soldiers buried in Arlington Cemetery are “suckers” and thinks cable news is the pinnacle of human endeavor to come up with an appointment like this. And this, as we all know, is why Trump chose him: He was a snarling cable host who looked the part and hated DEI. People knew at the time. Exiled Republican Adam Kinzinger posted last November, when Trump nominated Hegseth: “Wow. Trump picking Pete Hegseth is the most hilariously predictably stupid thing.”But of course, few Republicans were willing to say so, which brings us to reason two: the total abdication of constitutional responsibilities by Trump’s party. Well, not quite total. Three Republicans did vote against Hegseth: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitch McConnell. JD Vance had to hustle up to the Capitol to break the tie.But what that means is that 47 senators who had to know better (well, Tommy Tuberville excepted) voted for him. Mississippi’s Roger Wicker has been in the news this week because he chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee and is thus deeply involved in the question of how Congress will proceed in probing the second strike on that vessel on September 2. And, as Wicker is not tightly identified with the MAGA movement, I’ve seen him referred to this week as a comparative voice of reason.Really? Go watch his statement back in January explaining his vote for Hegseth to see what a voice of reason he was then. “Admittedly, this nomination is unconventional,” he allowed. But so was Trump, when he flitted down that escalator. “That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth an excellent choice,” he continued. Hegseth would bring “a new warrior ethos” and “energy” and “fresh ideas.” Those descriptors might in fact be accurate, but not in a good way.Wicker has been around Washington for three decades. He’s a former Air Force officer. There is zero chance he actually believed those words that he spoke that January day. But he spoke them, and 46 of his colleagues mouthed similarly mendacious platitudes.Those platitudes received endless repetition on Fox News and the other right-wing propaganda outlets, which brings us to the third reason why it’s possible for such an unqualified hooligan to lead the world’s largest military. The right-wing “media” serves as an enforcer in such situations. GOP senators know very well that if they break with Trump on a big vote, the propaganda mill will target them, and that rich agribusiness magnate back home who’s a MAGA fire-breather will primary them next time, and Trump will endorse him, and goodbye Senate.These outlets also enforce the acceptance of a certain reality among the rank and file—in which, in the current case, all the talk last winter about Hegseth’s drinking problem and his running that nonprofit into the ground were just deep-state lies. They create for the audience a world that is the direct opposite of reality.Speaking of which … a poll came out this week—commissioned by the conservative Manhattan Institute, no less—that sought to give America a fuller portrait than we usually get of the beliefs and feelings of today’s GOP. The pollster asked a few questions about conspiracy theories. Find your hat, please, and hold onto it.One-third, exactly 33 percent, think vaccines cause autism. A little more, 36 percent, think NASA faked the moon landing. Also, 37 percent think the Holocaust was “greatly exaggerated.” Forty-one percent think the September 11 attacks were carried out by actors beyond Al Qaeda and were “likely orchestrated or permitted by the U.S. government.” And 51 percent, as opposed to 40 percent who disagreed, believe the 2020 election was stolen. (Interesting side result, on another question: Fifteen percent of the poll’s respondents admitted to being racist!)I’m not saying we can trace all this directly to Fox News. As far as I know, even Fox isn’t peddling Faurisson-esque Holocaust denialism. But Fox and the others have certainly promoted a milieu in which their consumers are encouraged to question nearly all statements of fact if liberals seem to believe those facts. From there, the algorithms of social media take over, and we’re off to the parallel-reality races.It’s no wonder in such a world that a man like Hegseth could rise to his current position, sustained and protected by cowardice and lies. And it’s no wonder that he’s ordering the clearly illegal targeting of vessels and making allegations about them without offering any evidence. This is exactly where the moral rot that has consumed the Republican Party in this century was bound to land us. Latest From Politics\nTrump’s ICE Agents Arrested Don Lemon. Then the Story Got Even Darker.Most Recent PostI’m sitting here early Friday morning with the home pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post up on my screen. The president of the United States, as you know by now, has accused six Democratic legislators of sedition, or, as Donald Trump inevitably puts such things, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,” adding that it is “punishable by DEATH!” He also re-Truthed a comment reading “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”Trump says a lot of outrageous things, and we know why he says them. First, he’s an unhinged sociopath who knows nothing about American history (George Washington is literally the last person who’d behave as above, more on which later). Second, when he is attacked, as he was here—or as he believes he was; the sextet was actually just stating a fact of American tradition and law—he strikes back in the most juvenile way possible, since his emotional development was arrested at about age 13 (which is perhaps being generous). And third, he’s trying to distract from an otherwise bad week—arguably the worst of his second presidency, as his own party moved essentially in unanimity against him on the Epstein matter (something that, speaking of American history, I’m not sure has ever happened before).So we know all that about him, and we’ve come to accept it. But come on. Hang them? Elected representatives of the people? Who have all served their country in the armed forces or in risky intelligence work? Not that that last point should matter one way or the other, but it does count for something. Senator Mark Kelly, for example, flew 39 combat missions during the Persian Gulf War. This was around the same time that Trump was working overtime to suppress a documentary about him that showed him to be the gangster and conman we all know him to be today.But put these personal details to the side, and stick to the mere objective fact: A sitting president of the United States has called for the execution of six legislators. I don’t know this for certain, but it seems nearly impossible that this has happened before. I don’t think Abraham Lincoln did it, and he was dealing with actual traitors. Maybe, you know, Franklin Pierce or James Buchanan did it on a bad day. Or Andrew Johnson. He was temperamentally capable of something like this. But that hardly makes it defensible. As they were three of the worst presidents in U.S. history, that only makes it worse.OK. Back to the Times and the Post now. How in the world is this not the top story this morning? Indeed: How is it not the only headline above the fold, the kind of headline they usually reserve for world wars?But it’s not. It’s not even close. On my Post home page around 7 a.m. Friday, you have to spin the scroll wheel on the mouse about seven times even to see the headline and subhed, which do not, incidentally, mention the “death” part at all. (The story did appear on the upper left of the front page of today’s physical paper.) At the Times, I had to give the scroll wheel four spins before I saw the story; the headline does quote Trump’s words “punishable by death.” But the Times didn’t even put it on the front page of their physical paper—there was only a single-sentence reference to the story in a small box titled “More on the White House,” as if this was just more ho-hum news from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.When I peeked at the Times on Thursday night, I noted that the headline did not even mention the death part. It read: “In Outburst, Trump Accuses Democrats of Sedition Over Video to Military.” Sweet Jesus, Times. It’s a small thing, perhaps. But “outburst”?! It’s a telling little example of how mainstream news headline writers continue to try to use the normal conventions of objective journalism style to describe behavior that is an offense against normalcy.The headline writers at the two papers would undoubtedly snicker at me. I’m being alarmist. Trump says a lot of things. He doesn’t really mean it. Or, even if he does mean it in the moment, it’s not really to be taken seriously. It can’t happen here.I’m sorry. Those are all the rationalizations of people who have decided that anti-alarmism is the proper, neutral posture toward Trump. I won’t psychoanalyze them and say why, although I have my theories. I’ll just say that they—and many people like them who package mainstream news for tens of millions of readers and viewers and listeners—have shown us time after time after fatiguing time that they believe that Trump’s outrageous remarks need to be “contextualized” and that we shouldn’t get too worked up over them.Trump said in 2016 that people at his rallies should beat up protesters. Oh, relax—maybe he was joking. He said there was a Second Amendment solution for Hillary Clinton. Well, that was ambiguous. He clearly and repulsively mocked a journalist with physical disabilities. Well, it wasn’t completely clear what he was referring to. Barack Obama was spying on him. Well, there may be no evidence, but that’s Trump being Trump. And so on, times a thousand.Question: What will it take? Where is the line that Trump must cross for these people to say to themselves, “OK. That’s enough. We are alarmed, and we believe America should be alarmed, and we are going to cover this like it’s the crisis it is.” If calling for six legislators to be hanged doesn’t clear that bar, what will?These legislators did nothing wrong. They said, “You can refuse illegal orders … you must refuse illegal orders.” This is correct and true. It is what recruits are taught in every branch of the military. It prevents a president from turning the military into his own personal army, and as such, it’s one of the key principles that keeps a democratic republic from careening into dictatorship.As to why they felt moved to make this video in the first place—well, we don’t really know the answer to that yet, but you don’t have to be George Patton to know that Trump would like to use the military to do whatever he wants it to do. TNR’s Greg Sargent interviewed one of the six Democrats, Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, for his Daily Blast podcast today. Here’s what she had to say:Sargent: It sounds to me like all of you who have military or intelligence experience are hearing from inside these institutions that there’s real and actual concern, live concern, that people are being asked to carry out illegal orders. Is that what’s going on? Houlahan: It’s partially what’s going on. It’s also sort of the buildup of the last nine or ten months, where we have watched this president kind of push on every boundary, try to break every circuit, so to speak, and overload us all with attempts to figure out where the lines are in the law. And so it’s not just in the military realm—though of course that’s what this particular podcast or broadcast is about—but it is abundantly evident with more than 149 instances over the last months of the president putting out orders of one form or another that have then been pushed to the courts in some way, shape, or form.Houlahan went on to tell Sargent that she had “had a few conversations with people who have indicated discomfort with sort of the current state of affairs” and that “I know my colleagues have had similar kinds of conversations.” I would imagine we’ll be hearing more about this.The country should be thanking these six for making this public warning, both because it described a very real threat to the Constitution and because, in eliciting a crazed response from Trump, the video showed America a new and even more depraved level of his dangerous ignorance. George Washington, please. Washington is the most anti-Trump leader not only in American history but probably in the history of the modern world.Washington advocated a certain degree of mercy toward prisoners of war. When he captured more than 900 Hessians at Trenton in 1776, he not only didn’t hang them—he ordered that his troops do them no harm. Instead of being hauled off to prisons, they were sent to farms and allowed to work. And, of course, we all know—or I hope we all know—that Washington directly rebuffed his chance to become America’s dictator in 1783. Trump, as usual, hasn’t the slightest idea what he’s talking about.But Trump himself is only part of the problem here. The other part is a media that collectively thinks we ought to just shrug these things off as Trump being Trump. Yes; it is Trump being Trump. And that’s precisely the problem. Does someone literally have to die before these “outbursts” merit a banner headline? Or even then, will they counsel us not to be alarmed—to consider the context? These people are going to help contextualize us into dictatorship.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here.Most Recent PostThe key thing about Donald Trump’s presidency, when you examine it alongside the history of every other Oval Office occupant, is that to understand what drives him day-to-day, you have to have a handle on his psychology—all those twisted urges and impulses that twitch through his brain. This is because so much of what he does is by pure instinct—id unchecked by superego; animal urge unmitigated by conscience. That, plus the fact that all he really cares about is how he looks on TV (more specifically, Fox News and Newsmax). Who can doubt that part of what he loves about bombing those boats in the Caribbean is that he loves seeing them go boom on a big screen?So, when we analyze this administration, we have to look for the psychological “tells” in a way we simply didn’t with any other president, because the other presidents, no matter their politics, weren’t emotional 5-year-olds who lived in an impenetrable image bubble created and maintained by their staffs and their propagandists with press passes. And the psychological tell of the week? Hauling Representative Lauren Boebert into the White House Situation Room to try to break her down and make her change her vote on the Jeffrey Epstein discharge petition.Think about this purely as a presidential decision. We don’t know whether this was his idea or if an aide hatched this plan and he liked it, but it amounts to the same thing. Yeah, we can picture Trump thinking: the Situation Room; secret, private, all those fancy screens and maps—that’ll intimidate her.When LBJ had a recalcitrant member of Congress to win over, he invited him up to the Truman Balcony for a bourbon. Trump locked Boebert in the room that’s supposed to be used to monitor military operations. It’s where Barack Obama watched Seal Team Six take out bin Laden. It’s unclear whether Trump was there. One assumes he was. But willing hacks Pam Bondi and Kash Patel showed up. Wait, what? What was their presence meant to imply? Why did the attorney general and the FBI director need to be present on a legislative matter? Was the idea to hint to Boebert that she could face some sort of legal consequences if she didn’t capitulate? On a congressional vote?Boebert laughed it all off, but she didn’t cave. In fact, the strong-arming apparently left her all the more convinced Trump may be hiding something. Hard to imagine I’d ever be saying this, but: good for her. And for her colleague Nancy Mace, whom Trump simply called, in the old-fashioned way. But both stood their ground, and next week, the House will vote to compel Bondi’s Justice Department to release the files, with possibly up to 100 Republicans voting to do so.Trump is clearly in a dead panic about this. We saw this week the reason why. Many of the Epstein emails released this week were—at least in the court of public opinion—incriminating to one degree or another; none more so than the one Epstein wrote to an unnamed acquaintance in December 2018, in which he announced: “i am the one able to take him down.” Also: “I know how dirty donald is.” (He was too lazy to hit the shift key, apparently.)Trump, as always, says it’s all a lie and he did nothing wrong. And a few of the released emails can be read to support this claim. But just stop and think: We are sitting here, in November 2025, in the middle (or the beginning-middle) of a credible investigation into whether the president of the United States engaged in sex acts with underage girls. (And when media allies such as Megyn Kelly publicly try to finesse the differences between having sex with a 5-year-old versus having sex with a 15-year-old, that’s not a good sign.)There’s still plenty of reason to think we’ll never get a satisfactory answer about Trump’s place in Epstein’s grotesque constellation of decadent elites. Trump still has a number of roadblocks to put in the way of getting to the point of the files being released. First and foremost, there’s the Senate. Because once the House votes to release the files, then the Senate has to. I haven’t seen much handicapping on this yet. But it would have to clear the 60-vote cloture hurdle, meaning that 13 Republicans would have to vote with the Democrats to bring the matter to final passage. Then, of course, even if it does pass the Senate, Trump can veto it. At that point, two-thirds of each House would be required to override the veto. And even then, if all that happens, there’s still Bondi. She could just say, No, I’m not going to do it. Yes, that would be defying an act of Congress. Do you really have trouble picturing her doing that?Of course, if this gets to that point, we’ll have a major national scandal on our hands, for one simple reason that will be crystal clear to a comfortable majority of the American people: If Trump and his goons are going to those lengths to keep these files from being made public, then he must obviously have something bad to hide.That’s what makes this different from every other Trumpian contest of wills. In his battles with Democrats, with woke universities, with liberal law firms, with people he doesn’t like being in America, he’s always had a position that some percentage of Americans found compelling, for whatever reason. That’s why they cheer his bullying and don’t care about his lies.This, however, is different. He’s not defending anything that could remotely be called a principle, and he’s not slaying any America-hating dragons. He’s just covering up his own potential monstrous crimes. Given the way we’ve already seen this issue divide MAGA land, even some percentage of Trump’s hard-shell base will surely see the difference.Editor’s PickMarjorie Taylor Greene’s Fresh Epstein Bombshell Should Unnerve TrumpMost Recent PostZohran Mamdani is off to a solid start as mayor-elect. The transition team he named the day after winning has garnered generally positive coverage, from what I’ve seen. It’s anchored by four women, three of whom are City Hall veterans—one comes from the Bill de Blasio administration, while the other two, more intriguingly, served under the very non-Mamdani-like Eric Adams and Mike Bloomberg. The fourth is Lina Khan, who was Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission chair. She is a hero to liberals and something—well, let’s say—other than that to a lot of capitalist-class types, so her involvement sends a reassuring signal to the base and presumably a healthy little warning shot across the bow of the Good Ship One Percent.Mamdani will soon have a massive city to run, more than 300,000 employees to manage, and a budget north of $100 billion to execute and carry out. The New York City government is a sprawling Leviathan that’s larger than many state governments—just scroll through this list and have a look-see.I of course don’t cover all this closely. But I once did, and for a long time, under the mayoralties of Ed Koch (the sunset years), David Dinkins, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Bloomberg. I never had a desk in City Hall’s Room 9, the cluttered squat where the reporters were based, but I spent a lot of time down there and knew dozens of deputy mayors and commissioners and lower-level appointees, and I think I still know a bit about how it all works. In addition, I still remember a thing or two about how the New York media and its tabloid subculture operate. And on the basis of that, I can offer this educated conjecture with some confidence: Mamdani’s powerful enemies are lying in wait and surely already setting traps for him. Their biggest weapon won’t be anything having to do with socialism or Israel, the two topics that got the most attention during the campaign. It won’t even be crime, unless somehow crime suddenly spikes up, which seems unlikely. Rather, it will be corruption and scandal. Why? Is it because Mamdani is on the make? No. It’s just a pitfall of big-city government. And New York is the biggest big-city government in the country, by a mile—a place where corruption and scandal are, or would seem to be and usually have been, inevitable. Mamdani and his people need to know this, and they need to build an administration that is as bulletproof against scandal as possible.That means appointing people to high positions who are competent and honest. Ideology shouldn’t be a factor here. The head of the Department of Sanitation doesn’t need to know the difference between social democracy and democratic socialism. He or she needs to know how to pick up trash and clear snow—especially in the neighborhoods that went for Andrew Cuomo, because if the streets of Bayside or Midwood sit uncleared for a week after a snowstorm, the media, led of course by the New York Post, will rip him to shreds. It’s not fair, but it’s how it is.Beyond that somewhat obvious example, there are three agencies in particular where I think Mamdani needs to make appointments (assuming he wants his own people) who’ll really mind the henhouse: the Department of Education; the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA; and the Health and Hospitals Corporation, or HHC. These are all massive, well, corporations in their own right. The Department of Education, which was placed under mayoral control back when I was covering City Hall, is by far the largest: It has around 150,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40 billion and educates more than one million children. NYCHA has north of 10,000 employees and a budget of more than $5 billion and manages 335 properties that serve more than half a million people. The HHC has around 43,000 employees and a budget of $12 billion and runs 11 public hospitals and 30 community clinics.In the time I covered New York, I saw scandals bubble up from these agencies and swallow mayors whole, at least for a little while. Ed Koch’s HHC guy faked his diploma and continued to lie about it, even at the press conference he called to set matters straight. David Dinkins’s NYCHA appointee spent an insane amount of money redecorating her office; I seem to recall something about a $3,000 sofa. As for the Education Department, I’ll never forget the way one former schools chancellor, the capable and incorruptible Rudy Crew, once described his job to me (this is a very close paraphrase): Imagine you’re on one of those moving walkways. Then people start shooting arrows at you. Then the walkway starts moving faster and faster and faster. Then those arrows start coming at you much more rapidly, until they’re coming nonstop. That’s the job.And he was just describing the job of schools chancellor, not mayor. Mamdani’s moving walkway is going to chug along at a ferocious rate from his first hour in office. And the people who want to see him fail are going to be scouring the three agencies I mentioned and others for any hint of scandal they can unearth. Mamdani also needs to understand, as I hope and assume he already does, the extent to which the right-wing Post drives the entire New York news cycle and has for years. They can have all the fun they want with hammers and sickles, as they did the day after Mamdani won. That won’t really matter that much. But if they can sink their canines into a juicy scandal—especially one that reveals the socialist to be a “hypocrite,” which the right loves more than anything—he’ll have big trouble.So he needs to do two things. First, appoint honest, competent, no-bullshit people to run these vast agencies, people who’ll keep an eye out for any signs of corruption. Second, devote a decent chunk of every day to monitoring these agencies himself—grilling the deputy mayors who oversee them, calling the agency heads, making unexpected visits to their facilities, communicating that he won’t tolerate corruption of any kind.And what if one of these spot inspections reveals corruption? My advice: Bring it into the light. Rather than covering it up or quietly moving a bad actor out of their post, get in front of reporters and tell them what you found and what you did about it. Be forthright and take responsibility—because that’s the sturdy foundation of the new brand of politics you want to build. If Mamdani can demonstrate that a government of the left can be ruthlessly honest and reasonably efficient, he’ll have proven something important and accomplished something big, even if he never opens a single grocery store.Editor’s PickHow Zohran Mamdani Fixed the Mistakes That Cost Democrats in 2024Most Recent PostSaturday is November 1—the day open enrollment begins on the Obamacare exchanges, and thus the day that those 20 million people will start learning in specific terms how much their health care premiums are going to increase. It is also the day that the Trump administration will stop paying SNAP benefits, the nutritional assistance program that helps 42 million Americans buy food for themselves and their families, at an average of around $175 a month. It will do this despite the presence of a $6 billion reserve fund to cover food stamp emergencies, which the administration argued in court Thursday it couldn’t or wouldn’t spend because this is not an emergency. Or the right kind of emergency. Or something.In addition, it will be the thirty-second day of the current government shutdown (the longest was 35 days, during Donald Trump’s first term). It will also mark 51 days since the House of Representatives, under Speaker Mike Johnson, has cast a vote. And it will be 38 days since the election of Democrat Adelita Grijalva to the Arizona House seat held by her father without her yet being sworn in, a situation about which Johnson, who by law must perform the ceremony, has told lie after pathetic lie. He has kept the House out of session and delayed her swearing in for one reason alone, which everyone knows: She’ll be the 218th vote to release the files relating to Jeffrey Epstein.So these are Mike Johnson’s Christian values, as Paul Krugman put it on his Substack Tuesday: “It sounds crazy to say that Republicans are making children go hungry to protect pedophiles, but it’s actually a reasonable interpretation of the situation.”It’s a 100 percent reasonable interpretation. If Johnson weren’t paralyzed by the looming Epstein vote, which he wouldn’t have the power to block from coming to the floor, the House could be in session, voting, and it could have done something about getting those SNAP benefits to people. In fact, the only factor that makes Krugman’s interpretation an other-than-reasonable one is that Republicans, given their long-standing and ferocious hostility to food stamps and every program that makes poor people’s burden a bit lighter, might not agree to vote for emergency spending. They’ve been trying and sometimes succeeding at making deep cuts to this program for nearly 15 years. Many people have pointed out that Republicans a","summary":"It was already a pretty weird week, what with Tulsi Gabbard—the official in charge of gathering foreign intelligence—showing up at a Georgia election office for an FBI raid. But then, on Thursday, the president of the United States filed a lawsuit that is an obvious shakedown of the government he runs. Donald Trump, his two older sons, and their business are suing the IRS and the Treasury Department for $10 billion for allowing a government contractor to gain access to their tax filings (the contractor later leaked the files to the press). It reads like a transparent attempt to steal a few billion dollars from the U.S. Treasury while he can get away with it.\n\nIt’s an interesting twist of fate that the Gabbard raid and this lawsuit both dropped in the same week, because they actually go together quite well in the Venn diagram of Trumpian iniquity.

And if other sections are diminished, we all are.”\n\nIn the letter to Bezos — which began with a chummy “Dear Jeff” — the ink-stained wretches asserted that many of their stories that drew new subscribers relied on teamwork with the international and metro desks, along with sports.\n\nThe plea came after WaPo recently told reporters it was scrapping plans to cover the Winter Olympics, sparking speculation the paper could be planning to eliminate its sports desk entirely. \n\nThe outlet has since backtracked, announcing plans to send a small team of journos to Italy, according to the New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, staffers are reportedly at a breaking point after years of layoffs and a growing distrust of Bezos and publisher Will Lewis after the paper killed an endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024 and added more conservative voices to its Opinion section — along with making newsroom reorganization moves that came across as half-baked.\n\n“There’s now a strong sense that neither Jeff Bezos nor Will Lewis are serious, good-faith stewards of The Washington Post,” a veteran correspondent told CNN.\n\nA WaPo spokesperson told The Post any suggestion that the newsroom is not independent “would be inaccurate and irresponsible.”\n\nStill, staff have been questioning why the paper is yet to publish a story that WaPo reporter Sophia Nguyen was doing about controversial new Amazon Kindle features, including one called “Ask This Book,” the Breaker newsletter recently reported.\n\n“Ask This Book” uses artificial intelligence to let readers “ask questions about the book you’re reading and receive spoiler-free answers,” according to Amazon – but the Authors Guild has raised concerns about the inability of authors and publishers to opt their books out of the feature.\n\nNguyen recently went on maternity leave and there are no plans for the paper to assign another reporter to the story, which was described as “critical” of the new feature, according to Breaker.\n\n“Sophia had started some conversations to build toward a possible piece, but it was still in essentially an early reporting phase when she left for her time off. For now, there are no plans,” Books editor John Williams told the newsletter. \n\nMeanwhile, international correspondents and more than two dozen Washington, DC-area beat reporters have also sent letters to Bezos urging him to hold off on firing staff, according to CNN.\n\n“Right now there is total fear and paralysis. People feel like Bezos is wandering around Paris with Lauren [Sanchez], and they don’t care about any of us,” a WaPo journalist told Breaker, referring to the owner’s wife.\n\nFormer Washington Post Moscow correspondent David Remnick, now editor of The New Yorker, blamed the newsroom chaos on a political shift.\n\n“Trump came back.

Five days later, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem admonished the NFL for its decision.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson, who had asked what message she wanted to send to the league. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski said on the same podcast: “It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game.”\n\nDespite the almost immediate backlash from the Trump administration and its supporters, the NFL has stood by its decision to book Bad Bunny for the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California. It’s a departure from how the league reacted to the president’s criticism nearly a decade ago when some players began kneeling during the national anthem. According to interviews with and public statements by several high-level club and league office executives, the NFL has remained steadfast despite the blowback because Bad Bunny, one of the most popular artists in the world, helps fulfill a top business objective: growing the NFL’s international and Latino audience.\n\nOne high-level club executive who regularly attends the NFL’s owners meetings said some owners at first were concerned about Bad Bunny’s fit because he sings primarily in Spanish, and many were unfamiliar with him.\n\n“And then I think everybody was just kind of like, ‘OK, we’re going to get on board, because the goal is global reach,’” the executive said. “And this guy has a massive global reach.”\n\nTHE NFL HAS a long-standing goal of growing its international audience. This season, the NFL played a record seven games in five international cities: Sao Paulo, Dublin, London, Berlin and Madrid. The league will add Australia in 2026. In September, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he wants each team to play a game abroad every year.\n\nMore specifically, the league has been focused on growing its Latino audience, both inside the U.S. and in Latin America. Marissa Solis, the NFL’s senior vice president of global brand and consumer marketing, told ESPN in November that the league first identified the U.S. Latino population as a “critical growth area” several years ago.\n\n“It is a community of more than 70 million people here in the U.S. ... so it was very important for us to ensure that we were relevant,” Solis said.\n\nIn 2020, the Super Bowl halftime show was headlined for the first time by two Latina pop stars, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. (Bad Bunny also appeared in the show.) At the time, the NFL hired veteran entertainment and brand marketer Javier Farfan as a consultant to add authenticity to the performance.\n\n“People don’t see it, but to the broader global and Latino community, they’re like, ‘Wow. The NFL gets me,’” Farfan, who still consults for the league, said in an interview with ESPN in December. “And then now, they’re seeing [Bad Bunny] and it’s like, ‘Wow, they really get me.’”\n\nSince 2019, the NFL has partnered with rapper and business mogul Jay-Z and his entertainment company Roc Nation to advise on the selection of halftime performers and promote “culture- and cause-focused initiatives,” according to a statement at the time announcing the arrangement.\n\nExactly how Roc Nation chooses the Super Bowl artist and what role the NFL plays in that decision isn’t publicly defined. Roc Nation declined ESPN’s requests to comment for this story.\n\n“Jay-Z understands the platform,” Goodell said at an October sports conference regarding his conversations with the rapper about Bad Bunny. “... And so, it doesn’t get real deep because he knows I’m not going to challenge him.”\n\nSolis said that Roc Nation and the NFL’s halftime strategy is to book “the cultural artist of the year.”\n\nThis year, that artist is Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who was the top-streamed artist on Spotify in 2025. His sixth studio album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” pivoted from straight reggaeton to a fusion of reggaeton, salsa and Puerto Rican genres. The lyrics discuss his love for Puerto Rican culture, the island’s struggle with gentrification that prices out locals and his desire for the island’s independence from the U.S. (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.) The album topped the Billboard charts for four weeks. He stayed in Puerto Rico for much of 2025 and performed a 31-show residency in San Juan.\n\nBad Bunny filmed the halftime show announcement and trailer in Puerto Rico, per his request, said Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing and communications for Apple Music, the performance’s presenting sponsor. When Myhren’s team asked Bad Bunny about his goals for the halftime show, Myhren said Bad Bunny responded, “This isn’t my halftime show, this is for everyone.” The Apple Music trailer shows Bad Bunny dancing to his song “Baile Inolvidable” with people of all races, ages and genders, with the tagline, “February 8 the world will dance.”\n\nMultiple representatives for Bad Bunny did not respond to messages from ESPN seeking interviews with the artist.\n\nChoosing Bad Bunny potentially exposed the NFL to Trump’s ire because the artist has been openly critical of the administration’s vow to remove millions of people from the U.S. via mass deportation programs.\n\nIn an interview published in September, Bad Bunny told i-D Magazine that he chose not to take his world tour to the U.S. because he was worried about potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“F---ing ICE could be outside [the concert],” he said. “And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”\n\nBad Bunny also appeared to mock Trump on the Fourth of July when he released the music video for his song “NUEVAYoL,” a salsa tribute to the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York. In the video, he sings from the crown of the Statue of Liberty, which wears the Puerto Rican flag on her forehead like a bandanna. In the final scenes, a Trump-sounding voice apologizes to immigrants over a radio broadcast.\n\n“I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants,” the voice says. “This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.”\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny endorsed Kamala Harris for U.S. president, criticizing the Trump administration’s 2017 response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen the NFL announced Bad Bunny as the halftime performer, Noem said ICE agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl. “I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they’re law-abiding Americans who love this country,” she said.\n\nThe day after Noem’s comments, Bad Bunny hosted “Saturday Night Live” and addressed the backlash in his monologue. He said in English: “I’m very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy.” Then he switched to Spanish and said: “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”\n\n“And if you didn’t understand what I just said,” he added, switching back to English, “you have four months to learn.”\n\nTrump was first asked about Bad Bunny on Oct. 6. NewsMax’s Greg Kelly asked the president if people should boycott the NFL because of “Bad Bunny Rabbit or whatever-his-name.”\n\nTrump said: “I’ve never heard of him. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know why they’re doing it.”\n\nSpeaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson, R-La., told a reporter in October that booking Bad Bunny was a “terrible decision.”\n\n“There are so many eyes on the Super Bowl, a lot of young, impressionable children. And I think, in my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or role models doing that,” he said. Greenwood, who is 83, is famous for his rendition of “God Bless the USA.”\n\nBad Bunny’s announcement prompted the conservative organization Turning Point USA to counterprogram with its own performance, called “The All-American Halftime Show.” On the show’s website, the group provided a survey for viewers to choose the music they want to hear. “Anything In English” was the first option. Turning Point USA has yet to update its website with any information about the performance and a spokesperson said in early January they will not be releasing any artist information ahead of time.\n\nLast weekend, Trump told the New York Post he would not be attending the Super Bowl because it’s “too far away.”\n\nHe also shared his opinion about Bad Bunny and Green Day, who will perform before kickoff and whose music has been sharply political: “I’m anti-them. ... All it does is sow hatred.”\n\nTrump’s immigration crackdown escalated this month in Minneapolis, with government agents clashing with protestors and fatally shooting two people. The administration has since worked to ease tensions and shift its policy.\n\nRegarding ICE’s presence at the Super Bowl, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said this week that the agency does not disclose operations or personnel plans.\n\n“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event,” McLaughlin said in an email. “Those who are here legally and are not breaking other laws have nothing to fear.”\n\nA person with knowledge of the administration’s plans said that ICE agents will be assigned to the Super Bowl because the event requires coverage by multiple federal agencies.\n\n“This is routine,” the person said. “DHS was there last year and in past years. Nothing about this is unusual.”\n\nA source familiar with Super Bowl planning told ESPN that league security officials “have not been told there will be immigration enforcement actions.”\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, the NFL said fan safety is its “top priority.”\n\n“We have the utmost confidence in our comprehensive security plans,” an NFL spokesman said in the statement. “Our security team has worked with federal, state, local and private sector partners over the past two years to develop extensive plans to provide a safe and secure environment at our events and on gameday.”\n\nWITHIN THE NFL, at least one owner met the decision to book Bad Bunny with skepticism, particularly considering the league’s pending agreement to sell the NFL Network and other assets to ESPN in exchange for a 10% stake in the media company.\n\nShortly after the Bad Bunny announcement, an NFL owner told Goodell that he feared the decision could threaten the government’s antitrust approval of the pending deal, a source with firsthand knowledge of the discussion told ESPN.\n\n“I told Roger he should’ve thought through that better,” the owner said, according to the source.\n\nAt the October league meeting in midtown Manhattan, Goodell said the league had no intentions of changing the halftime performer.\n\n“He’s one of the most popular entertainers in the world,” Goodell told reporters at a news conference. “... It’s carefully thought through. I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism. ... We’re confident it’s going to be a great show.\n\n“I think it’s going to be exciting and a united moment.”\n\nAt a marketing conference in October, NFL chief marketing officer Tim Ellis also addressed the controversy: “Well, not everyone has to like everything we do. Bad Bunny is f---ing awesome.”\n\nTwo sources who have attended owners meetings since the Bad Bunny announcement told ESPN that the artist hasn’t come up in groupwide discussions.\n\n“There’s not some great strife here,” the high-level club executive said. “The league is tasked with setting financial and brand goals, and that’s a lot of what we asked the league to do. ... Of course, it is tricky, because you have a room of 32 people that are unfamiliar with the artist or may have political concerns.”\n\nThree club executives told ESPN they think Bad Bunny helps achieve the league’s goal of growing globally.\n\nDallas Cowboys chief brand officer Charlotte Jones, whose father Jerry Jones owns the team and has donated millions to Trump and his political action committee, told the Katie Miller Podcast in November she supported the Bad Bunny choice.\n\n“I think it’s awesome, and I think our Latino fan base is amazing,” Jones told Miller. “We are on a global stage and we can’t ever forget that. ... We have a mixed culture and our whole society is based on immigrants who have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that.”\n\nMiller, who was a communications director for former vice president Mike Pence and is married to Trump adviser Stephen Miller, pushed back on Jones: “You don’t think that a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump -- when everyone is just seeking a political unification -- that you would want somebody who maybe didn’t touch politics to be on that stage?”\n\n“I don’t think our game is about politics,” Jones replied. “I don’t think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics. ... This is about bringing people together.”\n\nWhen Trump was first president in 2017, his criticism of NFL players who chose to kneel for the national anthem -- an action started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- created a national political crisis that threatened the NFL’s brand and its business. Trump said NFL owners should fire any player who knelt and encouraged fans to walk out. In response, more players started kneeling, and they resisted the league’s attempts to stop the protest.\n\nAccording to reporting from ESPN’s Don Van Natta Jr. and Seth Wickersham at the time, owners and Goodell met with players to discuss racial and social injustice. As a result, the NFL created the Inspire Change initiative, committing $89 million to support social causes, and partnered with Roc Nation to reshape the halftime show and help the league be more proactive in social justice work. Goodell ultimately acknowledged the league initially had been wrong in its approach with players.\n\nOne club executive and a source familiar with league business said the NFL learned lessons from its interactions with the first Trump administration. The club executive said the league isn’t being as “reactionary.”\n\n“Those are probably just lessons learned,” the executive said. “Drawing the president’s ire, there’s so many things that happen on a daily basis. I think people just have a different opinion this time around.”\n\nAnother club executive said the NFL is trying to “double down [now] on an apolitical stance.”\n\n“I think maybe in the past, the league office got a little turned around with some of the owners, or some of the other influential people, saying you have to take a stand here,” the other executive said.\n\nThe NFL spokesman declined to comment on the league’s strategy in dealing with the Trump administration.\n\nMultiple sources said the tension with Trump is less this time around.\n\n“Last time with Kaepernick, that was players and owners and the president. Bad Bunny doesn’t affect any of that,” a club executive said. “It doesn’t affect week-to-week games or television coverage. It’s just a halftime show. And I don’t mean that flippantly, but it’s just a halftime show.”\n\nThe league office is engaging with Trump for other upcoming events. In May, Goodell visited Trump at the White House with Commanders owner Josh Harris to announce that Washington D.C. will host the NFL draft in 2027.\n\nAnd in November, the NFL announced it would commemorate the United States’ 250th birthday in 2026 with commemorative game balls and on-field markings. The Athletic reported that Goodell is also expected to attend an upcoming America 250 unveiling event at the Oval Office, along with the four other major professional men’s sports commissioners.\n\n“If the league has layups or an easy win, it’s like, take the layup,” the source familiar with league business said.\n\nWhen asked in November if the league office has faced any political pressure to change its Latino-focused marketing strategy, Solis told ESPN: “Our strategy has always been to reach every fan in their culture, in their language, to make this sport global, and to make this sport for everyone. So I don’t think that strategy will change regardless of language, country, artists, players. ... We have a responsibility with this platform to ensure that we continue to reach everybody.”\n\nFarfan said in December he wasn’t surprised by the president’s criticism and the larger backlash to Bad Bunny because everyone has the right to express their opinion. “We have the right to do what we need to do for our business and stand tall against that, regardless of the noise happening outside.”\n\nESPN’s Don Van Natta Jr. and researcher John Mastroberardino contributed to this report, which also includes information from The Associated Press.","url":"https://www.tsn.ca/nfl/article/why-the-nfl-stood-by-bad-bunny-for-super-bowl-halftime-show-n1-47757332/","image":"https://www.tsn.ca/resizer/v2/PX6PDXTZJJPJYCCYXLUFTTTMSE.jpg?auth=a1fd7a4904d79c5720c7f9d23dbb5358eac74ecf6cb96e17bef9aaa00985c2a2","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 13:43:23","author":"Kalyn Kahler","authors":["Kalyn Kahler"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.059},{"id":397751426,"title":"AP Decision Notes: What to expect in Texas' special congressional runoff","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Houston voters who have gone almost a year without representation in the U.S. House will finally fill the seat in a special runoff election Saturday.

The largest share of the population in the current district will become part of the new 29th District. The new 18th District will include part of Harris County and extend into Fort Bend County.\n\nThe 18th District today is a Democratic stronghold in a heavily Republican state.

Lee Carter is the daughter of Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represented the area in Congress for nearly 30 years before her death in July 2024. Lee Carter briefly occupied the seat in 2024 before Turner took office. She was not a candidate in the special election.\n\nAs of Jan. 11, Menefee had spent about $1.8 million on his campaign, compared with about $1.5 million for Edwards.

About 76,000 people voted in that election, or about 20% of registered voters. Slightly more than half the voters (51%) voted early or by absentee ballot.\n\nAs of Tuesday, nearly 14,000 ballots had been cast in the 18th Congressional District and about 45,000 in state Senate District 9.\n\nHow long does vote counting usually take?\n\nIn the Nov. 4 special congressional election, the AP first reported results at 8:18 p.m. EST.

But in Saturday’s special congressional runoff, a significant portion of early voting results in Harris County will not be available until a week after the election. Early voting in the county was extended for two additional days after some early voting sites were shut down due to inclement weather.

Five days later, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem admonished the NFL for its decision.\n\n\"They suck, and we'll win,\" Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson, who had asked what message she wanted to send to the league. \"They won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe. And they're so weak, we'll fix it.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski said on the same podcast: \"It's so shameful that they've decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game.\"\n\nDespite the almost immediate backlash from the Trump administration and its supporters, the NFL has stood by its decision to book Bad Bunny for the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California. It's a departure from how the league reacted to the president's criticism nearly a decade ago when some players began kneeling during the national anthem. According to interviews with and public statements by several high-level club and league office executives, the NFL has remained steadfast despite the blowback because Bad Bunny, one of the most popular artists in the world, helps fulfill a top business objective: growing the NFL's international and Latino audience.\n\nOne high-level club executive who regularly attends the NFL's league meetings said that some owners at first were concerned about Bad Bunny's fit because he sings primarily in Spanish and that many were unfamiliar with him.\n\n\"And then I think everybody was just kind of like, 'OK, we're going to get on board, because the goal is global reach,'\" the executive said. \"And this guy has a massive global reach.\"\n\nTHE NFL HAS a long-standing goal of growing its international audience. This season, the NFL played a record seven games in five international cities: Sao Paulo, Dublin, London, Berlin and Madrid. The league will add Australia in 2026. In September, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he wants each team to play a game abroad every year.\n\nMore specifically, the league has been focused on growing its Latino audience, inside the U.S. and in Latin America. Marissa Solis, the NFL's senior vice president of global brand and consumer marketing, told ESPN in November that the league first identified the U.S. Latino population as a \"critical growth area\" several years ago.\n\n\"It is a community of more than 70 million people here in the U.S. ... so it was very important for us to ensure that we were relevant,\" Solis said.\n\nIn 2020, the Super Bowl halftime show was headlined for the first time by two Latina pop stars, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. (Bad Bunny also appeared in the show.) At the time, the NFL hired veteran entertainment and brand marketer Javier Farfan as a consultant to add authenticity to the performance.\n\n\"People don't see it, but to the broader global and Latino community, they're like, 'Wow. The NFL gets me,'\" Farfan, who still consults for the league, said in an interview with ESPN in December. \"And then now, they're seeing [Bad Bunny] and it's like, 'Wow, they really get me.'\"\n\nSince 2019, the NFL has partnered with rapper and business mogul Jay-Z and his entertainment company Roc Nation to advise on the selection of halftime performers and promote \"culture- and cause-focused initiatives,\" according to a statement at the time announcing the arrangement.\n\nExactly how Roc Nation chooses the Super Bowl artist and what role the NFL plays in that decision isn't publicly defined. Roc Nation declined ESPN's requests to comment for this story.\n\n\"Jay-Z understands the platform,\" Goodell said at an October sports conference regarding his conversations with the rapper about Bad Bunny. \"... And so, it doesn't get real deep because he knows I'm not going to challenge him.\"\n\nSolis said that Roc Nation and the NFL's halftime strategy is to book \"the cultural artist of the year.\"\n\nThis year, that artist is Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who was the top-streamed artist on Spotify in 2025. His sixth studio album \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" pivoted from straight reggaeton to a fusion of reggaeton, salsa and Puerto Rican genres. The lyrics discuss his love for Puerto Rican culture, the island's struggle with gentrification that prices out locals and his desire for the island's independence from the U.S. (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.) The album topped the Billboard charts for four weeks. He stayed in Puerto Rico for much of 2025 and performed a 31-show residency in San Juan.\n\nBad Bunny filmed the halftime show announcement and trailer in Puerto Rico, per his request, said Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing and communications for Apple Music, the performance's presenting sponsor. When Myhren's team asked Bad Bunny about his goals for the halftime show, Myhren said Bad Bunny responded, \"This isn't my halftime show, this is for everyone.\" The Apple Music trailer shows Bad Bunny dancing to his song \"Baile Inolvidable\" with people of all races, ages and genders, with the tagline, \"February 8 the world will dance.\"\n\nMultiple representatives for Bad Bunny did not respond to messages from ESPN seeking interviews with the artist.\n\nChoosing Bad Bunny potentially exposed the NFL to Trump's ire because the artist has been openly critical of the administration's vow to remove millions of people from the U.S. via mass deportation programs.\n\nIn an interview published in September, Bad Bunny told i-D Magazine that he chose not to take his world tour to the U.S. because he was worried about potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"F---ing ICE could be outside [the concert],\" he said. \"And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nBad Bunny also appeared to mock Trump on the Fourth of July when he released the music video for his song \"NUEVAYoL,\" a salsa tribute to the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York. In the video, he sings from the crown of the Statue of Liberty, who wears the Puerto Rican flag on her forehead like a bandanna. In the final scenes, a Trump-sounding voice apologizes to immigrants over a radio broadcast.\n\n\"I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants,\" the voice says. \"This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.\"\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny endorsed Kamala Harris for U.S. president, criticizing the Trump administration's 2017 response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen the NFL announced Bad Bunny as the halftime performer, Noem said ICE agents would be \"all over\" the Super Bowl. \"I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they're law-abiding Americans who love this country,\" she said.\n\nThe day after Noem's comments, Bad Bunny hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" and addressed the backlash in his monologue. He said in English: \"I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy.\" Then he switched to Spanish and said: \"Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It's more than a win for myself, it's a win for all of us.

NewsMax's Greg Kelly asked the president if people should boycott the NFL because of \"Bad Bunny Rabbit or whatever-his-name.\"\n\nTrump said: \"I've never heard of him. I don't know who he is. I don't know why they're doing it.\"\n\nSpeaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson, R-La., told a reporter in October that booking Bad Bunny was a \"terrible decision.\"\n\n\"There are so many eyes on the Super Bowl, a lot of young, impressionable children. And I think, in my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or role models doing that,\" he said. Greenwood, who is 83, is famous for his song \"God Bless the USA.\"\n\nBad Bunny's announcement prompted the conservative organization Turning Point USA to counterprogram with its own performance, called \"The All-American Halftime Show.\" On the show's website, the group provided a survey for viewers to choose the music they want to hear. \"Anything In English\" was the first option. Turning Point USA has yet to update its website with any information about the performance, and a spokesperson said in early January they will not be releasing any artist information ahead of time.\n\nLast weekend, Trump told the New York Post he would not be attending the Super Bowl because it's \"too far away.\"\n\nHe also shared his opinion about Bad Bunny and Green Day, who will perform before kickoff and whose music has been sharply political: \"I'm anti-them. ... All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nTrump's immigration crackdown escalated this month in Minneapolis, with government agents clashing with protestors and fatally shooting two people. The administration has since worked to ease tensions and shift its policy.\n\nRegarding ICE's presence at the Super Bowl, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said this week that the agency does not disclose operations or personnel plans.\n\n\"DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event,\" McLaughlin said in an email. \"Those who are here legally and are not breaking other laws have nothing to fear.\"\n\nA person with knowledge of the administration's plans said that ICE agents will be assigned to the Super Bowl because the event requires coverage by multiple federal agencies.\n\n\"This is routine,\" the person said. \"DHS was there last year and in past years. Nothing about this is unusual.\"\n\nA source familiar with Super Bowl planning told ESPN that league security officials \"have not been told there will be immigration enforcement actions.\"\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, the NFL said fan safety is its \"top priority.\"\n\n\"We have the utmost confidence in our comprehensive security plans,\" an NFL spokesperson said in the statement. \"Our security team has worked with federal, state, local and private sector partners over the past two years to develop extensive plans to provide a safe and secure environment at our events and on gameday.\"\n\nWITHIN THE NFL, at least one owner met the decision to book Bad Bunny with skepticism, particularly considering the league's pending agreement to sell the NFL Network and other assets to ESPN in exchange for a 10% stake in the media company.\n\nShortly after the Bad Bunny announcement, an NFL owner told Goodell that he feared the decision could threaten the government's antitrust approval of the pending deal, a source with firsthand knowledge of the discussion told ESPN.\n\n\"I told Roger he should've thought through that better,\" the owner said, according to the source.\n\nAt the October league meeting in midtown Manhattan, Goodell said the league had no intentions of changing the halftime performer.\n\n\"He's one of the most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell told reporters at a news conference. \"... It's carefully thought through. I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. ... We're confident it's going to be a great show.\n\n\"I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"\n\nAt a marketing conference in October, NFL chief marketing officer Tim Ellis also addressed the controversy: \"Well, not everyone has to like everything we do. Bad Bunny is f---ing awesome.\"\n\nTwo sources who have attended owners meetings since the Bad Bunny announcement told ESPN that the artist hasn't come up in groupwide discussions.\n\n\"There's not some great strife here,\" the high-level club executive said. \"The league is tasked with setting financial and brand goals, and that's a lot of what we asked the league to do. ... Of course, it is tricky, because you have a room of 32 people that are unfamiliar with the artist or may have political concerns.\"\n\nThree club executives told ESPN they think Bad Bunny helps achieve the league's goal of growing globally.\n\nDallas Cowboys chief brand officer Charlotte Jones, whose father Jerry Jones owns the team and has donated millions to Trump and his political action committee, told \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in November that she supported the Bad Bunny choice.\n\n\"I think it's awesome, and I think our Latino fan base is amazing,\" Jones told Miller. \"We are on a global stage, and we can't ever forget that. ... We have a mixed culture and our whole society is based on immigrants who have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that.\"\n\nMiller, who was a communications director for former vice president Mike Pence and is married to Trump adviser Stephen Miller, pushed back on Jones: \"You don't think that a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump -- when everyone is just seeking a political unification -- that you would want somebody who maybe didn't touch politics to be on that stage?\"\n\n\"I don't think our game is about politics,\" Jones replied. \"I don't think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics. ... This is about bringing people together.\"\n\nWhen Trump was first president in 2017, his criticism of NFL players who chose to kneel for the national anthem -- an action started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- created a national political crisis that threatened the NFL's brand and its business. Trump said NFL owners should fire any player who knelt and encouraged fans to walk out. In response, more players started kneeling, and they resisted the league's attempts to stop the protest.\n\nAccording to reporting from ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. and Seth Wickersham at the time, owners and Goodell met with players to discuss racial and social injustice. As a result, the NFL created the Inspire Change initiative, committing $89 million to support social causes, and partnered with Roc Nation to reshape the halftime show and help the league be more proactive in social justice work. Goodell ultimately acknowledged the league initially had been wrong in its approach with players.\n\nOne club executive and a source familiar with league business said the NFL learned lessons from its interactions with the first Trump administration. The club executive said the league isn't being as \"reactionary.\"\n\n\"Those are probably just lessons learned,\" the executive said. \"Drawing the president's ire, there's so many things that happen on a daily basis. I think people just have a different opinion this time around.\"\n\nAnother club executive said the NFL is trying to \"double down [now] on an apolitical stance.\"\n\n\"I think maybe in the past, the league office got a little turned around with some of the owners, or some of the other influential people, saying you have to take a stand here,\" the other executive said.\n\nThe NFL spokesperson declined to comment on the league's strategy in dealing with the Trump administration.\n\nMultiple sources said the tension with Trump is less this time around.\n\n\"Last time with Kaepernick, that was players and owners and the president. Bad Bunny doesn't affect any of that,\" a club executive said. \"It doesn't affect week-to-week games or television coverage. It's just a halftime show. And I don't mean that flippantly, but it's just a halftime show.\"\n\nThe league office is engaging with Trump for other upcoming events. In May, Goodell visited Trump at the White House with Commanders owner Josh Harris to announce that Washington, D.C., will host the NFL draft in 2027.\n\nAnd in November, the NFL announced it would commemorate the United States' 250th birthday in 2026 with commemorative game balls and on-field markings. The Athletic reported that Goodell is also expected to attend an upcoming America 250 unveiling event at the Oval Office, along with the four other major professional men's sports commissioners.\n\n\"If the league has layups or an easy win, it's like, take the layup,\" the source familiar with league business said.\n\nWhen asked in November whether the league office has faced any political pressure to change its Latino-focused marketing strategy, Solis told ESPN: \"Our strategy has always been to reach every fan in their culture, in their language, to make this sport global, and to make this sport for everyone. So I don't think that strategy will change regardless of language, country, artists, players. ... We have a responsibility with this platform to ensure that we continue to reach everybody.\"\n\nFarfan said in December that he wasn't surprised by the president's criticism and the larger backlash to Bad Bunny because everyone has the right to express their opinion. \"We have the right to do what we need to do for our business and stand tall against that, regardless of the noise happening outside.\"\n\nESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. and researcher John Mastroberardino contributed to this report, which also includes information from The Associated Press.","url":"https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/47757332/nfl-stood-bad-bunny-super-bowl-half-show-trump","image":"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2026/0121/r1603774_1296x729_16-9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 13:27:00","author":"Kalyn Kahler","authors":["Kalyn Kahler"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":397794018,"title":"Why the NFL stood by Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show - ESPN","text":"IN LATE SEPTEMBER, the NFL announced that Puerto Rican superstar rapper and singer Bad Bunny, who has openly criticized the Donald Trump administration for its immigration policies, would perform this year's Super Bowl halftime show. Five days later, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem admonished the NFL for its decision.\n\n\"They suck, and we'll win,\" Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson, who had asked what message she wanted to send to the league. \"They won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe. And they're so weak, we'll fix it.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security adviser Corey Lewandowski said on the same podcast: \"It's so shameful that they've decided to pick somebody who just seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game.\"\n\nDespite the almost immediate backlash from the Trump administration and its supporters, the NFL has stood by its decision to book Bad Bunny for the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California. It's a departure from how the league reacted to the president's criticism nearly a decade ago when some players began kneeling during the national anthem. According to interviews with and public statements by several high-level club and league office executives, the NFL has remained steadfast despite the blowback because Bad Bunny, one of the most popular artists in the world, helps fulfill a top business objective: growing the NFL's international and Latino audience.\n\nOne high-level club executive who regularly attends the NFL's league meetings said that some owners at first were concerned about Bad Bunny's fit because he sings primarily in Spanish and that many were unfamiliar with him.\n\n\"And then I think everybody was just kind of like, 'OK, we're going to get on board, because the goal is global reach,'\" the executive said. \"And this guy has a massive global reach.\"\n\nTHE NFL HAS a long-standing goal of growing its international audience. This season, the NFL played a record seven games in five international cities: Sao Paulo, Dublin, London, Berlin and Madrid. The league will add Australia in 2026. In September, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said he wants each team to play a game abroad every year.\n\nMore specifically, the league has been focused on growing its Latino audience, inside the U.S. and in Latin America. Marissa Solis, the NFL's senior vice president of global brand and consumer marketing, told ESPN in November that the league first identified the U.S. Latino population as a \"critical growth area\" several years ago.\n\n\"It is a community of more than 70 million people here in the U.S. ... so it was very important for us to ensure that we were relevant,\" Solis said.\n\nIn 2020, the Super Bowl halftime show was headlined for the first time by two Latina pop stars, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. (Bad Bunny also appeared in the show.) At the time, the NFL hired veteran entertainment and brand marketer Javier Farfan as a consultant to add authenticity to the performance.\n\n\"People don't see it, but to the broader global and Latino community, they're like, 'Wow. The NFL gets me,'\" Farfan, who still consults for the league, said in an interview with ESPN in December. \"And then now, they're seeing [Bad Bunny] and it's like, 'Wow, they really get me.'\"\n\nSince 2019, the NFL has partnered with rapper and business mogul Jay-Z and his entertainment company Roc Nation to advise on the selection of halftime performers and promote \"culture- and cause-focused initiatives,\" according to a statement at the time announcing the arrangement.\n\nExactly how Roc Nation chooses the Super Bowl artist and what role the NFL plays in that decision isn't publicly defined. Roc Nation declined ESPN's requests to comment for this story.\n\n\"Jay-Z understands the platform,\" Goodell said at an October sports conference regarding his conversations with the rapper about Bad Bunny. \"... And so, it doesn't get real deep because he knows I'm not going to challenge him.\"\n\nSolis said that Roc Nation and the NFL's halftime strategy is to book \"the cultural artist of the year.\"\n\nThis year, that artist is Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who was the top-streamed artist on Spotify in 2025. His sixth studio album \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" pivoted from straight reggaeton to a fusion of reggaeton, salsa and Puerto Rican genres. The lyrics discuss his love for Puerto Rican culture, the island's struggle with gentrification that prices out locals and his desire for the island's independence from the U.S. (Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.) The album topped the Billboard charts for four weeks. He stayed in Puerto Rico for much of 2025 and performed a 31-show residency in San Juan.\n\nBad Bunny filmed the halftime show announcement and trailer in Puerto Rico, per his request, said Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing and communications for Apple Music, the performance's presenting sponsor. When Myhren's team asked Bad Bunny about his goals for the halftime show, Myhren said Bad Bunny responded, \"This isn't my halftime show, this is for everyone.\" The Apple Music trailer shows Bad Bunny dancing to his song \"Baile Inolvidable\" with people of all races, ages and genders, with the tagline, \"February 8 the world will dance.\"\n\nMultiple representatives for Bad Bunny did not respond to messages from ESPN seeking interviews with the artist.\n\nChoosing Bad Bunny potentially exposed the NFL to Trump's ire because the artist has been openly critical of the administration's vow to remove millions of people from the U.S. via mass deportation programs.\n\nIn an interview published in September, Bad Bunny told i-D Magazine that he chose not to take his world tour to the U.S. because he was worried about potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"F---ing ICE could be outside [the concert],\" he said. \"And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nBad Bunny also appeared to mock Trump on the Fourth of July when he released the music video for his song \"NUEVAYoL,\" a salsa tribute to the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York. In the video, he sings from the crown of the Statue of Liberty, who wears the Puerto Rican flag on her forehead like a bandanna. In the final scenes, a Trump-sounding voice apologizes to immigrants over a radio broadcast.\n\n\"I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants,\" the voice says. \"This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.\"\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny endorsed Kamala Harris for U.S. president, criticizing the Trump administration's 2017 response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen the NFL announced Bad Bunny as the halftime performer, Noem said ICE agents would be \"all over\" the Super Bowl. \"I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they're law-abiding Americans who love this country,\" she said.\n\nThe day after Noem's comments, Bad Bunny hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" and addressed the backlash in his monologue. He said in English: \"I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy.\" Then he switched to Spanish and said: \"Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It's more than a win for myself, it's a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.\"\n\n\"And if you didn't understand what I just said,\" he added, switching back to English, \"you have four months to learn.\"\n\nTrump was first asked about Bad Bunny on Oct. 6. NewsMax's Greg Kelly asked the president if people should boycott the NFL because of \"Bad Bunny Rabbit or whatever-his-name.\"\n\nTrump said: \"I've never heard of him. I don't know who he is.

Trump’s &#8216;Border Czar&#8217; Sent to Take Over ICE Operations in Minneapolis","text":"Following the killing of Alex Pretti, President Donald Trump announced a serious shakeup inside his immigration operation in Minnesota. While a full retreat isn’t set to happen anytime soon, the president has deployed his “border czar,” Tom Homan, to carry the effort.\n\nHoman arrived in Minneapolis on Tuesday (Jan. 27) as the “main point of contact on the ground,” according to the White House. His appointment comes right as Trump kicked Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, who previously led the ICE operation, back to his original post at the southern border. The change of leadership represents a turning point in the tense battle in the city, and Homan’s “border czar” reputation should have everyone paying close attention.\n\nThe 64-year-old got his start as a police officer in New York, but by 1984, he landed a job in California as a border patrol officer, according to his bio. At the time, President Ronald Reagan was focused on balancing enforcement with the legalization of undocumented immigrants already inside the country.\n\nHoman soon rose through the ranks, even joining the Immigration and Naturalization Service. By 2013– during former President Barack Obama’s second term– he oversaw the Enforcement and Removal Operations branch of ICE, which had only been around for ten years at that point. \n\nThen-President Obama awarded Homan the Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Service— one of the highest civil service honors— for his effectiveness in managing deportation operations during the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nAn estimated 432,000 deportations were carried out in 2013 making history as the highest annual report ever. Even deportations in Trump’s first term never touched those numbers, according to the Associated Press. After all of his success, Homan retired in 2017 when Trump first took office. During his 2017 retirement party, however, a phone call from then-Chief of Staff John Kelly totally changed Homan’s plans.\n\n“I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE],” Homan told the Daily Caller. “Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back.”\n\nAs luck would have it, Trump’s search for strong leadership committed to building a southern border wall, family separation and mass deportation ended with Homan coming out of retirement. He’s often credited for introducing the family separation policy to deter immigration in 2014, but Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reportedly scrapped the idea, according to The Atlantic. In 2018, however, family separation became a leading effort under Trump’s policy thanks to Homan.\n\n“If you’re in the country illegally, you should be concerned,” Homan previously told the AP. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be. Just like if I go speeding down the highway, are you worried about getting a ticket? If you lie on your taxes, are you worried about an audit?“\n\nHoman’s approach to deportations largely mirrors Trump’s. Both rarely make exceptions for undocumented immigrations and are unapologetic about it. They were a match made in heaven…until Homan retired again in 2018.\n\nOh, but Homan couldn’t stay away for too long. Trump 2.0 brought him out of retirement once more. Now, the president has celebrated Homan as his “border czar,” a term he previously used to criticize former Vice President Kamala Harris. The White House fully stood behind Homan last year following allegations he accepted cash during a 2024 undercover FBI probe. Investigations into the accusations were ultimately shut down by Trump.\n\nThat brings us to 2026 when Homan declared, “I will run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.” Now that he’s on the ground in Minneapolis, it seems the border czar is trying to accomplish this major feat.\n\nHe announced the new Minneapolis effort will now focus on “targeted” operations and that will be “safer, more efficient, by the book.” But Homan stressed, “We are not surrendering the president’s mission on immigration enforcement.”","summary":"Here's everything you should know about White House border czar Tom Homan ahead of his ICE takeover in Minneapolis.\n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/who-is-tom-homan-trump-s-border-czar-sent-to-take-over-2000087125","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/30095452/GettyImages-2258854363-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 12:54:30","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":397711248,"title":"Michael Barone: Big Surprises in the 2030 Census Estimates","text":"About a month late, presumably due to last fall’s government shutdown, the Census Bureau has released its estimates of the populations of the 50 states and the District of Columbia for July 1, 2025.\n\nIt provides an interesting picture of what the country is, and is becoming, halfway through the decade of the 2020s and one-quarter of the way through (have we really gotten this far?) the 21st century. It also provides some political dynamite, all the more explosive because of Census Bureau statisticians’ deserved reputation for apolitical rigor and willingness to admit mistakes, as it did on the COVID-19-plagued 2020 Census.\n\nThe headline story is the sharp rise and sharp fall in immigration. The notion that immigration exploded sharply during the Biden administration and contracted sharply during the second Trump administration is not political propaganda.\n\nAfter the expiration of most COVID-19 restrictions, immigration rose to 1.8 million in 2021-22, 2.6 million in 2022-23, and 3.2 million in 2023-24.\n\nThe snapback to 1.9 million in 2024-25 reflects changes in both outgoing and incoming administrations. With the election looming, the Biden administration in early 2024 discovered that current legislation let it restrict immigration in ways it had claimed it didn’t before, and under the same legislation, the Trump administration immediately stopped almost all illegal border crossings. Government policy can make a difference.\n\nTaking that into account, the Census Bureau estimates immigration will fall well below 500,000 in 2025-26. That’s comparable to the sharp falloff of immigration during the financial and economic crises of 2007-08.\n\nThat means the nation’s total population increase is sharply down, especially in the states centered on the nation’s four largest metropolitan areas, which either grew just barely (New York and Illinois) or lost population (California). Meanwhile, every state in the Midwest gained population, and five states grew above the national rate.\n\nEven more striking, 44% of the nation’s population gains in 2020-25 came in just the two states of Texas and Florida. When you add in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina — with the nation’s higher percentage growth in 2024-25 — and Tennessee, you have 70% of the total national popular gain, all in states carried by Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nProjecting 2020-25 or 2024-25 patterns ahead of the 2030 Census and the reapportionment of U.S. House seats among the states that automatically follows results in a sharp change of political balance. Two different projections have California losing four House seats and Texas gaining four, leaving California with 48, only marginally larger than Texas’s 42.\n\nOne has Florida gaining four and New York and Illinois losing two each, while the other has Florida gaining two and New York and Florida losing one each, with the same net partisan effect. There is agreement that five more or less Republican states will gain one seat each (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah, Idaho) and that five more or less Democratic states will lose one each — Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon.\n\nApply either set of projections to the 2024 presidential election totals, and Trump gains either nine or 11 electoral votes — and wins even if he loses his three closest states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The blue wall has become a purple flowerbed.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Democrats will be frozen out of the White House. Changes in opinion of a magnitude often experienced can render the 2024 numbers obsolete. But one can see difficulties, even in 2028, if Democrats nominate one of the two California politicians, Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris, who top their polls. Will the nation be well served by policies that have prompted more people to leave than to head to a state with California’s beautiful scenery and comfortable climate?\n\nIt’s harder to be sure whether the 2030 Census will give Republicans a boost in Congress. The current ructions over mid-decade redistricting make prediction perilous. An intermediate court has blocked Virginia Democrats from gerrymandering, and a trial judge has ruled that the Voting Rights Act requires linking a Staten Island-dominated district to Manhattan rather than Brooklyn.\n\nBut almost certainly any political redistricting would rather be a Republican adding multiple districts in Texas and Florida than a Democrat required to eliminate some of his party’s incumbents in California, New York or Illinois. And heavily Democratic central cities will no longer be entitled to as much representation from masses of illegal immigrants protected from deportation but counted by census takers.\n\nA final caveat. Issues aren’t static, politicians aren’t around forever (even if Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers fear that), and voters move around amid changes in the political landscape. The Trump era has been full of surprises — who thought he’d win in 2024 because of increased Latino support? — and the 2030s, when Trump won’t be president nor be running for president, will have its surprises for us too.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2026 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/124721-big-surprises-in-the-2030-census-estimates-2026-01-30","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 12:44:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":397806928,"title":"The Worst of Don Lemon (Post-Arrest Edition)","text":"On Friday, it was reported that Don Lemon was arrested for his part in the invasion of a St. Paul, MN church.

They are trained to use horses to help control crowds, navigate difficult terrain, and assist in search and rescue when needed.In the Del Rio case, thousands of mostly Haitian migrants had gathered along the riverbank after crossing into the US seeking asylum. Border authorities were trying to manage the large influx, enforce immigration procedures, and prevent uncontrolled entries at points that were not official crossings.The White House, under the Biden-Harris administration, swiftly condemned the footage. Officials emphasised that such behaviour is unacceptable and inconsistent with US law and international human rights standards.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also acknowledged the reports of abuse, stating that investigations would be carried out. According to official statements, the department would review the conduct of agents involved and determine whether disciplinary or legal action is appropriate.Biden Administration Acted, Trump Didn'tFormer US President Joe Biden reacted strongly at the time, calling the images 'horrible' and saying it was 'outrageous' to see people treated that way. He promised that there would be an investigation and 'consequences'.Former Vice‑President Kamala Harris also criticised the sight, saying the treatment evoked 'some of the worst moments of our history', including references to slavery.Officials from the Department of Homeland Security promptly ordered an inquiry into how agents behaved. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) later released a detailed report concluding there was no evidence that agents struck migrants with whips or reins, and no whips were found among their equipment.However, the report did find that some agents used force or threatened force to coerce migrants back into the river, and at least one agent acted unprofessionally, including yelling offensive language and manoeuvring a horse near a child in an unsafe way.Four agents faced disciplinary actions for those conduct issues, even though the core allegation of whipping was rejected.Trump Administration's Foul Reaction to ICE-Linked DeathsOnline commentary has framed the incident as evidence that allegations of racial bias and brutality predate and outlast individual presidents, arguing that accountability has been limited and largely internal.As one X comment said, 'This racist brutality is not new; it was just easy for some to turn a blind eye when their team was in power'.Under President Trump's current administration, immigration enforcement has taken a far more aggressive turn, particularly in Minnesota. The federal government deployed thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents to Minneapolis under 'Operation Metro Surge', a hardline immigration enforcement campaign with violence at its core.Tragically, two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by federal immigration agents during these actions, prompting national outcry. Unfortunately, more are feared to have been affected or died, but no video evidence was present to condemn ICE agents.While Trump characterised the deaths as 'terrible' and insisted his enforcement policies remain necessary, he has defended federal agents, arguing that they are performing difficult jobs and should not be faulted for isolated incidents.As the video circulates anew, it has become less about relitigating 2021 and more about a broader reckoning with how the United States polices its borders — and whether past investigations have truly addressed the fears the images still provoke.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/resurfaced-video-us-border-patrol-shows-them-horseback-whipping-haitian-migrants-1775070","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1787310/us-border-patrol-agents-horseback-whipping-haitian-migrants.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=1770482392790cf05f8e7f3c5ff5297a","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 11:53:39","author":"Thea Felicity","authors":["Thea Felicity"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":397724496,"title":"California waits for a star to emerge in the 2026 race for governor","text":"In a state that's home to nearly 40 million people and the fourth largest economy in the world, the race for California governor has been lost in the shadow of President Trump's combustible return to office and, thus far, the absence of a candidate charismatic enough to break out of the pack. For the first time in recent history, there is no clear front-runner with less than five months before the June primary election. “This is the most wide-open governor's race we've seen in California in more than a quarter of a century,” said Dan Schnur, a political communications professor who teaches at USC, Pepperdine and UC Berkeley. “We've never seen a multicandidate field with so little clarity and such an absence of anything even resembling a front-runner. “There's no precedent in the modern political era for a campaign that's this crowded,” Schnur said. Opinion polls bear this out, with more voters saying they are undecided or coalescing behind any of the dozen prominent candidates who have announced bids. Former Rep. Katie Porter (D-Irvine) led the field with the support of 21% of respondents in a survey of likely voters by the Public Policy Institute of California released in December. Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, also a Democrat, and former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, a Republican, won the support of 14% of poll respondents. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, also a member of the GOP, won the backing of 10%, while everyone else in the field was in the single digits, though some Democratic candidates who recently entered the race were not included. Recent gubernatorial campaigns have been dominated by larger-than-life personalities — global superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, eBay billionaire Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown, the scion of a storied California political family. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vaulted into the national spotlight after championing same-sex marriage while he was mayor of San Francisco, has become a national force in Democratic politics and is pondering a 2028 presidential run. Newsom won handily in the 2018 and 2022 races for California governor, and easily defeated a recall attempt during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is barred from running again due to term limits. Porter cheekily alluded to California's political power dynamic at a labor forum earlier this month. “Look, we’ve had celebrity governors. We’ve had governors who are kids of other governors, and we’ve had governors who look hot with slicked back hair and barn jackets. You know what?” Porter said at an SEIU forum in January. “We haven’t had a governor in a skirt. I think it’s just about ... time.” Gubernatorial contests in the state routinely attract national attention. But the 2026 contest has not. Despite California being at the center of many policies emanating from the Trump administration, notably the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants, this year's gubernatorial race has been overshadowed. Deadly wildfires, immigration raids, and an esoteric yet expensive battle about redrawing congressional districts are among the topics that dominated headlines in the state last year. Additionally, the race was frozen as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), state Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso weighed entering the contest. All opted against running for governor, leaving the field in flux. San José Mayor Matt Mahan's entry into the race on Thursday — relatively late to mount a gubernatorial campaign — exemplifies the unsettled nature of the race. \"We've made a lot of progress in San José, but getting to the next level requires bold leadership in Sacramento that's going to take on the status quo,” Mahan said in an interview before he announced his campaign. ”I have not heard anyone in the current field explain how they're going to help us in San José and other cities across the state end unsheltered homelessness, implement Prop. 36 [a 2024 ballot measure that increased penalties for certain drug and theft crimes], get people into treatment, bring down the cost of housing, the cost of energy.\" A critical question is who donors decide to back in a state that is home to the most expensive media markets in the nation. Candidates have to file fundraising reports on Feb. 2, data that will indicate who is viable. “I know from first-hand experience that there comes a day when a candidacy is no longer sustainable because of a lack of resources,” said Garry South, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked on national and state campaigns. “You have to pay the bills to keep the lights on, let alone having enough cash to communicate with our more than 23 million registered voters,” he added. “They don’t have much time to do it. The primary is just months away.” The state Democratic and Republican conventions are quickly approaching. A Republican may be able to win the GOP endorsement, but it's unlikely a Democrat will be able to secure their party’s nod because of the large number of candidates in the race. Political observers expect some Democratic candidates who have meager financial resources and little name identification among the electorate to be pressured to drop out of the race by party leaders so that the party can consolidate support behind a viable candidate.

She’s the most classy First Lady that’s ever lived. So beautiful. So fashionable. So smart. She speaks five languages and is way underrated and unfairly attacked by the establishment media, needless to say the fashion media,” Marlow said. “She’s never had her due, which she deserves.”\n\nHudson reminded Alex’s audience how Hollywood and the elite fashion media have spent more than a decade spurning Melania Trump, with the most notable example of that repudiation coming from Vogue Magazine. The British fashion outlet has refused to put Mrs. Trump on its cover while awarding Hilary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Kamala Harris with splashy spreads.\n\n“It was the easiest journalist call to make, Alex, and the elite fashion media blew it,” Hudson told Marlow. “They had the most glamorous First Lady in over fifty years and they’ve either mocked her or ignored her.”\n\nIt also harkens back to what Melania Trump’s longtime senior advisor and Melania producer Marc Beckman said about the pushback he’s received from inside the industry while promoting the film.\n\n“I saw we were getting blocked by certain people. There are forces that are literally against us. I want to overcome those liberal forces that are trying to stop this movie from being successful,” Beckman said last week in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot 125.\n\nIt’s all the more reason the right should go out and support Melania, Alex said.\n\n“I want people to go see this in the theaters. I don’t want you to wait to stream it. Don’t wait for streaming. Go out. Be with likeminded people, show of force, and let’s make it so that it is a profitable business to get into arts directed at people like us. I think this is super important,” Marlow said.\n\nMelania opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, January 30th.","summary":"\"I'm just going to say flat out, the success of the \"Melania\" film will be a massive middle finger to the Hollywood left,\" Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said Wednesday on \"The Alex Marlow Show\" on the Salem Radio Network.\n\n\nThe post Marlow: If the Right Shows up for the &#8216;Melania&#8217; Film, It Will Be a Massive Middle Finger to the Hollywood Left appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/01/30/marlow-if-the-right-shows-up-for-the-melania-film-it-will-be-a-massive-middle-finger-to-the-hollywood-left/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/IMG_5602-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 09:00:41","author":"Breitbart News","authors":["Breitbart News"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":397626490,"title":"Jewelry, art and toy train top list of priciest foreign gifts to Biden and other officials in 2024","text":"WASHINGTON — Foreign leaders and governments presented to former President Joe Biden, his wife, U.S. Cabinet members and other senior officials tens of thousands of dollars in gifts in the last year of the Biden administration, including a $19,000 painting, an $11,000 necklace, a $5,000 bracelet and in one case $15,000 in cash, according to the latest accounting from the State Department.\n\nThe annual report, published Thursday in the Federal Register by the department’s Bureau of Protocol, covers calendar year 2024 and does not include any gifts given to President Donald Trump or his administration in the first year of Trump’s second term.\n\nFederal employees are required to report gifts they receive from foreign officials that are worth more than $480.

Tim Walz says his time as a political candidate is over.\n\n“I will never run for an elected office again. Never again,” Walz, the Democratic Party’s 2024 vice presidential nominee, said in an interview with MS NOW.\n\nFacing stinging criticism from President Donald Trump, other Republicans, and even some Democrats over a massive fraud scandal rocking Minnesota, Walz earlier this month announced that he was dropping his 2026 bid for an unprecedented third term as governor of the blue-leaning state.\n\nBut at the time, he didn’t rule out any future runs for elected office.\n\nSince Walz’s announcement, the state has become the epicenter in the heated battle over Trump’s unprecedented crackdown on illegal immigration, following the fatal shootings by federal agents of two US citizens in Minneapolis who protested against federal agents during deportation operations.\n\nPointing to the protests against the actions by federal agents, Walz said there are “heroes on the streets that we don’t know their names.”\n\n“They’re never going to run for office, and those grass-tops leaders brought this administration to their knees this week to do something about it. So there’s other ways to serve, and I’ll find them,” the governor added in his Wednesday interview.\n\nWalz launched his re-election bid in September but in December started facing a barrage of incoming political fire over the large-scale theft, under his watch as governor, in a state that has long prided itself on good governance.\n\nMore than 90 people — most from Minnesota’s large Somali community — have been charged since 2022. \n\nHow much money has been stolen through alleged money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. \n\nBut the US attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion.\n\nFederal prosecutors said some of the dozens that have already pleaded guilty in the case used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and international vacations, with some of the funds also sent overseas and potentially into the hands of Islamic terrorists.\n\n“This is on my watch, I am accountable for this and, more importantly, I am the one that will fix it,” Walz told reporters in December, as he took responsibility for the scandal.\n\nNearly a dozen Republicans who are running to succeed Walz in the governor’s office are making the fraud scandal central to their campaigns.\n\nAnd on Thursday, as expected, longtime Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a gubernatorial campaign, giving her party a big boost as it aims to defend the governor’s office.\n\nThe 61-year-old Walz was raised in rural Nebraska and enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, soon after graduating from high school.\n\nWalz returned to Nebraska to attend Chadron State College, where he graduated in 1989 with a degree in social science education.\n\nHe taught English and American History in China for one year through a program at Harvard University before being hired in 1990 as a high school teacher and football and basketball coach in Nebraska. Six years later, he moved to Mankato, Minnesota, to teach geography at Mankato West High.\n\nWalz was deployed to Italy to support Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003 before retiring two years later from the National Guard.\n\nHe was elected to the House in 2006 and re-elected five times, representing Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District, a mostly rural district covering the southern part of the state that includes a number of midsize cities. \n\nDuring his last two years on Capitol Hill, he served as ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. \n\nWalz won election as governor in 2018 and re-election four years later.\n\nBut Walz was unknown to many Americans when then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose the Minnesota governor as her running mate in the summer of 2024, soon after she replaced then-President Joe Biden as the Democrats’ presidential nominee.\n\nWalz, during his three months as running mate, visually and vocally embraced the traditional role of political attack dog that has long been associated with vice presidential nominees.\n\nBut Harris and Walz fell short, losing the November 2024 election to Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance, as the Democratic Party ticket was swept in all seven crucial battleground states.\n\nPundits considered Walz a possible contender for the Democratic Party’s 2028 presidential nomination. \n\nBut Walz said in multiple interviews last summer that he had no interest in seeking the presidency.\n\nAnd the ongoing fraud scandal and his decision to end his gubernatorial re-election put an end to Walz’s recent tenure in national politics.","summary":"Tim Walz earlier this month announced that he was dropping his 2026 bid for an unprecedented third term as governor of Minnesota.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/30/us-news/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-says-hes-done-with-politics-after-dropping-2026-bid-for-third-term/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/120008558.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gTKv2GzE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-30 05:24:48","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":397573504,"title":"US State Department releases list of gifts from Indian leaders to US counterparts","text":"NEW YORK: The US State Department has released a compilation of gifts presented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as other Indian government officials to US leaders, including former President Joe Biden.The Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of State, submitted a comprehensive list of \"gifts received from foreign government sources\".\"The Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of State, submits the following comprehensive listing of the statements which, as required by law, federal employees filed with their employing agencies during calendar year 2024 concerning gifts received from foreign government sources.The compilation includes reports of both tangible gifts and gifts of travel or travel expenses of more than minimal value.

It also provides some political dynamite, all the more explosive because of Census Bureau statisticians' deserved reputation for apolitical rigor and willingness to admit mistakes, as it did on the COVID-19-plagued 2020 Census.\n\nThe headline story is the sharp rise and sharp fall in immigration. The notion that immigration exploded sharply during the Biden administration and contracted sharply during the second Trump administration is not political propaganda.\n\nAfter the expiration of most COVID-19 restrictions, immigration rose to 1.8 million in 2021-22, 2.6 million in 2022-23, and 3.2 million in 2023-24.\n\nThe snapback to 1.9 million in 2024-25 reflects changes in both outgoing and incoming administrations. With the election looming, the Biden administration in early 2024 discovered that current legislation let it restrict immigration in ways it had claimed it didn't before, and under the same legislation, the Trump administration immediately stopped almost all illegal border crossings. Government policy can make a difference.\n\nTaking that into account, the Census Bureau estimates immigration will fall well below 500,000 in 2025-26. That's comparable to the sharp falloff of immigration during the financial and economic crises of 2007-08.\n\nThat means the nation's total population increase is sharply down, especially in the states centered on the nation's four largest metropolitan areas, which either grew just barely (New York and Illinois) or lost population (California). Meanwhile, every state in the Midwest gained population, and five states grew above the national rate.\n\nEven more striking, 44 percent of the nation's population gains in 2020-25 came in just the two states of Texas and Florida. When you add in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina -- with the nation's higher percentage growth in 2024-25 -- and Tennessee, you have 70% of the total national popular gain, all in states carried by Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nProjecting 2020-25 or 2024-25 patterns ahead of the 2030 Census and the reapportionment of U.S. House seats among the states that automatically follows results in a sharp change of political balance. Two different projections have California losing four House seats and Texas gaining four, leaving California with 48, only marginally larger than Texas's 42.\n\nOne has Florida gaining four and New York and Illinois losing two each, while the other has Florida gaining two and New York and Florida losing one each, with the same net partisan effect. There is agreement that five more or less Republican states will gain one seat each (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah, Idaho) and that five more or less Democratic states will lose one each -- Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon.\n\nApply either set of projections to the 2024 presidential election totals, and Trump gains either nine or 11 electoral votes -- and wins even if he loses his three closest states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The blue wall has become a purple flowerbed.\n\nThat doesn't mean Democrats will be frozen out of the White House. Changes in opinion of a magnitude often experienced can render the 2024 numbers obsolete. But one can see difficulties, even in 2028, if Democrats nominate one of the two California politicians, Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris, who top their polls. Will the nation be well served by policies that have prompted more people to leave than to head to a state with California's beautiful scenery and comfortable climate?\n\nIt's harder to be sure whether the 2030 Census will give Republicans a boost in Congress. The current ructions over mid-decade redistricting make prediction perilous. An intermediate court has blocked Virginia Democrats from gerrymandering, and a trial judge has ruled that the Voting Rights Act requires linking a Staten Island-dominated district to Manhattan rather than Brooklyn.\n\nBut almost certainly any political redistricting would rather be a Republican adding multiple districts in Texas and Florida than a Democrat required to eliminate some of his party's incumbents in California, New York or Illinois. And heavily Democratic central cities will no longer be entitled to as much representation from masses of illegal immigrants protected from deportation but counted by census takers.\n\nA final caveat. Issues aren't static, politicians aren't around forever (even if Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers fear that), and voters move around amid changes in the political landscape. The Trump era has been full of surprises -- who thought he'd win in 2024 because of increased Latino support? -- and the 2030s, when Trump won't be president or running for president, will have their surprises for us too.\n\nMichael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.
