Wade era. Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care. In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said, “There can be no place for extremism in women’s health care.” In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows, “I have always supported women’s access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.” And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says, “I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.” It’s a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women’s lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions. The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans’ campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP’s failure to grasp the political power of women’s reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters. “The Republicans have always known they’re actually on the wrong side of this issue,” said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party’s shift “wouldn’t surprise me.” With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women’s access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades. On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it’s best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He’s also distanced himself from the far right’s longtime goal of a national abortion ban. With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party’s ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president’s ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer: “We are not going back.” The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration. Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. Voters didn’t always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement’s push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November’s promised “red wave” of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority. By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That’s an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision. In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares: “I’m pro-choice.” Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars “lying about Republican candidates’ positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.” “Republicans can’t let Democrats lie any longer — they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.” Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views — past and present. “Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,” said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats. House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars’ worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races. Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris’ example. Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed, “We’ll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.” Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions. Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — a historic accomplishment — during the former president’s term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority. First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans. One of the nation’s leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide. But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue. “Voters have a right to know where I stand,” Lawler said.

Among the posts Robinson is accused of making on the site, \"Nude Africa,\" includes one where he called himself \"a black NAZI.\" In another post, made during the Obama administration, Robinson allegedly wrote, \"I'd take Hitler over any of the sh** that's in Washington right now!\"Robinson is the first black lieutenant governor of North Carolina and is running with former President Donald Trump's endorsement. Some Republicans have called on Robinson to suspend his candidacy by the state's deadline at the end of the day Thursday, although he has said that he intends to remain in the race.When reached for comment, Robinson's campaign directed Newsweek to the lieutenant governor's video message shared to social media, in which he called CNN's story \"tabloid trash\" and denied being behind the comments.Stein, on the other hand, is running with the backing of current North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat and surrogate for Vice President Kamala Harris who has reached his two-term limit in office. Stein has held the lead for weeks in the race against Cooper, including in a poll released Thursday by Emerson College and The Hill, which found that 48 percent of likely voters support the Democrat.In comparison, Robison earned 40 percent of likely voters' support, while 10 percent of the 1,000 respondents said they were undecided. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points and was conducted between September 15 and 18.Earlier in the month, in a poll by Quinnipiac University, Stein was leading the race 51 percent to 41 percent, based on the responses of 940 voters between September 4 to 8. A Fox News poll conducted between August 23 to 26 gave Stein an even greater lead, finding that the Democrat was leading Robinson 54 percent to 43 percent out of 1,000 registered voters.Newsweek reached out to Stein's campaign for further comment Thursday evening.Robinson has been caught making inflammatory comments prior to Thursday's report from CNN. In a 2019 Facebook post, the GOP candidate said that abortion in America was about \"killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down.\" In 2021, prior to being elected lieutenant governor in 2022, Robinson described \"homosexuality\" and \"transgenderism\" as \"filth\" while speaking before a church.Cooper told Politico back in August that he had withdrawn from being considered for Harris' running mate because he feared that Robinson could build momentum in North Carolina in his absence.\"If I were to be out of state at a campaign event, if I had been the vice-presidential nominee, he could claim he was acting governor,\" Cooper said at the time.","summary":"Polling shows that Stein, a Democrat, is leading in the polls for North Carolina's next governor.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/josh-stein-chances-beating-mark-robinson-polls-1956683","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476448/josh-steins-chances-beating-mark-robinson.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:54:53","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":256828990,"title":"‘Uncommitted’ Pro-Palestine Voting Group Says It Won’t Endorse Harris, ‘Opposes’ Trump Presidency","text":"A pro-Palestine group that pushed for thousands of “uncommitted” votes against the president in Michigan’s primary election has said it will not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris even as it urges voters to reject former President Donald Trump. The group added that it “opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing.” The Uncommitted National Movement is also urging its supporters against voting for third-party candidates, seeing that as another path to a Trump victory. The pro-Palestine group is frustrated that Harris did not respond by its self-imposed Sept. 15 deadline to meet with Palestinian American families who have lost loved ones during the Israel–Hamas war or to discuss plans to block arms shipments to Israel. They also pushed for a Palestinian speaker at August’s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which never came to fruition. “For months, we have urged Vice President Harris to shift her Gaza policy so we could mobilize voters in key states to save lives and our democracy. The DNC and the Vice President’s campaign fumbled even a small gesture to unite our party ahead of November by rejecting the simple request of a Palestinian American speaker,” the group added. Michigan is a critical battleground in the race for the Electoral College. Previously considered part of the “blue wall” of northern states that have leaned toward Democrats in recent decades, Trump won the state in 2016 by roughly 10,000 votes, but Joe Biden won it back in 2020 with a margin of more than 2 percent. That Democratic support, however, saw cracks in February when more than 100,000 people cast “uncommitted” votes against Biden in Michigan’s presidential primary to protest his military and humanitarian support for Israel. The state has one of the country’s largest populations of Arab American voters. The “uncommitted” campaign was continued in other states nationwide throughout the 2024 presidential primary cycle. While Harris has recently been empathetic about the situation for Palestinians in Gaza, she has remained committed to Biden’s foreign policies and has said she supports Israel’s “ability to defend itself” while pushing for a hostage and cease-fire deal. “We are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done … And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination, and security as we move forward and get a two-state deal done,” she said during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Sept. 17.","summary":"Earlier this year, 100,000 voters in Michigan cast 'uncommitted' votes in the Democratic primary.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/uncommitted-pro-palestine-voting-group-says-it-wont-endorse-harris-opposes-trump-presidency-5727039","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/25/id5637576-Michigan-Uncommitted-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:50:36","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":256828392,"title":"Harris, Oprah to campaign in Detroit","text":"Harris, Oprah to campaign in Detroit Oprah Winfrey will join Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, Thursday.

The market recovered days later.The stock market on Thursday closed at an all-time high, undermining messaging from Trump and other Republicans who have insisted that President Joe Biden and Harris have \"destroyed\" the economy.Also on Thursday, a scandal erupted after CNN reported that Trump-endorsed Republican North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson previously described himself as a \"black NAZI\" and advocated for a return to slavery on a pornography website. Messages tied to Robinson on the site also expressed his proclivity for \"tranny on girl\" porn.Robinson has refused to drop out of the race, potentially harming Trump's hopes of winning the Tar Heel State, which is considered a battleground this year despite leaning Republican in recent election cycles.Additionally, a Michigan judge ruled on Wednesday that Robert F.

During the meeting, the leaders will discuss the state of war between Russia and Ukraine, including Kyiv’s strategy planning and the US’ support for Ukraine’s defence against Russia amid the ongoing war. In a statement, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “On Thursday, September 26, President Biden will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine at the White House. Vice President Harris will also meet separately with President Zelenskyy at the White House.”“The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine’s strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. The President and Vice President will emphasize their unshakeable commitment to stand with Ukraine until it prevails in this war,” she added. During his meeting with Biden, Zelenskyy will present Ukraine’s Plan for Victory. The Ukrainian President expects to discuss the details of this plan and the US’ support for Ukraine in its right to freedom. He will address the United Nations General Assembly and meet world leaders on the sidelines of UNGA. In a statement, the Ukrainian President’s Office stated, “Next week, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the United States.

The United States has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Earlier this month, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that Biden will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his counterpart from Ukraine, this month, and that Washington is preparing a “substantial” round of further help for Kyiv.“I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war, and that is what President Zelenskyy says he is bringing,” Sullivan said.Notably, Sullivan delivered his remarks via videolink at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Al Jazeera reported.“So we are very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation,” he said.Sullivan said that the recent events in the region are of “unique concern.” In addition, the White House advisor stated that Biden is attempting to place Ukraine in the “best possible position to prevail” in his remaining months in office, Al Jazeera reported. Notably, Biden is not running for reelection, and his tenure expires in January.“President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those negotiations,” he said.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/09/us-president-biden-to-meet-ukrainian-counterpart-zelenskyy-next-week-discuss-war-situation-white-house/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/us-president-biden-to-meet-ukrainian-counterpart-zelenskyy-next-week-discuss-war-situation-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:31:18","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.162},{"id":256828558,"title":"Democrat Nearly Doubles Lead in Arizona Senate Race, Poll Shows","text":"Democratic Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego has nearly doubled his lead over Republican candidate Kari Lake for independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema's soon-to-be vacant seat, according to the two most recent Morning Consult state polls.The latest Morning Consult poll of 474 likely voters was conducted primarily after the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, from September 9 to September 18.

Chris Sununu. And the results of the survey and another poll released in the Granite State earlier in the week suggest former President Trump's standing in New Hampshire in the White House race may be a drag on down-ballot Republicans. According to a University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll released Thursday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee and former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig holds a razor-thin 47%-46% edge over former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, the Republican nominee. A poll released earlier this week from the Saint Anselm College Survey Center also indicated a coin-flip race, with Ayotte holding a slight edge. NEW HAMPSHIRE MAKES PRIMARY PICKS IN 2024 ELECTION Ayotte, thanks to her six years in the Senate and her tenure as a state attorney general before her service on Capitol Hill, has far greater name identification than Craig and has a sizable campaign cash advantage over her rival. But the new polls suggest Trump may be doing Ayotte no favors. WHAT AYOTTE TOLD FOX NEWS ALONG THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CAMPAIGN TRAIL \"Kelly's very popular, but I do think Trump's a burden,\" longtime Granite State-based GOP consultant and former state attorney general Tom Rath told Fox News. Trump came within roughly 3,000 votes of carrying New Hampshire in his 2016 presidential election victory. But four years ago, President Biden topped Trump by over seven points in New Hampshire. The UNH poll indicates Trump is down by 11 points to Vice President Kamala Harris. And the Saint Anselm College survey points to an upper single-digit lead for Harris in New Hampshire. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POLLING \"If this were a straight-up election without the presidential race on it, I think Kelly would have a lead outside the margin of error,\" argued Rath, who stayed unaffiliated in the 2024 Republican presidential primary race and served as a top adviser to Trump rival and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the 2016 GOP nomination battle. A New Hampshire-based Republican strategist told Fox News \"Trump is definitely an anchor on Kelly and her campaign right now, and she's the flagship.\" The strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, noted that Ayotte's \"status as a flagship means everybody's taking shots at her. There's not a lot of evidence of activity in New Hampshire by the Trump campaign, so it's really Kelly versus the world right now.\" And another Granite State-based Republican consultant also pointed to meager involvement and resources in New Hampshire coming from the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"Kelly's out fighting this thing all by herself. That's not a good place to be. You need other people drawing fire,\" said the consultant, who also asked for anonymity. \"[Trump's] not focusing on New Hampshire. His bad poll numbers and lack of enthusiasm is dragging the whole ticket down.\" Craig, who served three two-year terms steering the Granite State’s largest city, narrowly topped Cinde Warmington, the only Democrat on the state’s five-member Executive Council, to capture their party’s nomination in last week's state primary. Ayotte, a former state attorney general before winning election to the Senate in 2010, soundly defeated former New Hampshire Senate President Chuck Morse to win the GOP gubernatorial nomination. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sununu, who decided against running for re-election this year after winning four straight two-year terms as New Hampshire governor (New Hampshire and neighboring Vermont are the only states in the nation that elect governors every two years) endorsed Ayotte this summer in her primary race. And Ayotte pledges to continue the Sununu agenda if elected to succeed the popular GOP governor. Ayotte was a rising star in the Republican Party in 2016 with a burgeoning profile on national security as she was running for re-election. But just ahead of the 2016 election, she withdrew her support for Trump over the \"Access Hollywood\" controversy, when Trump made crude comments about grabbing women without their consent. \"I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\" Ayotte said at the time. Ayotte lost re-election by a razor-thin margin of just over 1,000 votes to then-Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte stayed neutral in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary, but she endorsed Trump in early March, right after he clinched the GOP nomination. Rath, pointing to Ayotte's backing of Trump, said \"her position, which was to embrace him and not create space, I understand why she's made it, and you take the consequences of it … if that's the top of the ticket, and you're the next level down, it's really hard to get around that problem in a race.\" Also working against Ayotte is an avalanche of negative ads that have been running against her all summer, courtesy of national Democratic groups. The attacks have helped to raise Ayotte's negative ratings in both the UNH Survey Center and Saint Anselm College polls.

The agent opened fire, but the suspect escaped, before being arrested nearby. Neither Trump, nor anyone he was with, were harmed. And there's a lot we still don't know about the 58-year-old who's now in custody, charged with gun offences. But the awful sense of deja vu over what was quickly assessed as a second apparent attempt in two months to take the former president's life doesn't just prompt concerns about the level of protection he's being provided with. It also raises troubling questions about the ongoing threat posed by political violence in the United States. A blame game Trump avoided casting political blame in the immediate aftermath of the first assassination attempt, in Pennsylvania, briefly arguing that he wanted to use the moment to work towards national unity. But he didn't hold back this time, telling Fox News the suspect \"believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it\". \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out,\" he said. Trump had last week argued in his debate with Vice-President Kamala Harris that he \"probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me\". \"They talk about democracy, 'I'm a threat to democracy'. They're the threat to democracy,\" he said. Democrats have repeatedly argued a second Trump term would threaten US democracy, pointing to his handling of the January 6 Capitol attack and to comments such as his statement that he wouldn't be a dictator, \"other than day one\". Both President Joe Biden and Harris expressed relief that the former president wasn't injured in the latest incident, and they each spoke to him on the phone in the days afterwards. But the vice-president later criticised Trump over his own rhetoric, accusing him of \"spewing lies\" in relation to unfounded claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. \"We've got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that, as usual, is designed to divide us as a country,\" she told an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). Authorities in Springfield have reported more than 30 bomb threat hoaxes since rumours, amplified by Trump on the debate stage, took hold, prompting police officers to be deployed to local schools. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said many of the threats had come from an unnamed foreign country, and were being treated as \"one more opportunity to mess with the United States.\" But Harris again referenced the situation in Springfield in that same NABJ event when she argued there were \"far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe\". \"Not everybody has Secret Service,\" she said. Trump, however, says he's planning a visit to Springfield in the next two weeks, telling supporters in New York, \"You may never see me again, but that's OK.\" \"'Whatever happened to Trump?' 'Well, he never got out of Springfield,'\" he said. Calls for calm as campaigning continues Both Biden and Harris have again argued this week that there's \"no place\" for political violence in the US. But FBI director Christopher Wray told Congress, in the wake of the first attempt on Trump's life in July, that it was \"out of control\". \"We get thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of tips reported to us and the language that's out there is just mind-bogglingly hateful,\" he said at the time. Only this week, an Alaska man was charged with threatening to assassinate Supreme Court justices, and suspicious packages were mailed to election officials in more than 15 states. And earlier this year, a man was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to kidnap former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and for attacking her husband with a hammer. The attack at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, led to intense scrutiny of the Secret Service, and a stepping up of protection. The suspected second attempt has sparked a new debate over how the agency is funded. But with less than two months to go until election day, both candidates are ploughing ahead with their campaigns – as Americans nervously hope there won't be any further scares. One to watch: A weekend trip to Delaware As the end of Biden's first and only term in the White House approaches, the president appears to be in the mood for reflection. So much so that he's invited the Australian prime minister, among others, to his personal residence and his old high school. The president will host the leaders of the Quad grouping, made up of the US, Australia, Japan and India, in Delaware this weekend. The White House argues \"foreign policy is personal\", and that Biden is seeking to build on the relationships he's developed with each leader over his time in office. But Washington's press corps has complained that the media is being kept out of his Wilmington home, where one-on-one meetings will take place outside of the main Quad gathering. \"I can't remember a time where this president has had a bilateral meeting on US soil and the press and therefore the American people were blocked from seeing it,\" White House Correspondents' Association president Eugene Daniels said in a statement. Amid political pressure at home, Anthony Albanese has stressed the speedy nature of his visit to the US. But in what could be his last official in-person meeting with Biden, it's likely to be a memorable trip.

Gavin Newsom on Thursday was noncommittal when pressed about whether he plans to campaign against Proposition 36, a controversial anti-crime measure on the November ballot that targets theft and drug offenses and has divided Democrats. \"I fear I can't do everything,\" Newsom said Thursday in San Francisco's Mission district during the signing of a major affordable housing package, saying that there is a lot on his plate between now and election day. \"I'm trying to get Kamala Harris elected president of the United States. ... I just pray, I really do, people take a good look at Proposition 36.\" The ballot measure addresses drug and theft crimes by implementing stiffer penalties for repeat retail theft offenders, regardless of the value of merchandise stolen. It also would mandate drug treatment as an option, instead of jail time, for those who commit certain drug crimes. The measure would alter critical parts of Proposition 47, a ballot measure that voters overwhelmingly passed in 2014. A new poll published Thursday found that 71% of likely California voters said they would vote in favor of Proposition 36. Another poll published in August by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that a smaller portion of voters, 56%, are likely to support Proposition 36. \"I was wondering what state I was living in,\" Newsom said when he saw the poll results Thursday morning. \"I know people are angry, I know people are frustrated. I am too. But this is not the way of solving it.\" For nearly nine months, Newsom has criticized the initiative, warning that the harms to Black and Latino communities will be \"next-level.\" He reiterated Thursday a point he has made several times during his last few public appearances: the fact that the measure is missing a funding plan. Newsom called it an \"unfunded mandate.\" Legislative analysts project it could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually. \"There's not one dollar attached to it,\" said Newsom. \"There's this notion that it's treatment on demand, which is a hell of a thing, considering there is not one dollar attached.\" The governor went on to criticize the drug treatment component of the measure, pointing out that it \"guarantees\" mental health treatment but questioning how that enforcement would work when residential treatment facilities in 22 of the state's 58 counties \"don't exist.\" He cautioned, \"It's about mass incarceration, it's about a 1980s mind-set.\" Proponents of Proposition 36 include a group of county district attorneys, law enforcement groups, three major Democratic mayors including London Breed of San Francisco, Matt Mahan of San José and Todd Gloria of San Diego, and a handful of moderate Democratic legislators. Major funders of the initiative include Walmart, who recently gave another million dollars. Target and Home Depot were initial funders, according to financial filings. Meanwhile, major donors are ramping up on the No on Proposition 36 including from major criminal justice reform donors Patty Quillin with $500,000, Stacy Schusterman with $325,000, Quinn Delaney with $225,000 and the ACLU of Northern California with $120,000. Opponents of the measure include a long list of elected Democrats and criminal justice advocacy groups. Along with Proposition 36, Newsom referred to a slew of other November ballot measures that concern him, including a measure that could raise taxes on health insurance providers. He expressed doubt about his ability to campaign against them. \"It's a question of bandwidth,\" the governor said.","summary":"Gov.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-19/newsom-probably-wont-star-in-election-ads-opposing-proposition-36-but-cautions-voters-take-a-good-look","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39403ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5196x2728+0+368/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5a%2F61%2Ff89e921b43648b7ff6f9f365a714%2Fcalifornia-ai-regula","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:01:29","author":"Anabel Sosa","authors":["Anabel Sosa"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":256827738,"title":"Letters: Prop. 4 | Nguyen for supervisor | Trump’s rhetoric | Hateful speech | Real issues | Factory farms","text":"Prop. 4 an investment to fight climate change Re: “Now isn’t time for unfocused Prop. 4 bonds” (Page A6, Sept. 11). The recent editorial did a good job detailing the costs associated with bond measures. It is not free money and comes from the state’s general fund. Proposition 4 would increase California’s payments for environment-related bonds to about $1.8 billion of an overall $311 billion budget. Prop 4 is a wise investment. Natural hazard mitigation saves $6 on average for every $1 spent, and California’s Natural Resources Agency estimates that the cost of climate change to our state will be more than $200 billion by 2050. Perhaps the question we should be asking is: Are we spending enough now to deal with an increasingly expensive future? Forty percent of Proposition 4 expenditures must directly benefit lower-income or climate-vulnerable communities. It also requires regular public spending reports. California needs bold, big-scale climate funding plans. If not now, when? Vote yes on Proposition 4.

Mark Wilson San Jose Trump’s rhetoric is driving political violence Re: “Normalization of political violence in the modern era is scary situation” (Page A1, Sept. 17). Since the beginning of his rallies, Donald Trump has been spewing hate and verbal violence. He blames Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for the attempts on his life; but, with his totally unfounded descriptions of Haitian immigrants eating neighbors’ pets, he has thrown the town of Springfield, Ohio, into chaos with the Haitian people fearing for their lives. I agree with Rep. James Crow, D-Colorado, that political violence has become pervasive and normative in our nation, and I lay its source and continuance at the feet of Trump. Rosemary Everett Campbell GOP’s hateful speech is backfiring on them Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have not campaigned on scary, false stories about immigrants consuming neighbors’ pets, the execution of newborn infants, communism taking over our country, etc. Donald Trump and JD Vance have used such hateful, violent rhetoric that they’re inciting hate mongers and especially unbalanced people to arm themselves. Some are apparently ready to become violent and stalk candidates. I shudder to think of what can happen in the next month and a half before the election, let alone after. Consider the prediction Trump made about a “bloodbath” if he loses. His hateful comments appear to be backfiring. He and Vance need to shut down the hate. Lynda Martinez San Jose Harris, Trump should focus on real issues Gas and grocery prices are still too high, and food prices are still going up. On top of that, there’s no sign the wars in Ukraine or Israel might ever end. As election time draws near, what are Kamala Harris and Donald Trump worried about? Harris is worried about keeping abortions legal, and Trump thinks immigrants might be eating my cat. Seriously, both of them need to stick with the issues most important to voters right now.

We can’t let them make 25 and 30%.” The average credit card interest rate was 21.5% as of this past May, according to data provided by the Federal Reserve. Rates had surged starting in early 2022 amid red-hot inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit card interest rates have never dipped to 10% in the Fed’s dataset, which dates back to 1994. But critics warned Trump’s plan would most hurt those he professed to help. “Government-imposed price controls on credit card interest rates would harm all cardholders, especially the lowest income Americans who these measures are intended to help,” a banking industry insider at the Consumer Banking Association told The Post Thursday. “This will result in credit cards only being given to consumers who have high income and credit scores who post little risk to card issuers.” Peter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management argued that “Trump just proposed his own version of price controls.” “That would destroy the industry and millions of Americans would lose their credit cards,” he added. “There are heavy losses in credit cards from people who don’t pay. So they need the high interest rates to offset that. There is also a lot of fraud.” Trump and his allies had slammed Harris after she unveiled a plan to crack down on so-called price gouging in the food industry last month. The 45th president blasted her as a “Marxist” and suggested her proposal was “communist” in practice. Back in 2019, several pols, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) backed a measure to cap credit card interest payments at 15%. “We have opposed similar interest rate cap proposals in the past,” said a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association, an industry group representing banks and their employees nationwide. “They would result in the loss of credit for the very consumers who need it the most. Instead, these consumers would be forced to use less-regulated, more risky alternatives including payday lenders and loan sharks.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request from The Post to clarify how it would bring about a credit card rate cap. Ahead of the Long Island rally, Trump also pledged that he’d dramatically slash the price of car insurance. “Your Automobile Insurance is up 73% — VOTE FOR TRUMP, I’LL CUT THAT NUMBER IN HALF!” he posted on X. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced the first major rate cut since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As he previously hinted, Powell opted to go big and slash the Fed’s benchmark interest rate target by a whopping 50 basis points — half a percentage point — to a range between 4.75% and 5%, down from 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed’s benchmark target rate is closely watched because it can impact other key interest rates.","summary":"\"Trump just proposed his own version of price controls,\" one economist said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/us-news/trump-pitches-capping-annual-credit-card-rates-at-10-we-cant-let-them-make-25-and-30/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-yfeaivsxq-1726785479891.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726771111&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:58:20","author":"James Franey,Ryan King","authors":["James Franey","Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":256826714,"title":"Immediate Investigation of Ohio Sheriff Urged for Reportedly Intimidating Democratic Voters","text":"Following reports that Ohio sheriff Bruce Zuchowski is collecting the addresses of individuals supporting the Democratic nominee for President VP Kamala Harris in order to target them at a later date, Democrats wrote to AG Merrick Garland requesting an immediate investigation into Zuchowski. In other words, some Democrats aren’t sleeping on voter intimidation this time around. With just three weeks until voting begins in Ohio, members of the House Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government Ranking Member Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) wrote to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division investigate the disturbing reports: I write to request that the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division investigate disturbing reports that an Ohio sheriff is collecting the addresses of individuals who display campaign material for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in order to target those individuals at a later date. This clear attempt by an elected Republican official to intimidate Democratic voters in his jurisdiction demands the Departmentâs immediate attention.” The evidence submitted in the letter includes: In public Facebook posts on both his personal and campaign accounts on September 13, 2024, the sheriff of Portage County, Ohio, Bruce Zuchowski, posted photos of Fox News television stories about âKamalaâs open bordersâ and wrote: “When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip – Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins??I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo…when the Illegal human “Locust” (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” Sheriff Zuchowskiâs intimidation efforts appear to have been successful: after his post, some residents began following his instructions and posted in Facebook comments the addresses of residents with yard signs supporting Vice President Harris. This is giving turning in your neighbor who claims she had a miscarriage vibes, and yes, that is a thing Republicans tried years ago and seem intent on doing again. Residents started the complaints, noting how alarmed and scared they are. A Republican official even resigned from the countyâs Republican Central Committee due to Zuchowskiâs targeting of people with different beliefs, calling it bullying “from the highest law enforcement official in Portage County.â These allegations are deeply disturbing and represent an actual direct violation of the right to free speech. A government official targeting individuals over political signs is an actual example of what the right to free speech is meant to protect. The letter notes, “Another resident said of the sheriff: ‘Heâs a top law enforcement official in Portage County. Heâs supposed to be upholding the law â¦ What that statement was on Facebook was intended for oppression, intimidation, and suppression of freedom of speech. I would like to turn to law enforcement but what happens when law enforcement is the one making those threats.’” This kind of bullying of Democratic voters has been going on around this country since Trump first descended that escalator. It’s routine to have Democratic political signs stolen and destroyed, houses targeted, and worse yet voters targeted outside of the polling places. While these stories are sometimes told in local papers, people I’ve asked if I can tell their story are often too scared to put their names to their fears and experiences. People in MAGA heavy areas are often afraid to put Democratic supporting signs up, and make casual reference to needing security cameras if they do. This is the reality for people who are not Trump voters in the United States of America. The MAGA movement is one of political intimidation and even terrorism as we’ve seen from January 6th to Springfield. Yet legacy media continues to lecture Americans that they need to “respect” MAGA voters. I note that they write these opinion pieces from their politically safe blue cities, from the vantage point of their own privilege as people who can always get law enforcement to help them, unlike many Americans. One thing to take away from MAGA’s ongoing intimidation of voters and election officials is that this is something incited by a leader who doesn’t think he can win fairly. It’s also a clear sign of how Trump intends to rule if allowed back into the White House — abusing power, weaponizing the government against citizens who don’t support him, and scaring people into submission.

Harris has been unapologetic about her stance on abortion rights for women, and she continued with a post on X Thursday. \"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: The government, and certainly Donald Trump, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\" she said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Dungy, the first Black head coach to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the modern era and second all-time, is a man of faith and questioned Harris. \"Dear VP Harris: I hear you make this statement all the time,\" Dungy wrote in a quote tweet. \"Exactly what ‘faith’ are you talking about when you say you don’t have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)? \"Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general ‘faith’ that says we’re good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What ‘faith’ are you talking about?\" HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES ‘NO EXCEPTION,’ MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE Harris has pledged that if Congress were to pass a bill to reinstate the protections that Roe v. Wade guaranteed, she would \"proudly sign it into law\" if elected president in November. Meanwhile, Trump commended the United States Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade, which has allowed states to handle the issue. Dungy also reposted former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson’s quote tweet over a Sept. 17 Harris tweet, which said, \"A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school. This is exactly what we feared when Roe vs. Wade was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans prevent doctors from providing basic medical care.\" \"Amber Thurman’s tragic death was caused by complications from legal abortion drugs and gross medical malpractice,\" Watson responded. \"She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia’s pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate. \"Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.\" On Dungy’s tweet, one commenter wrote, \"I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.\" \"I guess you didn’t see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote ‘Yes’ on it,\" Dungy replied. Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying, \"I’ll be voting no.\" Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances. \"President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,\" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, said after his NBC News interview. Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump’s abortion platform would make no exception \"even for rape and incest.\" \"A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\" Harris said. \"Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.\" Trump said moments before Harris’ statement he does believe \"strongly\" in exceptions for abortion. \"I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,\" Trump said during a debate. \"I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also.

Sabato speculated before the report was released that it could bring down Trump and Robinson in North Carolina. “Our Crystal Ball rating for NC Governor has been Lean D. Mark Robinson (R) was going to lose even before this new story,” he said. “The question is whether Robinson brings down the top of the ticket (Donald Trump) with him.

Despite many conservatives (including Trump) calling for the agency to revoke Disney’s broadcast licenses for ABC after the debate, the FCC‘s chair Jessica Rosenworcel wrote in a letter that, as an agency that stands for the First Amendment, it could take no such action. “The First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy,” Rosenworcel wrote in the letter, addressed to Sen.

Amid all of this, Fallon recently highlighted the moment when Vance broke the 'first rule of fake news,' which was parodied on his show, The Tonight Show. On Monday, September 16, the comedian said, \"JD Vance admitted that he created the false claim about immigrants eating pets to create media attention. Trump was like, ‘Everyone knows the first rule of fake news is not admitting to fake news.’\" Adding on he said, \"But besides being overtly racist and making Trump look like a total fool at the debate, no harm done, right?\" according to the HuffPost. For context, the commentary came after Vance spread unverified claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of the residents of Springfield, Ohio. \"Clearly these rumors are out there because constituents are seeing it with their own eyes, and some of them are talking about it,\" Vance previously told NBC’s Kristen Welker. Vance also controversially stated that immigrants are spreading diseases and increasing the crime rates in the states. On Sunday, September 15 during an appearance on CNN, news presenter Dana Bash told Vance that the Clark County sheriff and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had reported that there had been only two calls to 911 in the past 11 months complaining about Haitian immigrants stealing geese from parks. When Bash inquired if he had ever been to Springfield, he said, \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast,\" per the HuffPost. When the journalist and news presenter asked him if he would openly admit that he spread the rumors for political gains, Vance responded with an even more confusing analogy. \"I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. But yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering created by Kamala Harris’ policies,\" while claiming that his source of the dogs and cats being eaten story was based on undocumented information. As such, Fallon's take on Vance has once again stirred the conversation behind the actual motivation of such stories. In a previous string of jokes cracked on the Trump-Vance campaign, the late-night show host claimed that Trump must be wishing to for a certain arrangement with his running mate, just in case of a fallout. The reports of a little disagreement and the ex-POTUS being furious with Vance inspired Fallon to joke, \"This is why I always sign a prenup,\" as reported by the Independent, leaving the listeners in stitches.","summary":"The commentary by Jimmy Fallon came after JD Vance spread the lies about immigrants eating the pets of the residents of Springfield, Ohio.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/jimmy-fallon-catches-jd-vance-slipping-and-breaking-the-first-rule-of-fake-news","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/716265/uploads/6516dfa0-766f-11ef-b4a6-d7f7e3751d2d_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:33:01","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":256827960,"title":"What Happened to Elon Musk","text":"Elon Musk has said some shocking things online in recent days, even by his standards. He amplified conspiracy theories about the presidential debate, promoted false claims about the Democrats, and wrote a now-deleted post suggesting that it was suspicious that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala” (in follow-up posts, Musk claimed that he was just joking). I spoke with my colleague Charlie Warzel, who covers technology, about how Musk, a man once known primarily for his inventions and contributions in Silicon Valley, became a mouthpiece for the MAGA movement. From the Fringes Lora Kelley: Elon Musk has been crossing into the worlds of conspiracism and disinformation for a while—but he seems to be taking things even further lately. Why might he be going this far? What’s in it for him? Charlie Warzel: It’s complicated, but it’s also deceptively simple. We can’t be inside this guy’s head, but he does seem to truly feed off of and love attention. Musk has been moving in a right-wing direction for a long time. But his purchase of Twitter and how he mishandled it—with advertisers, and de-verifying users—really alienated people and accelerated his turn. Many people used to think of him as the Thomas Edison of the 21st century. He was branded as this innovator and savvy businessman. When he walked into Twitter and made a mess of it, he lost cachet among this group of people who saw him as a genius. Now he’s trying very hard to appeal to the only people who really care about him anymore—including those who reside in the far right corners of the internet. Lora: Why is Musk getting so involved in this presidential election, and with Trump (who apparently said he would give Musk a role leading a government-efficiency commission if he wins)? Is he making some kind of play to be a great man of history, or is he after power in a potential Trump administration? Charlie: Elon Musk basically bought Donald Trump at the top. He endorsed him moments after the first assassination attempt, when Trump was riding a wave of positive attention, when Joe Biden was still in the race and it looked like Trump was probably going to dominate him. So much has changed since Musk endorsed Trump in July. If he were truly a savvy political operator, he would be hedging his bets right now, saying I can’t fully alienate myself from one political party, because I have all these government contracts and so many other interests that I need to be able to at least sit in a room with with Democrats. I think the fact that he has effectively just become the in-house social-media team for Donald Trump speaks to the fact that he’s not just making a political calculation. He’s not playing a game of 3-D chess. It seems to me that he’s truly radicalized. Here’s a guy who has, like, six jobs and has decided to spend most of his time tweeting propaganda for a political candidate and hosting him on his platform. Does he want another job? It’s entirely possible. But I really think what he wants more than anything else is to be that sort of Rupert Murdoch person for this political group. He seems to be trying to fit himself into the role of power broker. Lora: In some ways, Musk’s turn feels surprising. But has he always sort of been like this? Charlie: I started covering Musk in the 2010s. And there were signs of this stuff—picking the fight with the cave diver, the way he would dismiss claims around Tesla, irresponsibly tweeting in ways that had the power to move stock prices. He was a loose cannon and showed a lot of signs of his disregard for the rule of law and authority. But for most people, that was overshadowed by the image of Elon Musk, the great innovator. Because of his background and fame in tech, everything that he does that seems outrageous becomes newsworthy. Media organizations don’t cover everything that Alex Jones says, because Alex Jones has been a conspiracy theorist since the beginning. But when Musk muses trollishly about the assassination of Kamala Harris, as he did last weekend on X, it is covered in this way of: What happened to this guy? Not only did his previous branding keep people from really seeing what he’s become until it was too late. But it’s also keeping him in the public eye. It allows him, like Trump did in 2016, to garner this outsize attention. There’s this real urge to try to make narrative sense of him. Lora: How has Musk’s audience shaped his actions? Charlie: When you’re captured by your audience, you behave in a certain way—in Musk’s case, tweeting a lot and being a troll—and you attract an audience as a result. And then the audience, over time, starts to own you, because you are performing for them. You’re allowing the audience to dictate what it is that you do and say, because you’re so hungry for approval. Musk has found this group of people who are giving him the attention he wants for doing this. And in the classic social-media way, he’s got to keep coming up with ways to delight them. That usually means increasing the intensity of his posts. If he tweets a conspiracy theory, and people laud him as a truth teller, then next time, that conspiracy theory has to be a little more extreme. You become the person that your followers want you to be, instead of thinking for yourself. Lora: Musk has this devoted audience on X—but is he changing people’s minds, on or beyond social media? In what ways is Musk actually influential? Charlie: I don’t get the sense that he is influential in terms of changing minds on social media. It seems like he delights people who already believe all this kind of stuff. Where he is influential is dragging things from the fringes into the mainstream news cycle. He has this massive amplification account—he has the most followed account on the platform, which he obviously also owns. Musk is chained to X, following all kinds of right-wing garbage accounts. He sees it; he amplifies it. It is deemed as newsworthy because of who he is. And then a fringe-y talking point is front-page news. That, I think, is his influence.

The network also kept harassment allegations against former Fox News star Bill O’Reilly under wraps for years and spent millions in payouts so that women alleging abuse from the host of “The O’Reilly Factor” would not file lawsuits Steve Doocy, the longtime co-host of “Fox & Friends,” was also accused of harassment in Carlson’s suit. He is still hosting the show. Eric Bolling, who co-hosted “The Five,” left the network in 2017 amid allegations that he sent unsolicited lewd photos to co-workers, which he has denied. Fox News also paid out a $4 million settlement in 2020 to the former assistant of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who also was a co-host on “The Five.” “[Guilfoyle] apparently subjected her to deeply unprofessional things - forcing her to see her naked, forcing her to see pornographic material, forcing her to see pictures of the male anatomy of various men that she knew,” NPR’s David Folkenflik reported. Guilfoyle, who has been dating Donald Trump Jr. and spoke at the 2020 and 2024 Republican National Conventions, denied the allegations. The most well-known person with a history of sexual abuse and harassment who is affiliated with Fox News is Donald Trump. At least 18 women have accused Trump of groping them, making lewd comments, and sexually assaulting them and in 2023, a jury found Trump liable for the sexual abuse of advice columnist E. Jean Caroll and awarded her $5 million. Before becoming a Republican presidential candidate in 2015, Trump appeared on “Fox & Friends” in a regular slot to provide commentary on politics and promote the racist “birther” conspiracy theory against then-President Barack Obama. He still calls into various shows, including “Fox & Friends,” to give rambling diatribes. Fox News’ toxic actions against women are not confined to behind-the-scenes interactions. The network has frequently produced and aired openly sexist and misogynistic content from a wide array of hosts and correspondents during its 28-year history Recently, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Fox host Jesse Watters said, “We don’t know who she is.

The company closed down nearly 6%, at $14.70, as the six-month lockup period preventing insiders from selling the stock expired after Trump Media merged with blank-check company Digital World Acquisition Corp to take it public. Trump, the majority owner with a 57% stake now valued at around $1.7 billion, said last week that he has no intention of selling his position — a move that would effectively devalue the stock. The Republican presidential nominee and other large investors, who collectively own more than 20 million shares, were free to sell the stock after the closing bell. Trump Media debuted on the Nasdaq to great fanfare in March, with the share price soaring to more than $60. But It has suffered volatile swings during his run for the White House as incumbent Joe Biden dropped out and Kamala Harris got the Democratic nomination. The latest polls show Trump and the Vice President are virtually tied in the major swing states. Trump launched Truth Social in February 2022 after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. He’s since been reinstated to both — and endorsed by X owner Elon Musk — but he still mostly posts on his own platform. While Truth Social sought to capitalize on the outrage over Trump’s bans, it has struggled gaining traction.

With polls showing a tight race against Donald Trump, whose campaign remains resilient despite a rocky debate performance and race-based immigration attacks, Winfrey aims to mobilize voters ahead of the November election. Having endorsed Harris and spoken at the Democratic convention last month, she will headline the event in Farmington Hills. The event, titled “Unite for America 2024,” will feature Winfrey and Harris on stage in front of a local audience, discussing the election’s stakes and the importance of voting. Winfrey emphasized her goal: “What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote — and that’s my intention in hosting this event. My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote.” Earlier on Thursday, a pro-Palestinian grassroots organization, Uncommitted National Movement, announced it would not endorse Harris but urged supporters to vote against Trump. The movement, which originated in Michigan and garnered over 101,000 votes in the state’s presidential primary, expressed concerns about the U.S. handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the vice president’s unwillingness to commit to significant policy changes if elected. The group has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. What Time Does the Livestream Start? The event is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET. Harris campaign advisers report that nearly 200,000 people have signed up to watch the livestream, and they hope to reach even more viewers through streams on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch accounts for both Winfrey and Harris. Everyone can join online at YouTube.com/@Oprah. What Will Trump Be Doing? Trump will be in Washington to participate in the “Fighting Anti-Semitism in America” evening event alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a significant donor to the Republican Party.

Deborah Ross (D-NC) said Robinson wasn’t “fit to lead” the state even before the news broke. “Every week we are learning more and more about Mark Robinson’s racist, sexist, antisemitic, and homophobic beliefs,” Ross said in a post on X. “He wasn’t fit to be governor before this story, and it’s even more clear today that he isn’t fit to lead our state.” The language in the CNN report about Robinson could pose new challenges for Trump as he appears at campaign events Thursday regarding “fighting anti-semitism in America.” The former president will visit North Carolina on Saturday, speaking at a rally in Wilmington about inflation.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-New York) district, and the Bronx congresswoman didn't let his remarks go unchallenged. On Wednesday, the Teamsters announced it would not be endorsing a candidate for president in the 2024 election, citing concerns with both major party candidates. Ocasio-Cortez (also known by her initials AOC) lambasted O'Brien in a tweet following the non-endorsement, reminding her 13.2 million followers that the union boss \"has been boosting Republicans all year while supporting anti-worker, anti-choice candidates.\" She added that Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to save the Teamsters' pension fund when the 2021 American Rescue Plan came before the U.S. Senate. During a recent interview with CNN host Dana Bash, O'Brien fired back at AOC, saying that she was out of touch with her constituents given that a significant number of Teamsters in her district supported former President Donald Trump.

The union praised Harris for her record on \"pension relief, changes to the National Labor Relations Board, infrastructure investment [and] supporting the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.\" \"The NY-14 Teamsters mentioned here have actually voted overwhelmingly to endorse Harris-Walz.

It’s a big thing to be wrong about,\" AOC tweeted in bold text. \"So let’s set the record straight: Teamsters Local 202 are all in for Harris.\" Aside from the Bronx Local 202 shop, various Teamsters councils throughout the U.S. representing approximately one million members have also endorsed the vice president's 2024 candidacy. Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt tweeted a statement Thursday with the names of all of the Teamsters shops backing the Democratic ticket, which also include multiple union locals in battleground states like Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Trump called the non-endorsement \"a great honor,\" even though the Teamsters didn't endorse his campaign. O'Brien was roundly criticized for his decision to speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last July, though he argued that he was simply aiming to get his message out to as wide of an audience as possible. He was not invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention, with organizers opting instead to invite a retired Teamsters member to the lectern.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is leading a delegation for Donald Trump to Nebraska, where the senator is making a last-ditch effort to convince a critical mass of the state’s Republican lawmakers to change how Nebraska awards Electoral College votes, a shift that could turn the state into a winner-takes-all situation. Unlike most states, Nebraska splits up all five of its Electoral College votes — two go to the winner of the popular vote in the state and the other three are split up among Nebraska’s three congressional districts and are awarded to whoever wins the popular vote in each district. Maine is the only other state with a similarly unusual method of allotting votes. The revived push by Trump allies to convince Nebraska to change its system is a pellucid attempt to prevent Vice President Kamala Harris from winning the Electoral College vote from the state’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes the city of Omaha. Democrats were awarded a vote in 2008 and 2020 for winning the popular vote in that district. Trump allies, led by far-right online provocateur Charlie Kirk, already attempted to change the way Nebraska divvies up votes earlier this year, when President Biden was running for reelection. But Republicans in the state legislature failed to pass the bill that would’ve made the switch. Republicans are clearly nervous about Harris carrying the Omaha-based district in November — her running mate Tim Walz, who was born near Omaha, held a jam-packed rally there last month — which could help her secure the presidency. The stakes are high, per The Hill: If Harris loses Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, she could still win the presidency by winning the other states won by President Biden in 2020 — as long as she also wins the single electoral vote from Nebraska’s 2nd District. This would give her exactly 270 electoral votes. Graham reportedly made a trip to Nebraska this week, at the request of Nebraska GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts and Gov. Jim Pillen, who are both supportive of the change. Similarly, Republican members of Congress from Nebraska put out a letter on Wednesday calling on lawmakers back home to bring the bill back up for consideration before the election. “As members of Nebraska’s federal delegation in Congress, we are united in our support for apportioning all five of the Nebraska’s electoral votes in presidential elections according to the winner of the whole state,” the letter, addressed to Pillen and Nebraska Speaker of the Legislature John Arch, said. “It is past time that Nebraska join 48 other states in embracing winner-take-all in presidential elections.” Speaking to reporters on Thursday after his meeting with Pillen and Ricketts, Graham said he was hopeful his efforts to resuscitate the previously-failed effort would be fruitful. “The whole fate of the country and the world could hinge on one electoral vote,” he told reporters, according to CBS News. “I hope the people in Nebraska will understand this may come down to a single electoral vote. And I just don’t believe a Harris presidency is good for Nebraska.” Pillen is reportedly willing to bring lawmakers back for a special session to try to pass the bill again before Election Day, per CBS: “As I have also made clear, I am willing to convene the Legislature for a special session to fix this 30-year-old problem before the 2024 election,” the governor said, though he noted that he must first receive indication that there’s enough support among state senators. Early voting in Nebraska begins on Oct. 1, but the secretary of state said a switch to a winner-take-all system could be implemented anytime before Election Day on Nov. 5, according to a report from KOLN.

But she's still Oprah.\"She still has an immense degree of respect and ability to convene people,\" Craig Garthwaite, a professor of strategy at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management who co-authored the study, told Bloomberg News this week.Several grassroots groups, including White Dudes for Harris, Win With Black Men, South Asians for Harris, and Republicans for Harris will be involved in Thursday's virtual rally at 8 p.m. ET, which will be streamed across YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch.Speakers will discuss why they are supporting the Vice President, as well as why voting matters.\"What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote – and that's my intention in hosting this event,\" Oprah Winfrey said in a press release. \"My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote.\"Oprah call can reach undecided votersGreco, from the Italian-American group, told Newsweek that Oprah's event with Harris on Thursday needs to \"extend\" a sense of enthusiasm to those undecided voters around them — and Harris needed to help with that by being clear on policy.\"In several of the swing states, but also for most voters, it's going to be the economy, the kitchen table issues, what the candidates can do for their bottom line and will their lives be better as a result,\" Greco said.He referred to his culture as an example, saying that the core family values Italian Americans hold dear could be tapped by Harris by touting her economic policies focused on childcare and taxes. In doing that, he believes this could win over undecided voters, male and female alike.\"In those swing states like Pennsylvania, I think Italian Americans, it's 15% of the population,\" Greco said. \"If you can even just capture 5% of that, in an election where 10,000 or so can be can flip a county or a whole state, I think it's worthwhile to make the effort.\"","summary":"Over 140 grassroots groups are rallying virtually Thursday night with Oprah, in a play for swing state voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/oprah-kamala-harris-undecided-voters-livestream-1956605","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476345/oprah-kamala-harris-call.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:11:27","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.155},{"id":256825782,"title":"Kamala Harris Pins Hopes on Oprah Moment","text":"Is Oprah Winfrey the secret sauce Kamala Harris needs to win?

A couple hundred thousand others are expected to be tuning in on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch. The event is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. The event, co-hosted by Win With Black Women, comes as Harris and Donald Trump are deadlocked in a high-stakes, suspenseful race that could break either way as both candidates target every possible demographic. The campaign has sky-high hopes for the livestream, suggesting the impact could mirror that of Oprah’s talk show. Harris’ team is positioning it as part of her diverse media engagement strategy, even as she catches flack about dodging reporters. It’s unclear how much influence celebrities actually have over election results. But if there’s any name that could move voters, it may just be Oprah. She delivered a million votes for Barack Obama in 2008 after her endorsement of the first Black president.

Sixteen years later, in a more fragmented media environment, it’s unclear how much an Oprah appearance translates to votes. The mononymous megastar billionaire has mostly avoided politics for the past decade-and-a-half. Now, she’s back in the game trying to deliver a victory for Harris.

And the appalling attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords? In 2011 a lone madman shot Giffords in the head. It was a terrible attack on Giffords and on American democracy. The idea that anyone would dare to influence the process of government by violence was condemned by all. Yet in the ensuing attempt to cast the blame wider some Democrats settled on Palin. Palin’s political action committee had earlier released a list of target seats which were in their sights. One of them was Giffords’ seat. Of course the idea of “targets” and “crosshairs” is fairly standard campaign rhetoric. But the Democrats — and the Democrat media — decided that Palin was in fact guilty of incitement. It is a really dirty game to play, and Palin has said later how appalled she was by it all. There are indeed madmen out there and aside from the smear it is the sort of thing that would torture a person’s conscience. Was there someone out there who did take this literally? Well how come when it comes to attacks on Republican lawmakers and two exceptionally near-miss attempts to assassinate former President Trump there are so few people applying a similar standard? After the first assassination attempt on Trump in July, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi) had to fire one of his aides after she posted on Facebook, “I don’t condone violence but please get you some shooting lessons so you don’t miss next time ooops that wasn’t me talking.” Meanwhile Jack Black’s Tenacious D bandmate, Kyle Gass, was asked during a performance to make a wish. “Don’t miss Trump next time” was the “hilarious” response. But even in July wiser voices realized that America — as well as the former President — had avoided disaster by a hair’s breadth. The more recent attempt, this weekend, saw that restraint go out the window. After another shooter tried to kill Trump — this time on the former President´s golf course in Florida — Lester Holt of NBC said: “Today’s apparent assassination attempt comes amid increasingly fierce rhetoric on the campaign trail.” Ah — so it was Trump that brought it on himself, apparently! Isn’t “victim-blaming” meant to be one of the great sins of our age? Not if it relates to Trump, it seems. The same day David Frum of The Atlantic magazine wrote: “Trump and his running mate have spent the past week successfully inciting violence in Springfield, Ohio. Today they want to present themselves as near-victims of violence — in this case, of violence completely unrelated to themselves and at a very safe distance from themselves.” I don’t know whether I’d count having another rifle barrel pointed at you as “a very safe distance.” But on and on they have gone this week. On Tuesday’s edition of “The View” Whoopi Goldberg opined “Let’s stop this thing. You know, let’s stop this both sides stuff. Because it’s not correct. It is not both sides, it is one clear side, and you can point to many, many reports. You can point to all kinds of stuff that’s been reported. You guys have to pull it back. This is not us or them, this is you got to stop doing what you’re doing, JD [Vance] and what you’re doing, Mr. [Trump], because you are not helping the situation.” Was Whoopi? I wonder. Meantime perhaps the most deranged person in American media, Joy Reid of MSNBC, said on her show on Monday, “The irony of it is the actual violence we’re seeing comes much more disproportionately from MAGA themselves.” Again and again the Democrat media tried to say that it was Donald Trump’s fault. Most of these people have been in a sticky corner since the Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt. People who have spent recent years insisting that Trump is “literally Hitler” had to say “I still think he’s literally Hitler, but I´m glad he hasn’t been killed.” This time they’ve changed the tune slightly. Now the line seems to be “If he doesn’t want to keep being shot then he should change his ways.” Don Lemon was on his old network of CNN this week saying that “If Donald Trump wants Kamala Harris and others to stop saying that he is a threat to democracy, then he should stop threatening democracy.” Will some Democrats realize that wild rhetoric can come from all sides and that the rhetoric problem is not one-sided? In 2022. Chris Hayes of MSNBC claimed of the Supreme Court, “They can do whatever they want unless someone stops them. There’s no other conclusion now but that the Supreme Court is — I fear — an acute threat to American representative governance and democracy.” Yesterday the Department of Justice indicted a man from Alaska for threatening to torture and kill six conservative Supreme Court Justices. I doubt that man takes direction from Chris Hayes. But by the rules of this game anyone would be free to claim that. Tone it down? Who wants to go first? Iran, Iran, Iran! Remember all the years of “Russia, Russia, Russia” when it was claimed that Vladimir Putin was so powerful he could even swing US elections? Well why there is not more talk about an actual threat? That is — “Iran, Iran, Iran.” Two years ago we learned of an Iranian plot to assassinate former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former national security advisor John Bolton on American soil. This July we learned that the US Intelligence Agencies had got wind of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Trump. Presumably because of the hard line all three men took on the revolutionary Islamic mullahs in Tehran. Now this week we learned that the Iranians recently hacked Trump’s election campaign and sent information they had gleaned to members of the Democrat campaign team. The Democrats insist that they haven’t made any use of this material. But it is hard to unsee something once you have seen it. Especially if it useful to you. So why are we not hearing about Iranian election interference? Or, come to that, the “interference” of trying to murder American officials on US soil? Is it because it isn’t useful? Or doesn’t fit the plans of those same people who were so keen to say “Russia, Russia, Russia”?","summary":"Democrats and the media have yet to tone down their charged rhetoric against former President Donald Trump — despite two near-miss assassination attempts.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/opinion/when-will-democrats-stop-the-violent-rhetoric-that-has-conservatives-under-threat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-mogoolelm-1726782914306.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726768561&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:05:31","author":"Douglas Murray","authors":["Douglas Murray"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":256826674,"title":"Harris to livestream with Oprah, Trump to address Israeli-American group","text":"Both major presidential candidates are gearing up their campaign efforts.

Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue! It’s fair to call it tied in every way. And the reason that seems remarkable is that in the last year, Democrats or their allies have: 1. Indicted Trump in connection with the 2020 election and Jan. 6. 2. Indicted Trump a second time in connection with the 2020 election. 3. Indicted and convicted Trump in connection with the 2016 election. 4. Indicted Trump in connection with classified documents. 5. Changed candidates in peak election season when Trump was leading. 6. Given Trump’s new opponent, Harris, overwhelmingly positive news coverage. 7. Given Trump overwhelmingly negative news coverage. 8. Sued in multiple jurisdictions to use the 14th Amendment to remove Trump from ballots. 9. Filed and won a lawsuit aimed at destroying Trump’s business empire. 10. Filed a lawsuit using special, unprecedented legal maneuvers to accuse him of sexual misconduct 25 years earlier. Finally, of course, two unstable individuals have tried to kill Trump, one shooting him in the ear on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the other lying in wait to kill him on Sept. 15 before being caught by the Secret Service. Looking at the list, it’s a wonder Trump is still standing, much less that he is tied in a presidential contest. And yet he is. Some of the attacks on him have backfired, but some have hit their marks. It’s certainly reasonable to argue that the relentless lawfare, and then the assassination attempts, have taken a toll on Trump. At times that should have been high season for campaigning, he has been stuck in a courtroom or hunkered down for his own safety. That would be a draining experience for anyone, Trump included. Yet the race is tied. Trump is very much in it. Yes, you can make arguments about current divisions in the electorate and 2024 as a base election, but it’s still just plain remarkable. On the other side, Harris was handed the Democratic nomination after a secretive group of party insiders muscled President Joe Biden out of the race. She has not had to go through the grueling 18-month process of primaries, caucuses, campaigning, travel, more travel, speeches, gaffes, interviews, town halls, glad-handing, and all of the exhausting stuff that makes up a serious presidential campaign. “The short campaign benefits Kamala Harris in a lot of ways,” senior campaign adviser and Obama veteran David Plouffe said during the Democratic convention. He was right. Perhaps most of all, Harris has escaped the level of scrutiny that has been a feature of Trump’s life for eight years. News reports indicate it is her plan to keep that up through Election Day, which, with the help of some compliant allies in the media, she might succeed in doing. Yet for all that, Harris is not leading the race. Why isn’t she ahead by 10 points? Fifteen? More? Fill in whatever theory you like.

At least 6 in 10 voters say grocery prices (66%) and housing costs (60%) are a major problem for their family. In May, those numbers were at 62% for groceries and 47% for housing costs. The 13-point jump in housing costs being a major problem is seen across the board but mainly among men (+16 points major problem), White voters (+15), those without a college degree (+15), Republicans (+15), voters ages 65 and over (+14), Democrats (+13), and those under 45 (+13). Nearly half of voters (48%) say gas prices are a major problem, about where it was in May. FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS All this leads to high prices being the single most important factor that voters say will motivate them to go out and vote this election. Four in 10 say high prices (39%) will be the main issue driving them, followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the candidate’s race (9%), and the candidate’s gender (7%). For Democrats, the single most important factor will be abortion (39%) and stopping the other side from winning (37%). For both Republicans and Independents, it’s immigration (50% and 27%, respectively) and high prices (49% and 40%). The economy has been the top issue for much of the campaign and that’s no different now. Thirty-nine percent say it’s the economy, with immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) registering a distant second and third. All other issues tested were in single digits. Democrats’ most important issue is split between abortion (27%) and the economy (25%), while Republicans and Independents are again united with the economy first (50% and 45%, respectively) then immigration (30% and 13%). When it comes to who can better handle these priorities, former President Donald Trump is favored on two of the top three. By 5 points, he is seen as better able to handle the economy and by 10 points immigration, while more voters trust Vice President Kamala Harris to handle abortion by 16 points. The candidates are rated evenly when it comes to handling taxes, while voters give Harris the lead on helping the middle class by 9 points. \"The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But his edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris’ messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.\" FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES Overall, Harris has a 2-point edge (within the error margin) in the head-to-head matchup against Trump (50%-48%). \"One reason the horserace is so tight is that a handful of voters who trust Trump on the economy and immigration still back Harris and a handful of those trusting Harris on abortion and climate favor Trump,\" says Dana Blanton, who runs the Fox News polling unit. Trump’s advantage on the economy is bolstered by a rosier picture of his time in office. By 17 points, more voters see his administration’s policies as helpful than harmful, whereas by 24 points they see the Biden administration’s policies as more hurtful. Half of Democrats (50%) say Biden’s policies are helping them, while most Republicans (87%) and over half of Independents (52%) say they are hurting. More than half of Democrats feel Trump’s policies were hurtful (55%) vs. most Republicans saying helpful (86%). Independents are more mixed on their memory of Trump policies: 39% helped, 32% hurt, 29% no difference. \"The perception that Trump’s policies helped more than Biden’s creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why ‘turning the page’ is a central theme she’s tried to stress,\" says Anderson. Roughly 4 in 10 voters overall (39%) think imposing tariffs on products hurts the economy while 36% says it helps. Two in 10 believe it doesn’t make a difference. While it’s nowhere near the high of 84% during Biden’s presidency, 7 in 10 have a negative view of the economy (70%) compared to 3 in 10 who hold a positive view (29%). That negative view includes most Republicans (90%) and Independents (77%) and nearly half of Democrats (48%). The president’s job rating stands at 42% approve, 58% disapprove, mostly unchanged since July. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One more thing… Despite negative attitudes on the economy and high prices, 41% of voters think life for the next generation will be better, up from 25% when the question was last asked two years ago. The new result sits near the high of 42% recorded in August 2012. Compared to 2022, the increase in optimism for future Americans comes mainly from those without a college degree (+21), voters with annual income under $50,000 (+20), nonwhite voters (+19), Democrats (+18), men (+18), and voters under age 30 (+16) Conducted September 13-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,102 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (128) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (275). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 876 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points.

Biden’s executive order, which curtails opportunities for migrants who cross the border illegally to apply for asylum, remains in effect when there are “high levels of encounters,” specifically when the daily average is 1,500 encounters. Last month’s daily average was approximately 2,000, edging closer to the threshold that could trigger a rollback. “We’ve taken this action because congressional Republicans refuse to act,” Jean-Pierre said in reference to bipartisan legislation that failed in the Senate. “We’re going to continue to deal with an issue that the majority of Americans care about, right? Which is making sure that the border’s protected, dealing with the border security without the help of congressional Republicans, who have gotten in the way and do not provide, want to provide more assistance, more resources.” “If they were to pass that bipartisan border deal, we would have additional resources to actually deal with this without, without the actions that the president has taken,” she continued.

Until today, Trump and other insiders have been unable to sell their stakes, even as the shares enjoyed an initial surge after the company's public offering in March, providing the company a valuation of more than $9.4 billion. That's because of a so-called lock-up period during which time Trump and other insiders have been unable to sell. Such agreements are common with initial stock sales and are designed to keep executives from immediately selling, thereby flooding the market with available shares and causing a stock to tumble.Despite its early stock market gains, Trump Media — which trades under the ticker DJT, the same letters as Trump's initials — has had a largely bumpy reception from Wall Street. That path became even rockier on Thursday with DJT shares tumbling 92 cents, or 5.9%, to $14.70, representing a new low for the stock. The lock-up period for Trump and other insiders expired at the end of the trading day, or 4 p.m. Eastern time on September 19.The slide, which comes even as the market rallied on optimism after the Federal Reserve's jumbo rate cut, represents an 81% decline from its March high of $79.38.The lock-up's expiration now provides Trump and other insiders with a chance to cash out. In Trump's case, his holdings are worth $1.7 billion — a sizable fortune, yet a far cry from its $6 billion value soon after the company went public.That slump might not matter to Trump, however, as the former president recently vowed he has \"absolutely no intention of selling\" his almost 60% stake in the business. But other insiders might be tempted to sell now that the lock-up has ended, with those shareholders ranging from company executives to former \"Apprentice\" contestants who were earlier involved in the social media business.Those insiders together own more than 20 million shares, according to the New York Times.Trump Media & Technology Group didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \"I'm going to buy more\"Trump Media & Technology Group has attracted thousands of small investors who bought shares as a way to express support for the former president. On Thursday, as the stock sank to a new low, some took to Truth Social to urge the stock upward and profess their faith that DJT shares will see better days. \"I'm going to buy more,\" one member of the DJT stock group on Truth Social wrote Thursday. \"Prices are ridiculously low ... even though I realize nothing is going to happen until Donald J. Trump is back in office.\"Shares of DJT have swung wildly based on news about Trump, as well as the perception of his standing in the presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris. For instance, after Trump survived an assassination attempt in July, the stock soared 32% as investors recalculated his odds of winning in November. Since Harris entered the race on July 21, replacing President Joe Biden, Trump Media shares have shed 58% of their value.That has prompted some analysts to compare DJT to a meme stock, or companies that trade on social media buzz instead of traditional financial measures such as revenue growth and profitability.Trump, meanwhile, said that he didn't create Trump Media or Truth Social for the money. \"I did it because I really wanted to have a strong voice,\" he said last week. \"As long as my voice is on there, it's going to always be good.\"","summary":"Donald Trump has vowed not to sell his Trump Media shares after a lock-up period expires Thursday.

During a rally in Michigan on Tuesday, Trump – the former US president who is running again for the office – criticised India as “a very big abuser” in trade but described Modi as a “fantastic man”. “He happens to be coming to meet me next week,” Trump said. Modi will be in the US Saturday through Monday, to attend US President Joe Biden’s convening of the leaders of the Quad security group, along with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The session is to take place in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday. Modi is also set to follow that on Sunday with an address to an Indian gathering in New York City. According to Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Programme at the Wilson Centre think tank in Washington, should Modi actually meet with Trump, the timing of the visit would not only be awkward but also controversial because the “election is indeed less than two months away”. Describing Trump’s announcement as an “extraordinary development”, he noted that “it’s a risk for Modi to do this meeting”. For one thing, Kugelman said, there is nothing to suggest Modi plans to meet with Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, whose mother was Indian. “If he were to meet with Trump, and there were no meetings with Kamala Harris – regardless of what his motivations are for holding that meeting with Trump – there would be strong perceptions that he does have a preference,” Kugelman said. “The optics of Modi meeting Biden, meeting Trump, not meeting Harris could be problematic on a variety of levels,” he added. Mira Rapp-Hooper, the top White House adviser on Indo-Pacific policy, refused to comment Thursday on the possibility of Modi meeting both Biden and Trump, or Harris, during his visit. But Lisa Curtis of the Centre for a New American Security said that if Modi met with Trump it would not be surprising. “They had a very close relationship when Trump was in power, and there were a lot of successes on the US-India relationship,” Curtis recalled. Trump hosted a reception in 2019 for Modi in Texas which drew an estimated 50,000. The following year, Modi welcomed Trump in his home state of Gujarat for an event which attracted an audience of around 120,000. “I think there was a lot of good chemistry between these two leaders, and India would be relatively comfortable with the potential for a future Trump administration,” Curtis said. Kugelman said he doubted India had a clear preference for either Trump or Harris, recalling the trade tensions during the Trump administration. In 2018, Trump increased duties on 14 per cent of India’s exports to the US. In response, New Delhi imposed new tariffs on about 6 per cent of US exports to India. “It’s true that there might be a perception in New Delhi that Trump would be much less likely than Harris to elevate a focus on human rights and other internal happenings inside India,” Kugelman said. “But I’m not sure it would be accurate to say that from India’s perspective, Trump or Harris would be a clear advantage.” During his current run for the White House, Trump has repeatedly accused India of “stealing” American business and vowed to punish New Delhi. Farwa Aamer of Asia Society, a New York think tank, said that while a Harris presidency would “most likely build on the Biden-Harris administration approach toward India”, under a Trump rule “there might be greater pressures for burden-sharing on India and concerns about potential tariffs”. If Modi does meet with Trump, he will join a list of foreign leaders who have met with the Republican nominee this year. Since the spring, Trump has hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He has also met with Polish President Andrzej Duda in New York.

Company executives now say they are cutting a production shift here at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant, a move that will cost a substantial number of jobs. The charming Trumbull County city, located along a curve of the Mahoning River just 15 miles outside of Youngstown, Ohio, is part of the storied Mahoning Valley that was once dotted with manufacturing plants and steel mills for generations. Last Wednesday, Stellantis executives said they would spend $400 million to upgrade three factories in Michigan and nearly $100 million into its Warren Truck Assembly plant here, with a focus on the building of battery-operated vehicles, a car the general public has not warmed up to. However, they also announced plans to cut the second shift here, which is estimated to cost 2,500 jobs. UAW President Sean Fain said those layoffs could trigger his members to stage a walkout against Stellantis. Fain was here last week outside the UAW Local 140 hall and told those attending the rally that the company owes these workers. “These taxpayers bailed this company out during a recession,” he said. “I was there. And all they do is continually search for a race to the bottom, for cheaper workers, and they bankrupt communities.” Fain announced earlier this summer that the UAW would back Vice President Kamala Harris for president but admitted on Fox News that the rank and file would likely vote for former President Donald Trump. The Republican nominee has said repeatedly that he would use tariffs on imports to protect the auto industry. The layoffs could have a larger impact on the Senate race between Republican businessman Bernie Moreno and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) if the incumbent is seen as not being effective in helping the Trumbull County workers avoid losing their jobs. Brown needs the iconic Mahoning Valley counties of Trumbull, Stark, and Mahoning to turn out big for him in the November Senate race. Moreno won them substantially in the primary, and Brown cannot win without their support in the general election — something former Rep. Tim Ryan failed to do against J.D. Vance in 2022, even though Ryan represented this area for decades.","summary":"WARREN, Ohio — One year after the United Auto Workers and Stellantis struck a historic deal after a six-week strike against the “big three” automakers, the automaker has not made good on a vow not to open a facility in Illinois, according to the UAW.

The survey released Wednesday by the University of Maryland’s Program for Public Consultation (PPC) polled 600 likely voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with results exhibiting strong majorities in favor of federal support for increasing the Child Tax Credit, universal preschool funding, childcare subsidies, and paid family and medical leave. And Republicans are on board too, so championing these issues may be the key to making inroads in these closely-fought battlegrounds and picking up their cumulative 77 electoral votes. “There is strong bipartisan support for the Federal government taking a more active role in strengthening the support system for families, especially those with children,” remarks program director Steven Kull, by way of contextualizing the numbers. With Kamala Harris and J.D. Vance both championing an increase in the Child Tax Credit this cycle, it’s no surprise that the proposal is getting traction in these half-dozen states. Support in each state ranges from 69% in Wisconsin to 77% in Georgia, where a robust 71% of Republicans are in favor. The $6,000 level is what Harris floated in rolling out her policy proposals earlier this month. For his part, Vance proposed a $5,000 credit. Unsurprisingly, the child tax credit is more popular with younger voters than the older set, with only 43% of senior citizens in favor across the swing states. Universal preschool is even more popular, meanwhile, with overall support ranging from 76% in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to 83% in Georgia and Michigan, again with resounding GOP support ranging from 63% to 78% across the six swing states. Childcare subsidies are also a political winner across party lines, with a proposal tested to make it free for low-income parents and capped at 7% of income for the middle-income cohort. Overall support for the scheme ranges from 74% in Wisconsin to 80% in Georgia, where 72% of Republicans like the idea of government helping parents with childcare costs. Battleground voters also like the idea of Uncle Sam forcing small companies to offer paid family leave, in addition to extending the same consideration to new hires and part-time workers. But Republicans aren’t as eager to embrace this idea. Only 52% of GOP registrants in Nevada and 55% of Pennsylvania Republicans are on board, but it’s more popular in the other states, with a high-water mark of 67% in Michigan. Overall support for the concept ranges from 68% to 75%, however, showing it resonates outside the Republican base.","summary":"New polling suggests a broad and bipartisan consensus in battleground states when it comes to federal help for parents raising children.
