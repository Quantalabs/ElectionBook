Then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was inside the DNC headquarters when law enforcement found the pipe bomb outside the building, but she was quickly evacuated after U.S. Capitol Police arrived on the scene.\n\nCole also told investigators he was inspired by The Troubles, a violent sectarian conflict that began in the 1960s in Northern Ireland, where paramilitary groups have used pipe bombs in hundreds of attacks since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nCole is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday at 1 p.m. for his detention hearing. The prosecutor listed on his docket is Assistant U.S. Attorney Jocelyn Ballantine, who oversaw the prosecution of the leaders of the far-right group the Proud Boys for their role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/28/pipe-bomb-justice-department-jan-6-suspect-00707242","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a2722bd/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F60%2Fe7%2F5aaa08584f14876a19b342eaaec4%2Ffbi-pipe-bomb-investigation-64768.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:08:00","author":"Jacob Wendler","authors":["Jacob Wendler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":389684666,"title":"Five Chaotic Gubernatorial Races to Watch in the New Year","text":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—While the 2026 midterm elections have garnered widespread media attention for the fierce battle to control both houses of Congress, voters in three dozen states will also head to the polls to elect governors.\n\nOf the 36 governor’s mansions up for grabs in the midterms, half are controlled by Democrats and half by Republicans. With more than 10 months to go before Election Day, primary season is already in full swing, and several gubernatorial races across the country have been marked by unpredictability and drawn significant attention.\n\nIncumbent Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022, is term limited and cannot run for a third consecutive time—paving the way for a contested GOP primary to succeed him.\n\nLong-regarded as a hotly-contested swing state, Florida is now a Republican stronghold that Trump carried by 13 points in 2024. Therefore, it is widely believed that the candidate that emerges as the party’s nominee for the governor’s mansion following the Aug. 18, 2026 primary will win the November general election. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Sunshine State’s contest as “Solid R.”\n\nTrump had endorsed Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds for governor in February—five days before Donalds entered the race—cementing the 47-year-old congressman as the race’s early odds-on frontrunner. In addition to the president, Donalds also has received the support of Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott, a handful of his congressional colleagues, multiple members of Trump’s cabinet and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDeSantis, however, has yet to make an endorsement and may still back another GOP primary candidate. An anonymous source familiar with Florida politics told the Daily Caller in November that the state’s sitting governor is “point-blank trashing” Donalds to donors. Donalds, along with the vast majority of Florida’s congressional Republicans, notably endorsed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. \n\nRepublican Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, a key DeSantis ally whom the governor appointed to the state’s No. 2 job in August, has signaled that he is open to entering the gubernatorial race but has also yet to either declare his candidacy or decline to run.\n\nEarly in 2025, observers speculated that DeSantis’ wife Casey DeSantis may run to succeed her husband, but such talk has subsided. Mrs. DeSantis has yet to state her intention either way.\n\nDonalds’ only current primary challenger to have held electoral office is former Florida state House Speaker Paul Renner, a self-styled “pro-Trump, pro-DeSantis Republican.” Despite this, DeSantis has come out in vocal opposition to Renner’s longshot campaign, calling his former legislative ally’s decision to run “ill-advised.”\n\nAlso in the GOP primary race is James Fishback, the 30-year-old CEO of investment firm Azoria Partners and a vocal critic of H-1B visas, who is campaigning to Donalds’ right. Fishback in February came under scrutiny after proposing the viral idea that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency send $5,000 dividend checks to households using money saved by the initiative.\n\nStopping short of entering the race, Collins in a Nov. 20 X post took a dig at Donalds writing, “In my first 100 days as Lieutenant Governor, I’ve already outperformed the guy in Congress still trying to convince people he’s ready to lead Florida.”\n\nIn response to a user asking him to say Donalds’ name, the lieutenant governor replied “H1-Byron,” appearing to repeat a line of attack also used by Fishback to paint the Trump-endorsed candidate as too lenient on the issue of immigration.\n\nDemocrat candidates vying to succeed DeSantis include former Republican Florida Rep. David Jolly—a former MSNBC contributor widely associated with the “Never Trump” movement—and Jerry Demings, deep-blue Orange County’s mayor and former sheriff. The Democratic Party has not won Florida’s governor’s mansion since 1994.\n\nSimilar to Florida, Ohio is a former swing state that is now firmly in the Republican column, with Trump carrying it by double digits in 2024. The Buckeye and Sunshine states are also similar in that Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, like DeSantis, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection.\n\nHowever, unlike Donalds, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, the Trump-endorsed candidate seems to have cleared the GOP field, with the Ohio Republican Party opting in May to endorse him. Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump and DeSantis in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, has also received the endorsements of Musk, Vice President JD Vance—a native Ohioan—and both of Ohio’s senators. \n\nTrump originally announced that Ramaswamy would work with Musk to jointly run DOGE, but as the president began his second term, Ramaswamy instead pivoted to running for governor and never ended up joining the initiative.\n\nThe businessman currently is the only well-known GOP candidate running for Ohio governor. Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost have both in the first half of 2025 dropped out of the GOP gubernatorial primary with the former endorsing Ramaswamy.\n\nOn the Democrat side, former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton seems poised to win the nomination as Democrat Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan passed on a run and Sherrod Brown announced a bid to return to the upper chamber instead. Acton notably presided over the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020—which many critics have slammed as too heavy-handed.\n\nWhen asked by Daily Caller Senior Editor Amber Duke if she had regretted closing Ohio’s schools in the name of COVID, Acton replied, “No, actually, what we were following was the pandemic playbook.”\n\nRamaswamy has himself hammered Acton on the issue, writing in a June post to X, “Dr. Amy Acton, the Chief Lockdown Officer of Ohio, led us to be the *first state in the nation* to close our public schools, while private schools remained open. … Acton owes our public school students an apology & shouldn’t come anywhere near the levers of power again.”However, recent polling shows that despite Ohio’s strong Republican lean, a Democrat upset in what many are saying is shaping up to be a “blue wave” year may just be on the horizon. A December 2025 Emerson College poll found Acton with a one point lead over Ramaswamy, with 46% of support to his 45%. Emerson College’s poll from four months earlier showed Ramaswamy with a 10-point lead over the Democrat, 49% to 39%.\n\nCook Political report rates the race as “Likely R.”\n\nAs term-limited Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom likely gears up to mount his highly-anticipated 2028 presidential run, the state has the potential to elect a Republican to succeed him in 2026.\n\nAlthough California is a heavily Democrat state, its top-two primary could conceivably result in an all-Republican general election matchup if a crowded Democrat field splits the vote, allowing top GOP candidates—Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton—to finish first and second. \n\nNo clear Democrat frontrunner has emerged, with just six months before voters cast their ballots in the June 2, 2026 all-party primary. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s failed 2024 presidential nominee, announced in late July that she would not seek the California governorship two years after losing the race for the White House—something Richard Nixon tried and failed to do in 1962.\n\nA handful of well-known Democrats remain in the race to take up Newsom’s mantle including, most notably, former Democrat Rep. Katie Porter—who made headlines for appearing to abuse her staff and for allegedly dumping scalding hot mashed potatoes on her then-husband’s head—and Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell—a prominent Trump foe who announced his candidacy on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in late November.\n\nSwalwell was absent for more House votes than any one of his current colleagues, according to data analyzed by the New York Post. The Trump administration in November referred the congressman to the Department of Justice for alleged mortgage fraud.\n\nOther Democrats vying to replace Newsom include former Joe Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, to name a few.\n\nWhile multiple recent polls show the possibility of a fiercely split Democrat primary field locking the party out of the general election, Cook Political Report still rates the race “Solid D.”\n\nBianco told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a December interview that the lack of a Democrat frontrunner shows that the party is in “shambles” and has “no leadership.”\n\n“If you look back in history, there’s always a secession plan. There’s always someone else in line. That’s how Newsom got in there,” Bianco added. “But the problem for them [Democrats] now is Newsom is the biggest narcissist, probably, in the world and, in his eyes, there is no one capable of filling his shoes.”\n\nMeanwhile, California’s neighbor Arizona, the adopted home state of slain Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, presents the Republicans’ best chance to unseat an incumbent Democrat governor.\n\nDemocrat Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term in office after defeating her Republican opponent by only 17,000 votes in 2022. Hobbs has faced numerous controversies while in office, including a “play-to-pay” campaign finance scandal and her reported lack of transparency about her legal donations.\n\nIn addition, the vulnerable governor had a dismal 39% approval rating, compared to a 40% disapproval, according to an Emerson College poll released in mid-November.\n\nHobbs will take on the winner of what is now a three-way Republican primary, scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026. Cook Political report rates Arizona’s gubernatorial race a “Toss Up.” \n\nThe three Republicans currently vying for the GOP nomination to take on Hobbs in the general election are Republican Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson and Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert. Trump has co-endorsed Biggs and Robson while Kirk had solely endorsed Biggs prior to his Sept. 10 assassination. Schweikert entered the race months after both of the other two candidates.\n\nEmerson College’s mid-November poll showed Hobbs trailing the two Trump-endorsed candidates by one point each and Schweikert by four points. Biggs had a massive lead over both of his primary opponents with 50% of support compared to Robson’s 17% and Schweikert’s 8%, according to the same poll.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller’s Ashley Brasfield at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in December, Biggs said that he is “acting like I’m the only one that has [Trump’s] endorsement,” highlighting his close relationship with the president.“Trump and I go back to the first election … he knows I’ve been in the foxholes,” Biggs, who’s been in Congress since 2017, told Brasfield. “I’ve gone through two impeachments with him and about five investigations where I was one of the lead defense counsels, so to speak, for him on all of those. And he knows that. And even know he’ll call me and we’ll talk and we have that relationship ongoing.”\n\n“You can say anybody’s endorsed by you but if you don’t have a relationship with him, it doesn’t really matter,” the GOP frontrunner added.\n\nFinally, Michigan proves another prime chance for Republicans to flip a governor’s mansion from blue to red—but this time because of a left-leaning independent candidate who might play spoiler.\n\nDemocrat Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, like Newsom, is both a rumored potential 2028 White House candidate and barred from running for a third term due to term limits. Cook Political report rates the race to succeed Whitmer as a “Toss Up.”\n\nThe open Democrat primary to succeed the incumbent governor features three main candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson. Whitmer has stated she has no plans to endorse any candidate in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Michigan Rep. John James is the heavy frontrunner to capture the GOP nomination, with his most prominent intraparty rival being former Republican Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, but has previously endorsed James during his successful runs for the House as well as his unsuccessful runs for U.S. Senate in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nHowever, the presence of independent Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan—a former lifelong Democrat who left the party in 2024—on the ballot may swing the race in James’ favor.\n\nA Plymouth Union Public Research poll released in mid-October showed James in the lead with 35% of support among likely voters, compared to 31% of support for a generic Democrat and 12% for Duggan. Similarly, an EPIC-MRA poll released in early November showed 34% of support for James, 33% for Benson and 20% for Duggan.\n\nDuggan blasted his former party in October, telling Politico, “Everything the Democrats have to say is terrible about Republicans.”\n\n“I am waiting for the Democratic Party to step forward and say, ‘Here’s our affordable housing proposal. Here’s our mental health treatment proposal,’” the independent gubernatorial candidate added at the time. “It’s just been so frustrating to watch the Democratic Party lose its way.”\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—While the 2026 midterm elections have garnered widespread media attention for the fierce battle to control both houses of Congress, voters in...

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) should have been one of the year’s biggest winners. She had positioned herself as one of the faces of President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” movement. Trump’s 2024 victory should have supercharged her political career. Greene’s problem, though, was that she was only popular among MAGA, and her appeal was nearly nonexistent outside of die-hard Republicans.\n\nTRUMP’S FIVE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS OF 2025\n\nSo, when Greene tried to run for Senate in Georgia, Trump’s team commissioned a poll showing her losing (in a landslide) to Democrat Jon Ossoff. Trump privately scuttled Greene’s ambitions. She responded by lashing out at him and Republicans with Democratic talking points. Trump trashed her on social media and effectively nuked any future for Greene in Republican politics. She chose to resign from the House, effective early 2026.\n\nGreene now spends her days pushing Palestinian propaganda and praising Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicholas Maduro, all while pretending that she is more “America first” than Trump. Greene was always toxic outside of her deep-red congressional district. She will undoubtedly pop up on some anti-conservative, faux-patriotic media network, such as Tucker Carlson’s, a far cry from the Senate seat she planned on running for at the beginning of the year.\n\nAndrew Cuomo\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned from the governor’s office in New York in disgrace in 2021, after sexual harassment accusations and a cover-up of the nursing home COVID-19 deaths that his terrible policies caused during the pandemic. With New York City Mayor Eric Adams embroiled in his own scandals, Cuomo finally launched his redemption tour with a run for the mayor’s office.\n\nIt failed miserably. Cuomo was drubbed by communist Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary, and then decided to jump into the general election as an independent candidate. Cuomo lost that too, leaving New York in the hands of Mamdani and sending his political career into retirement.\n\nTRUMP FIRST YEAR REPORT CARD: A- PROMISE KEEPER OR ‘NIGHTMARE’ FAILURE\n\nTrump’s tariffs\n\nTrump won the White House largely because of Biden’s economy. Voters blamed Joe Biden and, by extension, Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, for inflation. They also remembered that Trump’s economy was humming right up until the global pandemic. \n\nBut Trump’s obsession with tariffs is ruining all that GOP goodwill on the economy. Voters still aren’t happy with high prices, with over 70% saying they are paying more for groceries this year than last. Now, 62% of them blame the state of the economy on Trump’s policies, chiefly the tariffs that are keeping costs higher than they otherwise would be. Trump costing the GOP ground on the economy helped sink Virginia Republicans in their 2025 elections, and it will be hanging over Republicans for the 2026 midterm elections so long as Trump continues to make tariffs a focal point of his administration.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic presidential ticket\n\nHarris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, both lost in 2024, but their losing streaks continued into 2025 as well.\n\nHarris’s excuse-ridden book tour has been a flop, where she proved that she still has contempt for Americans as racist bigots. Harris claimed in her book that she did not want to choose then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because she thought it would be too much to ask Americans to vote for a black woman (with a Jewish husband) and a gay man on the same ticket.\n\nREPUBLICANS PRAISE TRUMP’S ISIS STRIKES IN NIGERIA: ‘CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE’\n\nWalz, meanwhile, has become embroiled in a statewide fraud scandal involving the state’s Somali community. Walz has become the face of government incompetence as his state has been defrauded of hundreds of millions in COVID-19, housing, and autism funds. This comes after months of Walz trying to rebrand himself as a tough guy, promising to fight Trump supporters and promising his own supporters that they can one day celebrate Trump dying.\n\nBoth Harris and Walz missed their chance to go down in history last year, and they have spent this past year proving that their lack of political talent is the only thing to blame.\n\nCalifornia has one bit of good news: 2026 will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s last year in office. Newsom is term-limited and wants to run for president, where he would export California’s failed policies to the rest of the nation. That is where the good news ends for California.\n\nUnder Newsom’s stewardship, California is facing budget deficits for years into the future. California businesses will now face a new tax on employees as a result of Newsom failing to repay a federal pandemic unemployment loan. California has a looming energy crisis and an ever-worsening affordability crisis. Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have both failed to rebuild Los Angeles in a timely manner after the city suffered widespread fires in January.\n\nTo top it all off, for anyone who thinks things cannot get worse in California, the top Democrat in polling right now to replace Newsom is the one and only Rep. Eric Swalwell. \n\nLate-night “comedy”\n\nLate-night comedy shows have been a dying format for a decade, driven by alternative media and by the fact that most late night “comedians” were political activists.\n\nTRUMP ORDERS CHRISTMAS DAY US MILITARY STRIKES AGAINST ISIS IN NIGERIA\n\nThe death of late-night comedy accelerated this year. CBS was, for some reason, paying Stephen Colbert a reported $20 million per year for a show that, for some reason, cost $130 million to produce each year. Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year and was pulling fewer viewers than Greg Gutfeld was pulling on Fox News at a fraction of the cost. Rather than fire Colbert and try to take The Late Show in a different direction, CBS decided it would be easier to cancel the show entirely, with last year being the final one for the franchise that started in 1993.\n\nJimmy Kimmel of ABC then earned himself a short suspension after Charlie Kirk was killed by a left-wing terrorist. Kimmel got on air and lied to his audience, claiming that Trump supporters were “trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” Kimmel was, of course, feeding into a conspiracy theory that Kirk was shot by some right-wing radical, something he still hasn’t apologized for to this day. Like Colbert, Kimmel has given up on comedy in favor of ranting about fascism, which is what he blamed for his suspension.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

When asked whether she had any doubts about Jeffries leading the chamber, she didn’t hesitate. “None,” she said.\n\nThat’s the Pelosi brand—absolute, unwavering confidence behind a layer of Botox. It sounds decisive, but at this point, it’s mostly theater. She’s just doing what political veterans do best: telling her party what it wants to hear. And let’s face it, that’s what this prediction was.\n\nWe’ve heard it all before. Pelosi said almost the same thing last year when she endorsed Kamala Harris after Joe Biden dropped out.\n\n“Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute – and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November,” she said at the time.\n\nIt was obvious that she was projecting. I mean, come on, no one ever used the word “brilliant” to describe Kamala Harris before. And what ultimately happened? Democrats lost the White House, the House, and the Senate.\n\nYet, Pelosi is still out there pretending like projecting confidence will assure the result she wants.\n\nIt wasn’t just Pelosi caught in fantasyland. The supposedly “objective” experts were right there with her. Allan Lichtman, the historian with his much-hyped “Keys to the White House” prediction model, claimed Harris would cruise to victory. His system had been accurate since 1984, which had so many convinced her victory was inevitable. The problem with his model was that many of the keys were subjective, and when I reassessed them, I discovered it actually predicted a Trump victory.\n\nHis “keys” weren’t the problem—his bias was. The man twisted his own model to fit his politics, and it blew up in his face.\n\nAnd then there was famed Democrat consultant James Carville. In an October 2024 op-ed for The New York Times, Carville didn’t just predict a Kamala Harris victory—he guaranteed it. “America, it will all be OK. Ms. Harris will be elected the next president of the United States. Of this, I am certain,” he wrote. Well, America turned out fine, but not because Carville got it right.\n\nThe problem isn’t poor predictions—it’s the arrogance behind them. People in the business of politics live in a bubble that rewards confidence over honesty. They don’t get paid to be right. They get paid to make their side feel hopeful. Pelosi, Carville, Lichtman—take your pick. They’re all part of the same choir, singing as loudly as they can to drown out the sound of political reality.\n\nThe same thing happens on the Republican side, too, and it's just as useless.\n\nCould Democrats win back the House next year? Sure. Heck, history is arguably on their side. But there’s no guarantee. Pelosi doesn’t have insider knowledge about how 2026 will shake out. None of these folks do. What they have is a megaphone and a base that demands reassurance. So they deliver it, every time—facts be damned.\n\nIf there’s one thing voters should have learned by now, it’s to tune out anyone who swears they know what’s coming. Politics is chaos wrapped in ego. Predictions don’t win elections. Voters do. And if history is any guide, the loudest voices in the pundit class will be just as wrong next time, too.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/28/ignore-election-predictions-and-just-vote-n4947615","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/87/9adfe385-e9df-4f65-a4a6-8775db692117.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 18:00:25","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":389679778,"title":"Larry David reunites with Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne pilot killed and another critically injured after helicopter plunges out of the sky following midair collision\n\nDonald Trump meets with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago as president snaps at reporter: 'What a stupid question'\n\nFBI gives update on daycare accused of $4MILLION taxpayer fraud as Kash Patel says it's the 'tip of the iceberg' and vows to 'follow the money and protect children'\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nSARAH VINE: The miasma of gloom has finally lifted over the royals.

'He saw something no one else could.' \n\n Billy Crystal breaks silence after racing to Rob Reiner's home to find unimaginable horror \n'When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation,' Seinfeld said. \nHe concluded his post by writing the death of Rob and his wife is 'impossibly sad.' \nEarlier this month, Crystal, David, Martin Short, and several other close friends and prominent figures released a joint statement memorializing Rob to The Associated Press.\n'Going to the movies in a dark theater filled with strangers having a common experience, laughing, crying, screaming in fear, or watching an intense drama unfold is still an unforgettable thrill. Tell us a story audiences demand of us. Absorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller,' the statement read.\n'There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to 'mockumentary' to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films.'\nCrystal was seen leaving the Reiners' home late Sunday, not long after their bodies had been discovered.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe reunion marked David's first public appearance since the recent deaths of his close friends Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner, who were murdered earlier this month; seen in 2019\n\nReiner was also a longtime friend and collaborator of David, having produced Seinfeld and later appearing as an exaggerated version of himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm.\nAlong with David and Crystal and their wives, the statement was issued on behalf of Martin Short, Albert Brooks, Kimberly Brooks, Alan Zweibel, Robin Zweibel, Marc Shaiman, Lou Mirabal, Barry Levinson, Diana Levinson, James Costos and Michael Smith.\n'His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant,' the statement continued. 'For the actors, he loved them. For the writers, he made them better.'\n'His greatest gift was freedom. If you had an idea, he listened, he brought you into the process. They always felt they were working as a team. To be in his hands as a filmmaker was a privilege but that is only part of his legacy.'\nThe group also paid tribute to the Reiners' political work, noting that the couple were longtime Democratic backers whose advocacy earned them admiration across the progressive community.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn his tribute to Rob, Seinfeld credited the late actor-director for having 'the biggest influence' next to David and George Shapiro; Seinfeld and Rob Reiner seen in 2000\n\nView gallery\n\n'Our show would have never happened without him,' Seinfeld said. 'He saw something no one else could' (L-R) Seinfeld, Albert Brooks, Reiner and David pictured at a 2003 event in LA \n'Rob was also a passionate, brave citizen, who not only cared for this country he loved, he did everything he could to make it better and with his loving wife Michele, he had the perfect partner. Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens,' the statement said.\n'They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish and inspiring. We were their friends, and we will miss them forever.'\nThe statement concluded with a line from one of Reiner's favorite films, It's a Wonderful Life: 'Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he? You have no idea.'\nReiner and Crystal had a decades-long friendship as they first met on the set of classic sitcom All In The Family in 1975 when the two were cast as best friends.\nIn 2016, Crystal reflected on their closeness in a column for The Hollywood Reporter and explained that their chemistry on screen was so palpable, they decided to be friends away from the camera.\n'We became the closest of friends. And when I moved out here (from New York), we just spent all kinds of time together,' he said.\nTheir most famous collaboration was the 1989 classic When Harry Met Sally in which Crystal starred with Meg Ryan in a romantic comedy penned by the late Nora Ephron.\n\nView gallery\n\nDavid and Billy Crystal were among those who visited the Reiners' home shortly after the couple were discovered murdered, according to reports at the time; Reiner and Crystal seen in September 2025\nCrystal shared that one of his favorite moments in their friendship was at the first screening of the movie: 'Rob and I were sitting in the back next to each other. Then the orgasm scene happens, and the place goes berserk. When Rob's mother, Estelle, says, 'I'll have what she's having,' it was thunderous, a laugh you can only hear with the best of jokes in a concert hall.'\n'It's those moments that make movies so spectacular: You set up the joke in September, and you don't hear the punch line until May. We just grabbed each other's hands because we knew something exciting was about to happen with this movie.'\nThe Hollywood director and his wife were knifed to death between Saturday night and 3.30pm Sunday, when their daughter Romy stumbled into the grim scene after going to check on them at their LA home.\nTheir throats had been cut and they may have been asleep in their bed when they were murdered, a source close to the investigation claimed to the Daily Mail.\nThe couple's son Nick was later arrested after reports stated he had been 'acting crazy' at a holiday party he attended with his parents on Saturday.\nAlthough he has been formally charged with the violent slayings of his mother and father, Nick has yet to be arraigned in court on the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole or the death penalty.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said no decision had been made yet whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\nView gallery\n\nReiner's son Nick, 32, who has a history of drug addiction and difficult behavior, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the slaying of his parents; pictured with dad Rob in 2016\n\nNick's lawyer Alan Jackson said his client had not been medically cleared to be transferred from the jail to the courthouse, but did not disclose any further details about his condition or the case, according to the New York Times.\nNick currently remains in jail without bail and is being held on suicide watch in administrative segregation at Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.\nAt the time of Nick's arrest, his sister Romy allegedly told investigators her brother 'should be a suspect' because he was 'dangerous'.\nCurb Your Enthusiasm and writer of Seinfeld, Larry David, was also spotted close to the Reiners' home on Sunday evening after the news broke about their deaths.\nReiner famously worked with David on his iconic sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm as he played himself in one of the best-known episodes, titled The Thong, which was broadcast in October 2001.\nThe two are both legends in the comedy world, with Reiner having directed some of the most iconic films of the genre and David being a comedic force behind Seinfeld and his aforementioned HBO series.\n\nView gallery\n\nReiner and his wife had three children, Nick (not pictured), Jake (left) and Romy (second to left); pictured together in January 2024 in LA\nIn September, Reiner released Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, the sequel to his iconic 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, which he co-wrote, directed and appeared in.\nReiner followed his father, the comic actor and filmmaker Carl Reiner, into Hollywood. Reiner died in 2020 at 98.\nReiner first emerged as an actor and is best known for his role as Michael 'Meathead' Stivic on the previously mentioned All In The Family.\nHe won two Emmy Awards and was nominated for five Golden Globes during his stint on the series from 1971 to 1978.\nReiner helped reinvent his career in the 1980s with his forward-looking comedy This Is Spinal Tap, which would go on to inspire countless mockumentaries.\nHe became one of Hollywood's most in-demand directors for the next two decades due to classics and box office hits such as Stand By Me (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007).\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLarry David reunites with Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nRedemption for Jake Paul's fiancee as Dutch speed skater bounces back after heartbreaking fall at Olympic trials\n\nUS soccer superstar Christian Pulisic breaks his silence on Sydney Sweeney dating rumors\n\nEXCLUSIVENashville's brutal secret RANKING of influencers: From the 'cougar'... to the star with an ugly nickname\n\nBristol Palin reunites with son Tripp for his 17th birthday after he moved to Alaska to live with his dad\n\nLarry David reunites with sitcom icons Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members. \n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. \n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on. \n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies. \n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates. \n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one. \n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House. \n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.\n\nCharlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.","summary":"The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run – a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run fo","url":"https://www.alternet.org/gop-2026-midterms/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61177615&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C224%2C0%2C224","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 16:56:51","author":"Charlie Hunt,The Conversation","authors":["Charlie Hunt","The Conversation"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":389679788,"title":"Bristol Palin reunites with son Tripp for his 17th birthday after he moved to Alaska to live with his dad","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne pilot killed and another critically injured after helicopter plunges out of the sky following midair collision\n\nDonald Trump meets with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago as president snaps at reporter: 'What a stupid question'\n\nFBI gives update on daycare accused of $4MILLION taxpayer fraud as Kash Patel says it's the 'tip of the iceberg' and vows to 'follow the money and protect children'\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nSARAH VINE: The miasma of gloom has finally lifted over the royals.

We're not doing this.\" I was so mad, so mad,' she said on the Sex, Lies, And Spray Tans podcast with Cheryl Burke. \n\nView gallery\n\nIn text added over the reel, Palin typed out, 'happiest 17th birthday to my @tripp.easton!!!'\n\nView gallery\n\nThe public speaker shares her son (seen in a throwback photo) with ex Levi Johnston - whom she previously had an on-and-off engagement to until their final split in 2010\n\nView gallery\n\nThe special reunion comes a little over one year since she announced that Tripp had made the decision to move to Alaska to reside with his father and finish out his high school years there as well\nThe star emotionally expressed how 'gut wrenching' it was to her as she opened up about the close bond she has with her son. \n'It's been just Tripp and I, and then I had my girls, but it's always been Tripp and I. It's changed the dynamic of so much.'\nPalin had been 18-years-old when she welcomed Tripp to the world. \nHer pregnancy had been publicly announced at the 2008 Republican National Convention when her mother Sarah Palin was running as vice presidential nominee.\nAfter her separation from Johnston, the pair entered a lengthy custody battle - which came to an end in 2016 with the pair gaining joint custody of Tripp. \nThe daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin later tied the knot with Dakota Meyer in 2016, but their divorce was finalized two years later. \nBack in July of this year, Palin also revealed whether her son has plans to attend college after his high school graduation. \nDuring an Instagram Q+A session at the time, a follower questioned whether the teen is interested in going to university to which she wrote in response, 'I'd never push college.' \n\nBristol Palin shares son Tripp's plans for the future\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:32\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\n'He just texted me and was like, \"Hey Mom, I'm not coming back.\" At first I'm like, \"I'm coming up to Alaska.

Somehow, it’s always “cheating” when Republicans do it, but it’s fair game when Democrats do it.\n\nThat was the message from left-wing political consultant Tezlyn Figaro on CNN’s NewsNight on Friday, and she wasn’t even being subtle about it. According to Figaro, cheating only exists as a political concept when Republicans do it. When Democrats engage in the same behavior, it magically transforms into something noble, defensive, and totally justified.\n\nFigaro opened with a sweeping declaration that left no room for nuance or evidence. “And one would argue that if Republicans can’t win in Texas, they cheat,” she said. “If Republicans can’t win, they cheat. They cheat. They cheat by changing the maps.”\n\nFrom her perspective, Republicans lose elections. Republicans respond by cheating. Case closed. That’s when Scott Jennings jumped in.\n\n“So, you’re saying it was illegal in what they did?” he asked.\n\n“Well, one would argue that,” Figaro insisted. “That’s why they put the whole lawsuit piece up.”\n\nJennings kept going because that is what happens when someone uses the word “cheating” in a legal context. He asked whether the same logic applied elsewhere. “Is it illegal in Illinois?”\n\n“It could be too,” Figaro replied.\n\n“Is it illegal in Democrat states?” Jennings asked.\n\n“It could be, yes. It could be.”\n\n“So, you’re saying the entire political system is just cheating?”\n\nHere’s where Figaro showed what she really meant. “No, that’s not what I said. I said if Republicans can’t win, they cheat. Not the entire political system, just Republicans. But it’s okay.”\n\nThere it was. Just Republicans cheat. And not just by redistricting… but by appointing judges too. Figaro spiraled into a Kamala Harris-esque word salad about courts, lawsuits, and Donald Trump secretly running the judiciary. “Will it survive court challenge because it was Trump’s folks in the court. He runs the court system as well. That’s also called cheating.”\n\nICYMI: How Long Before Tim Walz Is Indicted?\n\nIn other words, Republicans cheat by redistricting. Republicans cheat by appointing judges. Republicans cheat by winning court cases. Democrats file lawsuits forever because, you know… Virtue! Democracy!\n\nEven CNN host Abby Phillip gently pointed out the obvious: “I mean Democrats are also doing now the same thing Republicans are doing with these —”\n\n“What Newsom did, yes,” Figaro jumped in.\n\nJennings went for the kill shot: “Was it cheating in California?”\n\n“It’s fire for fire,” Figaro said.\n\nJennings, refusing to let her dodge, asked again: “Is it cheating?”\n\n“It’s responding,” she replied.\n\n“You said he’s cheating.”\n\n“You could call it cheating if that’s what you want to call it.”\n\nJennings finally translated her argument into plain English: “So, it’s cheating for Republicans and it’s okay for Democrat.”\n\nFigaro protested, then immediately proved his point: “I said that if Republicans can’t win, they cheat. And so what Newsom did is, he countered that. He countered it, whatever you want to call it. He countered cheating.”\n\nThat is the left’s worldview in a nutshell. Republican actions equal cheating by definition. Democrat actions equal counter-cheating. The rules stay the same. The judgment changes based on party.\n\nJennings summed it up with visible exasperation: “You’re talking in circles again. Are you dizzy?”\n\n🚨 HOLY CRAP! Scott Jennings EMBARRASSES liberal on CNN who whines Republicans are \"CHEATING\" by redistricting for 2026\"You talk in CIRCLES, are you DIZZY!?\" 🤣LIB: If Republicans can't win Texas, they cheat!SCOTT: How?

Then, when Republicans responded in kind, Democrats nuked the filibuster. Time and again, Democrats make it clear that they judge the morality and legality of the system based on whether it benefits them at a particular moment. Power matters more than consistency. For Democrats, the moral compass only points in their direction.\n\nThis holiday season, support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories legacy media bury.

I know we weren't together then but it's been a long time.' \nElsewhere in the interview, JoJo revealed a dealbreaker for them in making their relationship work is only accepting job offers which don't put their romance in jeopardy. \nShe added: 'Something important to both of us, is that nothing comes between us, is that nothing makes anything stressful or feels that we have to do something.' \nTheir gushing interview came after JoJo's ex Kath Ebbs announced she is engaged to new love Tilly Lucas-Rodd. \nKath was left heartbroken in August when the Dance Moms star appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, during which she formed a flirtatious bond with Chris. \nAt the CBB after-party, it was revealed that JoJo dumped Kath - leaving the latter 'disorientated, numb and in shock' - before the star started her romance with Chris.\nThey have now found love with Tilly, with the pair announcing their engagement after going public with their romance in July.\nBilly Ray Cyrus and Elizabeth Hurley\n\nView gallery\n\nElizabeth shocked fans in April when she announced her relationship with Achy Breaky singer Billy Ray \nElizabeth shocked fans in April when she announced her relationship with Achy Breaky singer Billy Ray.\nShe posted a snap of them both on Easter Sunday as she leaned in for a kiss and couldn't keep a smile off her face.\nBack in May, Elizabeth and Billy made their red carpet debut in Rome while attending the Orizzonti | Rosso Exhibition Opening Dinner together - with her son Damian also joining the couple.\nThe same month, The Royals actress made an appearance at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation 2025 Hot Pink Party in New York City - and gave an update about their relationship during an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com.\nShe gushed that she is 'very happy in my new relationship' and added, 'Billy's a lovely man and we make each other very happy.'\nThe pair's relationship began following his divorce from Firerose - and his third marriage.\nHe had met Elizabeth on set of the 2022 movie Christmas In Paradise and as he was navigating through the split from Firerose, he received a message from the actress.\n\nView gallery\n\nShe posted a snap of them both on Easter Sunday as she leaned in for a kiss and couldn't keep a smile off her face \nElizabeth's son Damian recently rushed to the defence of Billy Ray, branding him the 'sweetest man' as he hit back at 'untrue stories'. \n'I've been in the public eyes since the day I was born and rarely comment on anything written about me or my family,' Damian penned, before slamming recent 'untrue' stories.\n'For the record: I adore @billyraycyrus and think he's one of the sweetest men I've ever met. I love seeing my mom so happy.'\nHe added that Billy's kids are 'adorable' while also expressing that the families 'get along beautifully.'\nDamian - who is the son of Elizabeth and biological dad Steve Bing - continued to explain that he is part of a 'modern family,' including his former stepfather Arun Nayar. \nArun was previously married to the Gossip Girl alum from 2007 until their divorce was finalized in 2011. \nAfter giving a shoutout to his step siblings, the media personality added, 'I feel blessed every day to be surrounded by so much love and support.

Me and my siblings, everyone always comes to me.\n'There are a lot of people there, we eat a lot. We do the typical English thing of eating quality streets, watching TV and going out with the dogs.\n'So all I want for Christmas this year is that Billy, my new boyfriend, enjoys his first English Christmas.'\nShe added, 'He spent the whole summer with us, but I really do hope that he integrates with us, loves it, enjoys it and doesn't laugh at us for eating so many quality streets and lying on the sofa.\n'All I want is peace, happiness and being relaxed, having a laugh with friends and family.'\nLast month while talking to The Sunday Times, Elizabeth shared that Billy is a big fan of England. \n'He lives 40 minutes outside of Nashville.

[She has] a lot of fun with him. It's exactly what she needs right now,' the source said.\nOn Trudeau's side, the relationship appears to have brought a new sense of ease.\n'He is a much happier person now.

They thought the hate was blown out of proportion,' the insider said.\nIn September, the couple were seen holding hands as they had a blast during Horror Nights at Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n'The attraction is she is hot as can be,' an insider told the Daily Mail. 'He gives great advice. They have what each other wants.'\n\nView gallery\n\nInsiders recently told The Daily Mail that the pair's romance has escalated quickly behind the scenes \nSince going public with their romance, Sweeney and Braun have been spotted enjoying dates together across the country.\nEarlier this month, the two stars held hands during an excursion in New York City - shortly after her 'screaming' fight with ex-fiancé Jonathan.\nSweeney raised eyebrows after she was seen quietly slipping into a car with her ex-fiancé in Los Angeles. \nPhotographs captured the two-time Emmy nominee ducking down in the passenger seat with Davino behind the wheel.\nBut their apparent amiability seemed short-lived. TMZ reported that, at one point, the star screamed: 'I don't believe you. Please leave, leave me alone.'\nThe former couple called off their engagement, earlier this year, after about seven years together. \nEllie Goulding and Beau Minniear \n\nView gallery\n\nActor Beau, 28, and Ellie confirmed they were dating earlier this year, as their unlikely romance was revealed \nActor Beau, 28, and Ellie confirmed they were dating earlier this year, as their unlikely romance was revealed. \nRecently the singer, 38, revealed she was pregnant as she showed off her baby bump at the Fashion Awards in London.\nSoon after, The Daily Mail then exclusively revealed that in 2018, aged 20, Beau was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was living at the time. \nThe incident led to him being charged with three offences: robbery without a firearm, felony battery resulting in a serious bodily injury, and marijuana possession.\nAccording to documents filed by the West Palm Beach Police Department, Beau and two other young men were taken into custody after an altercation on a street at around 2.30am.\nA 36-year-old man claimed to have been kicked and punched multiple times by a group of attackers, while lying on the ground, leaving him with a fractured elbow and bleeding nose.\nAccording to the police records, he claimed that they also ripped off his trousers and stole his wallet, which was found in the possession of one of the men Beau was with when they were arrested.\n\nView gallery\n\nRecently the singer, 38, revealed she was pregnant as she showed off her baby bump at the Fashion Awards in London \nAccording to address details filed with the police, the victim – who also has a criminal record – was homeless at the time.\nIn a mugshot taken after his arrest, Beau, dressed in a blue-and-purple plaid shirt, looks downcast and remorseful, his hair hanging greasily over his forehead. He was the only one in the group charged with a drugs offence, having been found with seven grams of marijuana in his pockets.\nHaving served two days behind bars at the County Jail, Beau admitted misdemeanour battery, a lesser offence than felony battery, as part of an apparent plea deal.\nAppearing in front of a jury in November 2018, he was granted probation and ordered to pay $675 (£500) in costs.\nHe also had to complete a 12-hour online anger management course, and was ordered to do 75 hours of community service at a minimum of ten hours per month over the following year.\nThis wasn't, however, Beau's last brush with the law.\nIn 2020, during the Black Lives Matter riots in Los Angeles – two days of unrest sparked by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota – he was arrested again.\n\nView gallery\n\nBeau appears in several raunchy scenes in Ellie's latest music video, Destiny\nAlong with 4,000 others, the then 23-year-old was taken into custody for breaching the 8pm curfew that had been imposed on the city to quell the violence. No further action appears to have been taken, and he was apparently released without charge.\nGiven that Ellie is expecting his first child, one must presume that Beau has told her about his chequered past.\nThe singer split from her husband Caspar Jopling, with whom she shares a four-year-old son, Arthur, in February last year. Since her relationship with Beau went public in September, the pair have holidayed together in Italy, where Beau shared online an intimate photograph of Ellie lying in an unmade hotel room bed.\nHe also appears in several raunchy scenes in Ellie's latest music video, Destiny.\nIn one, the pair passionately kiss while wearing veils over their heads; in another Ellie takes pictures of Beau's semi-naked body before straddling him. She playfully captioned a behind-the-scenes clip on her TikTok profile: 'Bring your bf [boyfriend] to work day,' adding: 'He upstaged me tbh [to be honest].'\nIt marks quite the change for the British songstress, who just six years ago married Eton-educated art dealer Caspar in a fairytale ceremony at York Minster.\nIn attendance were Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, long-term friends of Ellie – who is also close to Prince William and Prince Harry, with whom she was once romantically linked.\nEllie broke her silence on her pregnancy and gushed that she felt 'empowered and my absolute best' on Wednesday after her surprise bump reveal. \nShe showed off her growing bump in an outfit from designer Willy Chavarria and announced her happy news.\nIn her first Instagram post since the reveal, she shared a series of photos from the night. \nThe hitmaker wrote: 'So grateful to have attended the Fashion Awards with the visionary Willy Chavarria, wearing a look that was a little bit custom, a little bit archive. \n'Only on a night like this, could Willy be the one to empower me and make me feel my absolute bestttt.'\nEllie added: 'Thank you for a night filled with meaning, beauty, and so much heart x.' \nShailene Woodley and Lucas Bravo \n\nView gallery\n\nShailene and Lucas seemed an unlikely pairing when it was revealed that they'd started dating earlier this year \nShailene and Lucas seemed an unlikely pairing when it was revealed that they'd started dating earlier this year.\nThe Emily In Paris hunk, 37, and the actress, 34, was first spotted together in Paris this past March.\nAt the time, they were spotted canoodling on the France set of Lucas' show Emily in Paris. \nThat same month a source told People that their romance was 'a breath of fresh air for her.'\nThe person also described Lucas as 'uncomplicated, kind, not pretentious and emotionally present.'\n'Her friends love him,' the insider emphasized, noting that the Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox star was 'thriving.'\n'It's a whole new vibe,' the source shared, later comparing Shailene's new love to her former flame Aaron Rodgers.\n'It's the total opposite of her dynamic with Aaron. She's happy, light and having fun again,' the person close to the situation said. \nThe Tell Me Lies actress and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback were romantically involved from 2020 to 2022.\nThey eventually broke off their engagement, leaving Shailene 'heartbroken.'\nIn a subsequent interview with Bustle in 2024, she cryptically said, 'I fell in love over and over with unavailability.'\nHowever in September it was reported that Shailene and Lucas had split after their six-month relationship.\nThey have since wiped their respective Instagram profiles clean of each other, after previously going 'official' on the app in late April.\nDaily Mail reached out to the stars' reps for comment at the time.\nCurtis Pritchard and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu\n\nView gallery\n\nCurtis and Ekin-Su met on the 2025 Love Island: All Stars series and made it very close to the end of the show \n\nView gallery\n\nThings sadly ended just three months after the South African season wrapped \n\nSam Thompson addresses his difficult year following split from Zara\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:34\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nCurtis and Ekin-Su met on the 2025 Love Island: All Stars series and made it very close to the end of the show.\nThings sadly ended just three months after the South African season wrapped.\nCurtis, whose brother is former Strictly star AJ Pritchard, first appeared on Love Island in 2019, where he met ex-girlfriend Maura Higgins. \nHe returned earlier this year for Love Island: All Stars, dating Ekin-Su until their split in July, and has not been linked to anyone since.\nAnnouncing the split on Instagram, she wrote: 'I wanted to share that Curtis and I have decided to go our separate ways. \n'It's been a really tough decision, but one made with a lot of love and respect for one another.\n'He's an incredible person and I'll always cherish the memories we made both in an out of the villa.'\nAt the time many fans branded them a showmance and said they seemed a very unlikely pair. \nIt came following her split from her boyfriend Davide before going on to have a rocky stint in Celebrity Big Brother. \nThe couple had a turbulent 18-month relationship since they first met in the Love Island villa in 2022, going on to win the show's £50,000 prize money together.\nZara McDermott and Louis Tomlinson \n\nView gallery\n\nZara and Louis began dating early this year after her split from Sam Thompson\nZara and Louis began dating early this year after her split from Sam Thompson. \nZara and Sam dated for around five years - with the pair going official in May 2019 and later splitting in December 2024.\nZara and Louis will spend Christmas together with his family as their relationship goes from strength to strength. \n\n Zara McDermott will spend Christmas with boyfriend Louis Tomlinson and his family as their relationship grows 'very serious' \nLouis' twin sisters Daisy and Phoebe, 21, recently revealed they are having their 'biggest Christmas', after the singer, 33, invited Zara, 28, to the celebrations. \nThey said in their podcast: 'This is a big Christmas this year.

I think there will be 16 of us in total.'\nLast month Zara and Louis made a rare joint appearance at the Grand Prix in Paradise, Nevada. \nIt came after it was reported Zara moved into multi-millionaire Louis's north London mansion, having moved back into her parents' house after leaving the home she shared with ex Sam.\nOf their latest plans, a source told The Sun: 'Louis and Zara are still totally in the honeymoon period and try not to be apart for too long.

The closely watched decisions from former Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla have been made.\n\nDoes that mean the race for California’s next governor — with its primary just six months away — is ready to heat up?\n\nIt’s been a rather lackluster campaign thus far. One that, while it certainly is not wanting for candidates, has lacked a certain excitement.\n\nThat’s in part due to the Proposition 50 special election that stole the political attention in the latter part of 2025. But a missing star power in the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom has also contributed to what political experts have considered to be a relatively dull gubernatorial campaign.\n\n“It’s an open race,” said Matt Lesenyie, who teaches political science at Cal State Long Beach. “No big splashes so far.”\n\nAlready, as 2025 comes to a close, a few of the crowded field of Democratic contenders to succeed Newsom have begun to drop out of the race.\n\nThose left include former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former State Controller Betty Yee, all of whom have experience in California’s executive branch.\n\nThere’s former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who once served as an advisor to Newsom, and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, whose money will enable him to put his face and name before voters, perhaps a bit more easily.\n\nAnd then there are Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Rep. Katie Porter, both bringing congressional expertise to the race as well as an affinity for cable television appearances.\n\nAs for the Republicans, both Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton have found a path toward the top of recent polls — polls that, notably, show the undecided category still the most popular choice for those surveyed.\n\nThere’s also the possibility that Attorney General Rob Bonta or billionaire businessman Rick Caruso could jump into the fray as well. And while their presence certainly wouldn’t shake up the campaign with the same weight that Harris or Padilla would have, politicos watching California’s gubernatorial race believe they could still make some difference.\n\nSo no, the race for California governor isn’t lonely. Just lackluster — and that is odd.\n\n“What’s notable about this race is how extraordinarily unsettled it is,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\n“There hasn’t been a campaign for California governor in modern political history that has been so open-ended at this stage,” Schnur said.\n\nSen. Tony Strickland, R-Huntington Beach, agrees.\n\n“This is the first time I can recall that there’s not a clear-cut frontrunner,” Strickland said.\n\nHow will that change in 2026?\n\nLesenyie expects the field to winnow a bit more: “Campaigns are expensive, poll results and donor energy will dictate these withdrawals.”\n\nHe also believes cost of living will be the issue that really drives the campaign in 2026.\n\n“In the 2022 gubernatorial … this manifested as a ‘homelessness crisis,’ which is true, but retrospectively is also a proxy for cost of living,” Lesenyie said. “I’d expect the issue framing to tie to retail goods, rent and housing stock.”\n\nStrickland, meanwhile, said candidates on either side of the aisle who focus on affordability and public safety could set themselves apart. And for him, that also means looking critically at the money California is spending on certain projects, like the high-speed rail project that was billed, years ago, as a train that would quickly connect Los Angeles, the Central Valley, San Francisco and other communities.\n\nGiven, in particular, the lack of a strong frontrunner on the Democratic side at this point in the race, Strickland sees the possibility for a Republican to make it through the June primary.\n\nThat’s not unheard of in modern elections in a California where the latest data shows 44.93% of voters are registered Democrats, while only 25.22% are Republicans and 22.6% are no party preference. In the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in California in 2024, Republican Steve Garvey advanced to the general election with then-Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who ultimately won in a landslide.\n\n“I’ve always said the Democrats have to make some mistakes and a Republican has to run a perfect campaign,” Strickland, who has endorsed Hilton for governor, said. “But I don’t think it’s as insurmountable as other people say.”\n\nBut Stephen Cloobeck, a businessman who was running for California governor but ended his campaign in November, said the recent redistricting campaign foreshadows that it will be a Democrat who prevails in the race, despite the uncertainty now.\n\nStatewide, 64.4% of those who voted in the special election agreed to Proposition 50, the redistricting proposal backed by Newsom and other Democrats who marketed it as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his efforts to shore up more congressional seats for Republicans in the 2026 midterms. Only 35.6% of the 11.5 million people who cast ballots opposed redistricting.\n\n“If you do the math, it’s undeniable,” said Cloobeck, who is backing Swalwell in the race. “Trump can’t spend enough money in California to elect a Republican governor. It can’t happen.”\n\nIn the meantime, Schnur, who has worked on multiple presidential and gubernatorial campaigns, likens the current field of chief executive hopefuls to “a political moshpit.”\n\n“There are too many candidates to keep track of, and they’re all trying to climb over each other and just keep getting pulled back down with the rest of them,” he said.\n\n“Once we move into the election year on the calendar, it becomes slightly easier to get the voters’ attention, but there is no guarantee with all this multi-candidate infighting all the way through the primary.”\n\nIn other words, the race for California governor is still very much unsettled.","summary":"While the campaign certainly hasn't lacked candidates, it has been missing star power.

Here’s Who’s Winning.","text":"She also rage-baited Josh Shapiro, writing that the Pennsylvania governor “mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision” during her running mate vetting process. That prompted Shapiro to accuse Harris, in an interview with The Atlantic, of “blatant lies” to “sell books and cover her ass.” And she rankled former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg by saying she passed over him for veep because she thought pairing a Black woman with a gay man was “too big of a risk,” adding that Buttigieg “knew that — to our mutual sadness.” After publication, Buttigieg told POLITICO he was “surprised” to read that and retorted, “The way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories.”\n\nHarris even threw shade at the entire party’s record of delivering for voters at a December speech before the Democratic National Committee, declaring “both parties have failed to hold the public’s trust.”\n\nWhether a former vice president can, in the eyes of voters, sufficiently separate herself from the Washington establishment, remains to be seen. But by spending so much energy on the past, she wasn’t putting in as much time taking on Trump or offering an alternative vision for the future.\n\nThere’s a reason why Newsom gained ground and Harris lost ground this year; he seized the mantle of chief attack dog and she didn’t.\n\nRunning in Place Award\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nPete Buttigieg maintained a campaign-lite schedule in 2025, participating in an Iowa town hall and making appearances on right-leaning podcasts — burnishing a reputation as a smooth debater able to connect with red-state voters. (In case anyone missed the point of such appearances, Buttigieg wrote a Substack post titled, “Why I Sat Down for a Two-Hour Podcast That Recently Hosted Trump.”)\n\nAfter ending his four-year stint as Transportation secretary, he and his family left Washington for Michigan, where he passed on running for open seats for governor or senator, a sign he’s interested in a bigger prize like the presidency. He also grew a salt-and-pepper beard, which could help the soon-to-be 44-year-old shake the perception that he’s too young to be Commander-in-Chief.\n\nWhat he didn’t do in 2025 is anything to address his biggest political weakness: scant support among Black and Latino voters.\n\nIn an August poll from Emerson College gauging Democratic support for 2028 possibilities, Buttigeig earned a promising second place with 16 percent. Yet the number of African American respondents who said they support Buttigieg was zero. Not that the percentage of support for Buttigieg among Black people rounded down to zero. Literally zero African Americans contacted by Emerson said they supported Buttigieg. And the number of Hispanic respondents was only slightly better: one. Every Democratic presidential nominee since Michael Dukakis in 1988 has needed Black support, particularly Southern Black support, to secure a sufficient number of delegates.\n\nFurthermore, Buttigieg’s support was heavily consolidated among the college-educated, with little support from voters with only high school diplomas or vocational degrees. He remains a quintessential “wine track” candidate, and such candidates have often struggled to win the Democratic nomination. Buttigieg ends another year as a contender but without a clear path to forging a diverse base of support.\n\nExcellence in Socialism and Bridge-Building Prize\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist insurgent who had once been known for encouraging primary challenges to Democratic House incumbents, continued her intra-party fence-mending operation in 2025. Last year, she began paying dues to her party’s House campaign arm for the first time. She also gave a full-throated endorsement to Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention when others in democratic socialist circles were withholding support to protest the Biden administration’s military support for Israel’s war with Hamas.\n\nThis year she helped raise money for the Democratic nominee for the governor of Virginia, Abigail Spangberger, a moderate who has disparaged the “socialist” label that Ocasio-Cortez still dons with pride.\n\nShe also solidified her position as the unofficial heir to the democratic socialist movement built up by Bernie Sanders’ two presidential campaigns by joining the 84-year-old Vermont independent for 11 stops on his Fighting Oligarchy tour, which took her to the early primary state of Nevada and the swing state of Arizona.\n\nIn another nod to the left, Ocasio-Cortez also didn’t suppress her frustration in November when a faction of Senate Democrats broke ranks to end the government shutdown without a deal to renew expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nWith Sanders unlikely to run for president a third time, and with the socialist left’s new favorite — New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani — ineligible to run for president (he was born in Uganda), Ocasio-Cortez would likely have the democratic socialist lane all to herself if she chose to run for president.\n\nShe may decide not to. Perhaps she sees running against the aging, battle-scarred Chuck Schumer in 2028 as the safer bet or that staying in the House is the safest choice of all. And the question remains whether the socialist lane has grown big enough to win a Democratic presidential primary, let alone the presidency. But Ocasio-Cortez ends 2025 well positioned to finance and staff a presidential campaign, which is more than what most potential candidates can usually say this early in the process.\n\nThe ‘Got a Bill Signed Into Law’ Blue Ribbon\n\nRep. Ro Khanna\n\nOne thing Ocasio-Cortez still does not have on her resume is a signature legislative achievement, which another progressive House Democrat reportedly eyeing the presidency notched this year.\n\nTeaming up with a small band of renegade Republicans, Rep. Ro Khanna helped round up a majority of House members to sign a discharge petition and force a vote — against Speaker Mike Johnson’s wishes — on legislation mandating the Justice Department release documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bill then sailed through the House and Senate, cornering Trump and compelling his signature. Khanna now has a bipartisan success story to tout on the presidential campaign trail as evidence he can take on Trump and win.\n\nThat’s not only more than Ocasio-Cortez can say, but also more than what any Senate Democrat can say they did in 2025.\n\nA-For-Effort Certificates\n\nSenate Category:\n\nCory Booker, Mark Kelly, Elissa Slotkin, Ruben Gallego and Chris Murphy\n\nPotential presidential candidates from the Senate Democratic Caucus, lacking obvious legislative options to distinguish themselves, tended to embrace symbolic acts of defiance. Some had better success than others.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/12/28/presidential-race-2028-candidates-analysis-00695164","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/186db7b/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4d%2Fe6%2Ff57099d04a58bd4612e0453f6283%2Floving-politico-2028-contenders-final.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 15:00:00","author":"Bill Scher","authors":["Bill Scher"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.063},{"id":389616014,"title":"Brigitte Bardot's final social media posts show her doing what she loved and looking remarkably healthy without the care she relied upon in her final years - just days before her death","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFury grows over 'empty' Minnesota daycare with misspelled sign accused of receiving $4m in taxpayer funds\n\nRichest California suburb's deadly secret: How a scenic cliff with breathtaking views of Pacific has become a death trap where three have died since August\n\nBrigitte Bardot dies aged 91: France's original 'Sex Kitten' who found global fame with And God Created Woman before ditching acting and modelling for animal rights activism passes away\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nSARAH VINE: The miasma of gloom has finally lifted over the royals.

All the teams at the Brigitte Bardot Foundation wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! Thank you for your support! Take care of yourselves, your loved ones, and your pets.'\nThe animal rights charity also announced her passing on Sunday morning with a statement.\nIt read: 'The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation.'\nThe organisation did not specify the time or place where she died. \nKnown as the original 'Sex Kitten', Brigitte shot to international notoriety with her role in 1956 film And God Created Woman, which was directed by her first husband Roger Vadim. \nThat turn as a voluptuous, hedonistic orphan made her an object of edgy fascination for millions, even though the film itself got a mixed reaction from critics.\nDescribed by Time magazine as France's 'most ogled export', her sex appeal was further fuelled by her outings as a model.\nFollowing the news of her death, French president Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Brigitte, saying she was ‘a legend who embodied a life of freedom’.\n\nView gallery\n\nBrigitte passed away aged 91. Above: The star in 2023, one of the last times she was pictured out and about\n\nView gallery\n\nBrigitte became an animal rights activist. Above: Attending the international feline exhibition in Saint-Tropex, France, June 1977\nHe wrote on X: ‘Her films, her voice, her dazzling fame, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom.\n‘A French existence, a universal radiance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century’.\nBrigitte had suffered a great deal of ill health in recent months, and was frequently admitted to hospital.\nIn October, she was forced to release a statement confirming she was not dead, after an influencer put out a false report.\nBrigitte took to X to announce: ‘I don't know who the idiot is who started this fake news about my disappearance this evening, but know that I am fine and that I have no intention of bowing out. A word to the wise’.\nShe was soon back at her home in Saint-Tropez following three weeks of treatment for an unspecified condition.\nThe star, who married and divorced three times before settling with her fourth husband Bernard d'Ormale in 1992, retired from acting in 1973 to focus on her passionate animal rights activism. \nBut she drew controversy with her engagement in far-right politics, which saw her endorse National Rally leader Marine Le Pen and be fined six times for inciting racial hatred. \nThe star was reclusive in her final years, instead preferring to remain out of the spotlight at her secluded and very private property in Saint Tropez. \nBorn on September 28, 1934, in Paris, Brigitte initially trained as a ballet dancer at the National Superior Conservatory of Paris for Music and Dance.\nAfter quitting acting in 1973, Bardot took her life in a different direction.\n\nBrigitte visiting her dog refuge in Paris, 2001\n\n Brigitte Bardot's complicated love life: How French acting legend's 'quest for passion' saw her embark on four marriages and affairs with Hollywood co-stars \nShe said: 'I gave my youth and my beauty to men, I am now giving and my experience, the best of myself, to animals.'\nSetting up the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986, she was a dedicated vegetarian and regularly campaigned for the rights of animals.\nIn 2013 she threatened to request Russian citizenship and leave France after a pair of 42-year-old elephants were refused treatment for tuberculosis in a Lyon zoo.\nShe referred to France as a 'graveyard for animals' but ultimately won the case and saved the two former circus animals.\nIn 2001 she also donated $140,000 over two years to sterilise and adopt 300,000 of Bucharest's stray dogs.\nNot all of her activism work since quitting acting was quite so well received.\nIn 2004 she was convicted by a French court and fined £4,000 for 'inciting racial hatred' in her book A Scream in the Silence.\nShe was a keen supporter of the far-right Marine Le Pen. At the 2017 French elections, she told people not to vote for Emmanuel Macron because he had a 'coldness' in his 'steel eyes'.\nEmmanuel MacronFrance\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrigitte Bardot's final social media posts show her doing what she loved and looking remarkably healthy without the care she relied upon in her final years - just days before her death\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJake Paul watches helplessly as fiancee leaves Olympic qualifying in tears after disaster strikes\n\nKim Kardashian shares rare portrait with all four of her children for Christmas... and no sign of ex Kanye West\n\nEXCLUSIVENashville's brutal secret RANKING of influencers: From the 'cougar'... to the star with an ugly nickname\n\nTiffany Haddish stops comedy show as she recognizes woman who 'saved her life': 'Turn the lights on!'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAna de Armas shows off rock hard abs in skintight workout gear in LA after Tom Cruise split\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:07:40 EST, 28 December 2025 |Updated:08:43 EST, 28 December 2025 \n\nAdam Peaty' dad Mark has been pictured the day after his son's wedding to Holly Ramsay as he enjoyed a dog walk near their family home in Staffordshire. \nMark wrapped up in an eye catching orange coat and winter hat as he stepped out after it was revealed he was invited to the wedding at Bath Abbey, but was told he would have to sit in the back row.\nMore than 200 friends and family members gathered to see the Olympic swimmer, 30, and the daughter of Gordon Ramsay, 25, tie the knot.\nBut the run-up to the wedding has been anything but plain sailing, sparking a toxic family row that captured the nation and left Peaty's family disinvited to the celebrations. \nDespite the feud, the gold medalist's sister, Bethany Peaty, was among Holly's bridesmaids, which also included her mother, Tana Ramsay, 51, and her sisters, Tilly, 24 and Megan, 27.\nNow new information has claimed that Adam's dad was in fact invited to the special day.\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam Peaty' dad Mark has been pictured the day after his son's wedding to Holly Ramsay as he enjoyed a dog walk near their family home in Staffordshire\n\nView gallery\n\nMore than 200 friends and family members gathered to see the Olympic swimmer, 30, and the daughter of Gordon Ramsay, 25, tie the knot\n\nNashville's brutal secret ranking of influencers\n\n1.3k viewing now\n\nInside Ashton Kutcher's 'desperate' comeback attempt\n\n32.9k viewing now\n\nKim Kardashian shares rare portrait with all four kids for Christmas\n\n3.8k viewing now\n\nA family source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Frankly, it's disgusting that it went ahead without Adam reaching out to his mum and dad beforehand.'\nThe insider continued: 'It was a difficult day for Caroline and Mark, so the family spent the evening together. Caroline got upset as soon as she saw the photographs from the wedding. \n'For him to turn around and tell Beth that his dad could come and sit at the back of the church is awful. Mark was told he could sit behind plus-ones — who Adam has probably never even seen or spoken to.'\nMeanwhile Adam's mum Caroline said she is trying to stay upbeat and positive but, in truth, her heart is breaking. \nShe does her best to hold them in but tears inevitably fall as she talks exclusively to the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t think they understand how much they have hurt me; it’s as if they have cut my heart out,’ she says.\n‘This is the first Christmas that I’ve not had my family together – my family is broken.\n‘Yes, I have my other grandchildren. Yes, I have my other children, but my family is split because of the goings on … because of the wedding.’\nAmong the star-studded guest list which includes 200 attendees, was Sir David, 50, his wife, Victoria Beckham, 51, as well as their children, Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14.\n\nView gallery\n\nMark wrapped up in an eye catching orange coat as he stepped out after it was revealed he was invited to the wedding at Bath Abbey, but was told he would have to sit in the back row\n\nView gallery\n\nA source said: 'Mark was told he could sit behind plus-ones — who Adam has probably never even seen or spoken to'\n\nEXCLUSIVE Revealed: The icy text Adam Peaty received moments after he married Holly Ramsay \nThe Beckhams and the Ramsays have been close family friends since the early 2000s, with the two clan striking a bond when they both relocated to the USA.\nAdam had met Holly on the set of Strictly Come Dancing in 2021, when he was competing alongside her sister Tilly. Their paths crossed again in 2023 and they began dating. \nCaroline shared an apartment with Holly when they visited Paris and they got on well. Caroline, a former nursery manager, even told Holly of her anxiety that her son was pulling away from his family.\nAs she recalled last time we met: ‘I remember her words: “You’ve got him back now, he’ll always be part of your family.” ’\nThose words feel so hollow now.\nWhen Adam presented Holly with a £23,000 yellow diamond engagement ring in September last year, and told his mum he had found his soulmate, she couldn’t have been happier.\nLooking back, Caroline admits the distance between Adam and his own family feels like a long, slow pulling away.\nThe engagement party, held in December last year, at the exclusive members-only venue Soho Farmhouse, was a harbinger of what was to come, for while Caroline and Mark attended Adam’s wider family were not invited.\nCaroline was hurt and sent Holly a message, expressing how much she, like Holly, cherished family and explaining her disappointment that her sisters were not asked. She wrestled over the wording of the message. It was, she insists, polite and diplomatic, however Adam was furious.\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam's mother Caroline (picture), who spent years ferrying her son to early morning training sessions, was not invited to the couple's wedding - or to Holly's glamorous hen do \n\nAdam Peaty's sister Bethany joins Holly Ramsay's bridal party\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:35\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nThe bad feeling continued at the engagement party itself. Caroline was dismayed to find that a Netflix film crew had also been invited to the glossy shindig to record footage for Gordon Ramsay’s new show, Being Gordon Ramsay.\nCaroline has since fired off letters – to Adam and Holly, to the Ramsays and to Netflix – requesting that neither she, Mark nor their son Jamie and his wife Charlotte appear in any footage. \nThe Ramsays are a close clan, they do things together, as was made clear these last two weeks.\nFirst the assembled family joined Adam and Holly on a trip to Bath, getting ready for the big day, then came the little pre-wedding trip to Lapland, and Boxing Day continued with festive, pre-wedding drinks.\nCaroline, left to watch it unfold from afar, thought the bonds of her family were tight, too, saying: ‘Family has always been the centre of my life, so you can imagine the hurt this has caused me.’\nThere was renewed hurt when her 60th birthday went unacknowledged shortly before Christmas, and Christmas itself was very different this year.\nAdam PeatyHolly Ramsay\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAdam Peaty's dad is pictured the day after son's wedding after it was revealed he WAS invited but was told he would have to sit in the back row\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (14)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nRARory Archers, Chiswick, United Kingdom, 41 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nWhy is she dressed in a white bedsheet?\n\nClick to rate\n\nMCMia Callaway ., London, United Kingdom, 42 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nThey both look fed up .\n\nClick to rate\n\nBXBrewdogmeister XLII, Like A Phoenix From The Ashes, United Kingdom, 43 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nGood job Mark for not bothering to turn up I can only applaud you!\n\nClick to rate\n\nShow 11 More Comments\nThe opinions and views expressed in the comments section are solely those of the individual users and do not represent or reflect the opinions, views, or positions of Daily Mail.

If this is confirmed, I’ll be treated with a strong course of antibiotics and steroids via drip.\n'It’s now looking like I’ll be spending Christmas in hospital but I’ve come to accept it, and I’ll stay here until I’m completely well enough to go home.\n'Thank you all so much for the love, it truly means everything #pneumonia #beingpositive'.\nGary Lineker\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWayne Lineker, 63, reveals he is out of hospital after 'seven weeks of pure hell' after battling severe pneumonia\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (4)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nDDeerAntClave, London, United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nClick to rate\n\nDDeerAntClave, London, United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nHe's a creep\n\nClick to rate\n\nEENGLISH, WORCESTER, United Kingdom, 9 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nHe came home to save the cost of being treated abroad I suspect , his brother Gary couldn't afford it !!!!!.\n\nClick to rate\n\nShow 1 More Comments\nThe opinions and views expressed in the comments section are solely those of the individual users and do not represent or reflect the opinions, views, or positions of Daily Mail.

while his brother Adam is 'the outsider'. \nThe relationship deteriorates as Michael embraces his role as the Mafia boss, culminating in the last scene where the door shuts on Kay, symbolising her exclusion.\nThe now-deleted post of James and his mother was the only photo shared to his Instagram page, which has since been completely wiped of any images.\nAdam and Holly have been at the centre of a bitter feud with his family, who were all uninvited from the nuptials, aside from his sister Beth who was a bridesmaid.\nMost his family stayed at home 150 miles away while the couple tied the knot in front of 200 guests in Somerset.\nA family source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Frankly, it's disgusting that it went ahead without Adam reaching out to his mum and dad beforehand.'\nAccording to the publication, Mark was told by Adam's sister Beth he was allowed to attend the ceremony but he had to sit at the back.\n\nView gallery\n\nAfter being kicked off the invite list, James posted an old photograph on the day with their mother Caroline Peaty standing outside of the wedding venue (stock image Bath Abbey)\n\nView gallery\n\nJames Peaty, pictured second left alongside his brothers and parents, was questioned by police for two days before being released on conditional bail\nThe source added: 'For him to turn around and tell Beth that his dad could come and sit at the back of the church is awful.\n'Mark was told he could sit behind plus-ones — who Adam has probably never even seen or spoken to.'\nThe insider also claimed that Caroline became emotional as soon as she saw the photos released following the big day.\nIn lieu of his parents or brothers, Adam's swimming coach Melanie Marshall delivered a reading during the wedding breakfast. \nIn stark contrast, Holly's parents were integral to the day with her famous father Gordon walking her down the aisle and her mother Tana giving a reading.\nThere was no sign of strife as the newlyweds beamed and made their grand exit from the historic 7th-century building following their ceremony.\nThey smiled as they made their way through an adoring crowd, keen to catch the loved-up couple, before they headed to the opulent Georgian manor, Kin House.\nMeanwhile, Holly's proud father, 59, was seen thanking members of the star-studded guest list, including the Beckhams, as they left the service.\n\nAdam and Holly pictured together after their ceremony\n\nView gallery\n\nIn what was seen by some as a display of defiance against her family, Bethany linked arms with Holly's eldest sister as they entered the abbey carrying white arum lilies\nBut the run-up to the wedding has been anything but plain sailing, sparking a toxic family row that captured the nation and left Peaty's family disinvited to the celebrations.\nAdam's other family members fueled further speculation of a rift by flying a Union Jack flag upside down in Staffordshire. \nThe inverted flag - an internationally recognised symbol of distress - has been interpreted by some as a subtle dig aimed at Adam and his bride. \nHowever, is not known whether it was a deliberate snub or a simple mistake made by the patriotic family. \nCaroline had reportedly planned to crash the wedding but has since decided against it explaining 'it would be too sad' and she doesn't 'want to spoil his big day'.\nHer change of heart came after she'd previously insisted: 'I will be there, and I will watch from the street.'\nHowever, her husband Mark dissuaded her from crashing the wedding, telling her it would be 'too upsetting' to be there.\nInstead, the Peatys remained at their home in Uttoxeter - the same home from which Caroline used to ferry her son to and from his countless training sessions and competitions, all those years ago.\n\nView gallery\n\nHolly swept into her wedding in Bath Abbey on the arm of her celebrity chef father Gordon\n\nView gallery\n\nDavid and Victoria arrive for Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty's wedding. Victoria wore one of her own frocks, a stylish £1,290 teal number\n\nEXCLUSIVE Holly Ramsay looked radiant in her billowing ivory gown... but as the wedding party was buffeted by the freezing wind, an even icier text was winging its way to Adam Peaty \nSix weeks ago, Caroline revealed her hurt and bewilderment in the wake of an extraordinary family bust-up that had exploded into the public arena after Holly's very glossy hen-do, to which she was not invited.\nPhotographs of the glamorous gathering, posted on Instagram, notably included the bride-to-be, her family and friends, Victoria Beckham, Adam's sister Bethany, but not Caroline. \nShe was at home, looking after Adam's son, George, five, from his previous relationship with Eirianedd Munro.\nThe move kick started a row between the families, and Adam's brother James was even arrested over allegations he sent threats to the sportsman during his stag.\nJames was questioned by police for two days before being released on conditional bail after allegations he sent Adam a barrage of verbal threats while he was celebrating his stag weekend in the Hungarian capital of Budapest.\nIt was revealed at the time that Caroline was uninvited from attending his wedding as a result of a fallout and was branded a 'narcissist' by his own family over his actions.\nBut since then a source close to the Ramsays pointed to 'wider problems' in the Peaty family which they say lie at the heart of the fallout - and that they are serious.\nThe insider explained that there were 'horrible' threats of violence against Holly, and Adam and that police have been involved.\nA family source told the Daily Mail: 'The boys have always been close, and Jamie, who is a builder, even helped Adam renovate his house.\n'They've always got on, but Adam has changed with his new celebrity lifestyle and family.\n'Now James has a potential charge hanging over his head and his parents have the headache of being disinvited and banned from their son's wedding.\n'This is so hurtful and distressing for our family.'\nAdam was reportedly granted a huge police escort at Manchester airport on night after flying back home from his stag do.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAdam Peaty's estranged brother shares photo of himself and his mother alone outside Bath Abbey wedding venue after they were dis-invited from the Ramsay nuptials - with a VERY pointed song\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nJake Paul watches helplessly as fiancee leaves Olympic qualifying in tears after disaster strikes\n\nKim Kardashian shares rare portrait with all four of her children for Christmas... and no sign of ex Kanye West\n\nEXCLUSIVENashville's brutal secret RANKING of influencers: From the 'cougar'... to the star with an ugly nickname\n\nTiffany Haddish stops comedy show as she recognizes woman who 'saved her life': 'Turn the lights on!'\n\nAna de Armas shows off rock hard abs in skintight workout gear in LA after Tom Cruise split\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

The technology increasingly shaped how people worked, learned, traveled and entertained themselves.\n\nStudents routinely used ChatGPT and other AI tools to help with homework or draft entire papers. Self-driving cars navigated city streets and freeways. AI helped detect cancer, improved weather forecasting, powered video games, and shaped what people watched on Netflix or bought on Amazon.\n\nThe boom lifted Bay Area tech giants, including Google, Meta and AMD, fueling hiring, pushing up housing demand, and accelerating the construction of energy-hungry data centers.\n\nBut it also sparked deep unease: copyright battles, deepfake misinformation, fears of mass job displacement and warnings of a speculative bubble — even science-fiction scenarios in which AI systems could one day be weaponized.\n\n“This is the single most impactful technology of our time,” Huang told Time magazine.\n\nAfter 2025, few argued otherwise.\n\n2) Newsom for president?\n\nAfter nearly seven years as governor, former San Francisco mayor and current Marin County resident Gavin Newsom emerged in 2025 as one of Democrats’ most aggressive national figures — largely by positioning himself as President Donald Trump’s chief antagonist.\n\nWhen Trump returned to office, California sued his administration 50 times. Newsom pushed back against immigration raids, environmental rollbacks and tariffs. When Trump pressured Texas to redraw congressional districts to benefit Republicans, Newsom responded by placing Proposition 50 on California’s ballot, expanding Democratic-leaning districts. Voters approved it in a landslide.\n\nNewsom mocked Trump relentlessly on social media, often using the president’s own confrontational style.\n\nIt remains early in the 2028 presidential cycle, and Newsom carries vulnerabilities, from homelessness to California’s high cost of living.\n\nStill, with one year left as governor, his approval rating rose to 55% in a December PPIC poll, up 10 points from a year earlier. Nationally, the Real Clear Politics polling average from August to December shows him leading potential Democratic rivals, including Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and JB Pritzker.\n\nNewsom has deep-pocketed donors in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. He is energetic, media-savvy and, for many Democrats, willing to go on offense.\n\nWhether that translates into a winning national campaign remains an open question.\n\n3) ICE raids\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration crackdown roiled Bay Area communities in 2025.\n\nFederal agents — many wearing masks — arrested people at workplaces, courthouses, and near churches and schools. Statewide, thousands were deported: some convicted criminals, others longtime residents who had been brought to the U.S. as children or were working low-wage jobs. In some cases, American citizens were wrongfully detained.\n\nTrump also sent Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, and planned similar deployments to the Bay Area.\n\nThat changed Oct. 23, after San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and several tech executives urged Trump to stand down.\n\n“I got a great call from some incredible people, some friends of mine, very successful people,” Trump told reporters, citing Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nThe reversal likely avoided violent clashes between activists and federal authorities. But Bay Area leaders — including Newsom, who secured a court ruling ordering the National Guard out of Los Angeles — warned that tensions would remain high into 2026.\n\n4) Golden State Valkyries’ breakout first season\n\nOn May 16, more than 18,000 fans packed Chase Center in San Francisco — not to watch the Warriors, but to cheer the Golden State Valkyries.\n\nThe WNBA expansion franchise became the league’s first new team in 17 years, and the Bay Area embraced it immediately.\n\nThe Valkyries sold out all 22 home games, set attendance records and became the only expansion team in league history to reach the playoffs in its inaugural season.\n\nHead coach Natalie Nakase was named WNBA Coach of the Year. Guard Veronica Burton won Most Improved Player honors.\n\nIn 2026, the team — owned by Warriors executives Joe Lacob and Peter Guber — will face roster decisions and expectations that come with success. But its debut underscored the Bay Area’s appetite for women’s professional sports.\n\n“That was crazy. Like, you felt it, you know?” forward Janelle Salaün after the season finale. “We felt the energy.”\n\n5) Beloved East Bay football coach John Beam killed\n\nIn the 1946 classic “It’s a Wonderful Life,” Clarence the angel tells George Bailey that each life leaves “an awful hole” when it’s gone.\n\nFew embodied that truth more than John Beam.\n\nAs head football coach at Skyline High School in Oakland from 1987 to 2003, Beam mentored hundreds of young men, many from disadvantaged backgrounds. He compiled a 160-33 record before moving to Laney College, where he continued shaping lives on and off the field.\n\nUnder his guidance, more than 100 players went on to Division I football. Nearly all graduated or transferred to four-year schools. Several reached the NFL. In 2019, his program was featured on Netflix’s “Last Chance U.”\n\nBeam was shot at Laney College on Nov. 13, where he had been serving as athletic director. Cedric Irving Jr., a former player, was charged with murder. The motive remains unclear.\n\nHundreds attended his memorial service Dec. 10.\n\n“For 45 years, he showed up when others stepped back,” Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said. “He believed in our young people before they believed in themselves.”\n\n6) Pelosi announces her retirement\n\nOn Nov. 6, Nancy Pelosi announced she would not seek reelection, ending a political era in San Francisco and Washington.\n\nFirst elected in 1987, Pelosi became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the U.S. House, wielding extraordinary influence during narrow Democratic majorities. She helped shepherd landmark legislation, including the Affordable Care Act, and led two impeachments of Trump.\n\nHer departure triggered a high-profile race to succeed her, with candidates including state Sen. Scott Wiener, Supervisor Connie Chan and former tech executive Saikat Chakrabarti.\n\nPelosi endorsed House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries as her successor, positioning the party for a generational transition.\n\n7) VTA strike shuts down the South Bay\n\nOn March 10, more than 100,000 Silicon Valley residents woke up without buses or light rail. Valley Transportation Agency workers launched the agency’s longest strike, demanding an 18% raise over three years amid soaring housing costs. The agency countered with a 9% raise, noting that ridership had not recovered since COVID-19 and that its operators were already the fifth-highest paid in the nation.\n\nAfter 17 days, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge ordered the union’s 1,500 employees back to work. A new contract approved in June included raises totaling 14.5% over four years and improved benefits.\n\nAs remote work continues to depress ridership, transit agencies are now weighing service cuts or a potential sales tax increase — a debate likely to define Bay Area transportation politics in 2026.\n\n8) Housing and homelessness reforms\n\nFacing voter anger over encampments and housing costs, Bay Area leaders took bolder — and sometimes controversial — steps in 2025.\n\nState lawmakers Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Buffy Wicks of Oakland passed measures overriding local zoning rules to accelerate apartment construction near transit. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan pivoted toward rapid-build interim housing, doubling shelter capacity by adding more than 1,100 beds.\n\nThe approach marked a shift from a strict “Housing First” philosophy and included tougher enforcement, including clearing encampments and penalizing repeated shelter refusals.\n\n“I don’t think it’s humane or compassionate to allow people to live and die on our streets,” Mahan said.\n\nThe strategy, praised by some and criticized by others, elevated Mahan’s profile statewide — and signaled a broader recalibration among Democratic leaders.\n\n9) Driverless cars hit Bay Area freeways\n\nThat car next to you on the freeway may not have a driver.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet Inc., announced its autonomous vehicles would begin offering freeway rides across the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Phoenix — a first in the U.S.\n\nThe driverless taxi race now includes Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox, in a market analysts say could be worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nSkepticism remains. A Waymo vehicle killed a cat in San Francisco’s Mission District in October, drawing public outrage. Supporters counter that autonomous cars do not drive drunk, fall asleep or text — and that human drivers kill about 40,000 people annually.\n\nThe companies are beginning to offer service to airports and to teens as young as 14 who can use them to get to school. In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to more than a dozen other American cities. “Running on empty” is about to take on a whole new meaning.\n\n10) Gang fears at San Jose shopping malls\n\nIn February, 15-year-old David Gutierrez was stabbed to death at Santana Row in San Jose while on a Valentine’s Day date. Police said attackers mistook him for a rival gang member.\n\nNine months later, on Black Friday, a shooting at Westfield Valley Fair in Santa Clara injured three people and sent thousands fleeing.\n\nProsecutors charged a 17-year-old suspect with attempted murder, seeking adult court penalties that could bring decades in prison. Police said the teen was wearing red and encountered others wearing blue, a color associated with a rival gang.\n\nSan Jose Mayor Mahan and other local leaders called for tougher sentencing for gang crime — reigniting a statewide debate over juvenile justice, public safety and political risk in a year that left many Bay Area residents on edge.","summary":"AI booms, Newsom rises, driverless cars take to the freeways, and the Golden State Valkyries begin with flair","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/28/the-top-10-bay-area-stories-of-2025-and-what-they-mean-for-2026/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/France_Vivatech_93460.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 12:00:23","author":"Paul Rogers","authors":["Paul Rogers"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.198},{"id":389665976,"title":"Open Forum, Part 1","text":"Shop the C-SPAN Store - Great Gift Ideas\n\nKeep Democracy Unfiltered – Donate Now\n\nWatch C-SPAN Anywhere, Anytime on C-SPAN Now\n\nStraight from the sources: Get WORD FOR WORD\n\nTake a Deeper Look at Congress\n\nKeep Democracy Unfiltered – Donate Now\n\nYour gift supports C-SPAN’s mission to provide unedited, unfiltered coverage of government.

They have nothing better to do, part of the Left’s ongoing derangement about Donald Trump’s second presidency. Get over it. We won; the Democrats lost, and he and his administration get to do things as they see fit, based on the results of the 2024 election, in which Trump bested Kamala Harris in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. The latter is what counts, obviously, but the Democrats always fall back on the popular vote to fuel their ‘abolish the Electoral College’ nonsense. They couldn’t do that in 2024, which was supremely satisfying as it was a thorough a** whooping. \n\nSo, when this White House wished Americans a Merry Christmas on the day, which is celebrated by over a billion people worldwide, you bet the liberal media went nuts. Trump did something, and it was also a message that the overwhelming majority in this country wouldn’t find bothersome (via WaPo): \n\nTop officials in President Donald Trump’s administration posted messages from their government accounts hailing Christmas in explicitly sectarian terms, such as a day to celebrate the birth of “our Savior Jesus Christ.” The Department of Homeland Security posted three messages on social media Thursday and Friday, twice declaring, “Christ is Born!” and once stating, “We are blessed to share a nation and a Savior.” One DHS video posted on X displayed religious images, including Jesus, a manger and crosses. The messages sharply diverged from the more secular, Santa Claus-and-reindeer style of Christmas messages that have been the norm for government agencies for years. The posts provided the latest example of the administration’s efforts to promote the cultural views and language of Trump’s evangelical Christian base. […] Those social media posts are “one more example of the Christian Nationalist rhetoric the Trump administration has disseminated since Day One in office,” Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said in a statement. “Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation has allowed religious diversity — including different denominations of Christianity — to flourish in America. “People of all religions and none should not have to sift through proselytizing messages to access government information,” she added. “It’s divisive and un-American.” \n\nOf course, those people would be upset about the proclamations. No one cares. Most Americans who didn’t throw a tantrum and cut off family members, aka the normies, celebrated with their families. For everyone else who was upset that Trump did this, get a grip. Also, an excessive amount of time was spent analyzing Trump’s level of Christian support and whether that was the reason. No, it was Christmas Day. You say, Merry Christmas. Hanukkah is over, and Kwanzaa is a fake holiday. \n\nThere was only one holiday on the 25th of December, you clowns. \n\nYet, this article in the Washington Post wasn't nearly as bad as Politico EU, which tried to claim that Christmas was a right-wing holiday, or 'hijacked' by the right-wing. We all got the point. It was still stupid. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Shame on you both. Shame.\n'Remember on this, your happiest day, and on each anniversary of your happiest day, that you hurt your mum so deeply her soul screams.'\n\nView gallery\n\nNow TV presenter Dan, 48, who competed in Strictly with Adam in 2021, has taken to Instagram to share a photo of the couple's order of service \n\nHe wrote: 'We had a lovely time celebrating with @adam_peaty & @hollyramsayy yesterday. Great wedding, top people, wonderful service, unforgettable reception'\n\nView gallery\n\nDan attended the ceremony with his wife Sarah \n\nEXCLUSIVE The VERY humble origins of Adam Peaty's father-in-law to be, Gordon Ramsay \nThe roots of this terrible family conflict go back to September 2024, when Adam and Holly snubbed wider members of the Peaty family by not inviting them to their engagement party.\nCaroline, who spent years ferrying her son to early–morning training sessions, was also not invited to Holly's glamorous hen do at Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds last month, even though the bride's mother, Tana Ramsay, and friends including Victoria Beckham, were at the extravagant bash.\nDespite everything Caroline sent a card and gift to her newlywed son for his 31st birthday today.\nMeanwhile, Adam's 73–year–old great–aunt Janet, who was also left out of yesterday's wedding, told The Mail on Sunday: 'I just feel so sorry for Caroline.\n'I can't believe he's done this to his mother who's done so much for him from an early age. To be treated like this is not kind.'\nDespite being shunned, devastated Caroline had threatened to turn up at the wedding anyway – and, if barred from entering the abbey, stand outside and watch from the street.\nShe said yesterday that she changed her mind after her husband Mark convinced her it would be 'too upsetting' to go along.\nHad she defied her son's ban, she would have found herself face–to–face with five security guards, placed in front of the abbey's ancient and elaborately carved wooden doors, which were framed by decorative columns of white roses and hydrangeas.\nThe Ramsay family splashed out thousands on the venue, where weddings normally cost around £2,500, block–booking it for the day to ensure the service took place in absolute secrecy.\nHaving found fame and fortune for his foul–mouthed antics in the kitchen, Gordon Ramsay was on his best behaviour as he helped his 25–year–old daughter from a black Rolls–Royce which drew up outside the Gothic abbey at about 12.30pm.\nHe was seen whispering in her ear before kissing her cheek while an attendant straightened her crumpled outfit.\nBuffeted by an icy wind, the pair were mobbed by well–wishers shouting 'Merry Christmas' as they passed.\nWaiting inside for a first glimpse of the bride was a celebrity–studded congregation, including Sir David and Victoria Beckham, who are no strangers to family feuds themselves.\n\nAdam Peaty's sister Bethany joins Holly Ramsay's bridal party\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:35\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam's mother Caroline (picture), who spent years ferrying her son to early–morning training sessions, was not invited to the couple's wedding - or to Holly's glamorous hen do last month\n\n Happily married! Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay leave Bath Abbey after getting wed in front of Beckhams \nTheir sons Romeo and Cruz and daughter Harper, who are close friends of the Ramsays, were also there – but not estranged son Brooklyn.\nMarcus Wareing from Masterchef: The Professionals and his wife Jane were also there.\nThe ensuing ceremony, one guest later told The Mail on Sunday, was 'beautiful and very emotional'.\nLike Adam, who is a devout Christian, Holly was determined that they would exchange vows in a religious service. Peaty's son George, from a previous relationship, was said to have played a pivotal role in the ceremony.\nThe three bridesmaids were Holly's older sister Megan, 27, younger sister Tilly, 24, and Adam's sister Bethany – the only member of his family to be invited to the event, as well as to the hen party.\nOther relatives said Bethany had been included as one of the bride's attendants because she 'fits in' with the Ramsays' glamorous world.\nIn what was seen by some as a display of defiance against her family, Bethany linked arms with Holly's eldest sister as they entered the abbey carrying white arum lilies.\nThe bridesmaids wore red flowing dresses designed by Victoria Beckham. The former Spice Girl also wore one of her own frocks, a £1,290 teal number, and the dark green silk dress worn by the bride's mother, 51–year–old Tana,was also from Lady Beckham's label. Peaty, meanwhile, slicked back his hair and wore the same dinner suit as his new father–in–law.\nThere was no word, however, on the designer behind Holly's romantic floral–patterned lace dress which was kept under wraps until the influencer was inside the abbey, away from prying cameras.\nOther than the glaring absence of Peaty's family, the bride and groom were declared man and wife without any drama. The newlyweds left church at around 1.30pm to a joyful peal from the abbey bells and were driven away to their reception at Kin House, a Georgian manor house 17 miles away, near Chippenham.\n\nThe Beckhams are seen arriving at Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty wedding\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:30\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nThere, guests were served a wedding banquet which featured prawn cocktail, beef Wellington and pan–roasted halibut followed by a tarte tatin. A tradition wedding cake was served at 8pm.\nA source said: 'Holly and Adam have been meticulous in their planning and it's come together perfectly. They couldn't wait to share everything with their guests.'\nWhile the ceremony and reception were conducted in the utmost secrecy, it's likely they will feature in an upcoming Netflix documentary series about life in the Ramsay family.\nIts airing – expected early next year – may well be the first proper glimpse Caroline Peaty will get of her own son's wedding.\nFor the time being, mother and son remain tragically at loggerheads, unable to mend their differences and patch up their formerly close relationship. This is one story in search of a happy ending.\nDan WalkerGordon RamsayVictoria Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAdam Peaty's Strictly Come Dancing co-star shares first glimpse inside Olympian's 'unforgettable' wedding to Holly Ramsay at Bath Abbey\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (80)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nCCaperWinterIndex, London, United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nWE DONT CARE!!\n\nClick to rate\n\nBBearSoapCare, London, United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nMake it stop!

Tim Walz, Democrats tap influencers to spread political message","text":"To spread the word about his run for a third term, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sat for interviews with social media influencers at a St. Paul bar in September.\n\nOne of the content creators handed the DFL governor a bottle of his favorite soft drink, Diet Mountain Dew, and asked him to share something people didn’t know about him. Another asked Walz about providing reliable information on vaccines to families, and she thanked him for making Minnesota “one of the best places to raise a family.”\n\nA third influencer who spoke to Walz created an Instagram post afterward to rebut Republicans who’ve criticized the governor and Democrats for spending a previous $17.6 billion budget surplus. “Using surplus cash when available is actually a conservative fiscal strategy,” she posted.\n\nThe interviews were part of a new political strategy — one that many believe is overdue for the left, but which, Democrats are learning, is not always as simple as fielding a series of softball questions.\n\nAfter Republicans outmaneuvered Democrats online in the 2024 election, Walz and the DFL are trying to build their own network of content creators to reach audiences that don’t consume traditional media. They’ve learned from their party’s electoral beating and the missteps preceding it, such as when Kamala Harris declined an interview with Joe Rogan while President Donald Trump seized the opportunity to appear on the world’s most popular podcast.\n\n“The DFL has to approach our attempts to reach voters differently than we ever have,” said Minnesota DFL Chair Richard Carlbom. “The youth vote is the new swing vote.”\n\nInfluencers have gotten exclusive time with Walz and other top Democrats in recent months while the governor’s team has brushed off interview requests from the Minnesota Star Tribune and other legacy local news outlets.\n\nBy engaging social media influencers, politicians are going where the audience is larger, the format is more relaxed, and the tone is friendlier. The setting provides an opportunity for candidates to come across more authentically while giving both them and the content creators a credibility boost with the audience.","summary":"After Republicans outmaneuvered Democrats online in the 2024 election, Walz and fellow Democrats are trying to build their own network of content creators.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-and-the-dfl-are-tapping-influencers-to-spread-their-message/601546526","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/6W6VTAOGXRACRNNPMNX6S5EQ44.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 11:00:00","author":"Ryan Faircloth","authors":["Ryan Faircloth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.24},{"id":389654992,"title":"Kennedy magic: America's storied political dynasty roared back in 2025","text":"WASHINGTON – Stepping inside Kathleen Kennedy Townsend’s sun-filled apartment is like stepping into American history.\n\nA letter from her father Robert F. Kennedy hangs in the hallway.\n\n\"Dear Kathleen, as the oldest of the Kennedy grandchildren you have a special responsibility: Be kind to others and work for your country,” RFK wrote his 12-year-old daughter, two days after the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in 1963.\n\nFor members of the Kennedy clan, that sense of responsibility is being tested by one of their own: Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Townsend's younger brother and a top member of President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nMore: Senate confirms Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services\n\n“I would not say there’s a lot of peace in my family,” she said, alluding to the tragedies and scandals that have preyed on the Kennedy dynasty, including the assassination of her own father in 1968 while running for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThat's certainly been true in 2025, the 100th anniversary of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s birth, which saw his namesake accused of spreading vaccine conspiracies and groping a babysitter during a televised Senate confirmation hearing, the release of government files on the JFK and RFK assassinations, and mass firings and scientific turmoil at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTownsend, 74, the oldest grandchild of the Kennedy family matriarch Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and power broker Joseph Kennedy, is unassuming and friendly. She often puts her arm on the shoulder of a reporter as she offers explanations of framed letters and memorabilia lining her long entryway.\n\nThere’s a large red leather swivel chair in the study that her father sat in when he was the U.S. attorney general.

What to know about JFK assassination files\n\nCall it the Kennedy magic. The ability to connect with people that has kept America’s most storied political family at the heart its politics for more than half of its 250-year history.\n\nThe clan experienced a generational handoff after Sen. Ted Kennedy, the youngest sibling of JFK and RFK, died in 2009 while in his 47th year serving in the Senate. RFK's oldest son, Joseph Kennedy II, a former congressman, declined to run for the ensuing open Massachusetts Senate seat. His son, Joseph P. Kennedy III– RFK's grandson – served in Congress for four terms but gave up his seat to unsuccessfully run in the Democratic Senate primary in Massachusetts in 2020. There has been no Kennedy in Congress since then.\n\nNow, the Kennedy name is back, but in a manner that has horrified most members of an extended brood that maintains deep and historic ties to the Democratic party. In April 2023, RFK Jr. launched a long-shot Democratic primary challenge against then-President Joe Biden. Six months later, he was running for the White House as an independent before ultimately abandoning his campaign to endorse Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nMore: RFK Jr. suspends campaign; endorses former President Trump\n\nAfter Trump's election, RFK Jr. joined the new Cabinet and rolled out a slew of controversial actions as part of his Make America Healthy Again platform. Multiple Kennedy family members have called their relative out as complicit in “cruel” policies of the Trump administration. There have been newspaper opinion pieces, magazine articles and letters to senators from the family warning against RFK Jr.’s qualifications, character and policies.\n\nIt’s not just MAHA. The family has been buffeted by the release of the JFK and RFK assassination files, while seeing the Kennedy legacy diluted as Trump leveled former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's garden during his demolition of the East Wing and renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington as the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.”\n\nMore: Trump's name quickly added to facade of Kennedy Center\n\nMaria Shriver, a niece of RFK and JFK, said in a post on X it was “beyond comprehension” that Trump had sought to “rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy.\"\n\nDuring an interview with CBS, RFK’s grandson, Joseph Kennedy III, panned Trump’s renaming a “living memorial to a fallen president” like it was a New York City skyscraper.\n\nThe year drew to a close with a millennial member of the Kennedy family, Jack Schlossberg - grandson of JFK and an ardent critic of RFK Jr. - announcing a run for an open U.S. House seat from Manhattan.\n\n“SEND ME TO CONGRESS TO SMOKE THESE FOOLS- MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR I won’t back down or be drowned out,\" Schlossberg wrote Dec. 18 on social media.\n\n'No Irish need apply'\n\nRose Fitzgerald Kennedy’s father, John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, was elected as a U.S. congressman from Massachusetts in 1894 and later became Boston’s first Irish-American mayor.\n\n“I spent a lot of time with my grandmother, Rose Kennedy,” says Townsend. “And she would talk about how when she was growing up, there were signs still – even though her father was the mayor of Boston – that said, 'Help wanted - no Irish need apply.'”\n\n“And I think that she passed that on to her children as well,” Townsend said of her privileged family. “What injustice feels like.”\n\nThe Kennedy legacy that Rose Kennedy helped forge with her husband continues to shape American politics.\n\nIt’s that sense of justice that led JFK to initiate the push for a bill aimed at ending discriminatory quotas and a preference for northern Europeans, says Townsend. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, two years after Kennedy's assassination. Ted Kennedy, who won a special election in 1962 to fill the seat his brother vacated to become president, championed it in Congress.\n\nFredrik Logevall, a professor of history at Harvard University, is writing a multi-volume biography of John F. Kennedy. He said part of the reason the Kennedys are such an extraordinary American story is that the close-knit family shares a political philosophy and an optimistic view of what America could achieve.\n\nMore: John F. Kennedy was in office for less than 3 years, but his legacy lives on\n\nLogevall described JFK’s brand of Democratic politics as “pragmatic liberalism,” RFK as deeply committed to liberalism and Ted Kennedy as left of center.\n\n'Betrayal' of Robert F. Kennedy's legacy\n\nBut the common thread was that “they had faith in America, in this flawed, but real democracy,” Logevall said, adding: “That’s why up until this moment, the Kennedys were in agreement with one another politically.”\n\nWith his role as a top lieutenant to Trump and his embrace of the bombastic MAGA movement, Logevall said RFK Jr. “is out of step with what the Kennedy family has stood for politically and continues to stand for.”\n\nMore: Kennedy: America's kids are obese. Making families healthier starts with the food we eat.\n\nIn November, Maxwell Kennedy wrote a searing opinion article in the Boston Globe accusing his older brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., of a \"betrayal\" of their father's legacy by supporting the Trump administration's cuts to food assistance programs for “America’s neediest.”\n\nAn environmental attorney for about 30 years, RFK Jr's embrace of Trump has mystified his family. During his first term, Trump's administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. Tapping RFK Jr. to join his second term, Trump promised to let him “go wild” on health, food and medicine.\n\n\"Donald Trump is anathema to everything our family stands for,\" Kerry Kennedy, one of RFK Jr.'s siblings, told USA TODAY in August 2024. \"I distance myself and reject everything that Bobby is doing and saying because I think that it's a rejection of our family's values and everything that I've spent my life working for....And, frankly, everything Bobby spent his life working for.\"\n\nIf her father and uncle were still alive, they’d have detested everything about Trump, Kerry Kennedy added in the interview where she described her plans to stump for Kamala Harris, who by then had replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nResponding before Election Day 2024 to his family's criticism, RFK Jr. told Fox News that he understood that his relatives were troubled by his decisions. \"But, you know, I think we all need to be able to disagree with each other and still love each other,” he said.\n\n'God sent me President Trump'\n\nLess than 10 days after Trump won his second term as president, he tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nKennedy’s nomination faced fierce resistance from many in the scientific community over his promotion of unfounded claims about vaccines causing autism and antidepressants being linked to school shootings. On the eve of Kennedy's confirmation hearing, his cousin and the only living child of JFK posted a video on social media calling Kennedy a \"predator.\"\n\nMore: Exclusive: Former babysitter to RFK Jr.'s kids speaks about sexual assault allegation\n\n“I have known Bobby my whole life,\" Caroline Kennedy said in the video, in which she read aloud a letter she wrote to senators who'd be voting on RFK Jr.'s nomination. \"We grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.\"\n\nRFK Jr. did not respond to Caroline Kennedy's allegation.\n\nFollowing Senate approval as one of Trump’s Cabinet picks, RFK Jr. was sworn into his new job during an Oval Office ceremony surrounded by his wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and his children.\n\n\"For 20 years, I'm up every morning on my knees and praying that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country,\" he said. \"God sent me President Trump.\" \n\nOver the last 11 months, Kennedy has made sweeping changes to vaccines, food and prescription drug policies. He's also targeted ultra-processed foods, linking them to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and certain cancers. \n\nRFK Jr’s MAHA policies around food regulation and limiting animal testing have found broad bipartisan support from the American public, according to polls. That's in contrast to his policies around vaccines and severe funding cuts to HHS, which have been roundly criticized by scientists and lawmakers of both parties. In March, Kennedy announced the consolidation of divisions and elimination of 20,000 full-time employees in a major restructuring, saying it would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.\n\nMore: RFK Jr.'s MAHA movement is coming to a state near you\n\nIn June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's expert vaccine panel and filled many of the positions with people who have been vaccine skeptics or questioned COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nPublic criticism, once again, came from his family. In a New Yorker essay headlined 'A battle with my blood,' Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of JFK and daughter of Caroline Kennedy, revealed that she had less than a year to live. She minced no words.\n\nMore: What to know about Tatiana Schlossberg, author and JFK's granddaughter\n\n\"As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,\" wrote Schlossberg, 35, who is undergoing treatment for a rare form of blood cancer. \"Slashed billions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest sponsor of medical research.\"\n\nSchlossberg wrote that despite her mother’s letter to the Senate and her brother, Jack Scholssberg, speaking out “against his lies for months, I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government.\"\n\nHolding on to the legacy of feeling others' pain\n\nGiven that RFK Jr. currently holds the most high-profile political position in the famed family, where does that leave the Kennedy legacy?\n\nFor her part, Townsend, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, has made it her mission to advocate for strong regulations and accountability in the tech industry. She currently serves as an advisor for a nonprofit called Guard Rail Now to help states develop AI regulations.\n\nThe oldest of 11 children, Townsend was 16 years old when her father was assassinated. As far as the family legacy, she says each member has the \"obligation to make our country fairer, more just, and to give back.\"\n\nBeing the oldest, has she ever thought of herself as the peacekeeper in the family? Townsend said she didn’t see it that way. “I don't know if this search for peace is really an appropriate way to live,” she replied. “I think it's more important to feel other people's pain and your own pain.\"\n\nMore: The Kennedy curse: With Saoirse's death, a look at who else tragically died in this prominent family\n\nIt’s also important to feel joy when joy is appropriate, Townsend said, a lesson she learned from her mother, who with a sense of humor and a zest for life raised the large family after her husband’s assassination.\n\n“Joy is not peaceful. Joy is enthusiasm,\" Townsend said, adding with a laugh: \"My mother didn't go around looking for peace. She felt joy and excitement and thrill and a desire to win at tennis - that's not peace.\"\n\nWhile family members might have differing definitions of patriotism, one thing is clear: The Kennedys do not shy away from being public about what they believe is right. Maintaining family peace is not the priority.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Democrats still face an uphill battle to net the four seats they need to take control of the Senate, which would involve winning at least two states that President Donald Trump carried by double digits in 2024. But they see a glimmer of hope following victories in the 2025 elections and as Trump’s approval rating, particularly on his handling of the economy, has dropped. And Democrats believe they can capitalize on issues such as high costs and health care, while Republicans continue to struggle to turn out Trump’s supporters when he is not on the ballot. Republicans, though, remain confident that they will hold onto the Senate —and potentially even grow their majority, given the GOP’s recent success in states with the most competitive Senate races next year. And they’re optimistic the party will be able to run on Trump’s accomplishments, suggesting voters will begin to reap the benefits of Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending legislation ahead of voting in November 2026. Both parties will have to contend with potentially divisive and costly primaries, which could further shake up the Senate landscape. So far, the battle for the Senate majority is playing out across 10 key races. Here's what the map looks like. The core four It has been clear since the start of the election cycle that the fight for the Senate would center on four crucial states: Maine, North Carolina, Michigan and Georgia. Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the only Republican senator representing a state then-Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, when the Democrat carried Maine by nearly 7 points. Collins is also the only GOP senator in New England and, Republicans say, the party's only candidate who could win the Maine Senate race next year. Collins won re-election in 2020 by 9 points even as Trump lost the state by a similar margin. Collins has not yet officially launched her campaign, but she said at a recent Punchbowl News event, “I still plan to run for re-election.” She won’t know her opponent until June, with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills facing off against military veteran Graham Platner in the Democratic primary. Mills has pitched herself as the candidate best positioned to beat Collins, touting her clashes with Trump and her record as the only Democrat to win a statewide race in Maine in 20 years. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has set up a joint fundraising committee with Mills, signaling that party leaders view Mills as the strongest candidate. Platner, meanwhile, has made his case as the anti-establishment candidate and staunch progressive with the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. He said his campaign has been “strengthened” by recent controversies, including revelations that he had a tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol, which he has since covered up, and past Reddit posts that included a slew of controversial and offensive comments. Platner apologized for many of the posts, saying he was “disillusioned” after his military service. North Carolina Both parties believe they have strong recruits to replace retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis and this race is expected to be one of the most expensive Senate contests next year. Former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is running, while Republicans have tapped former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley. Both candidates are already in general election mode, though Whatley — who has Trump’s endorsement — did draw a last-minute primary challenge from Michele Morrow, a far-right candidate who lost a bid to be the state’s top education official last year. Trump has been successful in North Carolina, the only battleground the president has won three times, and he carried it by 3 points last year. But Democrats believe Cooper’s popularity and winning record, as well as key issues like health care, could paint a North Carolina Senate seat blue for the first time since 2008. Georgia Jon Ossoff, the only Senate Democrat running for re-election in a state Trump won, is Republicans’ top target next year. The first-term senator has been raising millions and focusing on issues including health care, the economy and corruption. But Republicans believe they can cast Ossoff as a far-left progressive, pointing to some of his positions on immigration, impeachment and the government shutdown. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to pass on a Senate run sparked a three-way GOP primary between Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins and former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, who has Kemp’s endorsement. Trump, who won Georgia by 2 points in 2024, has not yet weighed in on the primary. Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters’ retirement opened up the Senate race in this battleground state. Republicans, led by Trump, have coalesced around former Rep. Mike Rogers, who lost a close Senate race last year even as Trump won Michigan by 1 point. The Democratic primary is a three-way race between moderate Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a self-described “pragmatist,” and progressive physician Abdul El-Sayed. The primary has already exposed divisions on the future of the state’s manufacturing sector and support for Israel, and the nominee won’t be decided until August. Expanding the map The Senate battle could extend beyond the core four states in part thanks to candidates the parties think can bend results away from the norm in a few states. Ohio Democrats scored a big recruiting win when former Sen. Sherrod Brown decided to challenge GOP Sen. Jon Husted, the former lieutenant governor who was appointed to the Senate after JD Vance resigned to serve as vice president. Brown is widely viewed as one of the only Democrats who could make the special election to serve the final two years of Vance’s term competitive. The former senator lost re-election by nearly 4 points last year as Trump won Ohio by 11 points. Operatives in both parties say the race is now expected to draw significant resources after ad spending in last year’s Senate race reached more than $480 million, according to AdImpact. New Hampshire With Sen. Jeanne Shaheen retiring, both parties are eyeing New Hampshire as an open, competitive Senate race next year after Harris won the Granite State by 3 points. Senate Republican leaders have backed former Sen. John Sununu, who lost to Shaheen in 2008. But Sununu is running in the primary against Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts senator and Trump ambassador, and that nominating fight won’t be resolved until early September. Rep. Chris Pappas is considered the clear front-runner in the Democratic primary, and Democrats believe his deep ties to the state and proven ability to win competitive races put them in a strong position to hold the seat. Keep an eye on these races Other potentially competitive Senate races in redder or bluer states hinge on the outcomes of contentious primaries — and whether potentially strong candidates actually decide to run. Texas Both parties are navigating hotly contested Senate primaries early next year — though the Republican primary is expected to go past March 3, with none of the candidates likely to win a majority of the vote given the three-way race between Sen. John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. If no one wins a majority of the primary vote, the top two vote-getters would advance to a May runoff. All three candidates have stressed their loyalty to Trump in the primary, which has already seen millions of dollars in ads. That spending has mostly come from Cornyn allies who believe he is best positioned to prevail in a state Trump won by 14 points last year. Trump, so far, is staying on the sidelines. The Democratic primary between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico has become a battle over the best path forward for the party. Crockett has taken direct aim at Trump and said she can energize a “multiracial, multigenerational coalition,” including many people who haven't previously voted, while Talarico has said he can appeal to voters in both parties who are “hungry for sincerity and honesty and compassion.” Iowa There is also a contested Democratic primary in Iowa, where GOP Sen. Joni Ernst is retiring. State Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian, as well as state Sen. Zach Wahls and military veteran Nathan Sage are all competing for their party's nomination. Despite recent Republicans’ gains in the state, which Trump won by 13 points in 2024, Democrats believe the race could be competitive as Iowans grapple with health care access and Trump’s tariff policies. Republicans, including Trump, quickly coalesced around Rep. Ashley Hinson as their candidate to replace Ernst. Hinson, who flipped a Democratic district in 2020, is viewed as a rising star in the party. Alaska Democrats are waiting to see if former Rep. Mary Peltola, who represented the entire state of Alaska in Congress, will jump into the race against GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan. Peltola has also been eyeing a run for governor, after losing re-election last year by 3 points as Trump won Alaska by 13 points. Sullivan has signaled that he recognizes he could have a competitive race, particularly as health care emerges as a top midterm issue. The two-term senator recently supported a Democratic proposal to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for an additional three years. Minnesota Republicans are waiting on a top-tier candidate in Minnesota, which Trump lost by 4 points last year. Michele Tafoya, a longtime NFL sideline reporter-turned-conservative commentator, is considering a run for Senate, according to three sources familiar with her thinking. One source said Tafoya met with the National Republican Senatorial Committee earlier in December and could make a final decision in January. Former professional basketball player Royce White and retired Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze are also running. On the Democratic side, Rep. Angie Craig and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are battling to replace retiring Sen. Tina Smith, with Flanagan casting herself as the progressive candidate and Craig stressing her bipartisan appeal.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/10-senate-races-will-decide-balance-power-2026-rcna248276","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251217-susan-collins-john-ossoff-mn-1525-1ba60f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 10:00:00","author":"Bridget Bowman","authors":["Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":389711358,"title":"Should we ban social media for under-16s? Irish teens share their thoughts","text":"Earlier this month Australia became the first country in the world to ban social media for children under the age of 16. It’s a move that’s being watched closely around the globe, not least by those aged under 16, wondering if this could become their reality too. \n\nHere, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “there needs to be more debate on whether blanket bans are the way to go”, while Tánaiste Simon Harris said he is “very supportive of the idea of social media being restricted to people above a certain age”.\n\nBut what do those likely to be affected if a similar ban was to happen in Ireland think? \n\nSarah Davitt (15), from Blackrock, Co Dublin, recently returned from a trip to Brussels with the Webwise Youth Panel, which is focused on raising awareness of online safety.\n\n“I personally would be against it [the ban] being brought in to Ireland,” she says. “By banning something outright, less education is going to be put forward. If we’re trying to educate our youth on social media, we cannot do that unless we have the use of social media.”\n\nShe says “restrictions and safety by design” are more appropriate. If a ban was to happen, however, she feels it should be geared towards 12- and 13-year-olds. \n\nShe believes a ban will make social media “more attractive”. \n\n“Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out.\n\n“I don’t think people realise how easy it is to work a VPN,” Sarah says, referring to a virtual private network. “Changing the country’s location is so phenomenally easy ... I’ve seen my friends do it when their parents are really strict on social media ... Most people my age, even if they’re allowed or not allowed social media by their parents, have accounts.” \n\nShe says there needs to be more education and “digital media literacy”. \n\n“If we bring in this ban we’re just going to presume kids aren’t on social media, because they shouldn’t be there, which then just creates a worse social media space ... Without having social media companies held accountable for keeping online safe for kids, it’s not going to be created safe for anyone else.”\n\nShe points also to the opportunities social media creates for people who are part of minority groups to connect. \n\n“Most people have seen harmful videos on the internet. I think most of my friends and I saw the video of when Charlie Kirk was shot ... Obviously the trad wife trend, that has been very prevalent on social media recently. I understand that the Government is trying to help us and trying to protect us. And I do agree that something has to be done, and done soon ... banning it at 16 is just not the solution.” \n\nZach Moore (14), from Greenhills, Dublin, uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and YouTube mostly. Social media is important to him. He too is part of the Webwise Youth Panel.\n\n“If I’m bored, I’d probably go on social media. If I needed to know something, I’d look it up. And I talk to my friends as well,” Zach says. If he comes across misogynistic, racist or other unacceptable content he says he ignores it or reports it.\n\n“That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped. He seems like a bit of an extremist,” Zach says. He can see how this material can target boys.\n\n“I can definitely why they’d want to ban it, but to be honest I don’t think a complete ban would solve anything ... I think they would have been better to have mandatory parental controls. Leave it up to the parents.”\n\nZach worries he spends too much time on social media sometimes. But he thinks if a ban was introduced in Ireland young people might spend more time trying to get around the ban rather than doing other things.\n\nHe thinks some adults understand how important social media is to young people. “But some think that it’s all bad,” he says. “I don’t think that it’s all bad, but there definitely are certain areas that are malicious, or there’s no good intent.”\n\n[ Could Ireland follow Australia and ban under-16s from social media?Opens in new window ]\n\nHe’d like to see “stricter moderation on platforms” and more education and support provided to teenagers on how to navigate problematic content that they might come across. \n\nHe thinks the youth voice is important. “It’s definitely good to hear from people who are going to be directly affected, or people who are at risk of coming under the ban.” He expects adults and younger people may hold polar opposite views.\n\nZach doesn’t think adults necessarily know best on this. “Especially with social media because it’s only really gained this much traction over the past 15 years.”\n\nEve Cullen, from Tipperary, is 15. She uses TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. \n\nShe feels “in theory it’s a good idea to stop letting kids use social media” but argues that a cut-off age of 16 is too high. “Eleven or 12 would be perfect.” At 15, she says, “a lot of our lives revolve around social media and it’s important to have”. She believes people will easily find a way around any ban. “I feel like a lot of the people who brought in this ban might not have kids themselves. Parents might know more about how kids are going to get around it.”\n\nMany young people find their “community” online, Eve says. She uses Snapchat to call and text people she already knows. “It’s great to meet new people on TikTok.” Eve says most young people have their wits about them when it comes to the danger of being contacted by strangers who may not be who they claim to be. “I don’t think it’s as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be.” \n\nEve has seen some upsetting content online. “I figure a way to go around it and ignore it. It’s not a huge thing online for me.” She insists she’s not hugely influenced by political, health or wellness content she sees online, saying she’s more likely to try out a recipe.\n\nShe believes there are lots of positives to social media. “I love doing knitting and crochet and stuff like that. And there’s not many people in Thurles, where I live, that would be into that as well. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it. But if social media was banned then I’d be very lonely in that hobby.”\n\nAt school, Eve uses Instagram for her transition year (TY) mini-company. “Everyone in TY in our school [uses Instagram] to promote and advertise our products,” she explains. \n\nHer social media “used to be controlled when I was younger. There was an app on my phone that would block screen time,” Eve explains. But she feels at this age she is able to “self-police”. \n\nShe worries that if teenagers weren’t granted access to social media until the age of 16, they wouldn’t know what things they “should look out for. They might get scammed, even, because they’ve never been exposed to it,” she says.\n\nHolly Heneghan (16) lives in Westmeath. She says she would hate a ban.\n\n“With Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, the main three for me, it’s entertainment. Snapchat is for communicating with my friends ... I call and text on Snapchat.” \n\nShe has seen things on social media that she doesn’t feel are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds to see, but feels things have improved. “There is still a lot of body positive stuff on social media now. [More] than there was when I was 12.” \n\nShe has come across problematic material but “not necessarily in the apps that have been banned”. Inappropriate material can show up in advertisements that crop up in games, she explains. \n\n“There are times I’ve spent too much time on social media,” Holly admits, “but I go on social media because it shows me things I’m interested in. It gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like.”\n\nShe doesn’t believe teens will accept the ban. “I think they’ll try and figure out a way to keep their social media.” \n\nHolly thinks a ban would make those under 16 more secretive about their social media use. She feels adults don’t necessarily understand the huge support social media can offer, including academically.\n\n“On TikTok there is a Stem site. It can teach you maths, science and engineering.” She believes the positives of social media outweigh the negatives. \n\nHannah Goff (16) from Dublin, thinks a social media ban “is a really good idea” for younger people, but feels 14 or 15 may be a more appropriate cut-off age.\n\n“I don’t think people under 16 actually need phones to function.” \n\nShe thinks younger teens could organise meet-ups through parents. “I think it might be easier as well for parents to understand where their child is and what their child might be doing.” \n\nShe feels not having a phone could lead to under-16s meeting up with their friends in person more frequently. “However, I do think in Ireland there’s a lack of things to do for people under 16.” \n\nHannah has learned a lot about content awareness in school. “If you know how to use social media, you’re better off with it, but I think people a lot of the time were just handing their kids phones ... and then they’re not really prepared for what they come across. \n\n[ A grand social media experiment begins in Australia. Will it work?Opens in new window ]\n\n“During the elections in the US I did see a lot of propaganda for Trump and Kamala. But I would just scroll past that. I don’t think I’ve seen anything that has been particularly disturbing or upsetting. But also I’ve been very careful to avoid that.”\n\n“You do see a lot of people online who are very different to how they normally look. They’re edited.” She feels younger people could be vulnerable to this. “I’ve seen a lot of eight- to 10-year-olds now who are using all the internet make-up”.\n\nHannah believes the under-16s “will definitely” try to get around any ban “considering when the Yondr pouch was brought in. Everyone’s gotten around it at this point.\n\n“Teenagers, you tell them something to do and they will do the opposite. You give them a barrier and they’re going to go under it, over it, through it,” she says. \n\nDr Colman Noctor, child and adolescent psychotherapist, says delaying access until a young person is mature enough “is the right thing to do”. But, he adds, “the how you do that is more complex”.\n\nHe feels the Australian strategy, “while well intended, may not work”. \n\n“Imposing bans will always meet resistance and so some form of alliance with young people is far more likely to be successful. However, the difficulty is that young people think adults don’t have a clue about social media, and adults don’t think young people have a clue about real life. And both are probably true, but meeting a consensus will take time.\n\n“While I’m not sure the ban is the answer, waiting around for another 15 years to gain consensus is not a workable solution either,” Noctor says. “The damage of social media is happening now. \n\n“For me the only way this will be resolved is if the social media companies take the lead and invest in meaningfully protecting children, but that does not fit with their financial models so we have to do what we can in the meantime.”","summary":"Australia’s ban on social media for children under 16 is being closely watched around the world - and also by young people","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/12/28/should-we-ban-social-media-for-under-16s-irish-teens-share-their-thoughts/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/4TGZX24DBJEV3IHGYBOUK3UE6I.png?auth=9f1c7219005619b96c0a00e6148f8fe8d5b12c4f68f6379baaa7204646827105&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 06:00:00","author":"Jen Hogan","authors":["Jen Hogan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":389616030,"title":"Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman enjoy night out in the same restaurant in chance encounter 18 months after their court battle","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFury grows over 'empty' Minnesota daycare with misspelled sign accused of receiving $4m in taxpayer funds\n\nRichest California suburb's deadly secret: How a scenic cliff with breathtaking views of Pacific has become a death trap where three have died since August\n\nTrump and Zelensky to discuss three key issues as they're set to meet today... while Russia launches thousands of strikes on Ukraine\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nSARAH VINE: The miasma of gloom has finally lifted over the royals.

And their situation hasn’t improved. Its most recent Federal Election Commission filings show the DNC's main fundraising arm has only $12 million in cash but owes nearly $16 million on a recent loan. That's a negative balance sheet going into what should be a critical election cycle. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee reported $86 million in cash reserves back in September, giving the GOP a massive financial advantage.\n\nDemocratic strategist Julian Epstein appeared on Kudlow Friday and didn't leave any ambiguity as to what's happening. Guest host David Asman asked why left-wing billionaires aren't stepping up to rescue the DNC, and Epstein's answer was blunt. \"I think what we're seeing with the donor class right now is a lack of confidence, a vote of no confidence in the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nICYMI: Things Just Keep Getting Worse for Tim Walz\n\nEpstein laid out exactly why donors are keeping their checkbooks closed. He pointed to what he called a \"lie\" about Joe Biden's mental fitness, the trainwreck that was Kamala’s campaign, and polling data showing Democrats are wildly out of step with voters on both economic and cultural issues. When your billion-dollar presidential campaign ends in a sweep of losses across every battleground state, people start asking hard questions about competence and strategy.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting.\n\nEpstein argued that the same wealthy donors now withholding their cash are the ones who pushed Democrats so far to the left in the first place.\n\n\"The irony here, David, is that the donor class is perhaps the most leftist class of the Democratic Party,\" Epstein said. \"They are the ones driving the Democratic Party to be out of touch. Now they are withholding their money because they don't like the results of sort of the far-left drift.\"\n\nThat's a remarkable admission from a Democratic strategist.\n\nThe party's richest supporters funded the ideological shift that's now costing them elections, and they're shocked when voters reject what they've been selling. “So I don’t really know where the Democrats go from here. I’ve argued for a Sister Souljah moment, but I don’t think a lot of people are listening to that,” Epstein said.\n\nThe problem for the DNC, of course, is that it went into the recent cycle already at a financial disadvantage, weighed down by lingering liabilities and weak donor enthusiasm. In September, the RNC raised $10.7 million compared to the DNC's $10.3 million, but the real gap showed up in reserves. Republicans had $86 million on hand, while Democrats scraped by with $12 million.\n\nMuch of this financial strain ties directly back to Kamala’s failed presidential run, which spent roughly $1.5 billion in just over three months. The DNC paid another $1.6 million in September to settle additional Harris-Walz campaign bills, bringing its total payments for her effort to more than $20 million, according to an analysis from Axios. That's a staggering amount of money to waste on a candidate who couldn't win a single swing state.\n\nThe writing is clearly on the wall for Democrats. The party can no longer count on automatic checks from its billionaire base, which creates a serious problem going into 2026. Without reliable funding and with a message that's alienated mainstream voters, the party faces an uphill battle to hold its ground in the midterms.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/27/the-ghost-of-kamala-will-haunt-the-democrats-in-2026-n4947600","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/304/971a5fa0-863a-455b-b915-b95c317fcfc8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 01:07:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.528},{"id":389530614,"title":"Donald Trump Brags About Eliminating Over 270,000 Federal Jobs Since Taking Office for His Second Term","text":"Donald Trump, who has touted himself as a \"president for the workers\" who \"protects the middle class,\" has eliminated hundreds of thousands of federal jobs.\n\n In a Dec. 26 Truth Social post, Trump, 79, shared a screenshot of an X post from the White House's Rapid Response account, highlighting how job positions within the U.S. government are at the lowest level since 2014, with 271,000 roles eliminated.\n\n \"Promises made, promises kept,\" the White House Rapid Response account, which supports Trump's \"America First agenda and holding the Fake News accountable,\" said.\n\n In his Truth Social post, Trump celebrated the decrease in jobs, writing, \"Big news for the USA!\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Trump was elected to office in November 2024, winning the election against Kamala Harris. He previously served as president from 2017 to 2021, beating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, but when seeking reelection in 2020, Trump lost to Joe Biden.\n\n After Trump won the 2024 election, he brought Elon Musk into the Oval Office to serve as co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to make major cuts to areas of the government that Trump's administration deemed unnecessary.\n\n The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n Trump — who previously said that the DOGE's goal was to form \"a smaller government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy\" — signed an executive order that the organization would last through July 2026. But, in November, Scott Kupor, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director, said that the DOGE \"doesn't exist\" and is no longer a \"centralized entity,\" per a report from Reuters.\n\n Before that, Musk had announced he was departing his government role with the DOGE in May, right after the tech CEO criticized Trump’s budget legislation agenda.\n\n According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in the United States as of November is 4.6%, with 7.8 million people unemployed. (A year prior, the jobless rate was 4.2% and the number of unemployed people was 7.1 million.)\n\n While the organization said employment rose in healthcare and construction roles in November, federal government workers continued to lose jobs.\n\n The latest YouGov/Economist poll, meanwhile, researched Trump’s approval rating among Americans and found that only 39% approve of Trump's handling of the presidency, 57% disapprove and 4% were unsure.\n\n The findings, from 1,592 U.S. citizens of different ages, sexes, races and incomes, were collected between Dec. 20 and Dec. 22.","summary":"The politician has touted himself as a \"president for the workers\" who \"protects the middle class\"","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-brags-about-eliminating-over-270-000-federal-jobs-since-second-term-11876669","image":"https://people.com/thmb/dmU7cTh4VEi8ENC6bJ0LmAiwsHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/donald-trump-tout-3-090723-6209e2e98d474f3c93f8e5602ee96674.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 01:02:12","author":"Nicholas Rice","authors":["Nicholas Rice"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":389531228,"title":"How Trump fumbled his election win and caused so much chaos","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nRepublicans started 2025 with the wind at their backs, following Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race and bolstered by Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nBut by the end of the year, the party finds itself in retreat. \n\nTrump is increasingly unpopular and isolated, presiding over a slowing economy that has led multiple Republicans to flee for the exit—rather than face life in the minority during a lame duck presidency.\n\nThe point of Explaining the Right is discussing how the right arrives at their positions, but as 2026 begins, what needs to be explained is how the right blew 2025.\n\nBluesky bump\n\nAlmost immediately following the election, it became clear to many on the left that billionaire Elon Musk had put his thumb on the scale for Trump in multiple ways. When he wasn’t spending millions to elect Trump—and possibly breaking the law in the process—Musk was utilizing his ownership of X, formerly Twitter, to amplify his own content and right-wing narratives (including racism and antisemitism). As 2024 ended and Trump’s return to the presidency loomed, there was an exodus.\n\nRelated | Explaining the Right: Why they hate liberals fleeing to Bluesky\n\nBluesky benefited the most of all the rival social media services, and while conservatives initially cheered that they had inherited what remained of Twitter, they soon began to realize social media is a lot less fun without liberals to bully. Since then conservatives have begun to make tentative steps onto Bluesky, but their abuse and trolling is not allowed to be as toxic as it is on X.\n\nWar on diversity\n\nImmediately after he was sworn in, Trump began to make good on his promises to attack diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Conservatives have opposed diversity on the basis of race, gender, and sexual orientation for decades, and under Trump, they have tried to enshrine their bigotry within the American government. Programs focused on diversifying those who work for the government came under attack, even if data shows such diversity to be a boon to public safety—either via services like air traffic control or the military.\n\nDrowning government\n\nElon Musk’s devotion to Trump led to the creation of Musk’s infamous Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Early in the year, Musk and a group of devotees were given free rein to pillage and destroy programs across the federal government. DOGE undermined multiple agencies and initiatives under the guise of cutting wasteful spending, but while the project succeeded at disastrous actions like cutting USAID and triggering starvation and the spread of disease, the amount of government cuts was far less than the “trillions” Musk and Trump touted.\n\nVengeance and faux masculinity\n\nTrump also fulfilled a campaign promise of vengeance against detractors and his perceived political enemies, particularly in the media. He used his position to push phony claims that CBS News had altered video of former Vice President Kamala Harris, and instead of standing up to Trump and defending their journalism, CBS ultimately capitulated and installed a pro-Trump figure, Bari Weiss, to run its news operation.\n\nThe bullying of the media has been echoed in the leadership style of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon. A longtime advocate of faux masculinity during his time at Fox News, Hegseth spent the year constantly arguing that the military must adopt a “warrior” mentality.\n\nThe real-world manifestation of the new tough-guy regime? Embarrassing national security leaks on group chat. Purging capable transgender military members. And joking about likely war crimes in the form of bombing fishing boats.\n\nAdvocating for (alleged) sexual assault, promoting conspiracies\n\nMany accounts of the 2024 election have credited the world of right-wing chauvinist podcasting for giving a boost to Trump’s campaign. In office, Trump—a serial sexual assailant himself—used the power of the presidency to pressure Romania’s government to go easy on Andew Tate and his brother. The Tates have been accused of rape and sexual assault and were welcomed to the U.S. by the world of pro-Trump content creators.\n\nEven though he is the highest-ranking U.S. official, Trump returned to his safe space of advocating for conspiracy theories in the early days of his second term. Trump, accompanied by Musk, began circulating absurd conspiracies that the gold in Fort Knox had been removed under former President Joe Biden. Of course, the story wasn’t true—but that has never been an obstacle for the right before.\n\nFashion policing as the world burns\n\nTrump repeatedly argued that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would have never happened on his watch and that he would solve it on his first day in office. Instead, when Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House, he came under attack in an Oval Office ambush. The right-wing media, given new positions of authority under Trump, used the opportunity to complain about Zelenskyy’s choice of clothing, insisting that he wear a proper suit before seeking Trump’s help in protecting his people from brutal Russian assault.\n\nWhen he was busy not solving the Ukraine-Russia crisis, Trump was deeply involved in screwing up international trade. Dissatisfied with the economic recovery Biden had achieved after stimulating the weak Trump economy he inherited, Trump went wild with tariffs.\n\nHis mostly one-sided trade war has now hurt the domestic economy, leading to layoffs, a worsening job market, and increased costs for families.\n\nRacism, killing Big Bird, and torture\n\nThe administration wasn’t just happy to attack diversity programs but instead gave a federal boost to the practitioners of slavery. Part of reversing course from Biden meant that Trump rolled back the name changes affixed to military bases, erasing names put in place to honor diverse American servicemembers, and instead restored base names meant to hail those who fought in favor of human bondage in the pro-slavery Confederacy.\n\nPublic media has been a reliable source of historical information for millions of Americans, so it was in line with Trump’s pro-Confederacy actions when he and congressional Republicans acted to defund public television and radio. Like other Republicans before him (most recently former President George W. Bush), Trump painted a target on Big Bird and tried to kill him and other programming of a similar nature.\n\nTorture, another Bush initiative, was back on the menu as the Trump administration celebrated sending deported people to facilities like CECOT prison in El Salvador. A few years ago the U.S. was condemning human rights abuses, but now figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posed for pictures using human suffering as a ghoulish backdrop.\n\nWhen it gets bad, blame the ‘Deep State’\n\nThe worm began to seriously turn by mid-year, and as figures like Hegseth were swept up in scandal and bad headlines, the right turned to a reliable boogeyman. Once again, the shadowy “deep state” was invoked as the puppet masters behind Republican failure. The administration, reflecting Trump, simply cannot admit when it screwed up. Everything that goes wrong is the fault of the “deep state,” mirroring the right’s decades of obsession with conspiracy.\n\nScrew up the economy, attack everyone (and be racist)\n\nSurprising no one who follows presidential politics, the economy soured under Trump. His performance has echoed other Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump during his first term. The rhetoric may change, but the underlying conservative ideology valuing the ultra-wealthy over the middle class continues to have a terrible batting average.\n\nInstead of addressing his failings, Trump continued to bully colleges and universities (with far too many caving in to his demands). The Trump team threw red meat to their bigoted conservative base by attacking “woke”—aka tolerance and equality. And for good measure, the administration and figures like Musk used their new prominence to push racist mythology like “white genocide,” not only as rhetoric but as official policy used to restrict nonwhite migration.\n\nAmerican cities were also targeted with federal force, part of the conservative tradition of demonizing regions of the country with large nonwhite populations. Brown people were also the target of Trump-ordered bombings, based on extremely specious logic that echoed the Republican-led war in Iraq.\n\nIt’s always the fault of the press\n\nThe mainstream media has bent over backwards for Trump, even paying him off for legally dubious court cases. It didn’t stop his abuse. Trump and other Republicans went after the press for not operating as cheerleaders for his policies and rhetoric. This was the latest salvo in the conservative propaganda campaign against the free press. They don’t want journalism; they want a media world that looks like Fox News everywhere.\n\nThe Epstein moment\n\nConservatives have a long and sordid history with pedophilia. From former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who was an admitted pedophile, to Trump and his skin-crawling habit of sexualizing his underage daughter. Despite this, the party tried to smear Democrats on the issue.\n\nThis seriously unraveled as Trump and his team, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, worked to cover up the investigation into sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein after promising that it would expose the powerful. The result? Defections and rebuke, leading to a bipartisan congressional vote to release Epstein data.\n\nFear and the police state\n\nWhen they weren’t aiding sex criminals, key administration figures like Stephen Miller were admitting that they walk in near-constant fear. Miller argued that fear of immigration, crime, and other purported threats meant that Trump was justified in using federal officers against cities.\n\nThis led to police-state style action, with federal law enforcement usurping local control. This was the exact scenario conservatives have spent decades arguing would occur under Democratic presidents.\n\nThe fascist tendencies exploded at the national level after the weaponized FCC was used in an abortive attempt to silence comedian Jimmy Kimmel. The backlash was fierce and swift, but the naked attempt to silence dissent was exposed for all to see.\n\nAlways Fox, always demonizing\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has continued to use Fox News not just to hire his key officials (leading to mistake after mistake), but as a source of policy decisions. The surest way to get Trump on board with an idea is to feature it in heavy rotation on the network.\n\nFox is a useful venue for the right to use in demonizing its ideological enemies. The network, working in concert with Republican officials, insists that left-wing detractors are terrorists—and they all echo each other, attempting to turn spin into reality.\n\nNo compassion, full speed ahead\n\nRepublicans also stuck to their guns on their pet issues, using the Trump presidency to attack health care funding. More than a decade ago, the right tried to kill Obamacare. And even as the public has aligned with the Democratic health care policy more and more, the GOP keeps trying to undermine it.\n\nTrump even tried to deprive poor people of food, attacking funding for the federal SNAP program as his administration was under fire for health care cuts.\n\nWe got here\n\nBeing so out of touch and expressly ideological hasn’t happened in a vacuum. Republicans lost key races in Virginia and New Jersey, and performed poorly elsewhere as financial conditions worsened and Democrats argued for affordability.\n\nThe Republican response? Lie about it, and lie about it badly. Republicans have never cared about affordability, and that isn’t going to change overnight. \n\nThe GOP will have to navigate 2026 without the already intense backlash reaching a fever pitch.\n\nThe simple explanation: It doesn’t look good at all.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans started 2025 with the wind at their backs, following Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race and bolstered by Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n\n\nBut by the end of the year, the party finds itself in retreat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is increasingly unpopular and isolated, presiding over a slowing economy that has led multiple Republicans to flee for the exit—rather than face life in the minority during a lame duck presidency.\n\n\n\nThe point of Explaining the Right is discussing how the right arrives at their positions, but as 2026 begins, what needs to be explained is how the right blew 2025.\n\n\n\nBluesky bump\n\nAlmost immediately following the election, it became clear to many on the left that billionaire Elon Musk had put his thumb on the scale for Trump in multiple ways.

Grenell, a long-time Republican and close Trump ally, was appointed president of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after President Donald Trump reshaped the board.\n\nThe latest dispute began after the center’s board — appointed under Trump’s chairmanship — voted to add Trump’s name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Within days, jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled his annual Christmas Eve concert, explicitly citing the name change as his reason for withdrawing. Redd told The Associated Press, via WDTV, that when he “saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert.”\n\nJazz musician Chuck Redd hosted the Kennedy Center annual Christmas Eve jazz event for 20 years.\nHe cancelled this year after the Kennedy Center board at Trump’s urging renamed the center the Trump-Kennedy Center.\nHats off to Mr. Redd!\nTrump and his appointees violated the… pic.twitter.com/zArgfgyyhm\n— Feisty is proud to be a Democrat! (@FeistyLibLady) December 26, 2025\n\nThat cancellation hit a cultural nerve. According to WSLS, Grenell fired back in a strongly worded letter to Redd, calling the decision “classic intolerance” and saying it was costly for the nonprofit arts institution. He added that the center would seek $1 million in damages “for this political stunt.”\n\nThe clash over the music event is now entwined with broader legal and political fights. Democratic Representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio has filed a lawsuit to challenge the name change, arguing that altering the Kennedy Center’s name without Congressional approval might violate federal law. She also claims she was muted during the virtual board vote and prevented from speaking.\n\nThe left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts.\nBut we will not let them cancel shows without consequences.\nThe Arts are for everyone – and the Left is mad about it. https://t.co/zej4PnBNtz\n— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) December 27, 2025\n\nAnd to top all the controversy surrounding the center, the broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors hit a historical low this year. “The Kennedy Center Honors on CBS drew its smallest audience ever on the night of December 23, 2025, averaging an estimated 2.65 million viewers,” Programming Insider data revealed. If Trump thought that his stint as the host for the annual event would draw the numbers, he was sadly wrong.\n\nGrenell’s rise to the top of the Kennedy Center was part of a sweeping overhaul initiated by Trump earlier in 2025. Before this role, Grenell served as the United States ambassador to Germany and as acting director of national intelligence, both under Trump’s previous administration. He also worked in foreign policy and media before returning to public service.\n\nCritics say Grenell’s leadership style and political ties have injected partisan tensions into what was traditionally a bipartisan cultural institution. Since the renaming and leadership changes, several artists and performers have distanced themselves from the Kennedy Center, citing discomfort over the institution’s direction after the Trump name was added, per People.\n\n🚨NEW: Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) has filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from renaming the Kennedy Center, claiming that only Congress has the legal authority to do so.\nRETWEET to thank @RepBeatty for standing up to Donald Trump! pic.twitter.com/3Spl8R1Ypq\n— Protect Kamala Harris ✊ (@DisavowTrump20) December 23, 2025\n\nFor many arts fans and observers, the Redd cancellation wasn’t isolated. Even earlier this year, musicians and performers expressed frustration with Grenell’s management, including an exchange of emails about diversity and programming decisions that went viral.9\n\nSupporters of Grenell argue he is defending the center’s financial health and broad audience reach. But opponents see the latest legal and cultural fights as emblematic of how deeply politics has seeped into an institution once seen as a national cultural bridge.\n\nAs debate over the Kennedy Center’s name and mission continues to escalate, Grenell’s role — and his ties to Trump — remain central to the controversy, keeping his name trending in both the cultural and political spotlight.","summary":"A cultural fight puts the Kennedy Center’s leader in the headlines again","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kennedy-center-head-richard-grenell-draws-spotlight-after-trump-name-backlash","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Richard-Grenell-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 19:31:58","author":"Tracey Ashlee","authors":["Tracey Ashlee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":389509774,"title":"Can We Stop Pretending Kwanzaa Is a Real Holiday?","text":"Karenga didn't hide what he was doing, either. He openly described Kwanzaa as a cultural and political project meant to give African Americans an explicitly ideological alternative to Christmas. Everything about it — the timing, the symbolism, the rituals — was deliberately constructed to serve that purpose. There's nothing ancient or traditional about it. It's less than 60 years old.\n\nBut tell that to the NFL.\n\nOn Friday, my social media feeds filled up with \"Happy Kwanzaa\" posts from professional football teams. MLB and NBA teams joined the parade, too. All of them rushing to celebrate a holiday that most black Americans don’t actually observe. But because Kwanzaa gets pitched as a black holiday, corporate America loves to virtue signal its support for anything related to diversity, and so it is essentially compelled to pretend the holiday is important. So the posts roll out, graphics get designed, and we’re supposed to “ooooh” and “ahhhh” and pretend this matters.\n\nWhile professional sports teams were crawling all over each other with their stupid Kwanzaa messages, the real proof that posting about Kwanzaa is just shameless pandering came from none other than Kamala Harris.\n\nLast year, when she was still vice president, she posted a Kwanzaa message from her official account. \"When I was growing up, Kwanzaa was a special time of reflection with family and friends,\" she wrote. \"Let us carry the wisdom of the seven principles with us as we work to build a brighter future. Happy Kwanzaa.\"\n\nWhen I was growing up, Kwanzaa was a special time of reflection with family and friends.

Kamala was born in 1964, two years before the holiday even existed. No one truly believes her family celebrated this brand-new, barely known pseudo-holiday when she was a toddler. On top of that, Kamala is of Indian and Jamaican descent, not African. Her parents divorced in 1972, when she was seven, and she was raised primarily by her Indian mother, who followed Hindu traditions. The idea that Kwanzaa played any significant role in her childhood is absurd. Kamala didn't even try to identify as black until she ran for president.\n\nNow that she's out of public office and not running for anything, Kamala couldn't be bothered to acknowledge Kwanzaa this year. The holiday she once claimed was central to her identity? Gone. Not even a perfunctory tweet. She doesn't need to pretend anymore.\n\nBut professional sports teams? They're still at it, flooding social media with Kwanzaa greetings for a holiday almost nobody celebrates. It's performative nonsense, and everyone knows it. But seriously, enough is enough.

It’ll be about pricing,” Trump told the outlet. “Because, you know, they gave us high pricing, and we’re bringing it down. Energy’s way down. Gasoline is way down.”\n\nThe president’s recent emphasis on the cost of living comes after Democrats romped to victory in a string of states earlier this year, largely by tapping into economic concerns.\n\nRecognizing the potency of the issue, Trump went on the offensive, hitting the campaign trail in Pennsylvania earlier this month to highlight his economic agenda and assuage anxieties. However, he veered off script and repeatedly downplayed worries.\n\n“They have a new word. You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability,” Trump said during a December 9 speech in Mount Pocono.\n\nDemocrats have complained that “prices are too high,” Trump added. “Yeah, they're too high because they caused them to be too high. But now they're coming down.”\n\nHe also advocated for austerity measures, stating that American children should be content with “one or two” pencils and “two or three” dolls.\n\nA day earlier, the president appeared supremely satisfied at the state of the U.S. economy, giving it an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” rating in an interview with Politico.\n\nTrump’s latest comments come on the heels of a series of economic reports showing the economy performing better than many expected.\n\nIn November, inflation fell to 2.7 percent year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded since July, according to the latest consumer price index report from the Labor Department. And data published by the government this week revealed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the fastest clip in two years.\n\n“You saw the 4.3 percent?” Trump said to Politico on Friday. “The Democrats were exploding. Their heads were exploding.”\n\n“Electricity is down. It’s way down,” Trump added. “You know, when the gasoline goes down and when the oil and gas go down, the electricity comes down naturally. But it’s all coming down. It’s all coming down. It’s coming beautifully.”\n\nStill, other indicators paint a less favorable picture of the economy. For example, between January and November, corporate bankruptcies soared to a 15-year high as companies struggled to cope with Trump’s trade wars.\n\nAnd recent polls show that most Americans — including many of Trump’s own voters — are indeed feeling squeezed by the present economic climate.\n\nA Politico survey conducted in November revealed that 46 percent of respondents believe the current cost of living is the worst they can remember. This figure includes 37 percent of Trump 2024 voters and 53 percent of voters who cast their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAt the same time, nearly half reported struggling to afford essentials like groceries, health care and housing, while more than a quarter said they’ve skipped medical appointments in the past two years due to high costs.","summary":"President’s comments come after a series of recent economic reports showed the economy performing better than many expected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-midterms-pricing-affordability-hoax-b2890984.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/27/17/13/GettyImages-2252765745.jpeg?crop=8256,5504,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mfVMsyhz-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-27 18:35:11","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":389490186,"title":"Too Fun to Check: Has Hunter Gone MAGA?","text":"Alternate headline: Second look at nepo babies?\n\nThe poster boy for dissipated scions has decided to re-insert himself into the public consciousness, apparently not yet satisfied with his presidential pardon from his padre's puppeteers. Earlier this week, Hunter Biden opened up on a podcast about a wide range of topics, including his father's performance in the White House. First, though, Hunter decided to set the record straight on the infamous laptop that Joe Biden insisted was a Russian intelligence operation, his lawyers claimed was privileged and stolen, and that Hunter now says ... never existed?\n\nHunter Biden told podcaster Shawn Ryan in an interview that aired Monday that former Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York City “concocted” the laptop that was the subject of an October 2020 New York Post report. ...“What I can tell you about the laptop is that there is no laptop. That’s bullshit. What was provided out there, what the-” Biden said, with Ryan asking, “There was no fucking laptop?”“There is an actual physical laptop that somebody had, but the guy that had, that said he had the laptop, the existence of the search for the laptop came before he was even a twinkle in Rudy Giuliani’s eye,” Biden said. “There were people, talk to Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas literally went to Ukraine to get a laptop from Dmytro Firtash, to get a hard drive, Hunter Biden’s hard drive from Dmytro Firtash and Andrii Derkach, in Ukraine, in Austria, four months before John Paul Mac Isaac ever even… existed. And so, what they did is they cobbled together [a] stolen, concocted, fabricated mishmash of digital information, largely, which is, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of emails… from 25 years. I mean, no laptop could have held all of that.”\n\nOh, I don't know ... My new Macbook Pro came with a two-terabyte drive. That's more than enough room for all of my photography and email storage needs, even the pics of my experiences with hookers, blow, and guns. Of course, I mean this theoretically, since this laptop actually belongs to the Powers That Be of Townhall. Theoretical, I say. \n\nReally, fellas. I only have my church photography on it. Anything else on it was planted on me by the guys at Power Line. I, uh, dropped it off at a repair shop in Minneapolis, and ... you know the rest. It could be a Fraters Libertas dirty trick, too.\n\nTruly, though, this latest claim from Hunter might tend to dent his credibility on other matters, and that's too bad. Hunter sounded much more connected to reality when it came to assessing his father's legacy as president, at least to the extent that Joe ever was president. Hunter decided to weigh in on two of his father's biggest disasters in the same podcast with Shawn Ryan, immigration and Afghanistan. And Hunter acknowledged the reality of both:\n\nDisgraced first son Hunter Biden turned on his father, Joe, in a wide-ranging podcast interview this week, acknowledging that the 46th president’s lax immigration policy and move to pull US forces out of Afghanistan were both catastrophic failures.“We need vibrant immigration,” the 55-year-old told “The Shawn Ryan Show” during a five-and-a-half-hour conversation that dropped Monday.“But we don’t want immigrants that are coming here illegally, draining us of resources, and being prioritized above people that are actual, literal heroes, that are still recovering from 21, 20 years of endless war — or anybody else in our society.”\n\nHunter did try to shift the blame to Trump, but ...\n\n“And then Donald Trump stepped in six months before the [2024] election, and told [Republicans] that he was gonna primary every single one of them that voted for that, because we’re addicted to the problem,” said the younger Biden.\n\nYeah, well, good luck with that explanation. The crisis began as soon as Joe took office and reversed Trump's tough policies on asylum and border security. House Democrat Henry Cuellar tried to warn the Biden team about the coming catastrophe, but Joe and Kamala Harris got exactly what they wanted out of it. They wanted to pressure Republicans into accepting a high level of illegal immigration as a new baseline with that bill in exchange for a minimal amount of enforcement, claiming that it was the only way to solve the problem. Trump exposed this flim-flam within weeks of taking office, eliminating the border flood altogether without any new legislation at all. \n\nHunter didn't even attempt a blame-shift on Afghanistan:\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Hunter admitted to interviewer Shawn Ryan that the botched bugout from Afghanistan “was an obvious f—ing failure.”“I think that there was a better way to do it, and … I can blame it on his generals, I can blame it on [other] people [for] the way in which we did it, but — and my dad always knew this also, is that the buck stops with him.”\n\nWell ... yeah, and that's exactly what MAGA argues, too. Donald Trump actually did have a better way to do it, which would have allowed for us to hold Bagram as a way to secure Kabul and the Afghan government we had meticulously nurtured for two decades. It still might have collapsed over time anyway, but it wouldn't have created Saigon II: Taliban Bug-Out-aloo. The rout in Kabul exposed Biden as an incompetent to not just MAGA but to everyone, and Biden's approval ratings never recovered from it. \n\nOf course, Hunter is not going to put on a red cap and shout \"USA! USA!\" at the next Trump rally. But at least he's a little more connected to reality than the rest of his family. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

During a discussion on “Kudlow,” guest host David Asman asked why prominent left-wing billionaires have not stepped in to help stabilize the DNC’s finances. Epstein said the silence from the donor class reflects a broader “vote of no confidence” in the Democratic Party.\n\n“I think what we’re seeing with the donor class right now is a lack of confidence, a vote of no confidence in the Democrats. And I think it stems back to a couple things,” Epstein told Asman. “The lie about Biden’s mental health, the incompetency of the Harris campaign, and the fact that all of the data shows that the Democratic Party is deeply out of touch on almost every single economic and social cultural issue.”\n\nEpstein said elite donors helped pull Democrats away from the political center.\n\n“The irony here, David, is that the donor class is perhaps the most leftist class of the Democratic Party. They are the ones driving the Democratic Party to be out of touch. Now they are withholding their money because they don’t like the results of sort of the far-left drift,” Epstein added. “So I don’t really know where the Democrats go from here. I’ve argued for a Sister Souljah moment, but I don’t think a lot of people are listening to that.”\n\nThe DNC’s debt problems are not new, as the committee entered the midterm cycle months ago at a clear financial disadvantage, weighed down by lingering debt from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign and weak donor enthusiasm. At the time, the Republican National Committee reported raising $10.7 million in September with roughly $86 million in cash on hand, while the DNC brought in $10.3 million and held about $12 million in reserves.\n\nThe strain partly traces back to liabilities carried over from Harris’s failed presidential bid, which spent roughly $1.5 billion in just over three months. The DNC shelled out another $1.6 million in September to settle campaign-related bills, pushing total payments linked to Harris’s effort past $20 million, according to Axios.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox Business)\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Republicans","text":"There are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members. \n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. \n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on. \n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies. \n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates. \n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one. \n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House. \n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.\n\nCharlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

To begin with, who is the “Democratic leadership?” It is a question a number in the media have asked of former Vice President Kamala Harris and others without getting many good answers. Republicans will be all too happy to keep spreading the message that the “leaders” of the Democratic Party heading into the midterms and beyond are Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected, socialist-leaning, “fleece the rich” mayor-elect of New York City; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.); and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas). This trio has seemingly provided enough far-left rhetoric (anti-rule-of-law, pro-open-borders, “defund the police” and wreck the economy via “universal income,” etc.) to ensure tens of millions of “common sense” Americans will come out to vote against their policies in 2026 and 2028. Next, we have Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D). He is the gift which keeps on giving if you are a Republican, a fan of President Trump, or in favor of not having your hard-earned federal tax money stolen. First, he became the anchor attached to the 2024 Kamala Harris campaign, helping to sink that political vessel through his own personal flights of fancy and provable ineptitude. But now Walz surfaces yet again amid a Minnesota mess of fraud. The story is reminding the public why Trump is entirely correct to push for a regulated and secure immigration system, while also fighting to ensure that immigrants don’t game the system to abuse Americans' natural generosity. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota has become the poster child for the issues of both immigration and fraud. Billions are alleged to have been stolen or misappropriated — shocking allegations which have naturally spurred many to look much more deeply into the finances of other blue states led by Democratic governors. Gavin Newsom's California, anyone? All of a sudden, more and more Americans are starting to wonder how many tens of billions of their taxpayer dollars have potentially been stolen in these blue-democratic cities and states. Republicans did not cause them to think that way, but rather repeated Democratic miscues in those cities and states. For a brief, shining moment, some Democrats believed they had stumbled upon an issue that would hurt Trump and the Republicans heading into 2026: “affordability.” Not so much anymore. On its own, the scandal in Minnesota derails that potentially winning issue, since it bothers tens of millions of hard-working American citizens who often have so little for themselves and their families. It is hardly \"affordable\" to have Democratic policies, enabled by Democrats' incompetence, make a mockery of their understanding and kindness toward newcomers. But now we also have the nation's GDP growing at a \"blistering 4.3 percent\" annual pace. Fears about inflation are subsiding, thanks to strong wage growth and Trump's own affordability policies. That is an economic victory for Trump and the Republicans, and it has to be cited in every left-of-center news outlet across the country. To one extent or the other, bread and butter issues are always top of mind for most Americans, especially the working class. And no matter which narrative the Democrats use to attack Trump, those same Americans realize that he is the first true businessman to inhabit the Oval Office in their lifetimes — a massively successful one at that, who has built an iconic global brand. As we head into the new year and its critically important November elections, several questions arise for the Democrats as they gaze into the mirror: Who are we? Have we confused the American electorate with our split personalities? What can we honestly tout as a victory? How will we deal with the coming civil war with the far left if we pretend to be more centrist? And how many more misappropriated-money shoes are still to drop? In the meantime, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and the Republicans are in charge. They will gladly stand aside and let the public's focus fall on all the Democratic infighting to come.

Gavin Newsom moved himself into front-runner status for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, emerging from a pack of contenders to clear leading status. It was a strong year for Newsom, whose combative approach to taking on President Trump resonated with Democrats and won favorable headlines for his team. “The headline on Newsom is that this year, he became the default answer of who Democrats are thinking about for 2028,” Democratic strategist Joel Payne said. “He became the stand-in at a time when the party was looking for leadership and a good spokesperson.\" “Newsom has been the officeholder who has been in the best position to counter Trump,” he said. The question for Newsom and his operation going forward is whether he can keep the excitement level up and maintain front-runner status past the midterm elections, after which the presidential battle will really heat up. Despite his strong 2025, some Democrats have openly wondered if it’s possible Newsom is peaking too soon. “He fits the mood of the country and the party now, but things change quickly,” one Democratic consultant said. “Politics is all about timing, and it may be too soon. We’re still at least a year away from that cycle starting.” Newsom’s lead in the Real Clear Politics average of polls for the Democratic nomination is narrow. He gets 23.6 percent compared with former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 21.4 percent in an average of polls taken between Aug. 25 and Dec. 19. Newsom’s lead is wider in one recent poll. An Atlas Intel poll this month, for example, had him getting 35 percent support compared with 16 percent for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is widely seen as a strong candidate from the left. Two other recent polls included in the Real Clear Politics average, however, show him with just a percentage point lead over Harris in the case of an Echelon Insights poll, and trailing the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee by 11 points in a Big Data Poll. Whether any of those polls mean anything is also a matter of debate. “It’s insane to anoint anyone a front-runner or look at polls this far out,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale, who opined that Newsom “had a great year.” “It’s a very open question to see if that success translates into Democratic primary voters thinking he can win the electoral college,” Vale added. A CNN poll out this past week showed Newsom leading other would-be candidates on the Democratic side. But the same poll also said two-thirds of those surveyed said they didn’t have a specific candidate in mind for 2028. That’s a reminder that while the Beltway class is heavily focused on 2028, most of the country is not. Either way, Newsom has solidified his brand over the last year as the Trump battler-in-chief. Just last week, for example, Newsom took to social platform X to hit Trump on his newly installed White House hall of presidents, where he used plaques to hit former Democratic presidents including Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “Inflation is up. Unemployment is up. Grocery prices are up. Electricity costs are up. And Donald Trump is spending his time doing this,” Newsom wrote in his post on X. On a more substantive level, Newsom led the effort on behalf of California’s Proposition 50, the ballot measure that voters overwhelmingly approved in November to redraw the state’s congressional districts to give Democrats an edge. The effort was a direct response to a Trump-backed effort by Texas Republicans to help GOP House candidates in the Lone Star State. It was a national political fight given its implications on the 2026 battle for the House majority. If Democrats do win back control of the House, it will be a considerable curb on Trump’s power over the latter half of his term. “I think it was brilliant and it was needed,” Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said of the Newsom-led redistricting fight in California. “He showed that he’s not only talking the talk but walking the walking.\" “He has shown Democrats how to fight like it’s 2028. Not 1998,” Parkhomenko added. “And the key is that he didn’t necessarily invent a new playbook. He took Trump’s and made it better.” A Democratic donor added that Newsom “helped carry the Democratic Party on his shoulders this year while most of the party was asleep.” Trump has also helped to keep Newsom in the heart of the news cycle, frequently taking aim at the Democrat while helping to burnish his brand as a fighter, Democrats say. Last month, in an interview with Fox News, Trump called Newsom a “horrible governor.” “I knew Gavin for four years,” Trump said at the time. “I get along great with him. But he’s gone radical left.” In the months ahead — particularly as he eyes 2028 — Democrats say Newsom will have to pivot from Trump-bashing to a purveyor of ideas, particularly on economic issues. “He has tried a 1000-flowers-bloom approach and has done a little bit of everything and that’s OK for now, but he has to define what his path is going to be,” Payne said. “I imagine we will start to get a glimpse of what a post-gubernatorial Newsom sounds like in the coming months. The big question is what issue does he glom onto and make his hobby horse?” But so far, Democrats say, the nomination fight is his to lose. “I think the only one who could f‑‑‑ it up for Gavin Newsom is Gavin Newsom,” Parkhomenko said.","url":"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5662785-newsom-trump-battler-2028/","image":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Newsom_Parnes_AP_KarenWarren.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 17:00:00","author":"Amie Parnes","authors":["Amie Parnes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":389457142,"title":"Lizzo Trashes Nicki Minaj After TPUSA Appearance: Joined Trump's 'Side' for Money & 'Privileges'","text":"Left-wing pop star and Kamala Harris 2024 presidential surrogate Lizzo claims rap megastar Nicki Minaj only joined President Donald Trump’s “side” because she sees it as “more profitable and more beneficial,” predicting that the public will start seeing “an influx” of celebrities who will follow suit.\n\nRather than look into the reasons why Minaj would support President Trump, Lizzo oversimplified the matter by chalking it up as the “Super Bass” singer simply seeking “money” and certain “privileges.”\n\n“So I’m getting texts, like, about Nicki, and I’m like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I didn’t even know,” Lizzo said, adding, “Then I researched and saw what was going on, and I’m gonna say it like this: celebrities’ opinions of other celebrities does not matter — so my opinion of her does not matter.”\n\n“But what I will tell you is you’re about to see an influx of people who see that it is more profitable and more beneficial to join that side. You’re gonna see it. It already started, and it’s going to continue,” the “Rumors” singer continued.\n\nLizzo went on to say, “We got three more years” of Trump being president, during which time there will be “people who are going to surprise you,” suggesting that she knows there are closet conservatives in the entertainment industry who may feel emboldened to let their opinions be known in the coming years.\n\n“It’s going to hurt your feelings,” Lizzo told her fans. “It’s going to disappoint you.”\n\n“And you have to know that, like, there’s money behind everything,” she added. “There are privileges behind every move people in these positions make, and I’m not surprised.”\n\nInterestingly, Lizzo’s comments about Minaj convey that the “Truth Hurts” singer — who endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — holds the narrow-minded view that no one could possibly see any advantage in supporting a Republican president unless they have some financial incentive.\n\nMoreover, some may see the pop star’s remark that “there’s money behind everything” as Lizzo — who has gone to bat for Democrats — inadvertently revealing that she might know celebrities can, in fact, be paid for political endorsements, including possibly by Democrats, which the left has denied.\n\nBut for decades, it has been widely understood that many conservatives in the entertainment industry deliberately hide or downplay their political views in public, strongly suggesting that they do not see openly supporting Republicans as beneficial to their careers, which exist in an industry dominated by the left.\n\nNotably, Lizzo’s remarks come after Minaj took the stage at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest last weekend, where she praised President Trump and said that being at the event was more important than any concert she has ever performed anywhere in the world, because slain conservative icon Charlie Kirk’s organization is “a direct link between young people and God.”\n\nBut Minaj has also offered reasons as to why she supports Trump, citing the president intervening and taking the “mass slaughter” of Christians in Nigeria by radical Islamists “seriously” — an issue that is close to her heart.\n\nOn Christmas, President Trump announced that he directed the United States to carry out a “powerful and deadly strike” against ISIS terrorists in Nigeria, whom he identified as responsible for targeting and killing innocent Christians at historically severe levels.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The DNC spending a few bucks won’t fool rural Americans into thinking Democrats have touched grass,” RNC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said.\n\nOne Big Beautiful Mess\n\nTrump’s signature tax-and-spending law provides Democrats with another opening to contrast their pitch against Republicans.\n\nRural health care centers across the country have already shuttered in response to the law’s Medicaid cuts, which will disproportionately hit communities where hospitals are few and often primary employers. Low-income Americans are quickly learning they may no longer qualify for federal food aid — even as most of the tax breaks the GOP has touted will benefit the wealthy.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association and represents a ruby red state, recently called the law “a slap in the face to rural America.”\n\nAnd POLITICO’s November poll revealed that voters are more likely to rely on Democrats when it comes to health care policy. More than 40 percent of those surveyed said they trusted Democrats to bring down health care costs for ordinary Americans, compared with 33 percent who said they trusted the GOP.\n\nThe message for Democrats is “wrapped up and with a nice, tidy bow on it in the Big, Beautiful Bill,” said Christopher Borick, a political science professor who runs the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “It’s cuts to your health care, it’s cuts to rural hospitals. It’s cuts to SNAP benefits, and it’s just so tidy and neat for Democrats to go there.”\n\nThe strategy seems to be working. In a heavily Republican congressional district in Tennessee, Democrat Aftyn Behn beat expectations and outperformed Harris’ 2024 margins in a bid to unseat GOP Rep. Matt Van Epps this month.\n\nBehn’s ads largely focused on affordability and the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which she called the “one big BS bill.”\n\nThat tactic resonated with voters in an off-cycle election and will only gain steam: Americans’ health care premiums are set to skyrocket ahead of the 2026 midterms after Republicans declined to extend Covid-era “enhanced” subsidies of Affordable Care Act plans in their big bill.\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nStill, some political experts question how much Democrats can loosen the GOP’s hold on rural America.\n\nThe president’s first-term tariff war also hammered farmers, but their political ties to Republicans hardly wavered at the time. Democrats in 2024 used roughly the same playbook they’re seeking to capitalize on now, arguing that Trump’s proposed policies would increase the cost of living and that his tariffs would impose a new tax on the middle class — but they failed to gain enough ground with rural voters, enabling Republicans to win a trifecta.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/democrats-rural-voters-economy-trump-midterms-00700822","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/266c071/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7e%2F4e%2F69db3c884b4a91b0b1dc8c8c5152%2Fvoting-lists-states-sued-34269.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 15:00:00","author":"Marcia Brown,Rachel Shin,Samuel Benson","authors":["Marcia Brown","Rachel Shin","Samuel Benson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":389490376,"title":"Kim Kardashian's daughter North West shares cozy Christmas moment with dad Kanye's wife Bianca Censori","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Dec 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaunting final image of 19-year-old who vanished on Christmas Eve in Texas human trafficking hotspot\n\nInside the downfall of newlywed who murdered his wife in dispute over football as tragic note reveals his dark secret\n\nCelebrity Christmas dinners ranked from tasteful to tacky: From a Kardashians feast to JLo's photoshop fail\n\nLate billionaire's heirs agree to pay IRS $750 million to settle biggest individual tax fraud case in US history\n\nYear-end tax trap if you don't act BEFORE December 31: Trump's megabill could cost you thousands... use this expert guide to make sneaky savings and avoid hellish charges\n\nFirst my middle-aged husband was distant.

Ilhan Omar’s husband’s venture capital firm quietly scrubbed key officer details — including former Obama officials — as scrutiny grows over the family’s skyrocketing wealth, The Post has learned.\n\nOmar (D-MN) went from nearly broke to being worth up to $30 million in just a year — as a massive, up to $9 billion fraud scheme involving the Somali community in her district unfolded right under her nose in Minnesota.\n\nClose to 90 people have been charged so far, including at least three with direct ties to the lefty Squad member, though she has not been charged. \n\nIt was Somalia-born Omar — who was seen in a resurfaced video last month dishing out food in a restaurant now at the heart of the scandal — who introduced the legislation critics say paved the way for what the feds have called the largest fraud of the pandemic.\n\nThe Jimmy Choo wearing socialist introduced the MEALS Act in Congress in 2020, relaxing oversight of government sponsored children’s meals programs during the pandemic, which critics say allowed fraudsters to claim they served millions of meals without verification, while pocketing millions of dollars in government subsidies.\n\nShortly after the scheme played out, Omar’s husband, political consultant Tim Mynett, launched Rose Lake Capital in 2022, a venture capital management firm.\n\nThe company saw its reported value go from nearly zero in 2023, to between $5 million and $25 million in just a year, and somehow claims to having already amassed $60 billion assets under management — an amount many money managers on Wall Street only dream of.\n\n“There’s a lot of strange things going on,” said Paul Kamenar, counsel to the National Legal and Policy Center. “She was basically broke when she came into office and now she’s worth perhaps up to $30 million…she needs to come clean on these assets.”\n\nRose Lake Capital, which touts its “deep global networks built from on-the-ground work in more than 80 countries,” had less than $1,000 in assets in 2023, according to Omar’s financial disclosure.\n\nYet despite the reported windfall, the business’s only address is a WeWork in DC, according to its LinkedIn page.\n\nBetween September and October — when federal prosecutors announced charges to eight more individuals, including six of Somali descent, for their roles in the welfare scheme — the names and bios of Rose Lake Capitals’s nine officers and advisors were removed from the website. None of them were charged in the fraud.\n\nThese names include lobbyist and former Obama Ambassador to Bahrain Adam Ereli; former Senator and Obama Ambassador to China Max Baucus; DNC Finance Chair associate Alex Hoffman; former DNC treasurer William Derrough and former ex-CEO of Amalgamated Bank Keith Mestrich, who once described Amalgamated as “the institutional bank of the Democratic Party.” \n\nMeanwhile Mynett’s other business, a California winery that previously faced fraud allegations and was declared a failed venture in 2023, was suddenly worth between $1 million and $5 million in 2024 — a windfall of 9,900%.\n\nThe fraud case involved a wine investor suing Mynett in Oct. 2023, accusing him of swindling him of $900,000 as he “fraudulently misrepresented … that estCru, LLC was a legitimate company.” Mynett claimed he simply struggled to build a business during the pandemic.\n\nThe case settled out of court in November.\n\nThe winery, eStCru, at some point around 2022 promoted a line of wines with names like “Blockchain” and “The Devil’s Lie,” with a prestigious California winemaker who said she abruptly stopped getting paid in early 2023. The business was only worth between $15,000 and $50,000 in Omar’s financial disclosure that year, making the sudden windfall the next year even more puzzling.\n\nIt, too, is listed as operating out of a WeWork, and doesn’t appear to actually sell any wines anymore, according to extensive internet searches.\n\nDespite the high worth placed on the business, its website is a broken link, the phone number is disconnected and the last social media post for the winery dates back to 2023.\n\nWhen she first took office in 2019, the left-wing “Squad” member declared a net worth between negative $25,000 and negative $65,000, claimed to own no assets and only carrying student and car debt.\n\nNow Omar’s assets have suddenly skyrocketed to anywhere between $6 million to $30 million, according to her latest financial disclosure — just months after the congresswoman dismissed claims she was a millionaire as “ridiculous” and “categorically false.” \n\nHer links to the Minnesota welfare scheme have started to come to light in recent weeks.\n\nHer campaign received $7,400 in direct donations from at least three now-convicted fraudsters, though the Squad member defended she returned the donations after the scandal broke.\n\nShe’s been closely linked to at least two individuals from Minnesota’s Somalian community who’ve been charged in the fraud.\n\nOne is Salim Ahmed Said, the co-owner of Safari Restaurant, where Omar held her 2018 congressional victory party.\n\nSaid was found guilty in August of stealing more than $12 million for serving 3.9 million “phantom” meals during the COVID-19 pandemic, blowing much of the money on a $2 million Minneapolis mansion and a $9,000-a-month shopping habit at Nordstrom, according to prosecutors.\n\nAs the scam was underway in 2020, Omar even appeared on video at Minneapolis’ Safari Restaurant to praise the program.\n\n“Every day Safari provides 2,300 meals to children and their families,” she boasted in Somali in the video while being filmed handing trays of food in a parking lot with her pandemic-era facemask pulled down below her nose.\n\nThe other individual, Guhaad Hashi Said, worked on Omar’s campaign in 2018 and 2020, and pleaded guilty in August to running a fake food site called Advance Youth Athletic Development, where he falsely claimed to serve 5,000 meals a day and pocketed $3.2 million out of the food program. \n\nOn Capitol Hill last week, Omar said she had no regrets about introducing the MEALS Act. \n\n“Absolutely not, it did help feed kids,” she told a reporter.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Omar’s communications director sent The Post a message saying the entire office was closed until Jan. 5 – without offering an alternative contact.\n\nMynett did not return The Post’s messages, and both his businesses’ numbers were not functional.\n\n“Does Ilhan Omar know these people? Are they from her wonderfully managed Home Country of Somalia?” President Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in September when the news of new charges first broke.\n\nMinnesota governor Tim Waltz – Kamala Harris’ former running mate – has also faced intense scrutiny for letting the scandal unfold under his watch.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon wrote a letter calling for him to resign, and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) hinted at possible criminal charges.\n\n“Minnesota, under Governor Waltz, is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,” Trump said last month. “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state, and billions of dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from.”\n\nThe Treasury and Justice Department has already launched an investigation into the alleged money laundering.","summary":"The Jimmy Choo wearing socialist introduced the MEALS Act to Congress in 2020, relaxing oversight of children's meals programs and paving the way for the scheme the feds said could top $9 billion.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/27/us-news/ilhan-omars-hubbys-30m-firm-quietly-scrubs-names-from-website-as-squad-member-faces-mounting-questions-on-sudden-wealth-amid-minnesota-welfare-fraud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/117887193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LI6D0KUw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-27 14:18:07","author":"Gabrielle Fahmy,Geoff Earle","authors":["Gabrielle Fahmy","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":389448598,"title":"Elon Musk Calls Tim Walz a 'Crook' and Demands Prosecution Over £7bn Minnesota Fraud Scandal","text":"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has intensified his attacks on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, branding him a 'crook' and calling for his prosecution over a sprawling fraud scandal that federal prosecutors say could involve up to £7 billion ($9 billion) in stolen taxpayer funds.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared a post on X calling to prosecute Walz in response to investigative content posted by YouTuber Nick Shirley, whose videos have exposed alleged fraud schemes across Minnesota's welfare and Medicaid programmes.'Tim Walz is a crook', Musk wrote on Sunday.A Minnesota Department of Human Services staff account replied: '[Walz] absolutely is hiding fraud AND has retaliated & destroyed the lives of many whistleblowers'.Federal Prosecutors Call Fraud 'Industrial-Scale''The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated', First Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson said during a press conference on 18 December. 'What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.'Federal authorities have uncovered alleged schemes spanning 14 high-risk programmes, including housing assistance, autism therapy, and disability supports. Thompson had earlier suggested that half or more of the £14 billion ($18 billion) billed since 2018 could be fraudulent.The investigations grew from the £195 million ($250 million) Feeding Our Future scandal. Autism-related Medicaid claims surged from £65 million ($83 million) in 2021 to £267 million ($342 million) in 2024.House Republicans Join Calls for AccountabilityHouse Oversight Committee (HOC) Chairman James Comer told reporters that the 'walls are caving in' on Walz. 'The key to a good congressional investigation is having whistleblowers. And, fortunately for us, we have some state employees who have bravely stepped forward.'US House Majority Whip Tom Emmer echoed Musk's criticism on X. 'There's no way the Walz administration didn't know about the billions being stolen in fraud', the Minnesota Republican wrote. 'Whoever knew, even up to the high levels, must be held accountable.'Daycare Centre Video Sparks Viral OutrageThis week, YouTuber Nick Shirley posted footage showing a Minnesota daycare with 'Learning' misspelled on its sign that allegedly received £3.1 million ($4 million) in state funds.When investigators approached the 'Quality Learing Center' in Minneapolis, a woman shouted warnings about Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Shirley presented documents showing the centre received £1.5 million ($1.9 million) in fiscal year 2025 alone.Walz Denies WrongdoingGovernor Walz, for his part, questioned whether federal prosecutors' claims were politically motivated. 'You should be equally outraged about $1 or whatever that number is, but they're using that number without the proof behind it', Walz had said.A Walz spokesperson called the investigation 'a coordinated political attack to try to silence one of the President's most effective critics'.History of Animosity Between Musk and WalzThe clash escalates tensions between Musk and Walz, dating back to the 2024 presidential campaign when Walz served as Kamala Harris's running mate.During the campaign, Walz called Musk a 'dipshit' and questioned his government contracts. Walz reportedly celebrated when Tesla's stock declined, despite Minnesota's state pension fund holding 1.6 million shares in the company.The confrontation intensified after Donald Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), giving the billionaire a platform to scrutinise government waste and fraud.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/elon-musk-calls-tim-walz-crook-demands-prosecution-over-7bn-minnesota-fraud-scandal-1766165","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1772170/donald-trump-called-tim-walz-retarded-x-post.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=2c0c1183546ecf41b28cbf02a0ee0a2d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 12:52:15","author":"Stephanie Cruz","authors":["Stephanie Cruz"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":389437722,"title":"‘Turnout Machine’ Trump to Go Full-Throttle in 2026 Midterm Blitz","text":"White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has revealed that President Donald Trump will aggressively campaign for GOP candidates during the midterms, treating the elections \"like it's 2024 again.\"\n\nTraditional tracks have involved limiting Trump's exposure for Republican candidates in contested elections in the hopes that he won't generate a backlash turnout for Democrats. Wiles' strategy would be a bold departure from that midterm playbook.\n\nAnd it means the party will embrace a full-throttle defense of the policies and platforms that led to the President's dominating performance in 2024 when he easily dispatched Kamala Harris, whom Democrats and a compliant media heavily promoted as the second coming of Obama.\n\n\"Typically, in the midterms, it's not about who's sitting at the White House. You localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,\" Wiles said in an appearance on \"The Mom View\" podcast. \"We're actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot.\"\n\n\"Because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters,\" she added, noting that some results in 2025 show \"what happens when he’s not on the ballot and not active.\"\n\n\"He's going to campaign like it's 2024 again…He's a difference maker, and he's certainly a turnout machine.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Dems' Theory on Kamala’s Loss Goes Up in Smoke: Shocking Analysis Shows Trump Could Have Won by Even More\n\n'We Don't Dispute' It: Georgia 315k Vote Bombshell Blows a Big Hole in 2020's 'Most Secure Election' Lie\n\nWiles said she hasn't quite broken the news to President Trump that he'll be touring the country on the campaign trail yet, but we doubt he'll be adamantly opposed to holding rallies and dancing to the YMCA for candidates who support him.\n\nThis will be welcome news for conservatives who remember the frustration of past midterms. In 2018, during Trump's first term, Republicans lost control of the House in a significant setback, flipping dozens of seats to Democrats despite holding the Senate.\n\nFast forward to 2022, when the much-hyped \"red wave\" never materialized. Republicans narrowly took the House but failed to deliver the sweeping victories expected under a deeply unpopular Biden administration. Turnout among the MAGA base was lackluster in several battlegrounds, allowing Democrats to overperform.\n\nRepublicans opposed to the new strategy might want to look at their own record before chiming in. President Trump has been working tirelessly since re-entering the Oval Office. The GOP-led Congress? Not so much.\n\nThat might not be the best record to run on.\n\nA study of the 2024 presidential election revealed that, contrary to the media narrative, Harris was not a victim of low turnout. In fact, GOP turnout was strong thanks to Trump being on the ballot, and the study suggested that had he driven more voters to the polls, his already big victory would have been even larger.\n\nDavid Shor, a Democrat data scientist and political consultant renowned for analyzing political polls, refuted the theory that voter turnout would have helped give Kamala the edge.\n\n\"The reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of the roughly 1.6+ points],\" he explained. \n\n\"So, I think that a 'we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone' strategy would’ve made things worse.\"\n\nAnd there you have it. Republicans, as Wiles is suggesting, \"need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone.\" Who better to do that than the most consequential political figure of the modern era? The man who swept the battleground states where GOP candidates in 2022 struggled.\n\nBy nationalizing the midterms and putting Trump front and center—with rallies, endorsements, and his massive war chest—Republicans can drive turnout among the working-class voters who propelled him to victory last year.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Republicans sought to cement President Donald Trump’s gains, while Democrats, fearing they could lose an increasingly disaffected segment of the electorate for a generation, launched a series of initiatives to prevent that. Ahead of next year’s midterms, some Democrats say the momentum is shifting. High-profile Democrats running in last month’s elections — Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Zohran Mamdani in New York City — improved on the party’s poor performance among young men one year before. Some 2028 Democratic presidential contenders launched policy initiatives aimed at men and boys. And in Trump’s first year in office, many young men say they feel a continued economic and social malaise, cutting into his support with that key group. “I never want to hear again that the Democratic Party has a problem with young men,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told reporters after the November elections. While some Democrats are taking an early victory lap, members of both parties say the fight is far from over. “There’s some bed-wetting going on amongst some folks who are like, ‘Well, Trump’s numbers have slipped with all these groups that he won big with last year,’” said a senior Republican strategist, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the matter. “That’s just shortsighted. ... The Republican ecosystem is just a little bit stronger in this space.” In addition, multiple Democrats said that while they’ve been encouraged by the progress the party has made, there remains a level of discomfort among some party leaders in speaking to those issues. At last month’s Symposium on Young American Men, a conference put on by The Lafayette Company, a conservative communications firm, to discuss crises facing the demographic, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said some in the party still have a fear of being “canceled” for homing in on the subject. “It’s OK to reach out to men,” Gallego said. “Talk to men. Talk about men being men.” Republicans, meanwhile, plan to hammer Democrats ahead of the midterms as out of touch with the concerns of young men while projecting improved economic standing for them in the new year, pointing to tax provisions in Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” including some about tipped wages. The senior Republican strategist said the midterms will be decided by voters’ attitudes on Trump and the economy, predicting sentiment will improve as Trump’s agenda fully sets in. “There’s a lot of folks who feel that they are not where they should be, they’re falling behind,” this person said. “There’s a general unsettlement. Young men are especially there when you look at job prospects, AI, there’s uncertainty in general. And you add in the fact that you can’t buy a house, you can’t find a girlfriend. ... A lot of folks look to Trump for solutions.” The fight could define several critical midterm races, with Democrats hoping to build on their 2025 gains while Republicans still work to figure out how to get inconsistent voters to turn out without the president at the top of the ticket. A senior GOP Senate aide said that “to the extent” Republicans are pondering how to get disaffected young men back to the polls next fall, “they’re just hoping Trump does it” for them. While it’s difficult to measure how Trump’s standing among young men has ebbed, this month’s Yale Youth Poll found his gains with young voters last year have largely been wiped out this year. The survey found that just 34% of voters ages 18 to 22 approved of Trump, in addition to 32% of voters ages 23 to 29. Last year, Trump won 42% of those under 30, a traditionally left-wing electorate that shifted substantially rightward from 2020. Economic sentiment appeared to be the biggest factor in the shift. Mamdani, Spanberger and Sherrill all focused on affordability in their campaigns and not only improved among young men over 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris but were also able to win over 7% to 9% of Trump voters in their elections, per NBC News exit polls. Youth unemployment — for those ages 16 to 24 — was at 10.8% in July, rising year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in November for U.S. residents ages 20 to 24 hit 8.3% in November, BLS data showed, down from 9.2% in September but still the highest since 2021. And this spring’s Harvard Youth Poll found that roughly 4 in 10 of those under 30 were “barely getting by” financially. Christian G., 25, an independent from Clifton, New Jersey, said it was continued disappointment with the economy that had him voting for Sherrill after having backed Trump. “I feel like I expected certain things to be improved or certain things to become more affordable, and it did the exact opposite,” he said in a recent focus group observed by NBC News and produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago, adding: “I would say for me it is kind of a testament to how, I guess, trust was lost over the year. Whereas I voted for him back in ’24, now, a year later, I’m feeling let down. I wanted to be a little more logical in my approach and vote for someone who I thought would benefit me more.” It’s not what many Democratic leaders figured when they entered the year trying to tackle Republicans’ advantage among young men — an edge they believed was due to the “manosphere,” a universe of apolitical to explicitly right-wing podcasters and streamers who embraced Trump in last year’s election. Some Democrats urged party leaders to break into that space, while others were willing to spend millions to fund their own male-friendly content platform. Thinking about the project to essentially create a left-wing Joe Rogan, Virginia state Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat who spoke at last month’s Symposium on Young American Men, laughed. “I’m laughing because it ain’t that hard if you’re being yourself,” he said, adding: “And so I don’t know if it’s a good use of donor funds to try and re-create a new ecosystem or shoehorn people into an existing ecosystem. But we have ... very earnest and sincere Democratic leaders who are men who can speak authentically about what it means to be a man at an earlier time and also what it means to be a man today.” One Democratic man who found success in such spaces was Mamdani, who won young men by roughly 40 points over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month. He has made a series of high-profile podcast appearances this year, including on “Flagrant,” a prominent comedy program Trump appeared on last year, and “The Adam Friedland Show.” In an interview, Mamdani said he was struck by how many New Yorkers he engaged with came across him only through his appearances on shows like “Flagrant.” He said a critical lesson for Democrats “is to stop treating young people and young men with the condescension that we often see and hear in our politics.” “What I found time and time again is that affordability was not something that needed any translation in young people’s lives, that this was something that was the difference between whether or not they could move out of their parents’ apartment and live on their own or not,” said Mamdani, the 34-year-old avowed democratic socialist. “There’s oftentimes even this attempt at trying to speak to young people, especially young men, slowly, through the prism of friends or memes, when you can, in fact, speak directly to them and to their problems.” Mamdani also connected issues around the cost of living with male loneliness and alienation. “Part of this story that we are telling is that the crisis of cost has also denied so many people the engagement with their own city and the sense of themselves as being someone who does more than just exist between work and home,” he said. Mamdani, whose campaign held high-profile free events, including a soccer tournament and a scavenger hunt, said he’s thinking of how to spur more free or low-cost events in the city that young people can take part in. Elsewhere, Democrats across the spectrum are coming forth with ideas to address an array of male-centric issues. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently announced an initiative to hire more male teachers, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Democrats had “walked away” from men’s and boys’ issues, signed executive orders this year to address male suicide and launch a “California Men’s Service Challenge.” In an interview, Thomas noted that he authored legislation to create Virginia’s first governor’s advisory board on boys’ and men’s issues. “I think men have seen ... there’s been a different focus in the Democratic Party that maybe didn’t exist in October of last year,” he said. Yet voters often feel differently about state and local elections than they do about national ones. Alex Lieberman of Brooklyn, New York, said that even though he backed Mamdani in November, he would vote for Trump for a third time if he could. (Without Trump on the ballot, Lieberman said, he would back whoever the more populist option is.) “I think he has fulfilled his campaign promises,” Lieberman, who is in his 20s and said he was inspired to vote for Mamdani in part because of his focus on affordability and small-business issues, said of Trump. “And I think that everything that people are not happy with, I just don’t, frankly, understand, because it was exactly what it was like in the first term.” In office, Trump hasn’t made such explicit appeals to young men, though allies have said his agenda — particularly on the economy, diversity and immigration — has them in mind. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told NBC News at the Symposium on Young American Men that Trump has sought to bolster the standing of young men, “but I haven’t heard him speak specifically ... about young men much, other than celebrating excellence and achievement, celebrating hard work.” Lankford said he has heard the conversation around issues affecting young men shift over the past year, saying he no longer hears much, if any, discussion of “toxic masculinity,” a concept that conservatives have criticized for years as part of broader left-wing excess. Similarly, the right has taken sharper aim this year at diversity initiatives, claiming they hamper the prospects of younger white men. To maintain their strength with young men, a longtime pro-Trump operative said, Republicans will capitalize on diversity policies they feel a future Democratic presidential nominee will embrace. “I don’t think we’ve lost them,” this person said of young men. “I still think our party will be the one that has a more appealing vision. Will they turn out in the midterms for random Republicans? Maybe not. Were they turning out for the midterms before? No. Really, what we’re talking about is will they be there in ’28.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/fight-young-men-2026-midterm-elections-rcna249513","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251224-zohran-mamdani-vl-1014p-9b7ea7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 11:00:00","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046}]}
