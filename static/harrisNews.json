For years, FEMA employees under the Biden administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.\n\n“They deliberately avoided houses displaying support for President Trump and the Second Amendment, illegally collected and stored information about survivors’ political beliefs, and failed to report their malicious behavior. We will not let this stand.”\n\nMatt Taibbi was first to report the investigation’s conclusion on Monday. The Center Square on Monday was unsuccessful in obtaining a copy of the report prior to Tuesday morning’s national release.\n\nEvidence examined by the Privacy Office of Homeland Security included screenshots of FEMA’s tool to collect and maintain information for the purpose of disaster survivor assistance. The report says, “The entries within the tool clearly showed that canvassers included information related to political party affiliation, campaign signs, and other information that may be considered First Amendment-protected freedom of expression within the free-text notes section.”\n\nAnd, it said, “In several instances, canvassers’ records indicate that canvassers skipped homes and left no disaster assistance flyers, citing the First Amendment-protected activity.”\n\nA map of the United States includes instances in eight states between 2021 and 2024, with the testimony to Congress quote of former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell above it. She said, “I do not believe that this employee’s actions are indicative of any widespread cultural problems at FEMA.”\n\nMarn’i Washington, fired from her position as a disaster survivor assistance crew leader for FEMA, on the Nov. 11 edition of the Roland Martin Unfiltered Daily Digital Show had confirmed homes skipped. She said it happened at homes not only with signs for Trump but also for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.\n\nShe said it happened in Florida and the Carolinas. Hurricane Milton was one of three hurricanes to hit Florida in 66 days, and another was Helene that ravaged Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee – the most deaths and mostly costly damage coming in North Carolina.\n\nOn the Homeland Security report’s map, two notations for North Carolina include instances in October and November last year. The first says, “The survivor had a sign that read … NRA, we do our part,” and the second said, “Survivor stated that homes have been damaged, but there are Republicans on the grounds with guns, so please be careful.”\n\nA dot for Florida from October says, “Trump sign, no contact per leadership.” Another dot for November said, “There was a political flyer, so I didn’t leave a FEMA brochure.”\n\nFrom September 2021 in Pennsylvania, the report notes, “… a lot of explicit political flags, posters, etc. ‘F— Joe Biden’ ‘MAGA 2024’ ‘Joe Biden Sucks’ ‘Trump 2024’ We do not recommend anyone visiting this location.”\n\nFrom October 2021, in Louisiana, “Homeowner had sign stated … this is trump country.”\n\nHERE ARE THE GROUPS TRUMP HAS DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS\n\nThe map and incidents noted were not inclusive of findings; rather, just a sampling.\n\nNoem said the following actions will happen:\n\n• Referred the case to the Department of Justice for further investigation and potential prosecution.\n\n• Also referred the case to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General.\n\n• Canceled the door-to-door survey practice that FEMA used to discriminate against Americans.\n\n• Instructed the DHS Privacy Office to issue clear recommendations to FEMA to address these egregious violations and prevent future ones.\n\n• Required FEMA to adhere to stricter data collection practices, strengthen guidance and training, and clearly define legitimate safety and hostility concerns to ensure staff make fair and lawful decisions.\n\n• Instructed FEMA to also implement rigorous oversight and auditing mechanisms to restore integrity to its disaster relief operations.","summary":"(The Center Square) – Reports of FEMA disaster assistance teams in 2024 bypassing homes displaying signs supporting then-presidential candidate Donald Trump were true and were indicative of a pattern tracing back to Hurricane Ida in 2021, says an internal probe by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

He would proceed to show a video of himself singing at a wedding in his underwear revealing that he had a tattoo on his chest that resembled the totenkopf, which means “death’s head,” a skull and crossbones-like symbol popular in Nazi Germany. \n\nPlatner has denied it was a Nazi tattoo and said that he got it while drunk in Croatia with his fellow Marines. \n\n“We chose a terrifying skull and crossbones off the wall because we were Marines,” he told host Tommy Vietor and said he continued to receive security clearance. Platner said he eventually got wind that the tattoo had entered into opposition research. \n\n“And I can honestly say that if I was trying to hide it, I have not been doing a very good job for the past 18 years,” Platner added. \n\nThe trove of news has quenched much of the fervor surrounding Platner in recent weeks since he announced his candidacy to challenge Collins. Up until then, few Democrats had stepped up to run against Maine’s senior senator, who is the only Republican who represents a state Kamala Harris won. \n\nPlatner’s campaign raked in more than $3 million since he announced in August. He immediately earned comparisons to Zohran Mamdani’s campaign for New York City mayor and Sen. John Fetterman’s 2022 campaign in Pennsylvania. He also shares many of the same consultants as they used.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has praised Platner’s campaign on X, said he had not seen the news about Platner. \n\n“I know a lot of people say that they haven't looked at it, and they don’t really mean it,” Murphy told The Independent. “I know he said some stuff on Reddit. I haven’t read it.”\n\nPlatner’s various controversies represents a conundrum for Democrats: Many of their voters are dissatisfied with the party leadership and want candidates who challenge the status quo. But many younger Democratic candidates of Platner’s age grew up in a time when they also documented most of their adult life online. \n\nSen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) won his race last year and is also a veteran of the Marine Corps who, like Platner, spoke about living with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq. \n\nWhen The Independent asked about the tattoo, Gallego said he had not seen it, but on Platner’s past statements said that if people grow out of their troublesome behaviors, they should be given grace. \n\n“We have to evaluate if that's the case I think that's a legitimate conversation to be had,” Gallego told The Independent. “But, you know, everyone has a right to grow and grow out of their stupidity, essentially. And I think voters should take the opportunity to evaluate that.”\n\nAt the same time, Maine’s popular executive, Gov. Janet Mills, a more establishment-friendly candidate, also jumped into the primary last week. \n\nDuring Senate Democratic leadership’s weekly press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got behind Mills when asked about Platner’s comments.\n\n“We think that Janet Mills is the best candidate to retire Susan Collins,” he said. “She's a tested two-term governor and the people of Maine have an enormous amount of affection and respect for her.”\n\nBut some pointed out how at 77, Mills seemed to confirm the Democratic Party’s age problem that led to criticism during the 2024 election. \n\nCollins, who has voted for most of Trump’s nominees but who voted against Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” has yet to announce whether she will seek re-election.","summary":"The anti-establishment ex-Marine earned plaudits from some Democrats.

Historically, the party of the president loses seats in the midterms, and President Donald Trump’s approval rating has dropped since his return to office in January. But some recent polls suggest that Democrats are in a weaker position than they were at this point in his first term—fueling concerns about whether a strong “blue wave” will strike next year.\n\nTwo new polls of Arizona’s 6th Congressional District and Wisconsin’s 3rd, however, point to tight races. These are likely to become two of the most competitive battles next year and are among Democrats’ top targets.\n\nThe polls are conducted by a Democratic-aligned firm, but they underscore the competitive nature of the seats.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nArizona’s 6th District, held by Republican Juan Ciscomani, supported Trump by less than 1 percentage point in November after narrowly backing former President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nCiscomani has drawn several Democratic challengers, including veteran JoAnna Mendoza. A recent survey from Public Policy Polling, first reported by Politico, asked voters in the district whether they would support Ciscomani or Mendoza.\n\nThe poll found that 42 percent of respondents said they would support Mendoza, while 41 percent would vote for Ciscomani. It surveyed 581 voters on October 14 and October 15.\n\nA voter casts a ballot in Madison, Wisconsin, on November 8, 2022.\n\nA separate Public Policy Polling survey asked voters in Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District about how they plan to vote next year. The district is currently represented by Republican Derrick Van Orden. It is a bit more conservative, with Trump winning there by about 7 points last year.\n\nThe poll showed Democratic challenger Rebecca Cooke, who ran for the seat last year, leading 44 percent to 42 percent, with 13 percent of respondents remaining undecided. The poll surveyed 609 voters in the district on the same days this month.\n\nCooke fared better than former Vice President Kamala Harris in the district last year, losing by less than 3 percentage points, so she is viewed as a top recruit for Democrats, who are hopeful she will be able to flip the seat in a more favorable environment.\n\nGeneric ballot polling has been a concern for Democrats. While they do hold a modest lead over Republicans in head-to-heads, it is much more narrow than in 2017. On Monday, Democrats led RealClearPolitics’ aggregate by about 1.6 points, compared with their lead of 9.2 points on October 20, 2017.\n\nDemocrats won the national popular vote by about 8.4 percentage points and a 235-199 House majority in the 2018 midterms.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMendoza, in a statement: “These numbers reflect and confirm what I hear every day across southern Arizona. Families are ready for leadership that puts people – not DC party leaders – first. I’ve spent my life serving my country and my community, and I’m ready to bring that same commitment to Congress to make life more affordable and ensure every family has a fair shot.”\n\nCooke, in a statement: “Not only is Derrick Van Orden deeply unpopular, but his record in Congress—backing tax cuts for the ultra-rich while asking Wisconsin working families to do more with less—is toxic. My campaign is bringing people together around real solutions that lower costs, improve health care access and put an end to the culture of corruption in Washington.”\n\nNRCC spokesperson Mike Marinella previously told Newsweek: “Democrats can’t hide their far-left lunacy, from their reckless government shutdown to their radical socialist agenda. Voters are sick of paying the price for Democrat chaos, and voters will elect Republicans across the board.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Cook Political Report classifies both races as toss-ups, meaning they’re set to be among the most contested elections of the midterms.","summary":"Two recent polls show tight races in battleground Arizona and Wisconsin congressional districts.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-within-striking-distance-of-flipping-gop-seats-in-2-swing-states-10916155","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1244622530.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 21:43:19","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":371355228,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Bill Nye, Buttigieg boost Spanberger amid Jones scandal","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

views and is trying to right the ship after the news magazine faced battering accusations of favoring Democrats and going out of its way to make President Donald Trump look bad.'Blindsided and

Jean-Pierre left the party earlier this year to become an independent. In the book, Jean-Pierre said she was disgusted by how Democrats treated Biden after his poor debate performance against Trump last year, ultimately pressuring him to leave the 2024 White House race.

Spanberger will rally with Buttigieg and Nye in Charlottesville – the city that birthed President Thomas Jefferson – while across town at the college founded by America’s third president, GOP lieutenant gubernatorial candidate John Reid will headline a public \"Dome Room\" forum hosted by pollster Larry Sabato’s University of Virginia Center for Politics. Spanberger’s rally occurs as she tries to separate herself from scandal-plagued attorney general candidate Jay Jones. Nye and Spanberger are expected to receive a welcome in the notable blue dot in the sea of rural Shenandoah Valley red that is Charlottesville. VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN WARNS AGAINST DEM CANDIDATE'S CENTRIST LABEL, SAYS SHE'LL END COOPERATION WITH ICE Trump Winery and its Albemarle Estate lodging, managed by Eric Trump, lies on the opposite side of town, down the street from Monticello itself. The road that runs from Jefferson’s estate to Trump’s is regularly lined with dozens of large American flags abutting the estate’s property line. That contrast will be evident Tuesday, as Spanberger enlists celebrities in hopes of propelling her to victory, while Reid, who has claimed to be pulling within neck-and-neck of Democrat Ghazala Hashmi, also seeks to engage with the public in the closing days. While she has condemned Jones’ comments, Spanberger has continued to decline to call for him to drop out – while pivoting this week to attacking her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, on her pro-life views. WINSOME EARLE-SEARS RELEASES ‘TWO BULLETS’ AD SCATHING OPPONENT FOR FAILING TO DEMAND JAY JONES’ OUSTER An ad released Monday criticized Earle-Sears’ support for a near-total abortion ban and in turn positioned Spanberger as the champion of individual rights. Moving from medical science to engineering, Nye resurfaced this week clamoring against President Donald Trump at a \"No Kings\" protest in his hometown of Washington, D.C., where he accused some in the MAGA faithful of being \"Confederates.\" \"We are here to tell our lawmakers that what’s going on in our government is wrong. They must stop the abuses of this petulant president and his circle of sycophants… This president and his associates cannot tolerate dissent. To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts,\" Nye said in part. SPANBERGER DEFENDS ABORTION AD CRITICIZING SEARS AFTER BERNIE WARNS AGAINST HIGHLIGHTING ISSUE The former star of PBS’ \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" and the engineer-by-trade who invented an aircraft implement while working for Boeing, slammed Trump for trying to \"silence television hosts.\" When asked about Nye's switch from science to politics, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson remarked, \"You mean Bill Nye the Liberal Activist Guy?\" While Republicans are not the party typically associated with major Hollywood and celebrity endorsements, over his decade-plus in politics, Trump has garnered several very vocal stars in his camp. \"Charles In Charge\" star Scott Baio has been most vocal as of late, saying in 2024 he believed the U.S. was always a \"MAGA\" nation. OBAMA ENDORSES SPANBERGER, ATTACKS REPUBLICANS IN VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE ADS Jon Voight has routinely released stern X videos addressing the public and/or public officials on Trump’s bona fides: \"Who else has faced greater challenges and enemies since Lincoln?\" he asked. Mel Gibson, who played a version of Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion in \"The Patriot,\" has been complimentary of Trump while remarking that 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris had \"the IQ of a fence post.\" Trump has since appointed him a \"special ambassador.\" NATION'S ONLY TWO 2025 RACES FOR GOVERNOR ROCKED WITH THREE WEEKS UNTIL ELECTION DAY Just on the other side of Skyline Drive from Jones’ rally site is the former district of then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert – the Republican whom Jones envisioned shooting in the head in texts revealed earlier this month. Earle-Sears repeatedly interjected during the two gubernatorial candidates' debate to urge Spanberger to call for Jones to drop out once and for all. On Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, headlined a fundraiser with Earle-Sears at the home of a Tysons Corner real estate developer.

For years, FEMA employees under the Biden administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.\n\n“They deliberately avoided houses displaying support for President Trump and the Second Amendment, illegally collected and stored information about survivors’ political beliefs, and failed to report their malicious behavior. We will not let this stand.”\n\nMatt Taibbi was first to report the investigation's conclusion on Monday. The Center Square on Monday was unsuccessful obtaining a copy of the report prior to Tuesday morning national release.\n\nEvidence examined by the Privacy Office of Homeland Security included screenshots of FEMA’s tool to collect and maintain information for the purpose of disaster survivor assistance. The report says, “The entries within the tool clearly showed that canvassers included information related to political party affiliation, campaign signs, and other information that may be considered First Amendment-protected freedom of expression within the free-text notes section.”\n\nAnd, it said, “In several instances, canvassers’ records indicate that canvassers skipped homes and left no disaster assistance flyers, citing the First Amendment-protected activity.”\n\nA map of the United States includes instances in eight states between 2021 and 2024, with the testimony to Congress quote of former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell above it.

She said it happened at homes not only with signs for Trump but also Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.\n\nShe said it happened in Florida and the Carolinas. Hurricane Milton was one of three hurricanes to hit Florida in 66 days, and another was Helene that ravaged Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee – the most deaths and mostly cosstly damange coming in North Carolina.\n\nOn the Homeland Security report’s map, two notations for North Carolina include instances in October and November last year.

Jean-Pierre called out the Democratic Party throughout her book, particularly voicing frustration over what she said was the party's betrayal of former President Biden. She also blamed the party for Harris' loss. \"It was deeply disturbing that after shoving Biden aside in a disgraceful display, the party’s elders couldn’t summon enough know-how to help an intelligent, accomplished attorney like Harris defeat an ignorant former reality TV star.

Neither Harris nor Newsom has formally announced their candidacy.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom at a news conference at Cedars-Sinai Mark Goodson pharmacy in Los Angeles Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAccording to the poll, Harris is leading the 2028 Democratic field with support from 33 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of Independents. Governor Newsom trailed well behind, earning 13 percent among Democrats and just 3 percent among Independents, while 17 percent of respondents said they were undecided about their choice in a potential Democratic primary.\n\nNew York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ranked third, with 8 percent of support among both Democrats and Independents, followed closely by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 7 percent.\n\nIt comes after Newsom received a significant bump in the polls after launching a barrage of sharp attacks on President Donald Trump on social media in August, with the governor’s office transforming its social media presence into a barrage of all-caps taunts, pop culture spoofs, and AI-generated memes—mocking the president’s style. \n\nIn an early August POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey, Newsom led Harris 25 percent to 19 percent among the state’s registered Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nHarris has largely avoided the spotlight since her unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign. She recently passed up the opportunity to run for California governor, saying she doesn’t “want to go back in the system” for now. That is despite the fact that polls showed that her candidacy in the California gubernatorial race would have a field-clearing effect. But polling now suggests Newsom’s support has dipped.\n\nThe Noble Predictive Insights poll showed that Harris outperformed her rivals across nearly every major demographic, drawing particularly strong backing from Black voters (54 percent), Southerners (40 percent), and younger Americans—44 percent among those aged 18 to 29 and 42 percent among those 30 to 44. She was also roughly twice as popular as Newsom among women and lower-income voters earning under $50,000 a year (36 percent to 18 percent).\n\nNewsom, however, led Harris among two key groups: voters in the West (30 percent to 25 percent) and older Americans aged 65 and above (29 percent to 18 percent). He and Harris were nearly tied among white, college-educated, and higher-income voters earning more than $100,000 annually, with only one- or two-point differences separating them. Ocasio-Cortez was the second choice among voters under 30, drawing 15 percent support compared with Newsom’s 12 percent.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker tied for fifth place with 4 percent each, followed by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer at 3 percent and Maryland Governor Wes Moore at 1 percent.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMost candidates do not announce presidential runs until after the midterm elections, which are set for November 2026.","summary":"According to the poll, Harris is leading the 2028 Democratic field, while Newsom trails behind.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-suffers-polling-blow-among-2028-democratic-candidates-10913159","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25289742915280.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 16:31:55","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":371343134,"title":"Free Beacon Mocks MSNBC's 'Live '25' Fan Event in NYC For Its 'Dying Audience'","text":"Andrew Stiles and Jameson Mitrovich at the Washington Free Beacon captured all the funniest takes at a MSNBC fan event, \"MSNBC Live '25\" at the Hammerstein Ballroom in midtown Manhattan.

For Hollywood and other traditional media giants, all roads lead to consolidation,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.\n\nThe company is also considering an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros and a spin-off of Discovery Global.\n\nThe Ellison in the room\n\nWarner Brothers Discovery already rejected an initial bid from Paramount — now led by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, cofounder of Oracle and a key ally of US President Donald Trump — Bloomberg News reported earlier this month, because the offer of around $20 per share was too low.\n\nSkydance’s advances soon after snapping up Paramount speak to the Ellison family’s voracious appetite to dominate the global media landscape amid a favourable regulatory regime in the United States.\n\nAnalysts believe David Ellison’s deep pockets – backed by his father, Oracle cofounder and the world’s second-richest person Larry Ellison – give him the firepower to take the risk.\n\nThe elder Ellison’s close ties with US President Donald Trump may also smooth regulatory hurdles and avoid the scrutiny that would usually come with such a merger, analysts say.\n\nThe decline of legacy media, driven by linear TV cord-cutting, as well as the shift of audiences and advertisers to streaming platforms, has forced traditional media companies to rethink their business structures.\n\nEllison’s looming involvement raised concerns about how CNN could cover the White House.\n\nAmong the vocal critics is Dan Rather, who served as the anchor of the CBS Evening News for 24 years.\n\n“Americans have to be concerned about the consolidation of huge billionaires getting control of nearly all of the major news outlets,” Rather said in an interview on Andy Cohen’s SiriusXM show in September.\n\n“It’s pretty hard to be optimistic about the possibilities of the Ellisons buying CNN.”\n\nBefore the Paramount – Skydance Merger, CBS settled a lawsuit that alleged that the network’s long-standing newsmagazine 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with then Democratic Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris for $16m. And also ahead of the merger announced the cancellation of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, who only days before called the settlement “a big fat bribe”.\n\nEllison has since hired Bari Weiss — an opinion writer and founder of the commentary website Free Press. Weiss, who had no experience in television — to lead the broadcast TV network. Weiss has gained popularity among right-wing voices for her “anti-woke” commentary.\n\nThis as the company appointed Kenneth Weinstein, a former Trump administration nominee, to be CBS News’ ombudsman to investigate allegations of bias.\n\nOn Wall Street, Warner Bros Discovery is up 10.8 percent following the announcement. Comcast is up 0.1 percent, Netflix is up 0.7 percent. Paramount-Skydance, on the other hand, is trending downwards — down 1.3 percent from the market open as of 11:30 AM in New York (15:30 GMT)","summary":"Comcast, Netflix and Paramount-Skydance reportedly have interest in buying the media giant.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/21/warner-bros-discovery-explores-possible-sale?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-09T023403Z_1160442236_RC21OGA04S8L_RTRMADP_3_FILM-ONE-BATTLE-AFTER-ANOTHER-PREMIERE-1761061138.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 16:19:39","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.222},{"id":371299356,"title":"Progressive groups launch $1.4 million campaign to win back Latino voters from Trump","text":"By ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON, Associated Press\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

The book will share stories about his political life, his family and his faith, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Gov.

He attended Akiba Hebrew Academy, where he met his wife, Lori, and served as a state representative, a Montgomery County commissioner and Pennsylvania attorney general before being elected governor in 2022. He is a father of four.\n\nShapiro's book will detail his experience in being on the shortlist to serve as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris's running mate last year.

She elaborated on her decision in her own book, \"107 Days,\" saying Shaprio had an \"unrealistic expectation\" to be in the room for every decision. \n\n\"A vice president is not a co-president,\" Harris wrote. \"I had a nagging concern that he wold be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership...

But across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Mamdani's race has stayed out of the spotlight, as the Garden State's gubernatorial election takes center stage and Democrats in the state sidestep endorsing or even mentioning the progressive candidate. \"I am not getting engaged in that race, because I’m completely focused on New Jersey,\" New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, said earlier in October of Mamdani's race. \"I’m going to let the people of New York decide that race.\" The off-year election cycle mainly has focused on four elections: California's ballot measure to redistrict congressional lines; New York City's mayoral election; and the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections. DEMOCRAT IN KEY GOVERNOR RACE KEEPS DISTANCE FROM NYC'S MAMDANI Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist, with critics identifying him more as a \"communist\" despite the candidate pushing back that he does not hold communist ideologies. Fox News Digital previously has reported that Mamdani has backed radical Marxist and communist principles, such as supporting the seizure of the \"means of production,\" endorsing a tax plan aimed at \"taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers,\" and openly calling for a communist mayor of New York City in 2020. The New Jersey gubernatorial election and Democratic lawmakers hailing from the state have overwhelmingly avoided the Mamdani race as other lawmakers and Democratic leaders — from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to New York Attorney General Letitia James to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore — have thrown their support behind the candidate. Back in July, Sherrill said she likely would support Mamdani's nomination as the Democrat's candidate for mayor before sidestepping months later. \"If he’s the Democratic candidate, which it sounds like he is, I assume I will (support him),\" she told NBC Philadelphia in July. \"If he’s going to be working on efficient government, that’s something very interesting to me.\" Mamdani, however, said he would \"absolutely\" support the New Jersey Democrat during a local interview with New York media in August. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker also has evaded answering whether he endorses Mamdani in an August CNN interview. \"I have learned a long time ago: Let New York politics be New York politics,\" Booker said when pressed if he would support Mamdani. \"We’ve got enough challenges in Jersey. I got a governor’s race. I’m supporting Mikie Sherrill. I got legislative races. That’s where my energy is going to go going into November.\" \"New York City, I love you,\" Booker added. \"You’re my neighbor. You’re about 10 miles from where I live. You guys figure out your elections. I’m going to focus on mine.\" NY STATE DEM BOSS REFUSES TO ENDORSE MAMDANI, CAUSING HUGE RIFT IN PARTY Current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim have not publicly weighed in on Mamdani's race, a Fox News Digital review of recent past remarks found. One of Sherrill's primary challengers, Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer, however, repeatedly has slammed Mamdani as \"a job-killing socialist.\" \"You will hear no ambiguity out of my mouth,\" Gottheimer said in July. \"We do not need a job-killing socialist who wants to raise taxes and supports antisemitic rhetoric. Right? In a city with the highest taxes in the country and the largest Jewish population.\" Gottheimer also teamed up with a Republican colleague from across the Hudson River, New York Rep. Mike Lawler, to slam Mamdani in September, after the socialist candidate said he would scrap a Holocaust remembrance group’s definition of \"antisemitism\" if elected mayor. EX-MAYOR DE BLASIO TOUTS SOCIALIST MAMDANI AS NEW YORK CITY'S ANSWER TO TRUMP POLICIES \"Zohran Mamdani’s reckless attempt to roll back New York City’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism is shameful, dangerous, and completely disgusting,\" the pair of lawmakers said in a joint statement in September. Lesser known New Jersey elected officials have endorsed Mamdani, including left-wing Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Baraka found himself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's deportation efforts when he was arrested and charged in May for trespassing at a federal immigration detention center while attempting to hold an oversight tour of the facility. The charge was later dropped, with Baraka later suing interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba for false arrest and malicious prosecution. Baraka is listed on Mamdani's endorsement page, with the Newark mayor posting an endorsement video to his social media accounts in June celebrating that the New York City candidate would be \"strong on Democratic values\" and defend the Constitution if elected. The New Jersey election is highly anticipated following President Donald Trump's inroads with voters in the deep blue state in the 2024 election, sparking renewed enthusiasm to flip the state red. New Jersey, as expected, backed former Vice President Kamala Harris as president in the 2024 race, but post-election data showed Trump and the GOP flipped five counties red, with Trump specifically cutting his 2020 loss from 16 points to six in 2024.

But his own country looks a lot like it | Daniel Mendiola","text":"Here in the Americas, we have a peculiar tradition. Every time there is a major election, prominent figures on the right find themselves compelled to repeat some version of the vaguely menacing prediction: if the candidate for the left wins, we will become “the next Venezuela”.\n\nWhether Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Colombia or Ecuador, countries throughout the western hemisphere keep this tradition. Donald Trump has also participated in this ritual, proclaiming during the 2024 election cycle that if Kamala Harris won, our country would become “Venezuela on steroids”.\n\nOddly spoken with disdain.\n\nHarris, of course, lost the election, so we will never know how Venezuela-esque her version of the US might have been. But we are seeing Trump’s America, and the reality is: it’s looking a lot like Venezuela.\n\nSince the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez – a charismatic yet polarizing leftwing figure – political discourses have shrouded Venezuela in conflicting layers of partisan caricature, often making it difficult to parse what is actually happening. At this point, however, there is no doubt that the country is in crisis.\n\nMigration statistics alone provide compelling evidence. Amnesty International and the UN refugee agency estimate that nearly 8 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 – as much as 25% of the population. Hyperinflation and food shortages have driven this exodus, compounded by authoritarianism and increasing repression under Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, who has held on to power since 2013 through elections with overwhelming evidence of fraud.\n\nSignificantly, the US has hardly been an innocent bystander. Not only have we frequently doled out reprehensible treatment to Venezuelan asylum seekers, but we have also played a role in creating the conditions that are forcing people to migrate in the first place. The US has maintained a belligerent stance toward Venezuela for more than two decades – for example, supporting a short-lived coup to overthrow Chávez in 2002, as well as hitting the country with sanctions – and the Trump administration has recently escalated the conflict by ordering a series of deadly strikes on civilian boats suspected of smuggling drugs off the Venezuelan the coast. Reports also indicate that Trump is considering an intervention to depose Maduro, and the CIA may already be carrying out covert operations in the country.\n\nJournalists and legal analysts have done excellent work explaining how these strikes are illegal according to US and international law, in addition to being murderously cruel. There has also been great coverage of how the demonization of Venezuelan immigrants – including a steady stream of propaganda painting Venezuelan immigrants as gang members and terrorists – has long been a centerpiece of Trump’s platform.\n\nThese actions are disgraceful on their own terms. But they are also bitterly ironic: even while terrorizing Venezuelans in the name of defending democracy, Trump has, in fact, been running a strikingly similar authoritarian playbook. Noteworthy parallels include dismantling constitutional limits on presidential authority, manipulating electoral districts to inflate his party’s representation in Congress, and using state power to repress political opponents.\n\nIn Venezuela’s case, the story begins with a fraught referendum. Immediately upon taking office in 1999, Chávez decreed a new executive power: the ability to call for a referendum on writing a new constitution. The legality of the claim was dubious given that the Venezuelan legal system already had mechanisms for updating the constitution, and a simple majority popular vote was not one of them. Nonetheless, the Venezuelan supreme court relented, and when the referendum passed, Chávez asserted a heavy hand in creating the process for how a constitutional assembly would work. Moreover, he unilaterally gave this assembly outsized powers to govern, suspending Congress and the supreme court in the meantime. Unsurprisingly, the resulting constitution of 1999 expanded executive authority considerably, and the entire process established a precedent to continue using these largely hand-picked constitutional assemblies to overrule congress whenever the opposition gained ground.\n\nWhile there are, likewise, calls for a constitutional convention coming from Trump allies that could function in a similar way, this hasn’t actually been necessary in the US. Rather, the conservative supermajority on the supreme court has managed to effectively do the same thing on its own: repeatedly ignoring plain text as well as its own precedent in order to assign new powers to the presidency while at the same time eviscerating longstanding checks from other branches of government and independent agencies alike. In short, even without literally rewriting the constitution, the supreme court has in practice served as a comparable constitutional assembly, fundamentally reshaping constitutional norms to create a “unitary executive” with fewer checks on executive power than ever before.\n\nTaking this comparison even deeper, there are also important parallels in Trump’s efforts to stack Congress through “gerrymandering”: a trick that hinges on exploiting the mathematical quirks of single-member, winner-take-all districts. For example, in a system where every district has an isolated winner-take-all race, even if one party gets 49% of the vote across the country, that does not mean that it will end up having 49% of the representation in Congress. In fact, if each district is a perfect microcosm of society with 49% of voters supporting this party, it could actually end up with zero seats in congress, despite representing roughly half the population.\n\nIn short, single-member, winner-take-all districts have the potential to massively inflate or deflate a party’s overall electoral showing, depending on how the voters are distributed among the districts. And if the party in power gets to redraw the districts, they can easily rig the game. Knowing full well the consequences, the US supreme court blessed this approach during Trump’s first term, and now at a time when Republicans have a clear advantage in controlling redistricting, the justices are poised to make it even easier. Within this context, Trump is pushing Republican-governed states to capitalize.\n\nSignificantly, Chávez’s early efforts to consolidate power used a similar mechanism. Though under-appreciated now, Venezuela’s earlier election system under its 1961 constitution actually included a clause guaranteeing minority representation, and officials developed a clever method to allocate seats roughly proportional to a party’s overall support. This made gerrymandering impossible, limiting the ability of the ruling party to press their advantage by further manipulating districts. In 1999, however, Chávez’s constitutional assembly eliminated this system, changing the rules so that most congressional seats would instead come from winner-take-all districts. The effect – at least in the short term while Chávez consolidated power – was to considerably inflate his party’s congressional representation.\n\nAlong with expanding executive power and manipulating congressional elections, a third commonality – repression of political opponents – needs little explanation. Even before Maduro apparently resorted to overt election fraud, the Chávez government faced accusations of intimidating judges and arresting opposition candidates. Vocal critics of the government have also reported heavy-handed tactics from formal military and paramilitary forces alike.\n\nAs we now watch Trump deploy troops in Democratic-led cities across the country; turn federal agencies such as Ice and into personal secret police who operate with impunity; and push to systematically arrest political opponents, the parallels are obvious.\n\nUltimately, while there is every reason to believe that Venezuela is in crisis, there is no reason to believe that Trump’s military aggression will have any benefit for the people of either country. The bottom line: the Trump administration has demonstrated time and time again that it has no qualms about wreaking havoc on Venezuelan civilians – nor on its own. Trump’s abuses of power at home and in the Caribbean are two sides of the same coin. We must condemn both.\n\n Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar College","summary":"The US president’s efforts to consolidate power are strikingly similar to historical authoritarian moves in Caracas\n\nHere in the Americas, we have a peculiar tradition.

But the hidden plot twist would make anyone paying attention do a double-take: “The share of subprime auto loans that were 60 days or more past due reached a high of nearly 6.5 percent in January and has lingered near that level, according to Fitch Ratings.”\n\nHmm, who was president for most of January? Because it certainly wasn’t Trump. Ember never mentions Biden at all — of course —and proceeded to keep her story devoid of the necessary context:\n\n[T]he weakness in the auto market is one of the clearest indications that low- and middle-income families — the economy’s foundation — could be starting to buckle. Because many Americans need their cars to get around, auto loan delinquencies can be a telling gauge of financial hardship.\n\nBut this has been an inflationary problem that long preceded Trump’s administration. NewsNation reported in March that “Americans owed a record $1.66 trillion in auto loan debt at the end of 2024, up 20% since 2020.” In 2023, the Institute for Energy Research estimated that “the average new car loan now has a monthly payment of over $750, with an interest rate of 9.5 percent. For used cars, the average car interest rate is 13.7 percent” in Biden’s America.\n\nIn fact, the IER directly attributed the phenomenon to Biden's climate change-obsessed regulatory crackdowns: \"As Biden continues with his net zero carbon policies, his regulatory costs are skyrocketing and prices reflect that.\" \n\nReaders wouldn’t know until the 23rd paragraph of Ember’s piece that “newer auto loans appear to be performing better than loans that originated in 2022 and 2023. That could be because lenders have tightened their loan requirements, preventing low-credit-score borrowers from securing risky loans so freely.” See what’s going on here?\n\nIt shouldn’t surprise anybody that The Times is attempting to cover up the mess that Bidenomics created over the past four years, given that it endorsed both Biden and his lefty former heir apparent Vice President Kamala Harris. But it’s an even bigger slap to the face when everybody and their mother knows where a major economic problem originated from and the supposed newspaper of record tries to pretend it doesn’t exist.","summary":"The New York Times came out with a story on rising car payment delinquencies that at first glance would make readers think it was President Donald Trump’s fault.

While Harris was repping Tamil Nadu, JD Vance was obviously the Andhra candidate with a Telugu wife.Levity aside, many commentators saw this as a sign of how far the Indian community — once reduced to Apu jokes or stereotypical bit parts in Bollywood movies — had come to being front and centre in American politics. Vivek Ramaswamy was a presidential contender, as was former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.During the election, fewer Indian-Americans voted for Harris than they did for Democratic candidates like Biden, Clinton, or Obama. Even after the election, it appeared Indians were everywhere and integral to the Republican machine. Tulsi Gabbard, an honorary Indian, was now Director of National Intelligence. Sriram Krishnan was advising Trump on AI. Kash Patel was the FBI chief. But all of it appeared to be just veneer, and the contempt for the community continued unabated — as evident during the MAGA Civil War, when the faithful attacked H-1B visa holders (mostly Indian-Americans) for Americans losing their jobs.window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}});But it went far beyond social media outrage — and the hate has gone offline as well.The Chat That Tore the Veneer OffIn October 2025, Politico published over 2,900 pages of leaked Telegram chat logs from the Young Republican National Federation — the so-called “farm team” of the GOP, home to the party’s next generation of strategists, staffers, and would-be senators.The content was revolting. Members joked about Hitler (“I love Hitler”), fantasised about gassing opponents, called the mass rape of Indigenous women “epic,” and cheered for slavery. Black people were “watermelon people.” Jews were “sneaky.” Asians were “ch–ks.” Women were raped and laughed about. The “n-word” appeared in dozens of variations.This wasn’t an anonymous 4chan sewer or a forgotten Discord channel. It was a closed group of politically ambitious Republicans — state chairs, campaign aides, legislative staffers — including a sitting Vermont senator, Samuel Douglass. They knew full well that exposure would destroy them. One even warned: “If we ever had a leak of this chat, we would be cooked fr fr.” And yet they “kept typing away” anyway.“She Just Didn’t Bathe Often”Amid the torrent of hatred, one particular exchange stood out for its precision — not because it was more vile than the rest, but because it revealed something deeper about how Indian-Americans are seen inside the Republican base.“He dated this very obese Indian woman for a period of time.” The comment came from Bobby Walker, vice chair of the New York Young Republicans. It wasn’t about ideology or policy. It was simply an ethnic insult masquerading as gossip.Peter Giunta, the group’s chair, interjected to clarify that the woman “was not Indian.” To which Samuel Douglass — a sitting state senator — delivered the punchline: “She just didn’t bathe often.”The joke was as old as colonial racism itself. Indians, reduced to a smell. Brownness, conflated with filth. It wasn’t even about the woman — an acquaintance with no public role — but about the idea of Indianness as inherently dirty.No one objected. No one cautioned restraint. The remark passed as acceptable humour in a space where Black people were animals, Jews were dishonest, and immigrants were parasites.This was the Republican Party’s next generation — and for them, Indians were still a punchline.The Deeper Truth: Inclusion Without AcceptanceThat throwaway “bathing” joke is more revealing than it appears. It punctures the illusion that representation equals respect. Indian-Americans may have made it to the highest rungs of Republican politics — but they haven’t made it inside the room.On the surface, the GOP is awash with brown faces. Vivek Ramaswamy isn’t just tolerated; he’s celebrated as the embodiment of meritocratic immigration. Kash Patel isn’t merely accepted; he’s tasked with dismantling the deep state. Sriram Krishnan is entrusted with shaping the administration’s AI policy.Yet beneath the photo-ops and appointments, contempt simmers. Because to many in the MAGA base, the Indian ascent is tolerated, not welcomed — conditional, not complete. They are useful, but not “us.”The same community that cheers Patel’s crackdown on fentanyl traffickers or Gabbard’s hawkish foreign policy still rails against H-1B visa holders for “stealing jobs.” The same base that retweets Ramaswamy’s tirades against “wokeism” also complains that Indian CEOs “control too much of Silicon Valley.”This is not hypocrisy. It’s hierarchy. You can rise within the machine — but you must know your place inside it.Resentment in the RanksThe deeper resentment stems from a familiar cultural anxiety. Indian-Americans today are where Jewish-Americans were a century ago: disproportionately successful, highly networked, overrepresented in elite institutions — and therefore, inevitably, resented.The numbers speak for themselves. Over 75% of Indian-Americans hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. Their median household income is nearly double the national average. They run Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM. They lead Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.It is precisely this success that provokes discomfort among those who see themselves as the rightful heirs of American power. The MAGA movement is rooted in a story about decline — a belief that “real” Americans have been displaced by immigrants, globalists, and elites. And Indian-Americans, with their Ivy League degrees and trillion-dollar companies, are the most visible avatars of that displacement.So when jobs disappear, it’s not automation or corporate greed that gets blamed — it’s the Indian engineer on an H-1B visa. When housing prices rise, it’s not Wall Street’s speculation — it’s the “IT guy from Hyderabad” buying in the suburbs. In this narrative, every success story is an insult. Every achievement is a provocation.The Politics of TransgressionThat resentment is what makes the Young Republicans’ chat so instructive. Their use of slurs was not random. It was ritual. It wasn’t just hatred; it was hierarchy, rehearsed and reinforced.The “bathing” joke wasn’t about one woman. It was a way to reassert the idea that no matter how successful Indians become, they remain “other” — a people to be mocked, not respected.The mechanics of it are familiar. A private group provides plausible deniability. Offensive jokes become acts of rebellion against “political correctness.” Each insult is a loyalty test — laugh or be cast out. And ambiguity offers an escape hatch: we didn’t mean it, we were just joking.This is the “strategic ambiguity” Katherine Dee calls the defining feature of online extremism. When every hateful remark can be dismissed as irony, the boundary between belief and performance collapses. What begins as trolling often hardens into ideology. And even when it doesn’t, the effect is the same: it normalises prejudice.Digital Poison, Real-World ConsequencesThe internet accelerates this process. Behind a screen, the usual brakes — shame, empathy, accountability — fail. Typing a slur is easier than saying one aloud. Sharing a meme requires no courage.But words typed in darkness rarely stay there. Memes travel. Jokes metastasise into narratives. And when they are repeated often enough, they reshape what people believe to be normal.The Young Republicans thought their chat was a safe space. They were wrong. And when Politico made it public, the consequences were swift. Careers ended. State chapters disbanded. Even national leaders condemned the rhetoric as “vile.”Yet even then, the minimisers emerged. Vice President JD Vance dismissed the messages as “stupid jokes” from “kids.” Others warned against “joining the left’s pile-on.” The instinct to protect one’s own — even when “one’s own” jokes about gas chambers — remains powerful.This reflex matters because it tells the next generation that they can say the same things and survive. It ensures that the contempt behind the “bathing” joke will not be confined to one Telegram thread. It will seep into campaign offices, congressional hearings, and White House policy debates — unless it is stopped.The New Jews — and the Old BigotryIn many ways, Indian-Americans have become what Jewish-Americans once were: a community that thrives despite suspicion, excels despite resentment, and is mocked precisely because it succeeds.They are the “new Jews” of America’s cultural imagination — indispensable yet resented, celebrated yet stereotyped. Their children dominate spelling bees, but their names are punchlines. They run trillion-dollar companies, but their hygiene is fair game.The tragedy — and perhaps the irony — is that many Indian-Americans still believe that political proximity will insulate them from prejudice. That serving as FBI director or Surgeon General will erase centuries of racial contempt. The Young Republicans’ chat is a brutal reminder that proximity does not equal acceptance.Representation is not the same as respect. And power does not always protect you from ridicule.A Lesson for Both SidesThere is a temptation to dismiss the “obese Indian woman” remark as juvenile stupidity — the digital equivalent of a high school locker-room taunt. That would be a mistake. Because it is precisely in these private, “joking” spaces that public prejudice is born.The Republican Party is not uniquely guilty of this — but it is uniquely vulnerable to it. A movement that defines itself in opposition to “wokeism” will always flirt with transgression for transgression’s sake. And as the Telegram chats show, transgression has a way of metastasising into hate.For Indian-Americans, the lesson is harsher still. The arc of their story — from Apu jokes to the FBI director’s office — is extraordinary. But their success has not bought them immunity. They remain, in the eyes of many in the movement they now help lead, outsiders. And as long as that is true, every triumph will come with an asterisk.Final ThoughtsThe leaked chats of the Young Republican National Federation should not be read as an aberration. They are a mirror — a brutally honest one — reflecting the gap between the GOP’s public embrace of Indian talent and its private disdain for Indian identity.It is possible for a party to elevate Usha Vance to the role of Second Lady and still sneer at an “obese Indian woman” in a private conversation. It is possible to praise merit-based immigration in public and mock H-1B visa holders online. And it is possible to rely on Indian-American billionaires for campaign donations while laughing at their supposed smell behind closed doors.That is the paradox of Indian power in America today: unprecedented in scope, yet fragile in acceptance. And until that changes, the real test of belonging will not be in the cabinet appointments or campaign rallies — it will be in the private spaces where jokes are made and no one dares to object.","summary":"​During the election, fewer Indian-Americans voted for Harris than they did for Democratic candidates like Biden, Clinton, or Obama.

This milestone marks a significant moment in his health journey, as Biden faced an aggressive form of prostate cancer diagnosed in May, just months after his presidency concluded and Donald Trump assumed office.\n\nThe news came to light through Ashley Biden’s Instagram post, where she honored her father’s resilience and the medical team’s dedication. Her heartfelt message accompanied a series of touching images and a video capturing the triumphant moment when Biden rang the bell to signify the end of his treatment.\n\n“Ringing the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine,” Ashley Biden expressed in her post, showcasing her gratitude for the care and support her father received. She praised her father’s courage during the challenging period, stating, “Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment.”\n\nThe Instagram post also included images depicting Biden’s journey, including moments with his healthcare team and cherished family gatherings, painting a picture of support and determination throughout his battle with cancer.\n\n‘We are so grateful! Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment.’\n\nShe shared several other pictures, one of Biden together with his doctor, and another of him posing alongside his family.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden told ABC it was unclear if he would require any further treatment. \n\nAfter her series of touching posts dedicated toward her father, she pivoted to share a picture of demolitions underway at the White House for Trump’s new ballroom.\n\n‘He literally destroys everything GOOD,’ she wrote. \n\nBiden left office in January, six months after he dropped his bid for reelection following a disastrous debate against Trump amid concerns about his age, health and mental acuity. \n\nHe was replaced by his Vice President Kamala Harris, who went on to resoundingly lose both the electoral college and popular vote.\n\nIn May, Biden’s post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bones. \n\nThe discovery came after he reported urinary symptoms.\n\nAt the time, many questioned whether Biden had been running the country while facing cancer, continuing the questioning throughout his term about what the public knew of the president’s decline.\n\nLeading oncologist and former Biden COVID advisor Dr. Zeke Emanuel told Morning Joe in May that Biden ‘did not develop [prostate cancer] in the last, 100, 200 days.’ \n\n‘He had it while he was president,’ Emanuel insisted. \n\n‘He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021. Yes, I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.’\n\nProstate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score.\n\nThe scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. \n\nBiden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nEmanuel questioned how such and advanced form of the disease had gone under the radar until now and spread to the former president’s bones. \n\n‘He’s had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading,’ said the doctor, who was named to a 16-person COVID advisory board handpicked by Biden himself.\n\nBiden officials had outlined the severity of the diagnosis in their statement – something Emanuel pointed to as a sign that Biden’s condition has been swept under the rug.\n\n‘I looked back at the records and there’s no evidence that when he got his health status and the medical records were released, that he had a prostate specific antigen,’ he said. ‘Now, it is true that a lot of people recommend not doing a prostate-specific antigen after 70.\n\n‘But President Biden’s been in public life a very long time,’ Emanuel argued, as theories continue to swirl regarding the timing of the diagnosis.\n\n‘He was Vice President and had a lot of exams under 70. So it’s a little surprising that they didn’t do it. \n\n‘And maybe President Biden decided he didn’t want the test. Many men do decide they don’t want [it], but this is also aggressive.’\n\nHe and others continue to question the timing of Biden’s diagnosis, as prostate cancer is a disease that, while deadly, often progresses slowly and is often detectable early on through PSA blood tests mentioned by Emanuel.\n\nCases as advanced as Biden’s usually come with warning signs aside from rising PSA levels, such as urinary symptoms and bone pain.\n\nAs Emanuel mentioned, presidents generally undergo routine and thorough annual physicals, which would typically include PSA testing.\n\nDoctors declared Biden ‘fit to serve’ as recently as February of last year, meaning, if he did undergo the PSA test at the time, the late state metastatic cancer made most of its progress within 15 months.\n\nTheories that Biden and his team knew about the disease and chose to delay public disclosure remain unfounded. \n\nOfficials, in their statement, said the diagnosis came a week after the discovery of the small nodule on Biden’s prostate.\n\nIt also mentions ‘increasing urinary symptoms’ from the former president that occurred before the discovery, which was made public days after the Democrat appeared on The View.\n\nLast month, Biden had surgery to remove skin cancer lesions from his forehead.\n\nHe is also working on his memoir for his time in office, which he reportedly sold to Hachette Book Group for around $10million back in July.\n\nHe said at an event earlier that month that he was ‘working my tail off’ to get the memoir finished, indicating it would primarily focus on his four years in office.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a heartfelt tribute, Joe Biden&#8217;s daughter announced that the former president&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: President Biden Successfully Concludes Radiation Treatment for Cancer first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/president-biden-successfully-concludes-radiation-treatment-for-cancer/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Biden-completes-round-of-radiation-therapy-for-cancer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 12:45:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.053},{"id":371226544,"title":"No Kings is the Seinfeld of protests: A show about nothing","text":"NO KINGS IS NOT ‘WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE’ IN THE FOUNDERS’ REPUBLICNew York Times: Republicans Know How Vulnerable Trump Is. The Attacks on No Kings Prove It.\n\nPolitico: ‘No Kings’ protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwide\n\nGee, it’s as if legacy media is taking a side here. Sarcasm aside, these protests, while large in scale, were attended by mostly older people who likely were also part of the Vietnam protests yearning for the past, but also something to feel morally superior about today. \n\nIn this case, the cause is “saving democracy.” Or something. And these folks could not be any more hypocritical.\n\nBack in 2024, Democrats were also screeching about “saving democracy” from Donald Trump, only to oust a sitting president from the nomination and install Kamala Harris without one single vote from the public, Soviet-style. Democrats cheered the lawfare and weaponization of the justice system in an effort to take down Trump before the election. They also supported taking him off state ballots in places such as Maine and Colorado. And when Trump was banned from most social media, they argued that censorship of conservatives was necessary to save the republic.\n\nThis is also the same group that overwhelmingly supports stacking the Supreme Court with liberal justices, adding two states, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and abolishing the Electoral College, defying the Founding Fathers’ desire to strike a balance between large and small states. They believed in forcing people to take the COVID-19 vaccine — so much for “my body, my choice” — and masking children as young as two years old who were never at risk. \n\nIn other words, to “save democracy,” the most essential parts of the Constitution need to be blown up in the name of one-party rule. Makes total sense.\n\nAnd here’s why these protests don’t mean anything in the end: No Kings will not convert almost any Trump supporters to the other side. In fact, almost all moderates will be pushed further away from the far-left wing of the party. They don’t like the prospect of a Mayor Zorhan Mamdani, an antisemite and socialist, in New York. They don’t like the embrace of a murder-fantasizing maniac like Jay Jones, who is looking to become the next Attorney General of Virginia, which Democrats refuse to call on to drop out of the race. And moderates certainly do not like calling Trump and his supporters fascists and Nazis.\n\nThis may explain why the party is not happy with its only common-sense senator, John Fetterman (D-PA).\n\n“I grew up in a conservative part of Pennsylvania. And I grew up, I knew, and I loved people that voted for President Trump,” he recently noted. “But they are not fascists. They’re not Nazis. They’re not trying to destroy the Constitution and those things.”\n\nOne day after making this pragmatic comment, Axios reported that Democrats have turned Democrats on him over his softened approach to President Donald Trump and are courting candidates to primary him in his next Senate reelection effort in 2028.\n\nThe party has learned nothing after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, instead opting to continue the fascist/Nazi rhetoric, which has resulted in some protesters openly cheering Kirk’s death and even mocking it.\n\n“Charlie Kirk is a piece of garbage,” one female protester told The Daily Signal in D.C. on Saturday. “Hitler is dead. I’m glad Hitler’s dead. Evil people have no place in my world. He was a hateful human being. It was disgusting the things he said and did.”\n\nAnd what was disgusting was that a Chicago elementary school teacher, Lucy Martinez, simulated Kirk getting shot in the neck in a video that has now been viewed millions of times. \n\n“Let’s go to when he [Trump] shoots himself in the bunker,” read another No Kings sign in reference to Hitler taking his own life as Allied troops were closing in on his bunker in Berlin at the end of World War II. “You gotta grab a gun, we gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system. These ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out. The same machinery that’s on full display right there has to get wiped out,” shouted an unidentified speaker at a No Kings rally in Chicago. \n\nAnd in Portland, one woman shared that she hoped to see “the obituary that we’re all waiting for tomorrow,” and confirmed to a reporter she was speaking about Trump. \n\nSo what were these protests really about? What was the goal? That’s about as clear as mud, because the whole theme of No Kings, as if we live in a country ruled by one, makes zero sense. \n\nTrump was duly elected. In the Electoral College, it wasn’t even close over Kamala Harris (312-226). He won the popular vote as well. He can’t run for a third term. And if Trump were actually a king, protests would not be permitted. \n\nWe’re hearing that these protests will hurt Trump, but his numbers keep going up during a government shutdown that Democrats are responsible for. The RealClearPolitics average of polls has him at 45.4% approval, which is higher than Obama’s at this stage of his second term (43.7%) and George W. Bush’s (39.7%). Compare that with the Democratic Party, which stands at just 34.7% approval. \n\nPopular podcaster host Joe Rogan, a former supporter of Bernie Sanders, summed up the makeup of the people who attended No Kings protests. \n\n“All those people that are protesting on the streets, 99% of them are losers,” Rogan said. “The other ones work for the Fed. It’s FBI agents and losers, it’s all it is. The whole f***ing protest is FBI agents and losers.”\n\nPresident Trump echoed Rogan on Air Force One on Sunday night. \n\n“I’m not a king. I work my ass off to make our country great. That’s all it is. I’m not a king at all,” Trump told reporters. “I looked at the people — they’re not representative of this country.” \n\nNo Kings held its first protest in June. Lots of hype, lots of analysis saying it was a turning point in the resistance against Trump. We’re hearing the same thing about the protests this past weekend. \n\nBut here we are, just a few days later, and they’re already forgotten. The Democratic Party still is a rudderless ship with no important issue they can rally around and explain why. \n\nResisting Trump probably felt good for No Kings attendees. Maybe they feel like they’re making a difference, just as they did in the sixties when opposing Vietnam. \n\nNO KINGS IS THE DUMBEST PROTEST IN THE TRUMP ERA\n\nThe difference now, of course, is that speaking out against a pointless war had teeth. “No Kings” simply has a silly slogan fueled by blind hatred for a duly elected president. \n\nThe Seinfeld of protests … a show about nothing.","summary":"The headlines of the past weekend’s “No Kings” protests made the gatherings sound like the 2025 version of the 1969 Vietnam protest at the National Mall.&#160; MSNBC:&#160;‘No Kings’ isn’t just a slogan.

Never had I considered leaving the party until now.”\n\nShe wrote that she began to consider becoming an independent after witnessing the Democratic Party unleashing a “firing squad” on Biden after a disastrous TV debate against Donald Trump.\n\n“Now the cloud of unease hovering over me solidified into an idea about how I could possibly do something different. How I could channel my disappointment into some kind of concrete action that would allow me to fight for what I believed in without giving blind loyalty to a party I felt no longer deserved it,” she continued.\n\n“‘You know what?

Here’s how we can fix that","text":"This weekend, an estimated 7.1 million people took to the streets across the country as part of the “No Kings” protests. From big cities like New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, to small towns such as Guntersville, Alabama, Vergennes, Vermont, and Lander, Wyoming, protesters turned out to peacefully oppose President Donald Trump’s despotic policies and behavior. But as powerful and moving as the marches were, they are not enough to create the lasting change our political system so desperately needs. \n\nAnd make no mistake: America needs major change.\n\nYou would not have known that had you listened to retired Judge J. Michael Luttig, who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and is a leading critic of the Trump administration, on Oct. 16 when he spoke on the campus where I teach about his deep reverence for the Constitution. While admirable, his veneration also appears to have blinded him — along with others who share his deference — to the stark fact that preserving our founding document requires acknowledging the ways that it has failed to meet the moment. No amount of glorification will save the Constitution unless we address the underlying causes of what Yale Law School professor Jack Balkin calls “constitutional rot.”\n\nPut simply, our Constitution was not designed to facilitate action to improve the lives of the American people. Instead, it was designed to make it hard for democratic majorities to work their will and use the government to engage in social reform projects that might infringe on property rights. This is hardly an original, earth-shattering insight. But it is important to remember as we seek to build broad-based opposition to the Trump administration.\n\nMore than a century ago, the historian Charles Beard told the story of a Constitutional Convention dominated by an “elite” group determined to protect its property and economic standing. The document they produced was, Beard argued, “essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental private rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities.”\n\nDespite such barriers, the country has occasionally managed to enact modest adjustments in how wealth is distributed. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s and President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society of the 1960s are two examples.\n\nBut in the decades since, the country reverted to form. Democrats and Republicans alike became more interested in wealth generation than in addressing an ever-widening wealth gap. While Trump has hardly dedicated himself to shifting gears, he has twice managed to convince voters that he will fulfill their desire to shake things up. The result is that, today, trying to mobilize sustained, inclusive opposition to Trump and his agenda by framing him as a threat to the Constitution and the rule of law has less traction than people like Luttig might think. Survey after survey has shown that “[u]pwards of 85% of respondents say there is a need for major changes” in our political system.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThis desire for change cuts across partisan lines. Former Vice President Kamala Harris based her 2024 presidential campaign on convincing Americans that Trump was a danger to a political order to which large numbers of Americans are no longer deeply attached.\n\nYou don’t have to be a devotee of Bernie Sanders or New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Madami to recognize that fact. And don’t be fooled: While millions of Americans turned out on No Kings Day, the number that came from the working class was less than it would have to be to force change in Washington, D.C. \n\nDid the millions of Americans who did not show up see their concerns about the economy embraced by protesters waving Palestinian flags or protesting in inflatable animal costumes? I doubt it.\n\nDon’t mistake what I am saying. No Kings was an important rallying point for those of us who want to stand up for democracy and the rule of law. But being anti-Trump is not enough. \n\nWe cannot succeed in saving our political system by being reactive — by talking only about Trump’s abuses. Success depends on convincing people that opposing tyranny is just the first step in a program dedicated to changing the fact that some of us live too well while many others cannot live well at all. That point was driven home by a front-page story in Sunday’s New York Times that opened with a scene set in a Chicago food bank line. \n\nThe 39-year-old Moreno had waited for two hours in “a line of people behind him that snaked around the corner.” He described the Pilsen Food Pantry as “‘a lifeline for me…Our food budget doesn’t stretch as far as it used to.’”\n\nThe story continued with a revealing juxtaposition: “A few miles away on Chicago’s glitzy Magnificent Mile, luxury hotels are bustling. Jewelry stores and designer boutiques do brisk business. The restaurants are packed with diners sipping $20 cocktails while they wait for tables.”\n\nThe Times invited readers to look behind surging stock prices and macroeconomic data to see the day-to-day struggles of people like Moreno set against the indulgent lifestyles of people with whom they may share a city, but who live in entirely different worlds.\n\nLong ago, political scientists who studied democracy and the rule of law warned that neither could be built or endure in places with radically and persistently unequal distributions of wealth. Writing in the afterglow of the New Deal, they were optimistic about the future of America‘s Constitutional Republic. \n\nToday, that optimism has faded. Though they offer different solutions, the populism of both the left and the right is responding to the erosion of the social and economic prerequisites for democracy and the rule of law in this country. \n\nIn the next No Kings protests, let’s make sure the Ulysses Morenos of America know that we hear and share their concerns — and that we are demanding action.

A monarch would have attempted to disperse the crowds or put important meeting sites off-limits. A monarch would not have gone about conducting the business of state while people dressed in goofy costumes banged drums and hurled vile insults at his head. A monarch… would not have been elected by a majority of the nation. The crowd size should impress no one. The protests were driven by labor unions like the American Federation of Teachers, which claims almost 3 million members and the AFL-CIO, which claims 15 million. NATIONWIDE ‘NO KINGS’ PROTESTS TARGET TRUMP AS CROWDS RALLY IN CITIES FROM COAST TO COAST Fair-minded Americans should wonder what exactly are the Trump White House policies that have people so riled up? Are Americans angry that President Donald Trump has taken on the drug cartels which have flooded our nation with fentanyl and other deadly substances that have killed hundreds of thousands of our young people? Are Americans protesting the securing of our southern border, no longer allowing millions of undocumented people to illegally crowd our cities’ schools and hospital emergency rooms? Do voters oppose shrinking the size of our federal bureaucracy, attempting to bring the outlandish spending engineered by President Joe Biden under control? Is it Trump’s efforts to turn our education establishment on its head, demanding better performance for the Black and brown kids who are not being taught to read? And what about crime? Are most Americans unhappy that the president is trying to bring our dangerous cities, like Chicago, under control? ‘IT’S A JOKE’: WHITE HOUSE DISMISSES 'NO KINGS' PROTESTS, WHILE NANCY PELOSI RIPS CROWN IN DEFIANCE The answer to all these questions is no. Polling shows most Americans agree with the tough policies that President Trump has adopted on crime, immigration and trimming the federal government. Most of the country, in addition, is thrilled that the Trump White House has negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, however fragile, and brought the hostages home. It is hard to find anyone who was unhappy that the president commanded the destruction of Iran’s nuclear weapons. And Trump’s efforts to bring manufacturing back to the United States have brought him acclaim from labor unions who stand to benefit from those changes. Surely most voters back a production renaissance in our country. 'NO KINGS' AGITATORS RECORDED HAVING CHILDREN BASH TRUMP PIÑATA What has really riled Democrats is that we have a president willing, even eager, to expose the pervasive corruption and dishonesty of their party. President Trump, along with Elon Musk, revealed the complex of tax-payer supported NGOs that support Democrat candidates and causes; NGOs, described by Musk as \"fake charities,\" funded by the very billionaires whom Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rails against. Billionaires like those who supposedly threw millions of dollars into promoting the No Kings rallies, like The Arabella Network, the Soros network, the Tides Foundation and many others. The Trump White House is also delving into the swamp, disclosing the political origins of the Russiagate hoax, the efforts of the Biden administration and media pals to censor the opposition, and Biden’s diversion of government spending to favored left-wing allies. Biden assigned long-time Clinton apparatchik John Podesta to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was meant to fund climate initiatives. Trump’s EPA head Lee Zeldin exposed the \"Biden Administration’s scheme to quickly park $20 billion outside the agency…we suspected that some organizations were created out of thin air just to take advantage of this.\" Yes, like a group affiliated with left-wing political activist and serial election loser Stacey Abrams. Democrats are also angry that President Trump won reelection in spite of an all-out legal assault meant to make him unelectable. They are also angry that, in spite of Vice President Kamala Harris enjoying a war chest of well over a billion dollars, Democrats were not only denied the Oval Office but also both houses of Congress. It is an election outcome that has allowed the GOP to investigate the malfeasance of people like former FBI Director James Comey, who was up to his neck in the Russiagate affair. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Democrat leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are furious that their party is on the ropes, increasingly directed by far-left candidates who do not reflect America’s values. They know that Trump currently occupies the middle of the policy spectrum. He is winning on issues like opposing transgender people competing in women’s sports and on banning DEI, which is unpopular. In Michigan, local No Kings organizers claimed they were objecting to sending immigration agents into cities, pushing for the redrawing of congressional maps to favor Republicans and \"gutting health care.\" To be sure, the aggressive rounding up of people in the country illegally is controversial. But, sending National Guard to protect federal property and law enforcement officials should not be. Meanwhile, the only thing new about the redistricting battles is that the GOP has wised up and is finally countering long-time gerrymandering by Democrats. As far as \"gutting health care,\" that is an issue before Congress, not the Trump White House. Some question the legality of Trump’s attacks on alleged drug runners from Venezuela, or to impose tariffs on our trading partners. His critics should be calmed by the intervention of the judiciary. Most of us have lost track of the number of lawsuits wending their way to the Supreme Court. It’s not very king-like to have to answer to judges.

Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses and staff at Penn Medicine,' she wrote alongside a video of Biden celebrating.\n\n'We are so grateful! Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment.'\n\nShe shared several other pictures, one of Biden together with his doctor, and another of him posing alongside his family.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden told ABC it was unclear if he would require any further treatment. \n\nAfter her series of touching posts dedicated toward her father, she pivoted to share a picture of demolitions underway at the White House for Trump's new ballroom.\n\n'He literally destroys everything GOOD,' she wrote. \n\nBiden left office in January, six months after he dropped his bid for reelection following a disastrous debate against Trump amid concerns about his age, health and mental acuity. \n\nHe was replaced by his Vice President Kamala Harris, who went on to resoundingly lose both the electoral college and popular vote.\n\nIn May, Biden’s post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bones. \n\nThe discovery came after he reported urinary symptoms.\n\nAt the time, many questioned whether Biden had been running the country while facing cancer, continuing the questioning throughout his term about what the public knew of the president's decline.\n\nLeading oncologist and former Biden COVID advisor Dr. Zeke Emanuel told Morning Joe in May that Biden 'did not develop [prostate cancer] in the last, 100, 200 days.' \n\n'He had it while he was president,' Emanuel insisted. \n\n'He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.'\n\nProstate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score.\n\nThe scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. \n\nBiden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nEmanuel questioned how such and advanced form of the disease had gone under the radar until now and spread to the former president's bones. \n\n'He's had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading,' said the doctor, who was named to a 16-person COVID advisory board handpicked by Biden himself.\n\nBiden officials had outlined the severity of the diagnosis in their statement - something Emanuel pointed to as a sign that Biden's condition has been swept under the rug.\n\n'I looked back at the records and there's no evidence that when he got his health status and the medical records were released, that he had a prostate specific antigen,' he said. 'Now, it is true that a lot of people recommend not doing a prostate-specific antigen after 70.\n\n'But President Biden’s been in public life a very long time,' Emanuel argued, as theories continue to swirl regarding the timing of the diagnosis.\n\n'He was Vice President and had a lot of exams under 70. So it's a little surprising that they didn’t do it. \n\n'And maybe President Biden decided he didn't want the test. Many men do decide they don't want [it], but this is also aggressive.'\n\nHe and others continue to question the timing of Biden's diagnosis, as prostate cancer is a disease that, while deadly, often progresses slowly and is often detectable early on through PSA blood tests mentioned by Emanuel.\n\nCases as advanced as Biden's usually come with warning signs aside from rising PSA levels, such as urinary symptoms and bone pain.\n\nAs Emanuel mentioned, presidents generally undergo routine and thorough annual physicals, which would typically include PSA testing.\n\nDoctors declared Biden 'fit to serve' as recently as February of last year, meaning, if he did undergo the PSA test at the time, the late state metastatic cancer made most of its progress within 15 months.\n\nTheories that Biden and his team knew about the disease and chose to delay public disclosure remain unfounded. \n\nOfficials, in their statement, said the diagnosis came a week after the discovery of the small nodule on Biden's prostate.\n\nIt also mentions 'increasing urinary symptoms' from the former president that occurred before the discovery, which was made public days after the Democrat appeared on The View.\n\nLast month, Biden had surgery to remove skin cancer lesions from his forehead.\n\nHe is also working on his memoir for his time in office, which he reportedly sold to Hachette Book Group for around $10million back in July.\n\nHe said at an event earlier that month that he was 'working my tail off' to get the memoir finished, indicating it would primarily focus on his four years in office.","summary":"The 82-year-old was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer in May, months after he left office and was replaced by Donald Trump .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15211281/biden-radiation-prostate-cancer-treatment.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/21/03/103162137-0-image-m-70_1761014907785.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/19/2335990081413298591/1024x576_MP4_2335990081413298591.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-21 07:07:04","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor,Stephen M.

Jean-Pierre’s remarks take a direct stance against assertions made in Jake Tapper’s book “Original Sin.”\n\nAn advance copy of Jean-Pierre’s book, titled “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,” was reviewed by the Daily Mail. In it, she explains her reasons for stepping away from the Democratic Party while maintaining her steadfast loyalty to Biden.\n\nJean-Pierre attributes Biden’s performance during the challenging June 2024 debate with former President Donald Trump to a simple cold, countering any insinuations of cognitive issues. She recalls that CNN’s Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson accused Biden of hiding mental health concerns and claimed his aides suppressed these worries.\n\n“Being a part of the president’s inner circle, I interacted with Biden daily and witnessed no such decline,” Jean-Pierre asserts in her book. “I haven’t read Tapper’s book and have no intention to, as it contradicts my firsthand experiences in the White House.”\n\nReflecting on her tenure, Jean-Pierre describes the formidable task of addressing the White House press corps following the debate, an experience she vividly recounts in her memoir.\n\nShe recalled how daunting it was to face the White House press corps in the aftermath of the debate. \n\n‘On and on it went,’ she recalled. ‘What cold medications was Biden taking before the debate? Did a doctor give him a neurological scan afterward? Did he have dementia?’ \n\nJean-Pierre expressed that she felt the questions from the press were unfair. \n\n‘Were they asking the same questions about Trump?’ she mused. \n\n‘During the campaign, Trump would froth at the mouth for hours on end, bringing up the fictitious movie villain Hannibal Lecter and at one appearance making obscene gestures with a microphone. But no reporter asked to speak to his doctor,’ she later added.\n\nShe also slammed the conspiracy theories that were prompted by the announcement after Biden left office that he had prostate cancer.\n\nJean-Pierre recalled how former Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat who had challenged Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary, had said that Biden timed the cancer announcement to blunt the coming Tapper and Thompson book. \n\nShe claimed that even cancer wouldn’t have slowed the 82-year-old president down. \n\n‘Suffice to say, Biden’s cancer diagnosis, regardless of what he knew when, would not have been directly related to his alleged cognitive decline, nor would it have affected his ability to make competent decisions as a world leader,’ she wrote. \n\nJean-Pierre, who announced she was leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent in June, in conjunction with saying she was writing a book, wrote that she first flirted with the idea after seeing Biden get pushed out of the race. \n\nShe placed a lot of the blame on House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for leading the charge, but blasted the overall party for eating their own. \n\nOnce Vice President Kamala Harris took over the reins, Jean-Pierre said the party failed her, too. \n\n‘Somehow it was unable to help a trailblazing, extremely accomplished former prosecutor who wanted to uplift everyone in our society defeat Trump, a habitual liar and convicted felon who openly embraced the politics of cruelty,’ she wrote. \n\nHer disappointment in the Democrats also came from her own White House experience.\n\nShe said she was ‘exasperated with the shady way Democrats do business.’ \n\nIn the book, she recounted how an unnamed white female superior had orchestrated a campaign to push her out of the press secretary’s job. \n\nJean-Pierre didn’t respond to the Daily Mail’s request to name the individual.\n\nBut Jean-Pierre accused the woman of being a source for negative articles about her in the New York Times, Axios and the New York Post. \n\n‘This woman had once been supportive of me and my career, or so it had seemed. Now she was relentlessly smearing me behind my back,’ Jean-Pierre recalled. \n\n‘The main reason for the change in how she treated me, going from someone who backed my getting the press secretary job to basically strategizing for me to lose it, had to do with my independence,’ she surmised.\n\nShe recalled one episode when the female White House staffer pushed her not to travel with the president on a trip to Israel and Jordan directly following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack.\n\nSkipping the trip would be highly unusual for a White House press secretary, but the woman suggested that a ‘man who had experience in war-torn regions, could go in my place.’ \n\nDuring much of Jean-Pierre’s tenure, John Kirby, who served as the spokesperson for the National Security Council, held briefings too, as he was more fluent in international affairs. \n\nJean-Pierre didn’t say if Kirby was the man who was suggested to go in her stead. \n\nShe also floated that there was a racist element in this treatment. \n\n‘I wasn’t the only woman on the White House staff who had negative experiences with this person. She had spoken dismissively to female members of the administration, especially those who were also people of color,’ Jean-Pierre wrote. \n\n‘A white woman once said to me that it was uncomfortable being on emails with her and witnessing her tone and the way she addressed women of color,’ she added. \n\nAs of today, Jean-Pierre, now an independent, says the Democratic Party is still failing. \n\nShe recalled how ridiculous they looked trying to combat Trump when he gave his first address before a joint session of Congress in early March. \n\nJean-Pierre wrote, ‘as Trump figuratively shot himself in the foot, what did Democrats do?’\n\nJean-Pierre recounted how Rep. Al Green yelled at Trump and got ejected from the chamber, while a group of Democrats wearing ‘Resist’ T-shirts walked out. Others held up whiteboards saying ‘Save Medicare’ and ‘Protect Veterans.’\n\n‘The Dems couldn’t even unite around what color to wear to make a statement, with some female lawmakers wearing pink, while members of the Congressional Black Caucus donned black,’ she noted. \n\nDespite still being politically liberal, she said all of these experiences led to her decision to leave the Democratic Party. \n\n‘The party’s unwillingness to defend Biden, the chasm Democrats allowed to grow between them and everyday Americans, their inadequate messaging during and following the last presidential election, and the way the party takes Black women for granted has made my remaining an official part of that political coalition untenable,’ she said.\n\n Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines will be released Tuesday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn her newly released book, Karine Jean-Pierre, who served as the White&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Karine Jean-Pierre Critiques Jake Tapper&#8217;s Book on Biden, Dismisses Claims of Decline first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/karine-jean-pierre-critiques-jake-tappers-book-on-biden-dismisses-claims-of-decline/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exasperated-Karine-Jean-Pierre-rips-Jake-Tappers-Biden-takedown-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 04:00:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":371373580,"title":"Biden completes radiation therapy for aggressive prostate cancer","text":"Washington: Former President Joe Biden on Monday completed a round of radiation therapy treatment for the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office, a spokesperson said.\nBiden had been receiving treatment at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia, said aide Kelly Scully.\nThe 82-year-old Democrat left office in January, six months after he dropped his bid for re-election following a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump amid concerns about Biden's age, health and mental fitness.

Fox News’ Laura Ingraham asked Cabassa about his on-the-ground reporting over the weekend, noting how it seemed to be “the same people at the protests every single time.” (RELATED: ‘No Kings’ Protesters Can’t Name One Reason Why They’re Protesting Trump)\n\n“I think you’re right. … I’ve been covering the LA protests, going back all the way to the George Floyd protests and riots that happened out here. And I’ve been seeing a lot of the same usual suspects. It’s usually the Democratic Socialists of America, the Party of Socialism and Liberation,” Cabassa said. “And even this Saturday, I witnessed SEIU [Service Employees International Union], which I believe the largest union in the nation, if not the second largest, they had tents out there.”\n\n“They [SEIU] were recruiting people to the Party of Socialism and Liberation and the Democratic Socialists of America. So, I posted that on my socials that they were recruiting the youth, some of these new people coming out and wanting to, ‘resist fascism,’ saying that only socialism can defeat fascism,” Cabassa added. “So, I’m kind of interested to see what some of the union members of SEIU have to feel about the fact that their union due money is being used to recruit the youth and some of these protesters into socialist parties.”\n\nThe House Education and Workforce Committee recently opened an investigation into the SEIU, a pro-Democratic labor union representing 2 million workers across the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, after the union hired a child molester to a top local chapter role. The SEIU endorsed failed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nRepublican Michigan Rep. Tim Walberg sent a letter to the union on June 24, asking why its San Francisco chapter hired sex offender Noelia Linares as a business agent. The investigation was notably opened after the Daily Caller News Foundation revealed the employee’s record.\n\nThe “No Kings” protests began over the summer, with thousands taking to the streets in cities like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Houston. While Democrats maintained that protesters were peaceful, some could be seen wishing death upon Trump and others in his administration.\n\nIn Chicago, one activist carried a piñata resembling Trump and offered other protesters a chance to hit it with a stick. In video footage, a child could be seen stabbing and hitting the figure, as others watching cheered.\n\nOn Monday, reports revealed that at least 34 protesters were arrested during the events for offenses ranging from terroristic threats to assaults.\n\nThe SEIU did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Others held up whiteboards saying 'Save Medicare' and 'Protect Veterans.'\n\n'The Dems couldn't even unite around what color to wear to make a statement, with some female lawmakers wearing pink, while members of the Congressional Black Caucus donned black,' she noted. \n\nDespite still being politically liberal, she said all of these experiences led to her decision to leave the Democratic Party. \n\n'The party's unwillingness to defend Biden, the chasm Democrats allowed to grow between them and everyday Americans, their inadequate messaging during and following the last presidential election, and the way the party takes Black women for granted has made my remaining an official part of that political coalition untenable,' she said.\n\n Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines will be released Tuesday.","summary":"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote in her new book that she saw 'no such decline' while working for octogenarian President Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15210573/karine-jean-pierre-jake-tapper-biden-book.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/21/03/103161859-0-image-m-30_1761014630991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 03:04:31","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.532},{"id":371307246,"title":"The ‘No Kings’ Phonies","text":"Projection.\n\nThe dictionary defines “projection” as “the tendency to ascribe to another person feelings, thoughts, or attitudes present in oneself.”\n\nA better description of the so-called “No Kings” movement would be hard to come by.\n\nIf ever there were a case of projection in today’s politics, it would be with the self-described “No Kings” movement — a movement that drips with the signs of authoritarianism as it pretends to support democracy.\n\nOver there at Wikipedia is the following definition of authoritarianism: “Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law.”\n\nFor starters, the “No Kings” movement is the very embodiment of “the rejection of political plurality.” There is not a dissenting pro-Trump soul to be found in the “No Kings” movement. (RELATED: The Ridiculous No Kings Protest)\n\nRecall that there was a move by the Left before the 2024 election to keep candidate Trump off the ballot in various states. That would be the very epitome of “the rejection of political plurality” that “No Kings” showcases. Which is to say, no dissent allowed in the “No Kings” movement. (RELATED: No Kings? Well … Not Your King!)\n\nThen there’s the business of “the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo…” Strong central power is exactly what “No Kings” craves — for themselves.\n\nOver here at an Oregon site is this:\n\nWhat began as a nationwide protest dubbed “No Kings Day” quickly devolved into outright violence outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in South Portland. By nightfall, police declared a full-blown riot. Protesters hurled fireworks, smoke grenades, and rocks at officers. A mob shattered glass, breached the building’s entrance, and injured four federal agents.\n\nWhich is to say, what happened in Portland is the classic method of operation of authoritarianism — showcased in this instance by “No Kings.”\n\nAuthoritarianism is about “the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo…”\n\nThe use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo is exactly what “No Kings” is about. The far left — the decidedly authoritarian political status quo — is all about allowing, aiding, and abetting masses of illegal immigrants to override the legal immigration system to flood the country with illegal immigrants. (RELATED: Cameras and Cash Fuel ‘No Kings’ Protests Against Trump)\n\nIn a country that is 100 percent filled with the descendants of legal immigrants or current legal immigrants who followed the rules, filled out the required paperwork, and waited in line to become legal immigrants and legal American immigrants, “No Kings” is about overriding the legal immigration system to flood the country with illegals, specifically designed to corrupt the political system for their own ends.\n\nAuthoritarianism is about “reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law.” That is exactly the “No Kings” agenda. They object to the democracy that features Americans deciding issues at the ballot box in free and fair elections. Instead, they want what they are all about right now — using force and violence to get their objectives accomplished.\n\nThe “No Kings” love of using violence to overthrow democracy in the style of authoritarians everywhere has been on vivid display in American cities like Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHere’s but one headline from Newsweek: “‘No Kings’ Protests See Major Crowds, Violence in Some States.”\n\nThe bottom line here is that “No Kings” is decidedly not what it pretends to be. It is rigidly authoritarian.\n\nAt a recent weekend rally on the steps of the State Capitol building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — which I attended — there was not a single sign of intellectual diversity to be heard. No discussion of issues was to be had. But there were Antifa signs to be seen. (RELATED: DOJ Files Charges Against Antifa)\n\nNot to mention that the reality that in a decidedly free election in 2024, Pennsylvania voters voted for Republican Donald Trump with 50.37 percent to 48.66 percent for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat. Wikipedia notes:\n\nThis was the largest margin of victory for a Republican candidate since 1988, as well as the first time since that election that a Republican won over 50 percent of the state vote.….Trump’s victory is seen to have contributed to down-ballot victories for Republicans who won the races for the U.S. Senate, Attorney General, Treasurer and Auditor General. Except for the Senate race, all 2024 Pennsylvania Republican statewide candidates won over 50 percent of the vote. Trump received more than 3.5 million votes, the most cast for any candidate in Pennsylvania history.\n\nWhich is to say, what is described above is what’s known as democracy.\n\nSo let’s cut to the chase.\n\nWhat the “No Kings” movement really objects to is democracy and free elections that they do not win.\n\nWhich is exactly, among a variety of issues, what Trump’s Make America Great Again movement is all about — democracy and free elections. To let the American voters decide.\n\nThe “No Kings” movement objects to both democracy in general and free elections specifically. Which tells Americans what the “No Kings” phonies are really all about: That would be making themselves King.\n\nWhether Americans like it — or vote for it — or not.\n\nREAD MORE from Jeffrey Lord:\n\nIf Mamdani Arrests Netanyahu, Should Feds Arrest Mamdani?\n\nTrump’s History-Making Triumph\n\nTrump Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize","summary":"Projection.

I was angry and sad. I was enraged and heartbroken that this man had given more than 50 years of his life to serving the American people, and in the end, he’d been treated poorly by members of his own party. It was horrible,” Jean-Pierre wrote.\n\n“You know what? I’m going to become an independent. I don’t think I can stomach being in the Democratic Party anymore,” she added.\n\nDokoupil pressed the former press secretary on how she apparently could not see the signs of Biden’s mental decline that were obvious to millions of voters.\n\n“So when this book landed on my desk and I saw ‘A broken White House,’ in the subtitle, I have to say, I thought you were going to say that, try as you might to convince Joe Biden to drop out of the race — because what we were seeing is what you were seeing, and he was struggling, and couldn’t do it — I thought you were going to say you were angry at that,” the anchor began. “What you said in this book is you’re angry at the people who tried to push him out.”\n\n“Some Americans are going to say, ‘seriously?’” he said.\n\nJean-Pierre replied, claiming that strangers were coming up to her in public and asking why the Democratic Party was not “fighting” back, before King circled back to Dokoupil’s point. \n\n“I want to pick up on what Tony was saying because I, too, thought that,” the co-host said. “You said, people said, why didn’t members of his inner circle speak up about what many believe was the apparent decline of Joe Biden, and you said you’re a member of the inner circle, and you never saw the decline. After that, I wrote, ‘how?’ You even write, Karine, that you were on the plane with him going to the debate, and you didn’t see anything.”\n\n“So hard to understand,” King added.\n\nBiden’s June debate performance was so bad that he even admitted that now-President Donald Trump “knocked him down” as donors began backing away from his campaign, Breitbart News reported.\n\nThe former president ended his campaign less than a month later.\n\n“Well, when we were on Air Force One going to the debate, you got to remember his campaign people were on the team, his family was on the team,” Jean-Pierre told King. “[It] actually was one of those rare trips that I didn’t really see him until after the debate, even though I was on the plane.”\n\nShe continued, “So really, I want everybody to know that I take this question incredibly seriously. I do. I was his White House press secretary, which means I had a role that saw him practically every day and traveled with him—”\n\nKing interjected, asking, “And you saw nothing?”\n\nJean-Pierre replied, “We’ve always said we’re not going to say, ‘Oh, he didn’t age.’ He aged, and he poked fun at it. We always owned up. And with age comes what happens when you get older.”\n\n“Which is?” Dokoupil asked, getting no response as Jean-Pierre continued. \n\n“When we talk about the mental acuity — and again, I take this very, very seriously — I never saw anyone who wasn’t there. I saw someone who was always engaged,” she insisted. “I saw someone who understood policy, pushed us on the policy and also understood history.”\n\nEven establishment media outlets eventually acknowledged that Biden’s team covered up his faltering capabilities, with the Washington Post‘s left-wing editorial board publishing in August 2024: “The 81-year-old had shown signs of slipping for a long time, but his inner circle worked to conceal his decline.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris also admitted in her own book that her former running mate’s age had “showed in physical and verbal stumbles,” and pondered if it was “recklessness” on her part to not have intervened to stop him from running for reelection. \n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, DC.

Harris joined liberal journalist Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., to discuss her new book, \"107 Days,\" which details her whirlwind experience in the 2024 election. During the interview, Harris touted her own credentials, comparing them to those of the Trump administration and said, \"Some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president.\" \"I like the ‘some people say,’ very nice, but go ahead,\" Swisher joked in response.

BILL MAHER RIPS KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, SAYS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED, 'EVERYONE SUCKS BUT ME' Rogan pointed to a 2021 Harris' Columbus Day message that recently resurfaced. Harris said at the time that the U.S. \"must not shy away\" from its \"shameful past\" of European explorers who she said ushered \"in a wave of devastation for tribal nations.\" \"Did you see her Columbus Day message to America?\" he asked. \"Oh God. It was like, 'Don't forget the horrors that the Europeans did to the — OK. Jesus Christ.
