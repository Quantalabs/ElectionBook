It’s a lively tour of Harris’ past, and a preview of her plans for the future. Harris sat with WIRED earlier this week for the interview, which asks guests to respond to some of the most-searched terms about themselves. In this case, the prompts hit on her policies around reproductive rights, gun ownership, marriage equality, and more. But Harris also talks about more personal details, like her relationship with her stepchildren and her deep ties to her college sorority. Most of all, Harris took the opportunity to highlight the differences between her perspective and Donald Trump’s. “His vision for our country is very grounded in the past,” she says, “and frankly an attempt to take us backward.” You can watch the full video above.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris talked about her childhood, her debate with Donald Trump, her gun ownership, and the policies that define her campaign in this special edition of the WIRED Autocomplete Interview.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/kamala-harris-autocomplete-interview/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/66ec825ac9d79523c5f2a011/16:9/w_1920,h_1080,c_limit/WIRED_Auto-Complete-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":"http://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/66ec8ddc5135f3782978ec8f/cbb69fd9-533d-4478-9e84-891461796692low.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-20 12:00:00","author":"Angela Watercutter","authors":["Angela Watercutter"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.547},{"id":256867954,"title":"Kamala Harris: Talking about Defending Her Home","text":"During a Thursday night campaign event with Oprah Winfrey, Democrat presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she would shoot someone if they broke into her house.

On April 11, 2029, CNN quoted Harris saying, “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety.” Ironically, while Harris owns a gun “for personal safety,” she opposes teachers being armed in classroom for the personal safety of themselves and their students.

About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 1 in 10 voters don’t trust either candidate, and a similar share has equal faith in them. The finding is a warning sign for Trump, who has tried to link Harris to President Joe Biden’s economic track record. The new poll suggests that Harris may be escaping some of the president’s baggage on the issue, undercutting what was previously one of Trump’s major advantages. The economy has long been a weak issue for Biden: A separate AP-NORC poll conducted in late June, before Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump, found that about 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy. Earlier this year, Americans were much more likely to say that Trump’s presidency helped the country on cost of living and job creation, compared to Biden’s. The new poll found that the economy is one of the most important issues for about 8 in 10 voters as they consider which candidate to support, dwarfing other top issues like health care and crime. The aftermath of inflation’s spike in 2022 to a four-decade high has pervaded this year’s presidential contest. Shoppers are upset over their grocery bills. Higher interest rates are financially squeezing the buyers of homes and motor vehicles. All that has appeared to matter more to the public than the low 4.2% unemployment rate and stock market gains. According to the AP-NORC poll, only about one-third of voters say the state of the national economy is somewhat or very good, although they’re more optimistic about their own situation, with about 6 in 10 voters saying their household’s finances are somewhat or very good. Both of those numbers have remained steady over the course of the year, despite falling inflation. The candidates have clashing ideas about how best to straighten out the economy, giving voters a stark choice that might hint at how partisan identity increasingly informs views of the economy and policy. But neither campaign has fully explained how its plans would be implemented. Harris insists her plans would be fully funded and not add to the deficit, while Trump’s team assumes — in defiance of most economic models — that growth will be high enough to offset the cost. Mark Carlough, 33, who works on medical records in Philadelphia, plans to vote for Harris and says he believes that the taxes on imports proposed by Trump would hurt most consumers. “The tariffs would be horrible for the economy,” he said. Richard Tunnell, 32, of Huntsville, Texas, plans to vote for Trump, just as he did in 2020. He’s not sure if the Republican has an advantage over Harris on the economy, but he noted that Trump has been a great businessman who remains one of the “richest men on the planet” even after filing for bankruptcy multiple times. “I believe this country needs someone to reach their hand in it and work it like a game of Monopoly and that person is Donald Trump,” said Tunnell, a military veteran on disability. Chantelle Breaux, 38, a stay-at-home parent from Lafayette, Louisiana, feels neither candidate has much to offer on the economy. She doesn’t plan to vote — unless a candidate more to her liking enters the race. “Kamala wants to put a Band-Aid where major surgery needs to be done on this economy,” said Breaux. “Trump wants to run the country as if it’s a business, but it isn’t a business that is going to support all of the people.” Former President Trump suggests growth would come from tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy leading to more investment, while a universal tariff of as much as 20% would direct that investment to building U.S. factories. Harris has campaigned on more benefits for the middle class to be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, saying that would help to contain costs and deliver growth. Her team has warned that Trump’s tariffs would lead to higher prices and worsen underlying inflation challenges. The economy is one of many issues shaping public sentiment as the campaigns seek to turn out their voters. More than half of voters said health care was a top concern, while roughly half said that about crime, immigration, abortion policy and gun policy. Only about one-third called climate change one of the most important issues for their vote, and about one-quarter said that about the war between Israel and Hamas. Trump and Harris are evenly matched in the poll on who would better handle crime and the war in Gaza. But the issues soon splinter in ways that reflect the distinct priorities of Republicans and Democrats. Trump has an advantage over Harris on whom voters trust to better handle immigration. This issue was a problem for Biden, as well: Illegal immigration and crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico have been a challenge during much of his administration. Republicans are more likely to care about immigration, the issue where Trump has a clear upper hand. Harris fares better than Trump when it comes to issues that Democrats care more about, including gun policy, health care, abortion policy and climate change. Rosamaria Nunez, a 68-year-old retiree in San Antonio, Texas, identified gun violence as the most important issue facing the country, saying it became personal when her grandson called her last year to be picked up because of a school lockdown. Nunez said she plans to vote for Harris, saying: “First of all, she’s a gun owner, so she can relate to the safety issue. She seems like she’s more in tune with a real person than Trump is.” Overall, voters see high stakes for the presidential election’s impact on the country’s future, the economy, and the future of democracy in the U.S., but they’re less likely to think the election will have an impact on them personally. About 8 in 10 voters say the election will have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of impact on the country’s future. About three-quarters say the election will have a similar impact on the nation’s economy and the future of democracy in the U.S. By contrast, half of voters say the election will have at least “quite a bit” of impact on them personally. --- The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted September 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.","summary":"About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/09/voters-split-on-whether-harris-or-trump-would-do-a-better-job-on-the-economy-ap-norc-poll.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/QE7AK44UUVEPJEGQK4CILHBCWU.jpg?auth=006739e47a5c6dc9d2cf9a360ed44813bc85e5dc181055a1f90c21802f5c8cc7&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:40:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":256866416,"title":"Harris tells Oprah anyone breaking into her home is ‘getting shot:’ ‘Probably should not have said that’","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris shocked Oprah Winfrey Thursday when she said any intruder breaking into her home is “getting shot” during a virtual campaign rally. Winfrey hosted the “Unite for America Rally” a livestream event featuring several celebrities as well as questions and stories from citizens across the country. As the event turned to the issue of gun violence, Winfrey remarked how surprised she was when Harris revealed she was a gun owner at the presidential debate last week. “I did not know that,” Winfrey exclaimed. “And I thought that was powerful.” “If somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot, sorry” Harris replied, laughing. “Yes, yes. I hear that, I hear that,” Winfrey replied. “Probably should not have said that,” Harris said as everyone laughed. “But my staff will deal with that later.” Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. At the presidential debate, Harris said, “I’ve made very clear my position on fracking and then this business about taking everyone’s guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We’re not taking anybody’s guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.” Video recently resurfaced of Harris as San Francisco’s district attorney in 2007 saying police officers could enter the locked homes of legal gun owners and inspect how they store their weapons. “We’re going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn’t mean that we’re not going to walk into that home and check to see if you’re being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs,” Harris said at the time. Social media users pushed back against Harris’ comments Thursday, pointing out her previous support for mandatory gun buybacks and gun control. “Kamala says she would sh**t an intruder who enters her home then says ‘I probably shouldn’t have said that.’ Let’s be very clear. She has repeatedly called to take away your guns and she 100% will if she’s elected. Security for me but not for thee,” Libs of TikTok wrote. The Spectator contributing editor Stephen Miller agreed, “Kamala Harris advocated for door-to-door mandatory gun buyback programs. Maybe a journalist worth the professional reputation would follow up on that one.” Conservative radio host Larry Eldern wrote, “‘Guns for me, not for thee…’” Townhall.com columnist Derek Hunter remarked, “They’ll get shot by the Secret Service because she has around the clock protection. It’s you and your family she wants to screw out of protection. Oprah pays people to protect her.” The “Unite for America Rally” was held by the “Win with Black Women” organization in support of the vice president. Over 140 other grassroots organizations took part in the virtual rally, including “White Women: Answer the Call,” “Latinas for Harris” and “White Dudes for Harris.” The event itself took place in Oakland County, Michigan, to an audience of 400 people with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also speaking. Celebrities like Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Lopez, Tracee Ellis Ross, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep were in virtual attendance as well.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris shocked Oprah Winfrey Thursday when she said any intruder breaking into her home is “getting shot” during a virtual campaign rally.

It just so happens that the one most recently deployed by Donald Trump is the kind that proliferates these days on X. When Trump declared, seemingly out of nowhere, during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants living legally in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the dogs … eating the cats … eating the pets of the people that live there,” he drew incomprehension, followed by widespread ridicule, from mainstream audiences. What came next was a furious and revealing national conversation on important questions of immigration, race, assimilation, work ethic, diet, traffic violations, duty (to struggling native-born constituencies and to newcomers alike), the limits of tolerance, the inevitability of its opposite, the nature of truth, and much else besides. But on the social-media platform that had provided him with the paranoid talking point in the first place, the discussion and reproduction of Trump’s outburst immediately gave way to the naked and sustained expressions of racism that have become emblematic of the website over the past two years. When Elon Musk acquired Twitter and changed its name to X, he promptly went about stripping its capacity for content moderation, reinstating extremist accounts, and boosting the reach and visibility of the worst trolls. I have heard many blithe rationalizations of the pragmatic and even salutary benefits of “knowing what people really think.” But the pervasiveness and normalization of what was, until very recently, niche and stigmatized bigotry has been astonishing to witness. Although there was plenty of racism on the internet during Trump’s first and second campaigns, it wasn’t this ubiquitous on mainstream networks such as Twitter. On Musk’s X, the racism has now become so relentless and self-confident that it amounts to a genuine qualitative difference. “If I had to summarize the intent of X’s algorithm at this point, it would be twofold,” Sam Harris remarked this week on his Making Sense podcast. “The first is to make Elon even more famous than he is. And the second is to make every white user of the platform more racist. If you could pipe the X algorithm into your brain through Neuralink, I think you’d probably jump off the table and go out and buy a Cybertruck and then join a white-supremacist militia. That’s the vibe I get when I spend a few minutes scrolling the homepage.” Consider a story shared, in the aftermath of Trump’s tirade, by a woman named Rebecca Christophi posting under the handle @rquietlyreading. She generated 1 million views and 11,000 likes for an anecdotal screed about her undergraduate experience sharing a dorm room with an older Haitian student. The roommate had a boyfriend back in Haiti whom she talked with on the room’s landline until very late at night: “It was torture. I could not sleep, I was barely able to stay awake in classes, but I was afraid to say anything to her.” When she finally confronted her roommate, asking her to take the phone out the door to talk, the young Haitian woman “started to cry—how she was affecting me seemed to never have occurred to her. The complete lack of consideration and her shock when I addressed it was hard to wrap my head around. It’s just not how most Americans function.” The post continues: “This is the issue, isn’t it? If you are bringing in thousands of ppl from other countries whose values/ideals differ drastically from yours, you are inevitably going to change your homeland.” At the end, she adds a “side-note” accusing the roommate of stealing clothes from her, and saying she “also cried when I asked her about it.” When one user pushed back—“I am sorry that your parents did not prepare you to tell your roommate when you wanted to go to bed. They failed you. You are projecting this failure onto the American value system in a way that is quite unfair”—that response led to a round of even more vehement and explicit racial hatred. “You’re so smug when you know the problem is that blacks are loud, obnoxious, and inconsiderate. They also struggle with impulse control. You wouldn’t tell a black that was loudly and rudely blasting music on the subway to cut that shit out because he’ll probably try to kill you,” someone wrote. “Nigs are gonna nig,” wrote another account that was verified through a paid subscription. I reached out to Christophi to ask if she’d intended her post to be read as invective against Haitians, and she replied in an email that no, it was just “a story,” its telling triggered by “the recent happenings in Springfield”; she “certainly did not expect so many people to see it or to respond with the hatred and vitriol that they did.” She said that people have since threatened her life and livelihood—which of course is egregious. And yet, in her message to me, she also doubled down on what she said were “accurate details about the effect of mass immigration.” If, she wrote, “the details coming out of Springfield are conveyed accurately, they only support my statements, for example, the mayor and city council appear to be receiving financial kickbacks for replacing a third of the population of their town with immigrants.” This is a perfect example of the “Great Replacement” theory in action—the idea that immigrants are being welcomed as part of a plot to steal control of the country away from white voters—and it is not true. There is no evidence that the residents of the town are being in any sense replaced. The choice of a quote from G. K. Chesterton that she shared at the end of the email dampened the sympathy her message might have otherwise elicited: “The definition of the true savage is that he laughs when he hurts you; and howls when you hurt him.” I am far from a hypersensitive snowflake on constant lookout for racial grievance, nor am I someone who could plausibly be accused of a lack of concern over creeping censoriousness particularly on the previous iteration of Twitter. On the contrary, I believe that maximal tolerance of free expression is crucial to American democracy, and I am deeply skeptical of both formal and informal censorship. I believe that it is vital for all of us—not just college students—to be put in contact with views we passionately disagree with. But through his revealed beliefs and example, Musk has debased the argument about the value of free speech and reduced the terms of this debate to its crudest possible units. With his nearly 200 million followers—a sizable portion of whom amount to cultists—he is responsible for tuning X’s digital culture into a gratuitously repulsive frequency. Astonishingly active and available on the platform that he so bombastically controls, he not only enables bad actors; he also personally praises and promotes them. Just a week before the presidential debate, Musk wrote, “Very interesting. Worth watching,” about a conversation between Tucker Carlson and the amateur historian and Nazi sympathizer Darryl Cooper. In that talk, Cooper claimed that Hitler had killed millions of Jews unintentionally, and that Winston Churchill was the real villain of the Second World War. Musk has since deleted the post, but such an endorsement from X’s apex user makes the spread of anti-Semitism not just likely but inevitable. One noxious meme that has been circulating lately depicts a smirking, hook-nosed figure wearing a kippah and rubbing his hands together. Behind him is a wall of cardboard boxes labeled Open Borders, Feminism, Cultural Decay, Globalism, “The Holocaust,” Hate Crime Laws, Climate Change, Gender Bending, Usury, Porno, and so on. “It’s all Jewish. Literally all of it,” a verified account claimed. This image, too, is a reference to the Great Replacement theory, and the idea that Jews are behind it. These sorts of grotesque posts predate Musk. But under his stewardship, they have absolutely lost their taboo. How could they not? As my colleague Yair Rosenberg has reported, Musk has endorsed that conspiracy theory himself. Last year, a Jewish user responded to anti-Semitic content on X by posting, “To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right’: You got something you want to say? Why don’t you say it to our faces.” A small-time white-nationalist account wrote back to attribute anti-Semitism to minorities, and blaming it on the Jews: Rosenberg pointed out that “his exchange would have languished in obscurity had Musk not replied to this bigoted bromide with six words: ‘You have said the actual truth.’” Here’s something else that Musk, Trump’s wealthiest and most prominent backer, lamented not long ago: “Racism against white people is the only kind of discrimination that’s allowed.” As the depressing discussions of Haitians—and Jews and Black people in general—have made so inescapably plain, from the top of the Republican ticket down to the most obscure account on X, that is anything but true.","summary":"He’s not just enabling trolls; he’s personally endorsing their posts.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/twitter-x-racism-elon-musk/679928/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/NiqJFbtB8EHGuJxmP3_HUNQU_Cg=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/09/twitter_racism_final_horizontal2/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:33:00","author":"Thomas Chatterton Williams","authors":["Thomas Chatterton Williams"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":256865820,"title":"Trump left his mark on the federal bench. Can Biden match his number of judicial nominations?","text":"Washington — As President Biden prepares to close out his four years in the White House, he is on track to match or even surpass the former President Donald Trump’s total number of judicial confirmations. Appointments to the federal bench have taken on added importance in recent years as courts have played a greater role in American life as the adjudicators of disputes over hot-button issues like abortion, immigration and the environment. Trump closed out his single term with 234 appointments to Article III courts, which include the Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. His impact on the federal bench has been quickly realized, with Trump-appointed judges overseeing closely watched cases involving the abortion pill, the Biden administration’s immigration policies, student loan forgiveness programs and LGBTQ rights. Now Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is closing in on his predecessor’s 234 judicial appointments, as the Senate continues to churn through confirmations in the weeks leading up the November election. “The American people and senators and members of Congress and presidents all realize how important the courts are, especially recently,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who focuses on federal judicial selection. “They’ve given courts a lot of salience, and so I think they’re more and more taken into account as the third branch of government and an important branch, and you need more than just Congress and the president to do things.” Presidents and the Senate, he said, are “quantitatively and qualitatively wanting to get the most and the best judges.” Biden’s judicial nominations With four months left in his presidency, 212 of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominations have won approval by the Senate, a figure that includes Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic confirmation to the Supreme Court. Among those 212 judges are 44 that joined the appeals courts and 165 on the district courts. And with 29 nominees pending in the Senate, Mr. Biden could close out his presidency with 241 overall judicial appointments if they all are confirmed. Another 28 seats are currently open without nominees from the White House, according to the Judicial Conference, and many are from states with two Republican senators. The White House typically consults with home-state senators on nominations, though they can block a nominee to a district court. “Every judicial confirmation makes an enormous difference to the courts to which these judges will join,” a White House official told CBS News. The official said while there is a “real possibility” of Mr. Biden having more of his judicial nominees approved by the Senate than Trump, the number is “less important than what it signifies, which is confirmations of the most demographically and professionally diverse nominees who understand the power of the courts and their role within the system of justice.” While Mr. Biden is poised to top Trump in total judges named to the federal bench, he’s unlikely to match his predecessor’s appointments to the 13 courts of appeals before leaving office. The former president had 54 of his nominees to those courts approved by the Senate, compared to Mr. Biden’s 44. And with just five nominations pending, the president will likely fall short of Trump’s total. Trump, though, had the upper hand for making a mark on the federal appeals courts when he came into office, inheriting 17 vacancies after confirmations in the Republican-led Senate ground to a halt in the final two years of President Barack Obama’s term. When Mr. Biden assumed the presidency, there were just two open appeals court seats. Both presidents, though, put an emphasis on filling those vacancies first. “The decisions of district judges are binding on no other judges, while the decisions of the courts of appeals are theoretically precedents for all the district judges in the circuit,” said Russell Wheeler, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks nominations. “When District Judge Jones makes a decision, it’s binding on the parties, but doesn’t bind Judge Smith. But when Circuit Judge Jones makes a decision along with two others on the panel, that’s the law of the circuit.” Plus, the appeals courts are the “last stop in the process” for most parties, he said, especially since the Supreme Court agrees to review so few lower court decisions. The Republican-led Senate also continued to hold votes on 14 of Trump’s judicial picks after he lost the 2020 election to Mr. Biden, the first time a defeated president had a judge confirmed during a lame-duck session since 1980, according to Wheeler. Democrats lambasted the confirmations at the time as a violation of a “long and established tradition” of halting consideration of judicial nominees after Election Day, but the GOP’s willingness to break with that practice four years ago could benefit Mr. Biden during the upcoming lame-duck session. “The precedent is there, the nominees are there, the will is there, so I would anticipate that, taking a page from the McConnell playbook, that confirmations will continue in the lame-duck,” the White House official said, referring to former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Republican senator played a crucial role in the confirmations of Trump’s judicial picks. Beyond the total number of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominations, the president has aimed to diversify the federal bench. He has repeatedly emphasized his goal of ensuring the judiciary reflects the diversity of the American people, and has worked to name judges of varying personal and professional backgrounds. Mr. Biden set a record for the largest number of nominees to the appeals courts who worked as public defenders. More than 40% of those with lifetime appointments served as public defenders or civil rights lawyers, or worked to protect civil and human rights, according to a May memo from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights highlighting the president’s 200th judge. Mr. Biden also notched another milestone when the Senate confirmed Mary Kathleen Costello to the federal bench this week. She became the 12th openly LGBTQ judge confirmed during his administration, surpassing Obama’s record of 11. He named the first Black woman to the nation’s highest court with his selection of Jackson, and has named more Black judges than any of his predecessors in one term. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Democrats in a letter earlier this month that confirming more of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominees is a priority for the coming weeks. But the upper chamber’s slim margins could complicate their efforts. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has cast tie-breaking votes for at least three candidates to the federal judiciary, is on the campaign trail working to defeat Trump in November, and five Democratic senators are in tight races to hold onto their seats. Democrats and four independents who typically vote with the party hold 51 seats to Republicans’ 49, though one of those GOP senators, JD Vance, has been absent from the Senate campaigning for the vice presidency. “On paper, Biden should be able to overall in lower court judges meet Trump,” Wheeler said. “Whether the closeness in the Senate makes that difficult is going to be the $64 question.”","summary":"Washington — As President Biden prepares to close out his four years in the White House, he is on track to match or even surpass the former President Donald Trump&#8217;s total number of judicial confirmations.

Zuchowski referred to undocumented immigrants as “locusts” in his initial post, and called for residents to “write down all the addresses of the people” supporting Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris with signs in their yards. “I have intentionally not put up signs in front of my house, I have intentionally not put it on my car. I have one, but I am scared,” one woman from Kent said Thursday. “As an indigenous person who is brown … think on what he’s done.” She was not the only one outraged by Zuchowski’s remarks. “How do we trust a man who has been elected to protect and serve every resident in Portage County and yet he is speaking out against half of them?” another woman asked. The meeting lasted about two hours and was focused on creating an open space to address community concerns. Multiple other organizations were present, including voter activist groups, and Portage County Deputy Board of Elections Director Theresa Nielsen also took questions from the crowd. “Many of the things that I’ve heard … they sadden me,” Nielsen said, with tears welling in her eyes. “You should not be afraid to vote.” Portage County NAACP President Reney Romaine believes these meetings are important. “We were getting a lot of calls, text messages, Facebook, different things about the way people felt about the post,” Romaine told 3News, “so it’s better to come together in unity. There’s strength in numbers.” Comments on Zuchowski’s post showed some in the community supported his comments. However, others at Thursday’s gathering found them intimidating. “He wields way to much power to be able to intimidate a community such as ours,” one man said. “He should be bringing us together, where he should be allowing us to live together as one. He is using fear and intimidation to tear us apart.” In a statement, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office said, “Our office has reviewed the comments and determined they don’t violate election laws.” On Tuesday, Zuchowski put out another Facebook post claiming his remarks had been “a little misinterpreted??” but adding, “I…as the elected sheriff, do have a first amendment right as do all citizens.” “Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence(s) of that speech,” another woman at Thursday’s meeting declared. WKYC has reached out to Zuchowski multiple times requesting to speak with him in person, but has not heard back.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSheriff Bruce Zuchowski previously attacked migrants and called for residents to &#8216;write&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Portage County residents express anger over sheriff&#8217;s remarks about Kamala Harris supporters at NAACP gathering first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/portage-county-residents-express-anger-over-sheriffs-remarks-about-kamala-harris-supporters-at-naacp-gathering/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Portage-County-residents-vent-frustrations-over-sheriffs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:30:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":256866374,"title":"Batteries of Lebanon walkie-talkies contained PETN explosive, source tells Reuters","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Batteries of Lebanon walkie-talkies contained PETN explosive: Reuters source The batteries of the walkie-talkies used by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that blew up this week were laced with a highly explosive compound known as PETN, a Lebanese source familiar with the device's components told Reuters.

The grants will fund 25 projects across 14 states, including key battleground states such as Michigan and North Carolina, as well as Ohio, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana. Announced on Friday, this marks the second round of EV battery funding under the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021. An earlier round allocated $1.8bn for 14 projects that are still underway. These totals are lower than those announced in October 2022, reflecting several projects that were either withdrawn or rejected by US officials during sometimes lengthy negotiations. This funding forms part of a broader initiative by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to promote the production and sales of electric vehicles as a crucial part of their strategy to combat climate change and bolster US manufacturing. Companies receiving awards process lithium, graphite or other battery materials, or manufacture components used in EV batteries. White House economic adviser Lael Brainard stated: \"Today’s awards move us closer to achieving the administration’s goal of building an end-to-end supply chain for batteries and critical minerals here in America, from mining to processing to manufacturing and recycling, which is vital to reduce China’s dominance of this critical sector,'' White House economic adviser Lael Brainard said. The Biden-Harris administration is \"committed to making batteries in the United States that are going to be vital for powering our grid, our homes and businesses and America’s iconic auto industry,'' Brainard told reporters Thursday during a White House call. The awards announced on Friday amount to nearly $35bn in total US investments to strengthen domestic critical minerals and battery supply chains, Brainard revealed, citing projects ranging from major lithium mines in Nevada and North Carolina to battery factories in Michigan and Ohio to production of rare earth elements and magnets in California and Texas. \"We’re using every tool at our disposal, from grants and loans to allocated tax credits,'' she said, adding that the administration's approach has leveraged more $100bn in private sector investment since Biden took office. In recent years, China has cornered the market for processing and refining key minerals such as lithium, rare earth elements and gallium, and also has dominated battery production, leaving the U.S. and its allies and partners \" she said, adding that the administration's approach has leveraged more than $100bn in private sector investment since Biden took office. The US has retaliated with what she described as \"tough, targeted measures to enforce against unfair actions by China.\" Just last week, officials increased tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals such as graphite used in EV and grid-storage batteries. The administration also implemented the 2022 climate law to encourage domestic sourcing for EVs sold in the US and imposed restrictions on products from China and other adversaries identified by the US as foreign entities of concern. \"We're committed to making batteries in the United States of America,'' stated Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. If approved, awards announced Friday will back 25 projects with 8,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 permanent jobs, officials revealed. Companies will be obliged to match grants on a 50-50 basis, with a minimum $50m investment, according to the Energy Department. While federal funding may not be crucial for some projects, the cash injection from the infrastructure and climate laws has significantly transformed the US battery manufacturing sector in recent years, observed Matthew McDowell, associate professor of engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. McDowell expressed his enthusiasm about the next generation of batteries for clean energy storage, including solid state batteries, which could potentially hold more energy than lithium ion.","summary":"The money is part of a larger effort by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to boost production and sales of electric vehicles as a key element of their strategy to slow climate change and build up US manufacturing","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/business/awards-3bn-electric-car-battery-33713534","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33713533.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Biden-EV-Batteries.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:20:22","author":"Lawrence Matheson,MATTHEW DALY","authors":["Lawrence Matheson","MATTHEW DALY"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":256864510,"title":"“Harris’s Potential Presidency Faces Senate Roadblock: Republicans Could Hold Veto Power over Agenda and Judges”","text":"The prospect of a President Kamala Harris facing down a Republican-controlled Senate is coming into focus as she rises in the 2024 contest, even as GOP hopes of capturing the Senate grow because of improving polling in a pivotal Montana race. A Republican-controlled chamber could thwart Harris’ nominees to fill out her administration and the courts, along with her legislative agenda. Top Senate Republicans told NBC News she would need their sign-off to secure votes on any judicial nominees, including for the Supreme Court. And some Harris supporters worry that without a united Congress, she would struggle to get much done legislatively. “I honestly believe she has to have both the House and the Senate in order for her to be able to get anything done. Anything at all,” said Frankie Veltri, a retired 77-year-old voter in Goodyear, Arizona. “And if she doesn’t have one or the other, putting more emphasis on the Senate … she will never be able to do anything that she said she would do, and then it will be the same old grind. You know, ‘She made all these promises and she didn’t do them.’ I mean, that’s evident with Biden.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a Judiciary Committee member who is running to be Senate GOP leader when Mitch McConnell retires after this year, said Harris would “absolutely” have to negotiate judicial and Supreme Court nominees with his party if Republicans control the Senate — and not assume they would get votes. “They’re not going to be able to nominate the most radical people like they would under their current scenario. So if they want them to get any floor time, they would have to enter into a negotiation with us,” Cornyn told NBC News in an interview. The prospect of a split Congress looms over a possible Harris win even if Democrats have a strong year and sweep every swing state. To capture the Senate, Republicans have to flip just two seats in solidly red states — West Virginia, which Democrats have conceded, and Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester trails in most polls — while holding seats in GOP-friendly Florida and Texas. Under that divided-government scenario, Harris would be the first president since 1989 to enter office without her party controlling both chambers of Congress. It would put her in uncharted waters given the polarization between the two parties in recent decades, with no guarantee that any major judicial nominees, Cabinet picks or legislative items would get a vote. While a split Congress would require the two parties to negotiate on must-pass bills like funding the government and authorizing the Pentagon, Harris’ other legislative pursuits — including Medicare drug price negotiations, cracking down on grocery price gouging and new investments in housing — would be at the mercy of a Republican Party that has aggressively criticized her ideas. “It’s always a challenge when you’ve got divided government like that,” said Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif. She said capturing the House would at least help Democrats “set the agenda” for a Harris presidency. But, she added, “it definitely poses a challenge if we don’t have the Senate.” Charlie Veltri, the husband of Frankie and an Arizona voter, projected confidence that Harris at the top of the ticket will help Democrats down the ballot. But he said what happens in Montana, which could be the tipping-point Senate race, affects everyone. “I think about [Democratic Sen.] Jon Tester and the fight he’s going through, and some of the other people. And it’s not enough just to have Ruben [Gallego, the Democratic congressman and Arizona Senate nominee] win. We’ve got to have the rest of them, because if we don’t, we don’t control the Senate,” he said. “It’s not enough just to win the presidency. She’s got to have control of the Senate, at the very minimum.” On the Supreme Court, it’s unclear when another vacancy will occur. But history suggests Harris would get at least one — the last president who didn’t get any new justices was Jimmy Carter. And if it’s a GOP-led Senate, Republicans would control a floor vote. “Particularly with the judiciary, because we have the power of confirmation, I think they’re going to have to think long and hard about who they submit and whether or not they think they could get them cleared through the Senate,” said Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who is also running for leader. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would have seniority to be the next Judiciary Committee chair and said he intends to claim the position if Republicans win control. He declined to say how he would handle picks for judges and justices in a potential Harris administration. “I’m not going to presume doom and gloom, but needless to say it’ll be more difficult” to confirm judges in a Republican-led Senate, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a Judiciary Committee member. Asked if he worries about a repeat of Merrick Garland in 2016, when a GOP Senate refused to give President Barack Obama’s nominee a vote, Blumenthal said, “I worry about it, but there’s a limit to how irresponsible they can be.” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., another Judiciary Committee member, said, “I don’t know that they’d confirm none, but they’d certainly make it an obstacle course for her.” A Harris campaign spokesman declined to comment when asked about the importance of the Senate, the prospect of divided government and how she would seek to work with Republicans if they win control. Henry Wade, a Maricopa, Arizona, City Council member, said he’s “confident but concerned” about Democrats’ prospects of holding the Senate. “I think that they can do it. … I know I’m out working hard, canvassing and talking to people and passing out signs,” he said. “We’ll see what happens. I’m going to keep doing my part.” Louis Olivas, a retired professor in Tempe, Arizona, acknowledged that Republicans could “potentially” stop Harris’ Supreme Court nominees if they took the Senate. But he said he’s “not worried at all” about them stonewalling, because “she’s a great negotiator.” “They’re not going to shut her down for four years,” Olivas said Sahil Kapur reported from Washington and Alex Tabet from Phoenix.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe prospect of a President Kamala Harris facing down a Republican-controlled Senate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Harris&#8217;s Potential Presidency Faces Senate Roadblock: Republicans Could Hold Veto Power over Agenda and Judges&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/harriss-potential-presidency-faces-senate-roadblock-republicans-could-hold-veto-power-over-agenda-and-judges/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240910-kamala-harris-al-17044-da4e98.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:13:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":256865284,"title":"Trump Springfield visit: Darcy cartoon","text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Thursday in a joint press conference. with Governor Mike DeWine, Republican Springfield Mayor Rob Rule discouraged a visit to the city by Donald Trump who said he planned on it. Governor DeWine said “I hope [Trump] does” stop making baseless claims that Haitian immigrants in the city are illegal and eating cats, dogs and geese. Mayor Rue said a Trump visit would only further stress overstrained city and state safety services. Governor DeWine had brought in the Ohio Highway Patrol and Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms to augment Springfield safety services responding to multiple bomb threats to Springfield schools, stores and events. “As a visit from the former president will undoubtedly place additional demands on our safety infrastructure, should he chose to change his plans, it would convey a significant message of peace to the city of Springfield,” said Mayor Rue. Instead, Trump conveyed an ominous fear mongerIng message of his Springfield visit. “In the next two weeks I’m going to Springfield and I’m going to Aurora. You may never see me again but that’s OK. I’ve gotta do what I gotta do.” Trump said during a campaign speech in New York, where he was convicted on 34 felony counts for fraud. Trump’s falsely claiming that Aurora, Colorado has been taken over by a criminal gang from Venezuela. No mention of them eating cats and dogs too. Running mate Sen. JD Vance recently said he had “created” the fake story of Haitian migrants grabbing and eating pets to grab the media’s attention. Vance has never once visited Springfield. Not since he started his slanderous sewage spill engulfing Springfield or during his Senate campaign, despite his having grown up in suburban middle class Middletown, just south of Springfield. Trump-Vance endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno visited Springfield Saturday and called for the legal Haitian immigrants to be deported. Bernie, the ‘Benz dealer, is a Bogota, Columbia legal immigrant himself. “What happened is that Sherrod Brown and Kamala Harris have waved the magic wand, corrupted our immigration system and shielded them through Temporary Protected Status and asylum - two loopholes in our immigration system that were corrupted by corrupt politicians,” Moreno extolled. Moreno’s opponent, Sen. Sherrod Brown is not a member of the Biden-Harris administration or in the Department of Homeland Security that granted the Haitian migrants TPS status. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said all those granted TPS status “Undergo and clear robust security vetting.”","summary":"In a joint press conference with Governor Mike DeWine, Republican Springfield Mayor Rob Rue discouraged a visit to the city by Donald Trump, who along with running mate Sen.

This strategy is designed to show that despite Russia’s advantage in missiles and manpower, Ukraine can, if properly equipped and fully supported, force Russian President Vladimir Putin to give up most of his revanchist goals to hold on to 20% of Ukraine’s territory. “Our Plan for Victory is fully prepared,” Zelensky said in a video address Wednesday. “All points, all key emphases, the necessary appendices with details to the plan have been identified. Everything has been worked out. The most important thing now is the determination to implement it.” “The president of Ukraine will address the U.N. General Assembly, meet with representatives of American defense and energy companies, and the Ukrainian community,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement. “The head of state will hold bilateral negotiations with leaders of countries and international organizations on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.” BIDEN, HARRIS, AND TRUMP TO BE BRIEFED: Zelensky intends to personally brief the decision-makers who hold the fate of his country in their hands, including members of Congress, President Joe Biden, and presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump. “Next Thursday, President [Joe] Biden and Vice President [Kamala] Harris will separately meet with President Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at yesterday’s briefing. “They will discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression and Ukraine’s strategic planning.” “I’m looking forward to hosting my friend President Zelensky of Ukraine next week at the White House,” Biden posted on the social media platform X. “During his visit, I’ll reaffirm America’s commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence.” What Biden didn’t say was whether he would relax his restrictions on using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons, which Zelensky noted was an essential element of his plan to turn the tide of battle. Zelensky’s office also expects to meet with former President Donald Trump, who has been cheered in Moscow for promising, if elected, to bring the war in Ukraine to a quick conclusion even before he takes office. “I had a phone call with Donald Trump, and he said that he’s very supportive, and we had a good conversation,” Zelensky told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria this past Sunday, referring to a conversation from two months ago. “He understands how it’s difficult to survive during the war, and he will do everything to strengthen Ukraine. So I don’t know. I mean, that’s great that it sounds this way, but that’s why I wanted to share this plan to hear his reaction.” Asked specifically about Trump’s pledge to end the war as soon as he’s elected, Zelensky said, “Election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real.” UKRAINE’S FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE: Zelensky’s victory plan tour comes as Ukraine is reeling from the unrelenting onslaught of Russian glide bombs and missiles, such as the one that hit a geriatric nursing home this week and destroyed Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in July. “All our energy infrastructure, they destroyed 80 percent by these guided bombs, 80 percent,” Zelensky told CNN. “Right now, ahead of the winter season and during this particularly significant autumn, we have many issues that critically affect Ukraine and the lives of our people,” Zelensky said in a video address Thursday. “Of course, energy is an urgent priority.” But Ukraine has also had some notable recent successes that Zelensky hopes will demonstrate that his military is capable of seizing the initiative and deliver demoralizing blows to Russia, including a devastating drone strike that destroyed one of Russia’s largest ammunition depots, and its offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, in which thousands of Russia troops have been surrounded, and hundreds captured. Zelensky claims the Kursk operation has achieved its main goal of taking some of the pressure off its eastern front, where he says “heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk” area is “extremely challenging.” “The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,” Zelesnky said, because Russia has been forced to redeploy some of its best troops to try to retake Kursk. “We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area.” “Our active operations continue. The ‘exchange fund’ is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war,” he said.

HAPPENING TODAY: This morning, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. will host a National POW/MIA Recognition Day ceremony on the Pentagon’s River Terrace Parade Field. In addition to speeches, the ceremony will feature a flyover of UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in missing man formation. The National POW/MIA Recognition Day honors Americans who were prisoners of war and those who served and never returned home. In a proclamation, President Joe Biden called on all Americans “to reflect on today and let us not forget those heroes who never returned home from the battlefields around the world or their families who are still waiting for answers.” “Today, more than 81,000 of these brave men and women remain missing and unaccounted for around the world. They will never be forgotten, and their courage, service, and sacrifice will always be cherished by our grateful nation,” Biden said. The Pentagon ceremony will be livestreamed on Defense.gov at 10 a.m. ISRAEL BOMBS HEZBOLLAH AFTER ‘GRIM BEEPER’ ATTACKS: Israel warplanes hit Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, including about 100 rocket launchers, overnight in one of the heaviest bombardments this year. The Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes were a preemptive action conducted in self-defense. “Hezbollah was preparing to launch an extensive rocket and missile attack against central and northern Israel, with thousands of rocket launcher barrels in over 40 launch areas aimed at the Israeli home front,” the IDF said in a statement. “In an act of self-defense to remove these threats, the IDF struck terrorist targets in Lebanon, from which Hezbollah was planning to launch their attacks.” “During the strike, about 230 launches and 20 aerial targets were identified crossing into Israeli territory,” the statement said. “Ninety percent of the launchers were from the heart of a civilian area, near civilian facilities such as mosques, schools, U.N. sites, etc.” The attack came as Hezbollah vowed a “just retribution and a bitter reckoning” for the mass explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies that have killed at least 37 Hezbollah members and maimed thousands more over the past few days, and as Israel’s defense minister has declared the start of a “new phase” of the war. “We will return the residents of the north securely to their homes,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday. TALKING TO TRUMP?: As Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) regroups after his failed first effort to get a temporary funding measure through the House, he has reportedly spoken to Trump about his call to let the government shut down at the end of the month if the stopgap measure known as a CR, or continuing resolution, doesn’t include a Republican provision that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. “Johnson told House Republican leadership colleagues that he’s talking to former President Donald Trump about his call to shut down the federal government and what options GOP lawmakers have right now as the funding deadline approaches,” Punchbowl News reported, citing “multiple sources familiar with the meeting.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor yesterday to lambaste the speaker and offer an alternative approach to avert a shutdown in just ten days. “To the surprise of virtually no one, Speaker Johnson’s deeply flawed and highly partisan CR failed by a vote of 202-220,” Schumer said. “The ‘no’ votes included Democrats, Republicans, fiscal hawks, conservative ideologues, and people in between.

ProPublica reported this week that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. Harris, who will be in the Atlanta area on Friday to address the issue, on Thursday night heard from the mother and sisters of one of the women who died. During a livestreamed campaign event hosted by Oprah Winfrey and attended by Harris, Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Thurman, tearfully told viewers that “people around the world need to know that this was preventable.” Williams said she initially did not want to go public about her daughter’s 2022 death but ultimately decided it was important for people to understand her daughter “was not a statistic. She was loved.” Harris told the family, “I’m just so sorry. The courage you all have shown is extraordinary.” The vice president added: “This story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place.” Dozens of pregnant patients have faced delayed care or been turned away from hospitals amid medical emergencies over the last two years, a violation of federal law, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Violations occurred in states with and without abortion bans. But an AP analysis earlier this year found an immediate spike in some states with abortion bans, including Texas, following the ruling. Harris was the administration’s chief spokesperson on abortion rights when President Joe Biden was running for reelection, headlining rallies across the nation, and she is the highest-ranking U.S. official to make a public visit to an abortion clinic. Since becoming the nominee, though, she’s broadened her focus to a wider range of issues. Harris’ campaign is hoping that reproductive rights will be a strong motivator for Democrats in the November election. Republican nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, continues to take credit for appointing three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe. About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their vote – but it’s more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About 6 in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about 4 in 10 male voters. The gender gap doesn’t stop there. About 6 in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about 2 in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters, by contrast, trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris. Democrats point to a series of electoral wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, and advocates believe Harris is a strong messenger. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate she gave a forceful answer on how the bans have affected even women who never intended to end pregnancies. Harris has a long history of fighting for reproductive health issues, especially Black maternal health. Since taking over the top of the ticket, others have toured the nation talking about reproductive rights, including her husband, Doug Emhoff. In Georgia, Thurman had waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills, even as she developed sepsis. Family members told ProPublica that the other woman who died was afraid to seek help for the pain she was experiencing after taking abortion pills. She also had a lethal combination of painkillers in her system. Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN in Georgia, said the six-week ban has caused a “massive environment of fear and confusion and uncertainty” for the medical community. “Medicine is a gray area,” she said. Laws, though “are a blunt instrument.” She said Republican legislators who are now blaming hospitals and doctors are seeing the ramifications of the laws playing out in real time. “The law is preventing us from being able to provide evidence-based care without having to think about the risk of criminal prosecution,” she said. Harris lays the blame on Trump, saying in a statement that, “This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.” During the presidential debate earlier this month, Trump leaned heavily on his catchall response to questions on abortion rights, saying the issue should be left up to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban. But he has also repeatedly declined to say whether he would veto such a ban if he were elected again. Harris was making a campaign stop later Friday in Wisconsin following her visit to Georgia. Trump had no public events scheduled for Friday. ___ AP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this report.

Email tips@dailymail.com By James Fielding For Mailonline Published:11:44 BST, 20 September 2024 |Updated:12:11 BST, 20 September 2024 e-mail 26 shares 32 View comments Zoe Ball's Radio 2 return date has been thrown into doubt as BBC bosses have told her to 'take all the time she needs' following the death of her beloved mother. Sources close to the star told MailOnline she has been given 'as much time as she needs' by the BBC, who acted similarly when she took time off in March to care for her ill mother Julia Peckham who passed away from cancer a month later. Zoe, who is the BBC’s highest paid female star earning £950,000-a-year, has been on extended leave from her show since August 8, with Gaby Roslin and Scott Mills filling in. While listeners grew concerned by her ongoing absence, the 53-year-old DJ was seen out for the first time in weeks, laughing and smiling with her ex-husband Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, outside a café in Hove on Thursday. As Zoe was spotted for the first time in weeks, BBC bosses are said to be doing 'everything they can' to help her return to work when she is ready. Zoe Ball was seen with ex-husband Norman Cook in Hove on Thursday, after taking time out from her show The 53-year-old DJ, whose listeners grew concerned by her ongoing absence, was seen out for the first time in weeks A source told MailOnline: 'Zoe's had a tough few months. She had the death of her mum in April to deal with and it's not been an easy time for her. 'She has taken the time off because she needed a break with everything that has been going on for her. Her bosses are being very supportive and just want her to be in a place where she is ready to return to work. 'Zoe is expected to come back before the end of the month. Nobody is telling her an exact date to come back, the decision is very much on her. 'She's been told to take all the time she needs.' Before her leave of absence, Zoe had been on holiday in Ibiza and attended Brighton Pride. But just three days back into her job, the former Live & Kicking presenter took another extended break. A schedule tweak suggested Zoe would return as soon as this Monday, with stand-in Scott moving back to his afternoon slot but Radio 2 insiders say 'nothing is set in stone'. The insider added: 'Nothing has been confirmed. Radio 2 is being led by Zoe on this. They're just expecting her to return sometime this month.' The presenter (right) was seen laughing and smiling with her ex-husband Norman, aka Fatboy Slim, outside a café in Hove on Thursday BBC bosses are said to be doing 'everything they can' to help her return to work when she is ready Zoe continues to have a close relationship with Norman, 61, the father of her two children Woody, 23, and Nelly, 14. The former couple were married for 18 years (pictured in 1999) Yet she looked in good spirits on Thursday as she joined friends and her ex-husband in Hove. Zoe continues to have a close relationship with Norman, 61, the father of her two children Woody, 23, and Nelly, 14. The former couple were married for 18 years and were known for their notorious partying in the Noughties before splitting in 2016. Both Zoe and Norman are now teetotal having admitted issues with alcohol and both had stints in rehab. Read More Zoe Ball pays tribute to her late mother as she marks first birthday since her death Zoe suffered further tragedy in 2017 when her boyfriend, cameraman Billy Yates, took his own life aged just 40 in what the DJ described at the time: 'Losing him was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with in my life.' Zoe took over from Chris Evans as the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast Show in January 2019, becoming the first woman to front the station's flagship show. She quit her role on Strictly Come Dancing spin-off show It Take Two in May 2021 to concentrate on her radio duties, having become a hit with fans. But regularly listeners were shocked to hear Radio 2 colleague Scott Mills' voice on August 12, when he filled in for Zoe unannounced. Scott said: 'If you set your alarm this morning to go off at 6:30am and normally Zoe comes in, please do not break out. You have not overslept 'If you've just put us on this morning, it's Scott Mills in for Zoe for the next few weeks. 'I'm sending you all my love Zo, as are my team.' Zoe took over from Chris Evans as the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast Show in January 2019, becoming the first woman to front the station's flagship show In March, Zoe said she would be taking time off to care for her mother Julia Peckham, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (pictured with her mother Julia in 2010) Fans have become concerned by the silence regarding the presenter's absence, as well as Zoe's lack of interaction on social media where she has been usually quiet. Her last post on Instagram was on August 8, highlighting an interview clip from ex Radio 1 Breakfast DJs Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley, best known as Mark and Lard, who revealed they wanted Zoe to be their own 'showbiz reporter' while they were fronting the show back in the Nineties. Three days previously, she posted a snap of herself with children Woody and Nelly, claiming they were tired from their partying in Ibiza and Brighton Pride. And before her summer break, she lauded her personal trainer who she revealed has been working out with her twice a week over the last year and 'hugely helped with my strength, menopause symptoms, anxiety and helped boost my confidence.' Neither Radio 2 or Zoe personal reps have offered any confirmed insight into her absence from the show, sparking even more worry from listeners. Zoe's son Woody - an aspiring DJ like his father - has not mentioned his mother in any of his many social media posts over the past few months. However Woody did reveal back in July he and Zoe, who have appeared together on Channel 4 show Celebrity Gogglebox, were in talks with various TV production companies about hosting a new show together. He told The Sun: 'Me and my mum keep being pitched for really cool stuff. The industry is so hard, but we'll get there. I'm excited for whatever we end up landing on.' Scott Mills failed to address Zoe absence from the Breakfast Show on Monday, as he stepped in for another week Zoe last posted on Instagram on August 5 before disappearing. It featured a picture of her with her two children saying she was 'jet lagged, brighton pride lagged [and] ibiza lagged' But whereas some fans have shown their support for Zoe while she's been off the airwaves - some of whom have been personally contacted Radio 2 - others haven't been quite so sympathetic. Many have voiced their frustration on X that Zoe's absence, and lack of intel from bosses, is unfair on licence fee payers. One wrote: 'Is this a BBC scandal, complete misuse of licence payers' funds. 'Zoe Ball gets to pick and choose her contract terms and conditions. Read More Where is Zoe Ball? Concerns mount over star's five week absence from Radio 2 show 'She's never at work, more holidays than you can imagine. Are we mugs paying for this? No comment.' Another added: 'Why are the BBC still paying Zoe Ball when she is still off air, just get rid of her for someone who does want to work early morning shift.' As well as taking time off this summer and for her look after her ill mother in March, Zoe also spent three weeks away from the station last year to host Mamma Mia! I Have A Dream for rivals ITV. The series, set in Corfu, won't be returning for a second season. Zoe has been beset by hardship over the last few years. Following the breakdown of her marriage to Fatboy Slim, Zoe found love again with her partner Billy Yates, but their relationship was also not set to last. After a long battle with depression, Billy, 40, took his own life in May 2017 at his home in Putney, London. The Radio 2 presenter previously told how she felt 'really grateful' he had said goodbye to her the last time she saw him. Fighting back tears as she spoke about their final moments together, she said: 'He got on his bike and he cycled off and he turned round and he blew me a kiss goodbye, and that was the last time I saw him.' Following the breakdown of her marriage to Fatboy Slim, Zoe found love again with her partner Billy Yates, who took his own life in May 2017 (Zoe and Billy pictured together) She added: 'It was just that moment and that feeling of ''Oh my god I love him so much, we'll find some help and it will all be okay.'' And I wish I'd told him that.' A year after his death, Zoe took part in a gruelling Sport Relief challenge to cycle 350 miles in five days in his memory and to raise awareness of mental health issues. In May the star paid tribute just a week after confirming the tragic death of her mother Julia. Following his death, Zoe said she had been 'in shock for two years' following the loss. Alongside a snap of Billy, the radio host wrote: '7 years kisses in the sky'.

One to go.Wednesday's interest-rate cut might have marked the end of the Fed's fight with inflation, but it also signaled the start of another battle with an equally formidable foe: the job market.The central bank's jumbo cut shows the concern isn't prices continuing to go up, but the number of available jobs going down.Fixing the labor market is a tricky thing. It's not as if millions of people are out of work. The unemployment rate sits at 4.2%, which is pretty good. (Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was close to what you'd call \"maximum employment,\" and sees it inching up to just 4.4% by the end of this year.)But finding a gig is proving particularly difficult for those without jobs or unhappy in their current ones.Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing costs, which could lead companies to start hiring again. But there's a snag here, too. The key lending benchmark for everything from mortgages to corporate debt, the 10-year US Treasury yield, actually increased yesterday.That's because the market is forward-looking and had already started pricing in the rate cut before the announcement.It's also not necessarily a bad thing. The 10-year US Treasury yield going slightly up is a sign investors aren't expecting a recession, as that would require the Fed to quickly drop rates, but it also means borrowers might not get much relief soon.Still confused? Here's a full explainer on the dynamic between the Fed and the 10-year US Treasury yield.Meanwhile, the stock market is loving this post-rate-cut environment.Investors' favorite trade over the past year-plus — artificial intelligence — was booming on Thursday. Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and ASML all surged. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished the day up 2.51%.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed at all-time highs.The good times could keep rolling if past Fed policy is an indication of future returns. The central bank's strategy looks awfully similar to its approach to avoiding a recession in 1995, according to one economist.Back then, the Fed eased rates from 6% to around 4.75% over three years. Along the way it sparked an economic boom and sent the S&P 500 soaring 125%.Meanwhile, the cut poses unique challenges for both presidential candidates.Former President Donald Trump downplayed the cut as either a sign of how bad the economy is or an example of the central bank \"playing politics.\"While Vice President Kamala Harris would normally celebrate the move as evidence of the economy's turnaround, doing so risks backing Trump's claim that it was a partisan move.The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

The former president claims Harris ‘spied’ on his campaign because Iranian hackers stole information and gave it to the Democrats in an effort to interfere with the 2024 presidential election, according to the FBI. He is also demanding the vice president resign in the wake of these allegations. ‘WHEN DOES KAMALA AND HER CAMPAIGN GO BEFORE A GRAND JURY ON IRAN, IRAN, IRAN?’ Trump questioned in an all caps post on Truth Social on Thursday. ‘MY CAMPAIGN WHEN THROUGH HELL ON THE RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA HOAX. THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE IRAN/KAMALA CAMPAIGN CORRUPTION CASE IS REAL!’ he concluded. It comes after Iranian hackers offered information it stole from Trump’s campaign to President Joe Biden when he was still the 2024 candidate up against the former president. Microsoft revealed in August that hackers tied to the Iranian government have for months been trying to influence the presidential election. And on Wednesday, the FBI claimed the cyber-terrorists sent unsolicited emails containing stolen information from the Trump campaign to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, is now questioning why the Biden or Harris campaign did not turn over this information or report it to authorities. ‘What did they do with Iran’s espionage?’ he questioned on X. ‘Did they contact law enforcement?’ ‘Is the Biden-Harris Administration colluding with Iran?’ In an all caps Truth Social post, Trump concluded the new report proves that Harris was spying on his campaign and demanded that his rival resign – but said she would only be replaced by a ‘communist’ candidate. ‘WOW, JUST OUT!’ Trump wrote on his social media site on Wednesday. ‘THE FBI CAUGHT IRAN SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GIVING ALL OF THE INFORMATION TO THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN.’ ‘THEREFORE SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN WERE ILLEGALLY SPYING ON ME.’ ‘WILL KAMALA RESIGN IN DISGRACE FROM POLITICS?’ he questioned. The new evidence claims Iranians sought to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into sensitive information from Trump and offering the material to Biden’s campaign. But in late July, Harris took over her boss’s reelection campaign and is now the Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November. A spokesperson for the Harriz-Walz campaign said they were ‘not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign.’ ‘A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.’ The spokesperson went on to say they’ve ‘cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities’ since they were informed of the foreign operation. Trump also spoke out about the hack attempt at his rally in Long Island, New York on Wednesday. ‘Biden is working with Iran and Iran doesn’t exactly like me because they were ready to make a deal, except we had an election that was rigged and stolen.’ There’s no evidence that any of the recipients of the hacked information responded, officials said, and instead prevented it from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election. The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden’s campaign before he dropped out on July 21 and endorsed his vice president to take his spot. The emails ‘contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,’ according to a statement from the FBI and other federal agencies. It represents the latest effort by U.S. officials to call out Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the 2024 election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. Additionally, the FBI uncovered a plot by Iranian-linked individuals to assassination Trump and other U.S. politicians and officials – like President Biden and former 2024 Republican primary candidate Nikki Haley. The Justice Department has been preparing charges in the latest breach.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump says a federal case needs to be brought against Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump inquires about Kamala Harris appearing before a grand jury following his accusations of spying on Iran. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-inquires-about-kamala-harris-appearing-before-a-grand-jury-following-his-accusations-of-spying-on-iran/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump-asks-Kamala-Harris-when-she-will.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:08:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":256866082,"title":"Former NFL kicker reveals why he's backing Trump and how he's trying to help turn a key swing state red","text":"Former NFL kicker and \"NFL on CBS\" broadcaster Jay Feely has endorsed former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election. Feely's endorsement is one of many Trump has received from the sports community, also earning support from Hulk Hogan, Dana White and Brett Favre. He opened up about why he is putting his support behind the former president during an interview on OuKick's \"Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich.\" \"If you look at Donald Trump and you do it objectively, and you just look at his three or four years in office, really three years prior COVID, and you look at any objective measure compared to four years of the Biden-Harris administration, and you talk about the things that matter to people at home, you talk about the economy, you talk about safety, you talk about shelter, their home, the border, the economy, the things that matter to the people at home, by every objective measure Donald Trump did a better job than the Biden-Harris administration.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Feely grew up in Florida, but he and his wife currently live in Phoenix, where he first lived when he played for the Arizona Cardinals from 2010-2013. Feely has five children: Lexi and Delmonte, who are each married; Jace, who is also a kicker and plays at University of Colorado under Deion Sanders; and Abby and Olivia, who are in high school. Feely believes that people in his state have a chance to flip Arizona back to voting Republican in the upcoming presidential election after Trump lost the state in 2020 to President Biden. However, he has a message to fellow Republicans in the state ahead of November. \"There's over 200,000 registered Republicans in Arizona that didn't vote in the last presidential election … If half of those people vote … just half the registered Republicans in Arizona, [Trump] wins the state of Arizona! It holds true in each of those swing states as well. So people who are registered Republicans, they just need to get out and vote for Donald Trump. I don't understand to me, how you wouldn't because the two parties have never been further apart,\" Feely said. WOMAN WHO WAS FORCED TO THROW MAGA HAT IN TRASH AT ARIZONA CARDINALS GAME GETS APOLOGY FROM TEAM \"The ideas and what they want to do with our country are so diametrically opposed to each other, that I don't understand that are like ‘well I don’t like Donald Trump so I don't think I'm going to vote for him,' … to me, I don't understand that. You vote for policy.\" A Fox News election survey published on Aug. 28 shows that Vice President Kamala Harris currently leads the former president in Arizona by less than one point. In the Arizona Senate race, Democrat Ruben Gallego leads Republican Kari Lake by 56%-41%. Trump won the state in 2016 by 3.5 points. Arizona had previously been won by a Republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections dating back to 1952, only losing it once in that span, in 1996.

If you like Trump, you should be able to express your beliefs. \"Hopefully we can get back to that someday.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"Former NFL kicker Jay Feely told OutKick&apos;s Dan Dakich why he has taken a stance of supporting former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election as an Arizona native.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-nfl-kicker-reveals-why-hes-backing-trump-how-hes-trying-help-turn-key-swing-state-red","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/Jay-Feely.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:05:05","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":256865602,"title":"Trump slammed as antisemitic for blaming Jews if he loses: 'Vile and dangerous'","text":"2024 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly accused American Jews who vote Democratic of betraying their faith and hurting Israel, and major Jewish organizations — including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Jewish Democratic Council of America — have called out those comments as antisemitic.

Tim Walz was chosen to fill out the presidential ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris. Conversely, it has provided targets for Republicans trying to soften up Walz on the national stage. “It” is the Minnesota Miracle 2.0 — at least that’s what those who support it call it. The sweeping legislative agenda was adopted by the House and Senate in five months of 2023 and signed into law by the DFL governor. Alternatively called “transformational” and “bonkers,” it covers too many pieces of legislation to list, but here are a few: expansive abortion rights, paid family leave insurance, recreational cannabis, gun-safety laws, targeted tax cuts for moderate-and-low-income Minnesotans, child tax credit expansions and tax hikes on high earners. But without what is called the DFL trifecta — narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate — none would have been accomplished. Now, as the agenda is getting national attention and the 2024 races for the state House intensify, how do voters view what happened? Do they endorse the DFL viewpoint that they broke through the partisan gridlock that had marked the previous four legislative sessions to pass needed legislation, or the GOP response that the majority rammed through expansive, expensive and mistake-ridden laws? The MinnPost/Embold Research polls of likely Minnesota voters sought to measure the assessment of the 2023 session, asking a pair of questions to gauge voter opinions. The same questions were posed in a poll last November and again this month. The result? Minnesota voters are somewhat divided over divided government, with the poll respondent’s party affiliation being the most-likely explanation for their answers. It also identified an apparently — but not necessarily — contradictory response by some voters who agreed with both statements. As you may know, the Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL) gained full control of state government in 2022, holding the Governor’s office and both houses of the state Legislature. Below are Below are two statements about the 2023 legislative session: STATEMENT A: The success of the 2023 legislative session will make huge differences in the lives of Minnesotans – This proves that more gets done when one party controls the state government. STATEMENT B: The 2023 legislative session was bad for Minnesotans. When the parties share control of state government, it results in compromise that is better for Minnesota. Which statement do you agree with more? 25% Much more with Statement A16% Somewhat more with Statement A13% Equally with both statements18% Somewhat more with Statement B29% Much more with Statement B The numbers are nearly identical to the responses in the November poll, though the combination of “much more” and “somewhat more” in November was 38% and the aggregate total was 41% this month. Looking at the subgroups provides some predictable results — those identifying as Democrats support Statement A with 78% saying they agree with it much more and somewhat more; Republicans support Statement B with a total of 85%. Demographic groups that are generally aligned with a party — urban voters vs. rural voters, college degree holders vs. less than college, voters of color vs. white voters — follow the same pattern with the former more in support of Statement A and the latter more in support of Statement B. One puzzling result is the number of people who responded that they agree equally with both statements. That’s because the question was phrased to encourage an A or B choice. Ben Greenfield, a pollster with Embold who worked on the poll, said there were similar results in November, something he attributes to two factors: so-called “pure independents” who pick the middle choice, and the proposition that while some might like the accomplishments of the 2023 session, they also think shared political power is a positive. “We had 167 respondents who identified as pure independents (independents who lean toward neither party), so it is not a huge group,” Greenfield said. “Most pure independents are not inclined to prefer unified control of the state government. But we still do see a sizable percentage of independents (21%) who agree equally with both statements: that unified control does lead to a more productive state government, but also that shared control can lead to better outcomes.” Kevin Parsneau is a professor of politics and government at Minnesota State University, Mankato. After looking at the poll results, including the crosstabs showing how demographic subgroups responded, Parsneau said respondents were fairly divided between agreeing with Statement A and Statement B but that a plurality seems interested in the concept of bipartisanship and compromise. “Generally speaking, people prefer the concept of bipartisanship,” he said. Pure Independents tended toward that choice more than others. “It sounds good to them.” But the concept and the reality of divided government are different. DFL leaders will argue that divided government in the eight years before the 2023 election led to gridlock, not compromise. “The idea of bipartisanship has appeal, even among partisans. They just want the other side to compromise toward them,” Parsneau said. “I’m in favor of compromise with my wife when I’m not the one giving in.” Parsneau said he also noted that voter sentiment toward Walz and the DFL-controlled Legislature is relatively supportive, at least as supportive as voters are of government now when any positive number is good. Both received approval scores of 50%. “They’re not angry at Walz to the point where they would want divided government,” he said. “They don’t look like they are on the verge of punishing Democrats.” Parsneau spoke of a theory in political science called the “responsible party government” that says voters prefer single party control as a way of seeing how they would act in power and reward or punish them. “This poll suggests that might be a nice theoretical concept but voters are uneasy with it,” he said. “But they’re also not particularly unhappy with Walz or the Democrats.” Another poll question asked voters to rate the job performance of the players in state government. In addition to rating Gov. Tim Walz, poll respondents were asked to grade the work of DFL members of the state Legislature and GOP members of the state Legislature. Even though support for Statement A above — a statement that endorsed the DFL take on the 2023 session was less than support for Statement B which reflects the GOP sentiment, DFLers were given higher approval ratings overall. Of those polled, 27% said they strongly approved of the legislative DFL’s job performance and 22% said they somewhat approved. In turn, 14% said they somewhat disapproved and 37% said they strongly disapproved. For the GOP, which was in the minority in both the House and Senate in 2023 and 2024, the numbers were weaker. Only 9% said they strongly approved, 33% said they somewhat approved, 27% said they somewhat disapproved and 31% said they strongly disapproved. Those job approval numbers are slightly below those given to President Joe Biden with 44% approving and 56% disapproving. MinnPost freelance data journalist Michael Nolan contributed to this report. METHODOLOGY Embold Research surveyed 1,616 likely 2024 voters in Minnesota, between September 4-8, 2024. We used the following sources to recruit respondents: targeted advertisements on Facebook and Instagram (1132 respondents) text messages sent, via the Switchboard platform, to cell phone numbers listed on the voter file for individuals who qualified for the survey’s sample universe, based on their voter file data (484 respondents) Regardless of which of these sources a respondent came from, they were directed to a survey hosted on SurveyMonkey’s website. Ads placed on social media targeted adults living in Minnesota. As the survey fielded, Embold Research used dynamic online sampling: adjusting ad budgets, lowering budgets for ads targeting groups that were overrepresented and raising budgets for ads targeting groups that were underrepresented, so that the final sample was roughly representative of the population across different groups. The survey was conducted in English. The survey was conducted online by Embold Research on behalf of MinnPost. Post-stratification was performed on age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, region, and 2020 vote. Weighting parameters are based on the demographic composition of 2024 general election voters, based on probabilistic turnout scores provided by Deck. These scores incorporate past vote history and demographic factors, as well as environmental factors including media coverage, fundraising numbers, and candidate demographics. Presidential results were obtained from the Minnesota Secretary of State. The modeled margin of error* for this survey is 2.8%, which uses effective sample sizes** that adjust for the design effect of weighting.","summary":"Minnesota voters seem to like the concept of divided government but also gave the DFL-controlled Legislature high marks.\n\n\nThe post Poll: A puzzling split among voters over DFL trifecta that produced ‘Minnesota Miracle 2.0’ appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2024/09/poll-a-puzzling-split-among-voters-over-dfl-trifecta-that-produced-minnesota-miracle-2-0/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MNHouse031624_940.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:01:00","author":"Peter Callaghan,Tom Olmscheid","authors":["Peter Callaghan","Tom Olmscheid"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.471},{"id":256864652,"title":"‘Delusional’ Donald Trump Mocked for Claiming 'Everyone' Agrees He Won the Presidential Debate","text":"Republican nominee, Donald Trump, doubled down on his claim that he won last week's presidential debate against Kamala Harris, even though polls suggest otherwise.

As reported by Raw Story, he stated, \"Finally everyone is agreeing that I won the debate with Kamala. It was like a delayed reaction but, as one political pundit said, 'Trump is still the G.O.A.T.'\" In response, netizens mocked Trump and labeled him as 'delusional.'

As reported by Politico, MacCallum said, “Seems like the American people would love another opportunity to see these candidates. It’s been such a short window and they deserve as many opportunities as possible. We certainly hope they will take us up on that.” A spokesperson for Harris confirmed that she's open to a debate in October.

Historians generally trace the term to the year 1144 in Norwich, England, when the corpse of a 12-year-old child was found. As part of a campaign to establish the dead boy as a martyr and the church where he was buried as a (profitable) pilgrimage site, an enterprising monk wrote a series of tracts blaming local Jews for his murder. Supposedly, Jews needed the blood of innocent Christian children to leaven their Passover matzohs. Corrupt government authorities bribed by Jewish money were alleged to have covered up the crime. And so it has gone for centuries: a totally imaginary slander kept alive by bigots and crackpots from Russia to Southern California. “You are not forgotten, Simon of Trent,” wrote a gunman who shot up a synagogue near San Diego in 2019, referencing a slain toddler allegedly martyred in 1475. “The horror that you and countless children have endured at the hands of the Jews will never be forgiven.” Events in Ohio, however, demonstrate that antisemitism is far from the only form of racist scapegoating in America today. The Trump Cult has gone downright medieval on undocumented immigrants. Donald Trump himself calls them “vermin” who are “poisoning the blood” of (white) Americans. During his catastrophically bad debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, the former president charged Haitian immigrants in Springfield with unspeakable crimes. “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” Trump said as the split screen broadcast showed Harris looking on incredulously. “They’re eating the cats,” Trump continued, repeating an internet conspiracy theory that local police call totally unsubstantiated. They attribute the rumors to a Facebook post citing its source as a “neighbor’s daughter’s friend.” The author has herself admitted that she has no idea if it’s true, and regrets posting it online. Challenged by debate moderator David Muir, Trump doubled down. “But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.” Would it shock you to learn that no such firsthand accounts exist? Not even on Fox News, presumably because nobody in Ohio can be found who’s willing to endorse so crazy a story even for the sake of the orange messiah. It would turn their lives upside down. For most Americans, kidnapping and cooking a family pet would be a more shocking crime than, well, pretty much anything I can imagine. That’s what makes it a blood libel: a false accusation that seeks to render its targets subhuman. Beneath contempt. It follows that anybody who would endorse it deserves nothing but scorn. For all the predictable whining of his supporters about how terribly unfair it was of ABC moderators to correct this grotesque lie, the simple truth is that Trump hurt himself. “You stupid mf’ers just got Trump to repeat your lie about the pets,” right-wing talk radio host Erick Erickson wrote on X. “Congrats on setting the news stories tomorrow by lying so Trump picks it up.” Yeah, well, nobody made him do it. The combination of Trump’s own ignorance, credulousness and bigotry caused him serious political harm. So, it’s only fitting that the worst vice-presidential candidate in recent American history not only doubled down on the libel, but went on national TV and bragged about it. Seriously, what is wrong with JD Vance? The reason he endorsed the anti-Haitian scare stories, he said, wasn’t that they are true, he admitted to CNN’s Dana Bash, but to correct news media bias. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people,” Vance said, “then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast.” The normally unflappable Bash emphasized that Vance had just admitted the whole pet-eating business was a made-up story. The candidate didn’t deny it. “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,” he insisted. Meanwhile, the kinds of MAGA cranks who appear to see Trump as semi-divine and incapable of error sprang into action. The small city of Springfield was besieged by bomb threats and warnings of impending violence that led to school, hospital and university closings. Predictions of mayhem caused panic among the Haitian community. They are legal immigrants actively recruited to the community to fill factory jobs that had gone begging, as local authorities, business leaders and Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine emphasized. It’s all nonsense, a classic blood libel blaming the Haitians for the panic some benighted Ohioans feel at their Black faces and Creole-accented voices. To Trumpers, poor deluded fools, that makes them frightening and evil.

Memo: Celebrating a tradition that marks the change in power","text":"WASHINGTON — Hammering began this week on an inaugural platform outside the west side of the U.S. Capitol, a reminder of the transfer of power that will take place Jan. 20. The completed platform will be large enough to hold 1,600 inaugural guests, including members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, Supreme Court justices, former presidents and the new president and vice president, who could be Gov. Tim Walz. So, it could be fitting that in a ceremony this week celebrating the construction of the 60th inaugural platform, the first nail used to build the structure was made from iron ore mined and processed on Minnesota’s Iron Range by U.S. Steel at its facilities in Keewatin and Mountain Iron. And the hammer used was made by Malco Tools of Annandale. However, it was not Walz but rather Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the one who drove in that first nail, who made the decision to use iron mined from the Iron Range in the ceremony. “The Presidential Inauguration is a powerful symbol of American democracy and our country’s commitment to the peaceful transfer of power. Today’s ceremony marks the beginning of this cherished tradition,” Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. Meanwhile, inside the U.S. Capitol, another tradition was taking place — brinkmanship over the federal budget. An attempt to pass a short-term “continuing resolution,” or CR, that would fund the federal government past the end of the federal fiscal year, Sept. 30, failed Wednesday. The reason? The legislation would fund the government at current levels for six months, which Democrats say is too long without adjustments to the budgets of federal agencies called “anomalies.” It also had unrelated legislation attached — a bill called the SAVE Act that would overhaul voting laws to require people to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Democrats oppose the SAVE Act because they say many low-income citizens, especially minorities, don’t have passports, birth certificates or other documents the law would require and there is no proof that non-citizens are voting in U.S. elections, something that is already illegal. “I voted in favor of this legislation because it includes the SAVE Act, a bill that prevents non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, from voting in our elections,” Rep. Brad Finstad, R-1st District, said in a statement. Meanwhile, 14 Republicans, none from Minnesota, voted against the CR, mainly because they oppose short-term funding mechanisms that “kick the can down the road” when it comes to passing a new federal budget. So the legislation failed and there is a little more than a week before the federal government will shut down because of a lack of funding. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-4th District, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, took to the House floor to decry the effort to pass a six-month CR that contained the Save Act. She said Republican leaders in the House “wasted months writing bills loaded with extreme social polity that is rejected by a majority of Americans.” She also said locking in the current level of government spending for six months “would be irresponsible, and the Department of Defense has identified the consequences for our national security and negative impacts on our military personnel and their families.” “We should reject this legislation — pass a short-term CR — and roll up our sleeves and get to work,” McCollum said. So, House Speaker Mike Johnson has a tough choice to make. Will he try to cut a deal with Democrats and President Joe Biden on a three-month stopgap funding bill with some anomalies? Or will he stick to his failed plan and risk a shutdown of the federal government, something Donald Trump is urging him to do? Smith, AOC push big affordable housing plan Sen. Tina Smith. D-Minn., teamed up with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on a longshot proposal aimed at providing billions of dollars in federal funding to provide affordable homes across the United States. The legislation proposes a public alternative to private developers to meet the immense need for affordable housing, especially for low-income households. Under the legislation, a new social housing authority would function as both a bank and developer for resident-owned coops, community land trusts, public housing and other market alternatives. If it were to pass, the Homes Act of 2024 would enable the federal government to acquire real estate that would be turned into affordable housing, build new subsidized homes and apartments and finance other projects for rent or purchase. The bill faces long odds and has a steep price tag — about $30 billion a year. But Smith and Ocasio-Cortez say the time has come for social housing, which is used in Europe and a few communities in the United States. “Instead of treating real estate as a commodity, we can underwrite the construction of millions of homes and apartments that, by law, must remain affordable,” the lawmakers said in a joint op-ed published this week by the New York Times. “Some would be rental units; others would offer Americans the opportunity to build equity. These models of rent caps and homeownership are already working around the world, such as in Vienna and in some parts of the United States.” Noah Hobbs, of One Roof Community Housing in Duluth, was among those who helped the lawmakers introduce their bill at a press conference just outside the U.S. Capitol. He said “The Homes Act” is the first meaningful housing legislation in 30 years “besides those that responded to crises like the pandemic.” One Roof Community Housing builds affordable multi-family housing and has a community land trust that refurbishes existing houses and builds new ones for lower-income buyers. “We’ve seen that de-commodifying the real estate market increases affordability for those earning 80% of an area’s median income,” Hobbs said. Walz watch The governor was deployed by the Harris-Walz campaign to the South this week, where he traveled to Georgia (and where one heckler shouted, “You can take your hot dish and shove it!”) and North Carolina — both swing states. At a rally in Asheville, N.C., Walz initiated a week-long effort to mobilize young Americans to register to vote and go to the polls in November. But perhaps his most important job is preparing for the Oct. 1 debate with Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate. The New York Times said Walz is intensifying his debate prep and that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is serving as a stand-in for Vance. Meet you at the MinnPost Festival I will be attending the MinnPost festival Sept. 28 and am eager to meet some of our readers — and of course crash the VIP reception in the evening. I’m also eager to learn from some of the panelists the festival will feature and from readers who can tell me what kinds of stories interest them most. I’d love to hear what kinds of stories interest you most. This is my first MinnPost Festival, so I could use some tips from veterans. The festival runs all day Saturday, Sept. 28, and will feature CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Pulitzer Prize winning author David Rohde, Timberwolves Chief Executive Ethan Casson, Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous and many more really interesting people. Hope to see you there! ICYMI It’s the time of the election cycle that kicks off polling season, and MinnPost is not immune. In a joint effort with Embold Research, MinnPost is releasing a number of polls that reveal the political mood in Minnesota. Some ran this week. –One story showed Kamala Harris with a slim lead over Donald Trump in the state. -Another showed Walz’s popularity has been boosted by his new role as Harris’ running mate. -Still another looked at what Minnesotans — in the Twin Cities as well as Greater Minnesota — shared with pollsters as their top concerns. Your questions and comments A reader was concerned about a story on a poll that showed Sen. Amy Klobuchar leading GOP Royce White by 52% to 41%. “That two out of five support White, who is totally unqualified for the job, is disturbing,” the reader said. Another reader said he is disappointed that the Minnesota Republican Party does not recruit better candidates to run against Democrats like Klobuchar. “Non-DFL folks in this state limp along wondering when local GOP people will step off their death-march campaigns and enter the fray with serious players, serious tactics, and dedication to winning battles — and wars,” the reader said.

Responding to a question about food costs, Trump told the Michigan audience that his plan would entail both energy deregulation and protectionist restrictions on food imports, which, he claims, would help American farmers. Leaving aside that U.S. grocery inflation has been dead in its tracks since last year—prices are up just about 1 percent compared with summer 2023—Trump is in some sense correct: Reducing fuel costs could reduce food prices a bit if the energy-intensive American agriculture industry passed on the savings to U.S. consumers. And yes, restricting imports of certain farm goods, presumably via Trump’s favorite tool, tariffs, could boost the incomes of American farmers by shielding them from foreign competition. As a plan to lower grocery prices, however, Trump’s protectionism is ludicrous. If implemented, it could even return us to the bad old days of American grocery scarcity. Imports are essential to the U.S. grocery market today, and to its steadily increasing abundance. In 1980, the typical supermarket carried only about 100 different produce items. Selection was limited by North American growing seasons—good luck finding a strawberry in winter—and few Americans had even heard of, let alone tasted, products such as lychee or jackfruit. Today, the variety of produce items has more than doubled, and a stroll through those same aisles reveals an incredible variety. This is thanks to global trade. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 55 percent of fresh fruits and 32 percent of fresh vegetables in the United States are sourced from abroad. Much of this boom in international food trade is owed to agreements struck in the 1990s that allowed more products to enter the United States duty-free. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994, improved Americans’ access to warm-weather produce from Mexico and specialty foods from Canada. Since the late ’90s, fresh-vegetable imports—mainly from these two countries—have nearly tripled. A standout example is avocados, about 90 percent of which are imported today, almost all from Mexico. Our southern neighbor also supplied more than half of all U.S. berry imports in 2023. Globally, the 1995 World Trade Organization agreements, especially the Agreement on Agriculture, significantly reduced worldwide food-related trade barriers. Since then, agricultural trade has more than doubled, giving the U.S. access to foods that would otherwise be unavailable or prohibitively expensive—not just produce but also meats, cheeses, and innumerable foreign specialty items. Bringing back food tariffs, as Trump proposes, would stymie this incredible progress, especially for foods that can’t be easily grown here, such as pineapples. With less available supply and new import taxes, prices would almost certainly rise. In fact, the U.S. already imposes tariffs and other barriers on a wide range of imported foods, including beef, seafood, sugar, and tomatoes. Studies consistently show that these trade restrictions inflate consumer prices. (Sugar, for example, costs twice as much in the United States as it does globally.) In theory, foreign exporters could lower their prices to offset new tariffs, as Trump is fond of claiming. In practice, however, this rarely happens. Evidence from the Trump presidency shows, for example, that American companies and consumers absorbed nearly all the tariffs’ costs, either through additional import taxes or higher prices for both foreign and domestic goods. Given that U.S. grocers already operate on thin margins (historically about 2 percent), the chances of these companies simply absorbing new tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to you and me, are minimal. Of course, if foreign food exporters did somehow pay new tariffs without raising prices, then the tariffs wouldn’t protect American farmers, as Trump says they would. The whole point of a protective tariff is to push consumers toward domestic goods by raising the prices we pay for imports. If prices didn’t change, then neither would the purchasing decisions of American shoppers. In short, if American farmers are earning more because of Trump’s tariffs, then we’re all paying more for the food they make. And if we’re not paying more, then “our farmers” aren’t earning more. Trump can’t have it both ways. As anyone over the age of 40 can attest, American grocery stores weren’t always the global fantasylands they are today. They were smaller, less diverse, and relatively more expensive. Trump’s plan to restrict food imports could drag us back to that era. So although we’re generally not fans of Kamala Harris’s “We are not going back” slogan, we’re with her in this particular case. We don’t want to go back to a time when, say, blueberries were the occasional luxury, and neither should you.","summary":"If you wish grocery stores were more expensive and offered less variety, then you’ll love his tariff proposal.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices/679942/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TlLkQdvktS4xddD0OOiZzUly-Sk=/0x61:2876x1559/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/09/trump_food_tax/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:00:00","author":"Scott Lincicome,Sophia Bagley","authors":["Scott Lincicome","Sophia Bagley"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.18},{"id":256864964,"title":"Matt Walsh’s ‘Am I Racist’ exposes what people did in the name of DEI","text":"The documentary is Walsh’s second original film and the first for Daily Wire+ to hit theaters. Despite the wide release, the movie is not getting the attention Walsh thinks it deserves. The movie focuses on how diversity, equity, and inclusion has turned into a “brainwashing” scheme done by money-making “grifters.” While the film still features Walsh’s famous deadpan humor, there are some major differences between Am I Racist? and his first movie What is a Woman? Instead of just sitting back and letting people “tell their truth,” Walsh is intentionally disruptive in almost every scene. Walsh himself is surprised by how tolerant people were to his antics and actually became disturbed by how far people were willing to go in the name of DEI. “I thought probably after the first time I interrupted, they would kick me out. But they didn’t,” Walsh said. “And it turns out that people don’t want to be the first person to speak up, and so we kind of exploited that a little bit.” One scene in the film is a real event called “Race2Dinner,” where Regina Jackson and Saira Rao sit at the head of a table of white women and criticize them for two hours. Walsh describes the meal as a brainwashing session. “They’ve been doing this for years,” Walsh said. “They explain to white women why they’re racist for two hours as everybody eats their meal. Just listening to these two women breaking these other women down psychologically, it’s a very intense kind of brainwashing session. It was unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed in person before. It was quite, just quite disturbing.” In one of the last scenes, Walsh holds a class as a certified DEI expert. The plan was to set up increasingly ridiculous scenarios until no one was left in the room. However, when it came time for participants to engage in “self-flogging” Walsh was unsettled to find people full of “self-hate” willing to physically harm themselves as a part of becoming “anti-racist.” Many films from Daily Wire+ have faced challenges in distribution, including censorship and lack of legacy media coverage. When What is a Woman? was streamed on X and Elon Musk had to intervene as Twitter employees were actually trying to censor the film. Daily Wire said for the movie Lady Ballers, they had to cast themselves because they couldn’t find anyone to audition. Walsh feels the hostility of the film industry is something the company is constantly fighting against. “The issue now is the mainstream media, and especially mainstream film critics. None of them have reviewed the film,” Walsh said. “They had an excuse with What is a Woman because it was on our platform and behind a paywall. Which is a weak excuse, but at least they had one. Now we have a wide released film, in theaters, and top five in the box office. If you’re a film critic, your job is to watch it, and give us your opinion. But to this point, not a single one has acknowledged the existence of the film, which is pretty interesting.” Am I Racist? currently holds a 98% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes among audience, and for the first week, it did not have a single critic review. The marketing for the film went viral in its own right. Walsh took the opportunity to go undercover at the DNC as a Kamala Harris supporter, sporting a “White Dudes for Kamala” shirt topped with his movie character’s signature blazer and man bun wig. While photobombing a CNN live shot and the distribution of “Project2025.com” cards leading to the film’s website got him quickly kicked out by the police, the Left’s negative reaction to his presence at the DNC contributed to the film’s exposure. “I was only there for a couple minutes before people started recognizing me,” Walsh said. “They were not quite welcoming of me there. Just me being spotted on camera by CNN, that was enough. That’s all we had to do to upset the Left quite a bit. They were very upset that I was there. You should be happy that I was there, being exposed to your ideas. If you’re proud of them.” Walsh criticized the DEI industry for profiting off people’s guilt and the high fees charged for the DEI-related scams he paid to make the film. “There’s a lot of money in it,” Walsh said. “When you convince people they have some sort of guilt because of the color of their skin, and then you tell them, ‘Hey, come to me to atone for your sins,’ which is basically what these DEI people say, people buy into that, and they’re willing to pay a lot of money.” “For the purposes of making this film, we discovered that in order to get these people in the movie, we had to pay them,” he added. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER During the film, the price the team paid was plastered on the screen. Walsh was charged $15,000 to speak with Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility. DiAngelo deleted her X account in response to the film. He said her interview was one of the first things he was able to shoot, and once they got her on camera, he knew they had a movie to show what a scam DEI really is. “If you really think that racism is a big problem in America, and you’re out to defeat racism, or whatever these people say, I know everyone’s got to make a living, but you would think that, hey, if I just want to talk to you about racism, that you’d be eager to sit down and talk,” Walsh said. “You wouldn’t need $15,000 to do it. But that’s not the case with these DEI grifters.”","summary":"Matt Walsh is surprised by what people were willing to do to atone for their “white privilege” during the filming of his new movie Am I Racist?

The union subsequently declined to issue an endorsement, the first time it had not backed the Democratic presidential ticket since 1996. “Rank-and-file union workers like the Teamsters relate to Trump, a builder who has worked with many unions, to a person who has never created working-class jobs,” Dan Bowling, who teaches labor courses at Georgia State University, told the Washington Examiner. What may be even more worrying for Democrats is the shift in the support after Biden left the race. Rank-and-file Teamsters backed Biden over Trump 44.3% to 36.3%, according to the union’s own polling, but two polls taken after Biden dropped out found Trump taking nearly 60% of the vote, with Harris polling in the low 30s. Among the wider electorate, Harris’s numbers are vastly superior to Biden’s. She has pulled ahead in national polling averages after he trailed badly for most of the year. But blue-collar, noncollege-educated workers make up a notable voting bloc of the midwestern blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which will be crucial in deciding the election. Trump’s campaign says it is a strong signal for the former president. “Workers know Kamala Harris — and her support for a fracking ban, electric vehicle mandate, and other Radical Left lunacy — would be devastating,” Trump’s campaign said in a Wednesday statement. “President Trump has always had the backs of American workers — and always will.” The Teamsters union represents a largely male workforce of truckers, rail workers, and UPS drivers and has a historic independent streak. The group endorsed Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush before turning toward Democrats in the 1990s, and it is the only major non-law enforcement union that has not backed Harris this year. Still, the news represents a blow to Harris and possibly a turning point in the identity of both major political parties. Trump has heavily courted union voters this cycle, promising that fracking bans and electric vehicle mandates would gut energy jobs in Pennsylvania and wreck the auto industry in Michigan. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), walked a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year. According to a new Trump campaign ad, Harris wants to “end all gas-powered cars.” #Election2024: \"Kamala Harris wants to end all gas powered cars…Michigan auto workers are paying the price. Massive layoffs already started. You could be next.\"The Trump campaign is up with this new ad in #MIPol. Future Presidential reservations in #MIPol:🔵$56.5m🔴$34.0m pic.twitter.com/Wxcip9sWp5— AdImpact Politics (@AdImpact_Pol) September 19, 2024 The Harris campaign says union voters will back her, pointing to endorsements from local Teamsters groups and her own history of joining picket lines. “The vice president’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her — alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor,” Harris spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. “As the vice president told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what.” A New York Times poll of Pennsylvania voters found that Harris is leading Trump 50% to 46% in the commonwealth. However, Trump led by 13 points with men, and by 27 points with white, noncollege voters. Harris’s support had also slipped relative to Biden among Black and Hispanic voters. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner that the Teamsters are an exception to the rule and that most union voters continue to back Harris. Even so, he said blue-collar workers are especially concerned about inflation and need to hear more from her on that topic. “The No. 1 issue in all of those [swing] states is inflation,” Bannon said. “I would advise the vice president to be very aggressive talking about inflation.” And even if Harris costs Democrats with some union voters, Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) says she is the only person who can win the White House for his party. “If we have a shot to win this election, it’s with Kamala Harris,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Fair or not, we were not in a position with President Biden leading the ticket to be able to compete the way we are now.” Kildee stressed that union voters are not monolithic but said the Democratic Party has done more to support them over the years. “Despite the fact that many of the members of that union [the Teamsters] don’t vote for Democrats, Democrats didn’t say, ‘We’re going to let your pension implode,'” Kildee said. “We feel like the pension is a promise. When Donald Trump was president, he had four years to fix the problems in those pension systems. He didn’t do a thing.” Biden directed $36 billion to a Teamsters pension fund in 2022, the largest private pension bailout in American history.

Here’s a rundown of who has endorsed whom: Harris’s endorsements Politicians Harris is endorsed by most elected members of the Democratic Party. President Joe Biden, who exited the presidential race in July, immediately endorsed her after his withdrawal, and the party generally coalesced around her candidacy quickly. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter have all endorsed her candidacy. She is also endorsed by several former vice presidents, including Republican Dick Cheney as well as Democrat Al Gore. Dan Quayle and Mike Pence have not made endorsements. Harris has the support of all 23 Democratic governors currently in office. There are three elected Democrats who are in reelection battles and have not endorsed Harris. Those include Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME), Mary Peltola (D-AK), and Josh Harder (D-CA). Three Democrats who are challenging Republicans in their House districts also have not endorsed Harris. Those include Lanon Baccam, who is running against Rep. Zach Nunn in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District; Adam Frisch, who is running for an open seat in Colorado’s 3rd District, and Janelle Stelson, who is running against Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) in Pennsylvania’s 10th District. Harris, however, is endorsed by hundreds of staffers, such as those of prominent Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush, and former Arizona Sen. John McCain. She also has the endorsement of McCain’s son, Jimmy. Some former Republican members of Congress have also endorsed Harris, including former Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Joe Walsh of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming. More than 100 former Republican officials also wrote a letter endorsing Harris, calling Trump unfit for office. “We expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues, but we believe that she possesses the essential qualities to serve as President and Donald Trump does not. We therefore support her election to be President,” the letter said. Organizations and business leaders Harris is endorsed by multiple prominent labor unions, including the United Auto Workers, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, and United Steelworkers. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate after releasing internal polling that showed a majority of its members supported Trump over Harris. It’s the first time since 1996 they haven’t endorsed the Democratic ticket. Multiple local chapters of the Teamsters, however, have endorsed Harris, including the Teamsters Joint Council 43 in Michigan, Teamsters Joint Council 39 in Wisconsin, and Teamsters Joint Council 7 and Joint Council 42, which represents 300,000 members across California, Hawaii, Guam, and Nevada. The Teamsters Black Caucus also endorsed the vice president. More than 90 prominent business leaders recently penned a letter highlighting their support of Harris. Those signatories included billionaire Mark Cuban, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, and former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, along with the former heads of American Express, Merck, Starbucks, and Yahoo. She is also endorsed by many civil rights organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign. She also has the support of groups that support stronger gun control like Everytown for Gun Safety. Celebrities and athletes Harris touts many celebrity endorsements, perhaps none more crucial than that of Taylor Swift, who has a wide and loyal following. She endorsed Harris immediately following the presidential debate and more than 300,000 people registered to vote from the link Swift posted. Harris is endorsed by dozens of other musical artists, including Billie Eilish and her brother and producer Finneas O’Connell, Cher, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Usher. She is also endorsed by dozens of Hollywood celebrities, including Matt Damon, Aubrey Plaza, and George Clooney. Harris is also endorsed by NBA superstar Steph Curry, Golden State Warriors and Team USA men’s basketball coach Steve Kerr, who spoke at the DNC, and NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul Jabbar. She is also endorsed by tennis star Coco Gauff. NBA superstar LeBron James, who sometimes dabbles in politics, has not yet made an endorsement, but he has endorsed Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Biden-Harris ticket in previous elections. He has expressed a distaste for Trump and was a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump’s endorsements Politicians Trump is endorsed by most elected Republicans, but some prominent ones have refused to back or comment on the former president. Trump’s third presidential bid has the support of Republican leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and rank-and-file members of Congress. Some Republicans who ran against Trump in the 2024 primaries have now backed him, including his strongest competition, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, as well as Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Doug Burgum (R-ND), Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former GOP Govs. Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie, who also ran in this year’s primaries, have not endorsed the former president and have been vocal critics of him. Trump has the support of many current and former governors, including Govs. Brian Kemp (R-GA), Greg Abbott (R-TX), Jim Pillen (R-NE), and Chris Sununu (R-NH) and former Govs. Doug Ducey, Scott Walker, and Bob McDonnell. Of the living former Republican presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates, just Sarah Palin has explicitly said she is voting for him. McCain, who ran alongside Palin, died in 2018, but Trump frequently criticized the Arizona senator. Quayle has not voiced his support of Trump either, and Dick Cheney is voting for Harris. The 2012 Republican ticket, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, are vocal critics of Trump and have not endorsed him. Pence, whose relationship with Trump turned sour after Pence refused to work to overturn the results of the 2020 election, said he is not voting for Trump, but he has said he could “never” vote for Harris either. George W. Bush said he will not be making a presidential endorsement this year. Every national Republican lawmaker running a race this year has endorsed Trump for president, save for three: former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is running for Senate, and Reps. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) and David Valadao (R-CA). None have voiced their support for Trump. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump in August. The former president also has the support of former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2020. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was pardoned by Trump in 2020, is also supporting Trump’s third bid for the presidency. Organizations and business leaders Trump is endorsed by various organizations, including the Fraternal Order of the Police, which is the country’s largest police organization, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the Associated Builders and Contractors. Billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, and venture capitalist David Sacks are all supporting Trump. He is also endorsed by X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is the only Fortune 500 CEO backing the former president in 2024. Celebrities and athletes Trump is endorsed by dozens of musical artists, including Jason Aldean, Kodak Black, Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Kanye West. Brittany Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’s wife, has shown support for Trump, and the former president recently praised her for “defending him.” Patrick Mahomes, who is a three-time Super Bowl champion, said he is not endorsing a political candidate this election. Brittany Mahomes, however, is reportedly rethinking her support for Trump after Trump criticized Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, for endorsing Harris. Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown and former NFL player and Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker have endorsed Trump. The former president is also endorsed by boxer Jake Paul and U.S. Olympian Caitlyn Jenner.","summary":"Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are raking in endorsements and vying for others from those with influence this election season.

BRET BAIER: Every day as we get closer to the election, we're obviously focused on those swing states for the presidential race, but we're also focused on the battle for control of the U.S. Senate. It really does hang in the balance. You see these yellow states, these are our toss-ups, and as you see our what-if scenario, 49-42, we can say as of today, the RealClearPolitics average of polls, let's just say, who's leading in those will give them the state. Maryland is a lead for Democrats. Ohio is closing, but still Sherrod Brown has the lead there. Michigan is Democrat-leaning. Wisconsin as well. Arizona and Nevada. Republicans right now leading in the polls in West Virginia and Montana. I see I leave Pennsylvania here because I want to tell the story about Pennsylvania. Incumbent Democrat Bob Casey facing Dave McCormick. The RealClearPolitics average of polls in this race has been closing in recent days. There you see it, a little bit more than five points, but the recent poll, the most recent, the Washington Post poll out, has this race tied at 48-48. That is a big deal. If the Republicans manage to pull off this upset win over the incumbent, go back to the map, you can see it would be 52-48.

The White House still calls him a threat. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has mostly discarded that talking point. Trump wants it to stop either way. At least, when directed towards him. It is time to stop the lies, stop the hoaxes, stop the smears, stop the lawfare or the fake lawsuits against me, and stop claiming your opponents will turn America into a dictatorship. Give me a break, the Republican nominee said at a Wednesday rally in New York. Because the fact is that I'm not a threat to democracy, he continued, before turning around and using the rhetoric he just condemned against his opponents. They are. The problem for Trump: Harris has moved on from that rhetoric after the first assassination attempt. She did not use any of the democracy boilerplate during her debut rally in Milwaukee in July, and when she accepted the nomination in Chicago last month, she spoke in broad terms about freedom. This was a sudden change, as Harris was in the habit of denouncing Trump as a threat to our democracy. She used that exact phrase numerous times while Biden was still on the ticket, most recently on July 13, which was coincidentally the day of the first assassination attempt. It took Gov. Tim Walz a little longer. While he won national headlines for branding Republicans weird, the Minnesota Democrat also called Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, fascists. Are they a threat to democracy? Yes. Are they going to take our rights away? Yes. Are they going to put people's lives in danger? Yes. Are they going to endanger the planet by not dealing with climate change? Yes, Walz said at a press conference two weeks after the first attack on Trump. All the same, the change has been complete. And since joining the ticket, Walz has followed the lead of Harris. During the ABC News debate, for instance, she pointed to the Jan. 6 riot, and she took Trump s bloodbath comment out of context. The vice president did not, however, repeat claims that Biden first popularized by saying that democracy itself would end under a second Trump term. The problem for Harris: The Democrats working the hardest to put her in the Oval Office still argue that Trump could end democracy itself. Biden explained at the Democratic National Convention that he was leaving the ticket because that threat is still very much alive. He loved the job, the outgoing president said on stage, before adding, I love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. Sitting in the crowd, Harris beamed. The remarks came little more than one month after the first attempt on Trump s life. The second assassination attempt, this one in Florida last week and thwarted by the Secret Service before the shooter could open fire, did not change White House rhetoric. When pressed on whether it was appropriate to still describe Trump as a threat, an exasperated Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was not just saying that to say it. Instead, the Biden spokeswoman replied, they were using examples, namely the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol which she referenced more than a dozen times Tuesday. Insinuating that Biden had fanned the flames with his rhetoric, an assertion held by Trump and nearly every elected Republican, she said was dangerous. The press secretary repeatedly pointed out that the president and the vice president have always forcefully condemned violence in all forms, including political violence. And the condemnation of violence has indeed been universal. The switch from the old threat to democracy framework, however, has not. While Harris has turned the page on calling Trump a threat, Democratic allies are following Biden s lead, not hers. During a Thursday interview on MSNBC s Morning Joe, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returned easily and quickly to existential rhetoric. At the end of the day, this is a contest between freedom and oppression, between democracy and autocracy, between bringing people together and further dividing us, said Clinton, who hit similar themes at the Democratic convention. That exact message one Harris has shied away from delivering Clinton continued, has to be communicated every single day between now and the election.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/09/20/harris_allies_continue_calling_trump_threat_to_democracy_151652.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:56:42","author":"Philip Wegmann,RCP","authors":["Philip Wegmann","RCP"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":256864610,"title":"Pittsburgh Paradox Could Hand PA to Trump","text":"Pittsburgh’s transformation from Rust Belt phoenix to progressive tech stronghold was supposed to be the Democrats’ long-term ace in the hole for Pennsylvania. Instead, hubris might just hand the Keystone State to the GOP in 2024. As Allegheny County limps toward another election cycle, Republicans are eyeing an opportunity born not of their own strength, but of Democratic complacency and voter disillusionment. The numbers paint a grim picture. Allegheny County hemorrhaged nearly 7,800 residents last year alone, placing it in the top 10 for population loss nationwide. Even more alarming, the county has shed 50,000 jobs in the past five years – five times more than any other Pennsylvania county. The county’s most impoverished suburbs, home to many recent immigrants and other non-white minorities, are facing another round of white flight. On top of that, the future looks even bleaker for those officials tasked with educating future generations of gainfully-employed citizens: Pittsburgh Public Schools are mulling the closure of 16 schools, a move that would disproportionately impact working-class neighborhoods. Yet you'd never know any of this listening to the county's Democratic leadership. Take newly-minted County Executive Sara Innamorato. In 2018, she rode a wave of Democratic Socialists of America-fueled primary upsets to unseat center-left incumbent Dom Costa in the state legislature, infamously referring to the working-class voters she grew up with as “racist” along the way. By 2019, she’d ditched the DSA affiliation and made some concessions to organized labor, like many other young Democrats, but kept some of the progressive bona fides. Her narrow victory over well-funded Republican Joe Rockey in the county executive race in 2023 should have been a wake-up call. Instead, it seems to have lulled local Democrats into a false sense of security. To understand where Allegheny County might be headed, one need only look south to Washington County. Once a union-labor stronghold for the Democrats, Washington County has rapidly become a petri dish for MAGA politics. In 2020, Trump won 61% of the vote there. But it’s not just about presidential politics. MAGA true believers have capitalized on low turnouts to seize control of local government, turning once-staid county commission meetings into wild shouting matches. The rapid transformation of Washington County offers a playbook for how the GOP might chip away at Democratic dominance in Allegheny County. It hinged on voter apathy – depressing moderate-voter turnout, particularly those who saw Washington County’s Democratic machine as irreparably gridlocked and hopelessly corrupt, while galvanizing the MAGA base in both the primary and general elections. The Pennsylvania Department of State reports that Democrats now hold their slimmest voter registration advantage in decades. Republicans, meanwhile, have added nearly 40,000 voters since 2020. In Washington County, this wild shift has greatly increased the temperature and radicalized the tone of local politics. Allegheny County isn't there yet, but the currents are detectable. Consider the recent school closure debacle in Pittsburgh. Nothing saps voter enthusiasm quite like the news that your neighborhood school will shutter – with almost zero possibility for a better outcome, given the demographic catastrophe, further exacerbated by two years of unwelcome COVID closures, now facing the system. For every progressive cheering the city’s blue recycle bins and ban on plastic bags, there's an inflation-wracked working-class family wondering if they have a future in the city their grandparents built. Or take the job losses. Pittsburgh’s much-vaunted “eds-and-meds” economy was supposed to be recession-proof. Now, even healthcare giant UPMC is tightening its belt. The promised tech boom, meanwhile, has largely benefited a small, highly-educated elite – mostly carpetbaggers happy to inflate property values in the city’s nicer areas and pleased by superficial progressive reforms – while leaving blue-collar workers behind. Republicans don’t need to win these disaffected voters outright, especially in the city, since the county’s white flight-inflated suburbs have long ago been home to legions of right-leaning voters eager to paint the city in the worst possible light. To prevail, the GOP just needs undecided working-class voters to stay home on Election Day. And given the state of things, who could blame them? The irony is that Pittsburgh’s current malaise is, in many ways, a product of its own success. The “Pittsburgh Renaissance” of the early 2000s drew all those carpetbagger yuppies and tech companies. Now, the very leaders who built their electoral brands and government pensions during this transformation are shocked to discover that a city can’t run on artisanal coffee shops and co-working spaces alone. For Republicans, this presents a golden opportunity. While they're unlikely to ever again seize control of Pittsburgh proper, they can use the city’s leftward drift as a boogeyman to drive turnout in the suburbs and rural areas. Every time a Pittsburgh politician has talked about defunding the police, shutting down a polluting smokestack, implementing a Green New Deal, or – as with Innamorato – the racism of white working-class voters, that's fodder for GOP advertisements outside the city limits. Democrats, for their part, seem aware of the danger – the takeover of Washington County received lots of local and national coverage, after all – but have few levers to pull to release all this built-up pressure. They’re so used to winning Allegheny County that they have no reason to make the concessions and cut the deals needed to win coin-flip elections. The result, alas, is a political monoculture that stifles debate outside of niche primaries dominated by left-leaning activists and rewards ideological conformity over practical problem-solving. To give but one example, instead of a robust public debate about how to right-size the failing Pittsburgh public schools while ensuring equitable education, we get vague promises and finger-pointing. It's the kind of thorny, politically fraught issue that single-party rule seems especially ill-equipped to handle. Just judging from the numerous candidate visits and Kamala Harris’ pro-fracking forgiveness tour, it’s clear that all eyes are fixed on the region. For it's here, in the shadow of abandoned mills turned into malls and shuttered churches retrofitted into breweries, that America's political future may well be decided. Can its Democratic elite forge a center-left political identity that bridges the gap between its progressive pretensions and its working-class roots? Can these leaders avoid becoming the weakest link in the Democrats' electoral chain? The anvil of Western Pennsylvania, once used to shape the nation's infrastructure, may yet forge an unexpected political realignment that reshapes the nation itself.","summary":"Pittsburgh's transformation from Rust Belt phoenix to progressive tech stronghold was supposed to be the Democrats' long-term ace in the hole for Pennsylvania.

No other election in the world is scrutinised and analysed as much as the one that decides who will be the POTUS. The reason behind the popularity of the U.S. presidential election–besides U.S.’ influence across the globe–is perhaps the fact that there are two parties and two declared candidates involved. As a result, the campaigning phase in the elections is an elaborate and lengthy affair with the candidates visiting, canvassing, and campaigning across states. In recent memory, the Obama campaign of 2008, referred to by many as the greatest presidential campaign, saw Barack Obama pull one of the greatest upsets in U.S. election history. It was one of the first campaigns in history that utilised the internet and social media to sway voters and make policies known to record a remarkable victory. The 2024 U.S. presidential election has been a chaotic and tumultuous affair, to say the least–some have called it a circus, and justifiably so. While initially slated to be a fight between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the race to White House took dramatic turns as people grasped the new sequence of events unfolding everyday. The timely, untimely nomination Kamala Harris, the incumbent Vice President, announced her campaign for the 2024 U.S. presidential election on July 21, 2024, after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for re-election and endorsed her. While initially seeming reluctant to withdraw, Biden’s move came as a surprise for many given the limited time before the polling would be underway. Despite the limited time at her disposal, Kamala Harris has endeavoured to put on a formidable campaign. On July 22, 2024, Harris secured enough delegate endorsements to become the presumptive Democratic nominee, officially confirmed through a roll call vote in early August. When Harris took the reins of the Democratic party in her hands, many lauded the move as a welcome change for the party, drawing parallels to a Hollywood glow up. Donations started pouring in as soon as Harris’ candidature received the official seal. Harris' campaign raised $81 million in small-dollar donations in the first 24 hours, breaking fundraising records. By August 1, the campaign had raised $310 million. The viral appeal ‘Join the call’ circulated almost daily since Harris launched her presidential campaign in the weeks that followed. Zoom webinar links and organising calls appeared across social media feeds and email listservs, targeting a wide variety of demographic groups including White Dudes for Harris, South Asian Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris, Native Women + Two Spirit for Harris, Women for Harris, Caribbean-Americans for Harris, Filipino Americans for Harris, Disabled Voters for Harris, Win With Black Women, Win With Black Men, and White Women that could play a key role in Harris' coalition. Over $15 million had been raised through virtual grassroots events in the past week, according to a CBS News analysis. Harris announced on August 6 that she had chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the election. “As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his,\" Harris wrote in a statement. \"We are going to build a great partnership.\" Harris' team ensured that no move of hers stays undocumented with videos of every major milestine being captured and shared across her socials. View this post on Instagram In the 24 hours after announcing Tim Walz as Harris' running mate, the campaign raised $36 million. Compared to Biden’s campaign, Harris relies on a broader and more diverse team of advisors. Full-throttle campaign mode Harris adopted Beyoncé's song ‘Freedom’ as the official anthem for her campaign, with permission secured from Parkwood Entertainment on the day of her first rally. In the same month, after Trump played Foo Fighters' ‘My Hero’ at a rally without permission, the band declared that any royalties generated from its use would be donated to Harris' campaign, indicating growing support for Harris. Further, a digital ad featuring ‘Freedom’ was launched on July 25. On August 8, Harris' team released an ad called ‘Determination’ in both English and Spanish, targeting Latino voters in key states. The next day, another ad titled ‘Tougher’ highlighted Harris’ background as a ‘border-state prosecutor’. View this post on Instagram Harris’s first rally took place on July 23, 2024, at West Allis Central High School in Wisconsin, where turnout reportedly surpassed that of any Biden campaign event, with spokesperson Kevin Muñoz estimating attendance at 3,000. A week later, on July 30, Harris held an event at Georgia State University’s convocation centre in Atlanta, drawing 8,000 attendees. There, she directly challenged Trump to face her on the debate stage. Megan Thee Stallion performed and discussed reproductive rights, while Quavo spoke about gun violence prevention. Harris’s official campaign website also lists merchandise for supporters to shop including t-shirts, yard signs, and stickers. A noteworthy incident that happened at a rally dubbed \"I'm speaking\" incident, became a burning topic of conversations across the internet. At a rally at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on August 7, Kamala Harris was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters who chanted, \"Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won't vote for genocide!\" In response, Harris said, \"I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now. I am speaking now.\" When the disruptions continued, she added, \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,\" followed by a sharp look at the protesters. Her supporters soon drowned out the protesters with cheers, as they were escorted out of the venue. .@KamalaHarris to protesters at her Detroit rally: \"You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.\" pic.twitter.com/iUYhOJnAQr — CSPAN (@cspan) August 8, 2024 Harris' campaign has been framed as \"a choice between freedom and chaos,\" centred around the themes of \"freedom\" and \"the future.\" Her team has emphasised her background as an attorney general and prosecutor to build a case against Trump, particularly highlighting his 34 felony charges. Running as a moderate Democrat, Harris has shifted some of her policy positions since her 2019 campaign, aligning more closely with Biden on domestic issues, especially focusing on reproductive healthcare, criminal justice, and civil rights. Her campaign has also been noted for its optimistic and upbeat tone. In July, a key messaging shift involved calling Republicans, including Trump and his running mate JD Vance, \"weird,\" a label also used by Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, and others in the Democratic Party. Harris has been rather vocal with her comments on Trump. At a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Harris commented on Trump's attacks, saying, \"You may have noticed, Donald Trump has been resorting to wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird.\" This focus on \"freedom\" marks a shift from Biden's emphasis on democracy. The Harris-Walz campaign has launched multiple ads focusing on the issues they are fighting and attacking Donald Trump and his policies. Among the issues that Harris supports and that have been highlighted in her campaign are national abortion protections, LGBTQ+ rights, gun control, and legislation to address climate change. She also supports federal cannabis legalisation, strengthening voting rights, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and the federal funding of housing. On the basis of these, her team has tried to position her as a progressive leader who is inclusive and a leader that America needs to The hip Veep Kamala Harris’s campaign has been marked for its extensive usage of social media to tap into the young voter base. Harris’s popularity has risen significantly after her nomination announcement. The Vice President has a social media presence across platforms including X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. Harris also has a bilingual WhatsApp channel to target Latino voters. Harris’s social media accounts have been fairly active since the time of her nomination and have consistently updated followers about her campaign updates. View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram Harris’ social media updates seem to have a personalised touch to them, in an attempt to make people feel more connected to her as a person and stay in touch with her routine. View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram Given Kamala Harris’ popularity among the younger generation, as soon as she entered the presidential race, a sea of memes and reels started pooping on social media. Suddenly, a generation that seemingly couldn’t connect with the earlier nominees namely Biden and Trump given their age, was involved in political discussions and emotionally invested in a candidate they could relate to or perhaps look up to. A-list backing Perhaps the biggest highlight of the Harris-Walz campaign has been the support it has been able to muster from celebrities. Besides being endorsed by four out of the six living U.S. presidents as well as other top U.S. officials, Harris has received public endorsement from some of the most popular faces in America. Among these, perhaps the most influential or most-talked about has been the support of Taylor Swift. Recently, Trump posted AI-generated images falsely depicting the pop star endorsing him. After the debate between Trump and Harris, Swift responded, saying, “I recently found out that AI images of ‘me’ endorsing Trump were shared on his site. It really heightened my concerns about AI and the risks of misinformation. This made me realise the importance of being clear about my actual voting intentions. The best way to fight misinformation is through the truth.” She then confirmed, “I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I support Kamala because she stands up for causes I believe need a strong advocate.” Swift ended the post signing it as a \"childless cat lady,\" referring to remarks made by Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance, and shared a photo of herself with her cat, Benjamin Button. View this post on Instagram In a similar fashion, singer-songwriter Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas took to Instagram to officially proclaim their support for Harris. In a video, Eilish urged her 119 million followers to \"vote like your life depends on it.\" Her brother Finneas, also a producer and singer, added: \"We can’t let extremists dictate our lives, freedoms, or future. The only way to stop them and the dangerous Project 2025 agenda is by electing Kamala Harris.\" Harris’s campaign responded on Instagram, acknowledging the support with a comment referencing Eilish’s song, writing \"Birds of a feather,\" followed by a heart emoji. View this post on Instagram Another monumental trend that spread like wildfire was Charli XCX memes. In June, Charli XCX released her song ‘Brat,’ sparking a trend dubbed ‘Brat summer,’ which celebrates a carefree, messy persona. As calls grew for President Biden to step down, Harris supporters embraced the ‘Brat’ aesthetic, using coconut emojis and sharing green-tinted edits of Harris set to Charli XCX's music. After Biden endorsed Harris and Charli XCX tweeted “kamala IS brat,” Harris’ campaign adopted the ‘Brat’ style, with neon-green visuals and Charli XCX's song ‘360’ featured in campaign TikToks. At the Democratic National Convention, the ‘Brat’ meme appeared prominently, with notable figures including Mindy Kaling referencing it in their attire and speeches. kamala IS brat — Charli (@charli_xcx) July 22, 2024 The Biden campaign’s official account, Biden-Harris HQ, has officially rebranded to Kamala HQ with a ‘brat’ theme. pic.twitter.com/xy4FhdE5h7 — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 22, 2024 Other celebrities who have endorsed Harris include Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, George Clooney, Megan Thee Stallion, Ariana Grande, Jamie Lee Curtis, Katy Perry, Cardi B, Cynthia Nixon, Pink, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Aaron Sorkin, Lil Jon, Oprah Winfrey, Common, Mindy Kaling, Kerry Washington, Eva Longoria, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Foo Fighters, Joe Rogan, and Beyonce among others. As the race to the White House unfolds, the Harris-Walz ticket represents a stark contrast to the Trump-led opposition, framing the election as a choice between progress and upheaval. With momentum on her side, Kamala Harris’ candidacy is a defining moment in U.S. political history, one that could reshape the future of American leadership. Given the limited time she had to campaign before the polling goes underway, Kamala Harris has turned a lot of stones with her efforts. Harris’ campaign team has tried to position the candidate as the progressive leader America needs, with significant marketing efforts being put across mediums to tap into the diverse set of demographics that the Veep has the potential to attract. Add to it, the dash of A-list celebrity endorsements and Kamala HQ's efforts to ride the relevancy wave with Gen Z, the Harris-Walz campaign is giving the Trump-Vance campaign–if not outperforming–a run for its money.","summary":"The U.S. presidential election has always been an event at the epicentre of media coverage and the public eye.

Harris seems unwilling or unable to answer any impromptu question that she has not been previously prepped for. Her answers at the debate were memorized and canned. They never addressed the questions asked. Her single, 11-minute post-debate Philadelphia interview was a shipwreck of dodging and dissimulating -- even though the host was sympathetically left-wing. Even socialist Bernie Sanders pointed out that for Harris to get elected, she must temporarily disown her lifelong leftist credentials. As vice president, she must further deny co-ownership of the unpopular record of the Biden-Harris administration. Left unstated is that whether she wins the presidency -- or loses it and continues as vice president for another three months -- nonetheless she will inevitably revert back to her hard-core, lifelong leftist beliefs. In addition, Harris has reconstructed her privileged upbringing as a child of two PhDs, living in a posh Montreal neighborhood into a struggling, middle-class Oakland childhood. How can she stage such a complete makeover -- and contemptuously count on the voting public to be so easily deceived? She avoids all news conferences, one-on-one nationally broadcast interviews, and town halls. And like Biden, she will debate only on leftist venues with impartial pro-Harris moderators. When asked to provide the details of her past responsibility for the open border, inflationary economy, spiraling crime, attacks on fossil fuels, and collapsing foreign policy, Harris smiles, makes hand gestures, and dodges. She changes the subject to her empathetic personality, her \"joy\" campaign, and her iconic profile as a supposedly dynamic black woman. When pressed, Harris outsources the task of squaring her hypocrisies and subterfuges to the stonewalling campaign, Democratic surrogates -- and the media. Harris is also certainly not running on her demonstrable experience, vision, or intelligence as much as she is not Trump (or, for that matter, her former partner, Biden). To make that distinction stark, Harris must demonize and bait Trump nonstop and make the country fear him. So, she paints Trump as a racist and violent insurrectionist, not a former president whose four-year term saw a superior foreign policy, economy, border, and security than during the Biden-Harris term. Instead, Harris has repeatedly claimed Trump is a dictator and a threat to democracy -- as if he had politically weaponized the FBI, CIA, DOJ, or IRS as had former President Barack Obama and Biden. Trump as Hitler has become a staple Democrat smear for the past decade. That vicious caricature is so entrenched that major Democratic figures assume it's OK to joke about, or seriously call for, Trump's demise. So, Harris's current prominent advisor David Plouffe years ago warned the nation that \"it is not enough to simply beat Trump. He must be destroyed thoroughly. His kind must not rise again.\" Just last year, Rep. Dan Goldman, D-NY, claimed that Trump \"is destructive to our democracy, and he has to be, he has to be eliminated.\" Even after an assassin sought to kill Trump last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries declared, \"Extreme MAGA Republicans are the party of a national abortion ban and Trump's Project 2025. We must stop them.\" Harris's dehumanizing of Trump, outsourcing the campaign to the media, avoiding all public dialogue, and temporarily reinventing one's politics and biography have taken a toll on the country. Harris was coronated the Democratic candidate without ever entering a primary or winning a single delegate by vote. Some 14 million Democrat primary voters were reduced to irrelevancy. Like the 2020 Biden campaign, Harris has nationalized a new kind of cynical campaign in which leftist candidates seek for a few months to deceive the public into thinking they are centrist and moderate -- until elected. Avoiding all cross-examination and outsourcing the campaign to the obsequious media is now the new norm. Most news stories deemed unhelpful to Harris -- the left-wing, pro-Harris politics of the recent would-be Trump assassin, the distortion that dozens of bomb threats were called in against Springfield schools by Trump supporters when most, if not all, were perpetrated by foreign actors, or prominent Democrats before and after the recent assassination attempt blaming Trump for being the target of an assassin -- are suppressed by the media. The recent two foiled assassination attempts on Trump logically follow a near-decade pattern of trying to destroy rather than outvote him. The Russian collusion hoax, the laptop disinformation con, the two impeachments, the effort to remove Trump from some 16 state ballots, and the attempt to jail and bankrupt Trump through five criminal and civil \"lawfare\" indictments and suits also led to the current hateful climate of Trump assassination attempts. Harris thinks her delays, deceptions, and vilifications for the next 47 days will ensure her victory. But if so, it will be because she, her stealth campaign, and her self-proclaimed guardians of democracy have been willing to systematically destroy it.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/09/20/can_harriss_cynical_run-out-the_clock_campaign_succeed_151659.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:51:30","author":"American Greatness,Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["American Greatness","Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.105},{"id":256861890,"title":"Singapore seeks to fight deepfakes in elections, with new laws ahead of 2025 polls","text":"In a bid to shore up trust in public institutions, Singapore is considering making legislative changes that will enable candidates to flag deepfake videos of themselves during elections, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Janil Puthucheary says. The city state joins other jurisdictions looking to clamp down on manipulated media, with its next general election to be held no later than November 2025. Puthucheary, who was among panel speakers on Friday at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Festival of Ideas, said the proposed safeguards would enable election candidates to report digitally manipulated content that realistically depicts them saying or doing something that he or she did not in fact say or do. The proposed Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising) (Amendment) Bill grants the Returning Officer, who supervises elections, the power to issue corrective directions to publishers or service providers. Misrepresented candidates can also declare the truthfulness of their claims. Failure to comply could result in fines, imprisonment, or both. Candidates who submit false or misleading information risk a fine or losing their seats. During a panel on AI governance and disinformation, Puthucheary warned that how voters absorb information is an area “rife for manipulation for AI-driven tools”. He added that the bill, which would be debated in parliament at the next available sitting, was intended to avoid situations in other countries where public trust had been eroded by deep fakes. “It is, in terms of its operations, focused around the candidate … But it has, as its intent, the shoring up of public trust in information discourse platforms, the media, and that sense of institutions having a responsibility above and beyond their own narrow interests,” the minister said. In recent years, Singapore has implemented legislation to tackle fake news and online misinformation. This includes controversial laws such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) and Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which allow authorities to take action against perceived falsehoods or foreign interference in local politics. Puthucheary, who is also the Senior Minister of State for Health, addressed the difference between Pofma and the bill on Friday, saying that with Pofma, there was a “test around public interest and a requirement for an establishment of fact by an authoritative third party”. He explained, for example, how someone might have a very different opinion of vaccines, but ultimately, an academic informing the Health Ministry could advise them that this was against the public interest. Puthucheary said this was a very different process from an election, where the only people who could provide verification that something did not happen were the candidates themselves. “The government is in no position to do so, a third party, an academic, a professor, research institution, is in no position to do so,” he said. He noted that other organisations might have technological views about the material, but whether an act happened was something a candidate had “an interest in expressing, and then a responsibility to address in terms of providing the electorate the correct information”. Puthucheary noted that high trust in institutions such as the government and the media was a “necessary precondition” for discussions on the electoral process, acknowledging that Singapore was privileged to have this trust. Singapore will not be the first country to use legislation to combat AI-generated fakes during elections. South Korea’s National Assembly passed revisions to election laws last December that bar the use of deep fakes in political campaigns. The election administration agency reported busting 129 deep fakes violating laws between January 29 and February 16. Brazil similarly ruled against the use of deepfakes in political campaigning in February. Deepfakes have also been a concern in the US Presidential election.

Winfrey hosted the “Unite for America Rally” a livestream event featuring several celebrities as well as questions and stories from citizens across the country. As the event turned to the issue of gun violence, Winfrey remarked how surprised she was when Harris revealed she was a gun owner at the presidential debate last week. “I did not know that,” Winfrey exclaimed. “And I thought that was powerful.” “If somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot, sorry” Harris replied, laughing. “Yes, yes. I hear that, I hear that,” Winfrey replied. “Probably should not have said that,” Harris said as everyone laughed. “But my staff will deal with that later.” Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. At the presidential debate, Harris said, “I’ve made very clear my position on fracking and then this business about taking everyone’s guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We’re not taking anybody’s guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.” Video recently resurfaced of Harris as San Francisco’s district attorney in 2007 saying police officers could enter the locked homes of legal gun owners and inspect how they store their weapons. “We’re going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn’t mean that we’re not going to walk into that home and check to see if you’re being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs,” Harris said at the time. Social media users pushed back against Harris’ comments Thursday, pointing out her previous support for mandatory gun buybacks and gun control. “Kamala says she would sh**t an intruder who enters her home then says ‘I probably shouldn’t have said that.’ Let’s be very clear. She has repeatedly called to take away your guns and she 100% will if she’s elected. Security for me but not for thee,” Libs of TikTok wrote. The Spectator contributing editor Stephen Miller agreed, “Kamala Harris advocated for door-to-door mandatory gun buyback programs. Maybe a journalist worth the professional reputation would follow up on that one.” Conservative radio host Larry Eldern wrote, “‘Guns for me, not for thee…'” Townhall.com columnist Derek Hunter remarked, “They’ll get shot by the Secret Service because she has around the clock protection. It’s you and your family she wants to screw out of protection. Oprah pays people to protect her.” The “Unite for America Rally” was held by the “Win with Black Women” organization in support of the vice president. Over 140 other grassroots organizations took part in the virtual rally, including “White Women: Answer the Call,” “Latinas for Harris” and “White Dudes for Harris.” The event itself took place in Oakland County, Michigan, to an audience of 400 people with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also speaking. Celebrities like Bryan Cranston, Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Lopez, Tracee Ellis Ross, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep were in virtual attendance as well.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris shocked Oprah Winfrey Thursday when she said any intruder breaking into her home is \"getting shot\" during a virtual campaign rally.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/20/us-news/harris-tells-oprah-anyone-breaking-into-her-home-is-getting-shot-probably-should-not-have-said-that/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90054310.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QYEMBOb4-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:39:35","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":256861998,"title":"Lady Gaga silent as dad endorses 'pure patriot' Donald Trump, praises Elon Musk and slams Kamala Harris","text":"Lady Gaga's father, Joe Germanotta, has slammed Vice President Kamala Harris as fake and endorsed “patriot” Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election. Germanotta also thanked Elon Musk amid the billionaire being investigated over assassination tweets about Kamala Harris. The pop star, who famously champions LGBTQ rights, which the Trump campaign is firmly against, has stayed silent and not yet publicly endorsed any candidates. The singer and actress sang the national anthem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. In an interview with right wing broadcaster Fox News on September 19, Germanotta called Trump and Harris “two vastly different people”, saying: “One of them is pure, and he’s a patriot. “And the other is just going to say whatever she needs to say to get elected. That’s basically what I hear... “If you stack them up side by side, I don't know what the hell she's talking about.\" Germanotta said his business, Upper West Side restaurant Joanne Trattoria, was thriving during the Trump administration from 2017 to 2021, and that business in New York City has taken a turn for the worse since the Covid-19 pandemic. “Six years ago, I was going to have the best year we ever had at Joanne before Covid,” he said. “And when I say [the] best year, it was 25 per cent more than any other year. “My clientele, my customers, the ones that used to come once a week, now they come once every three weeks,” he claimed. “They're not coming to New York City. The tourist business is still fairly strong ... They're still popping into New York. “You can’t get worse than it is now.” Germanotta also said he liked Trump’s policies, including his economic plan, which includes putting major tariffs on overseas investors who want to trade with the US - something many financial experts say will come at a steep price to taxpayers who will ultimately foot the bill when foreign investors are forced to raise prices on their goods to pay the tariff penalties. Gaga's dad also added that he's a fan of most of Trump's other plans, one of which could see a \"Muslim ban\", which the former president has vowed to reinstate and the erasure of LGBTQ+ rights. Germanotta continued: “I mean, look, Donald, yeah, he’s abrasive, okay, but, you know, he’s a patriot, and his policies are there. All right, they’re on target for me anyway. “I’m into low fuel and food prices – low interest rates,” he added. “Good economy, pro-police. Let the police do their job, law and order… Don’t let these protesters burn down our cities and the small businesses. Keep the jobs here in the United States.” Germanotta, who comes from a family of Italian immigrants, also praised Trump’s divisive views on immigration. “It’s been an invasion, as far as I see it. We don’t have secure borders anymore. There’s no more legal immigration. “I endorse Donald Trump. I endorse his policies. Freedom of speech. Thank you Elon Musk. That’s all I’ve got to say,” he concluded. The Standard has contacted Gaga's team for comment.","summary":"Gaga is a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and sang the national anthem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration ","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/lady-gaga-dad-endorses-donald-trump-elon-musk-kamala-harris-b1183132.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/05/08/ef509f57050d15852c01d47f2eb364b4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NjU3NDE3-2.65833414.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:39:04","author":"Dominique Hines","authors":["Dominique Hines"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":256861254,"title":"Laura Loomer Accuses Kamala Harris of 'Hypocrisy' Over Gun Remarks","text":"Laura Loomer has accused Kamala Harris of being a hypocrite, after the Democratic presidential nominee spoke about her personal gun ownership while campaigning on gun control.The former congressional candidate posted a clip of Harris speaking to Oprah Winfrey in which Harris says that she and her running mate Tim Walz are both gun owners, and states: \"If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot.\"Oprah has endorsed Harris and hosted a two-hour Unite for America streaming session in Michigan featuring an in-depth interview with Harris and questions from the audience Thursday. The question of gun ownership occurred during a section of the livestream that was addressing school shootings.Loomer, who campaigns for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, reposted what Harris said to her X account, however she edited Harris' words from \"they're getting shot\" to \"they gon' get shot.\" Whether intentionally or not, Loomer quoted Harris as using African American Vernacular English (AAVE).Loomer accused Harris of hypocrisy, claiming that Harris wants to \"take away people's guns,\" but wants to keep her own.Several people in Loomer's comments section agreed with her accusation of hypocrisy, and expressed doubt that Harris is a gun owner at all.Loomer has become known for attacking Harris. On September 8, Loomer wrote about the vice president on X, saying: \"If Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center and the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call that nobody will understand.\"Harris and Walz have both been open about being gun owners.

However, she is campaigning on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. She is also running on requiring universal background checks.The Harris campaign has been contacted via email for comment.Harris currently oversees the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, where she launched the nation's first National Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) Resource Center, which is built to assist law enforcement in \"optimizing the use of red-flag laws.\"Many of the gun control measures that Harris is running on, such as background checks, and enforcing red flag laws, are highly popular among the electorate. According to recent Pew polling, six in ten Americans believe it is too easy for people to obtain a firearm, and favor stricter gun laws.Banning assault weapons is also largely popular, although more divided along partisan lines, where 42 percent of Republicans, and 85 percent of Democrats support a ban.Additionally, half of Americans see gun violence as a problem in the country, and see an increase in the number of guns as bad for society.","summary":"Former Congressional candidate, Laura Loomer, has accused Kamala Harris of being a hypocrite, after she spoke about her gun ownership on Oprah.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/laura-loomer-accuses-kamala-harrris-hypocricy-1956760","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476543/laura-loomer-tampa-2023.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:36:15","author":"Sophie Clark","authors":["Sophie Clark"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":256861246,"title":"LIVE UPDATES: Mark Robinson Scandal Puts Swing State North Carolina in Spotlight","text":"It's Friday, but if you were hoping for a quiet end to a busy week in election land...think again!

But it seems that the comedian, 47, has already won over viewers before his performance has begun, having left them in hysterics with a string of viral gags. Despite Strictly bosses' attempts to keep its launch free of drama following a string of abuse accusations, Chris stunned viewers, and his co-stars alike, with a brutal gag about the NHS. The funnyman has previously detailed how he made a shock career change after losing his sight 20 years ago, forcing him to give up his job as a web developer. After finding success with his role in the cBeebies series Me Too, he's become a fixture of the comedy scene. Chris McCausland is just hours away from making his debut on the Strictly dancefloor this weekend, with the comic, partnered with Dianne Buswell , hoping to win over the judges But it seems that the comedian has already won over viewers even before his performance track has begun, having left them in hysterics with a string of hilarious viral gags Chris has also offered insight into how he's juggled marital life and fatherhood with his condition, admitting that going blind even made him doubt whether he wanted to start a family. While he's already tickled viewers with his comedy quips, Strictly fans are hoping that he can also impress with his moves. On Saturday, he'll take to the floor for the first time, dancing a Cha Cha to Twist and Shout by The Beatles, joining fellow celebrity contestants Nick Knowles, Tasha Ghouri and Pete Wicks. MailOnline takes a look at how Chris could be the man to save Strictly, in a year that's seen the once-glittering BBC show plagued with drama... Losing his sight Chris started losing his sight 20 years ago, between the ages of 16 and 21, due to retinitis pigmentosa He previously opened up about his blindness while appearing on Channel 4 series Scared of the Dark, admitting that he 'still has an awareness of the space around him' Chris started losing his sight 20 years ago, between the ages of 16 and 21, due to retinitis pigmentosa, a condition which according to the NHS, sees sufferers lose their sight as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina - the light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Read More Strictly's Pete Wicks and Jowita Przystal seen withchaperone after 'anti-bullying' rules enforced The NHS website explains that people with RP lose their vision as light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. It is generally characterised by a black pigmented appearance of the retina when a specialist looks inside the eyes. Speaking about his visual impairment previously while taking part in Channel 4 series Scared of the Dark, Chris explained: 'I'm blind but I don't see black. 'I still see light and space, I still have an awareness of the space around me, not in terms of objects and things, but in terms of the room and whether there might be something in front of me. 'It just gives you that awareness that you're taking that away from me. I'm a slave to my iPhone like everybody else. So on paper you go, 'Well, I should nail this,' but in one area I should be more practically adjusted. 'It'll be quite interesting to see how quickly everybody else gets to that point. I'm quite looking forward to being the most able bodied person for a while. It doesn't happen often.' Career change After losing his sight, Chris was forced to give up his job as a web developer, and decided to become a comedian after trying his hand a new act night in 2003 (pictured in 2009) His career soon skyrocketed, going to to have a seven-year stint at the Edinburgh Fringe and an appearance on Live At The Apollo in 2018 (pictured at the Royal Variety in 2021) After losing his sight, Chris was forced to give up his job as a web developer, saying in 2012: 'I used to be a web site developer but my eyesight got worse and worse and the websites just got uglier and uglier. 'I decided that nobody wanted an ugly website and so made the decision to get out of IT completely. 'I ended up working in a call centre for a while just until I could figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and it was while I was there that I dared myself to give stand-up comedy a go… and here we are nine years later!' After trying his hand in comedy during a new act comedy night in 2003, Chris was soon recognised for his humour after winning the Jongleurs J2O Last Laugh competition, before gaining recognition in other competitions. His career soon skyrocketed, going to to have a seven-year stint at the Edinburgh Fringe and an appearance on Live At The Apollo in 2018, before continuing on to make several TV appearances. In a 2021 interview with The Guardian, Chris shared that he also applied to be a spy with MI5, but ended up failing to make the cut due to his eyesight. 'I got down to the last 30 out of 3,000 for MI5 selection,' he said. 'Eventually, I got refused because of my eyesight. Fair play. It's perfectly acceptable to discriminate for the safety of the nation. The job was identifying and targeting terrorist threats, which obviously you need to do in a limited amount of time.' TV success While pursuing his stand-up career, Chris also made one of his first TV appearances in the cBeebies show Me Too! as Rudi the market trader Since then Chris has been a regular face on flagship comedy shows, as well as Celebrity Gogglebox and Beat The Chasers While pursuing his stand-up career, Chris also made one of his first TV appearances in the cBeebies show Me Too! as Rudi the market trader. The series aired on the channel from 2006 to 2008, and since then Chris has been a regular face on flagship comedy shows like Have I Got News for You, Would I Lie to You?, QI, The Last Leg, and 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. The TV star has also appeared on Celebrity Gogglebox alongside his pal and fellow comedian Donna Preston, as well as an episode of EastEnders. While just last year, he was a contestant on Channel 4's Scared of the Dark, and this year he is set to be the first ever blind contestant to appear on Strictly. Family Life While Chris shares little of his family life on social media, he is father to a daughter called Sophie, with his wife Patricia, and they reside in Surbiton While Chris shares little of his family life on social media, he is father to a daughter called Sophie, with his wife Patricia, and they reside in Surbiton. Read More Who is Strictly Come Dancing's Chris McCausland? Meet show's first-ever blind contestant He recently confessed that having children 'terrified him' as he worried he wouldn't be able to do things properly and would be a 'half dad'. Speaking in an interview with Gyles Brandreth, Chris explained: 'I was in such a dilemma about it because I knew I would regret not having kids, but the thought of having kids terrified me. 'I want to be good at things, I want to do things I'm good at, which is why I didn't end up being a website designer. I would have done it, but I wouldn't have been as good as I could have been if I could see what I was doing. And that idea of doing something to a lower standard because of my eyesight ultimately stops me from doing a lot of things that I've enjoyed. Even football, blind people play football. If I can't play football properly I didn't want to play football.' Making Strictly history In August, Chris became the first ever blind contestant to sign up for Strictly, with the funnyman himself admitting he 'can't dance' During last week's launch, it was revealed that Chris has been paired with Dianne Buswell, and the pair will perform the Cha Cha (pictured with his partner on Friday) In August, Chris became the first ever blind contestant to sign up for Strictly, with the funnyman himself admitting he 'can't dance.' 'If anybody out there is thinking - How the hell is he going to do that? - then rest assured that I am thinking exactly the same thing. 'I don't dance, I haven't danced, I can't dance, I can't see the dancing I will have to do. What can possibly go wrong? Ok don't answer that…!' During last week's launch, it was revealed that Chris has been paired with Dianne Buswell, and the pair will perform the Cha Cha during the first live show of the series. Viral gags Even before his dancing debut, Chris has already left viewers in hysterics by making a hilarious gag about the NHS Even before his dancing debut, Chris has already left viewers in hysterics by making gags that no doubt left many Strictly bosses rattled, with the show currently under investigation amid claims of behind-the-scenes misconduct. Chris used it as an unlikely platform to reference Britain's floundering National Health Service and the ongoing battle to secure a face-to-face doctors appointment. But while the chaos sparked by former contestant Amanda Abbington and her allegations of backstage bullying were swept aside on Saturday, McCausland, 47, aimed a dig at fellow competitor Dr. Punam Krishnan. Krishnan, 41, a locum practitioner and former BBC Scotland presenter, was discussing her hectic work schedule with show presenter Tess Daly after being paired with professional dancer Gorka Marquez, when McCausland stepped in. 'Dr. Punam! You are going to be continuing your work as a GP whilst doing Strictly,' Daly said.'So I imagine you've got to be a bit creative with the old multi-tasking.' 'I've got to be!' she replied. 'The days are very long and I'm a very literal student.' Showing off her high-heeled ballroom shoes, Krishnan, whose main focus is podiatry, added: 'Yes, it's all about the feet now. So over the years, the only thing I've heard is about blisters and blisters getting in the way of dancing. 'So cream, plasters, you name it, I've got it and if it all works I might share.' Krishnan, a locum practitioner, was discussing her hectic work schedule with show presenter Tess Daly, when Chris said: 'Can I just say that none of us can believe we've managed to get in the same room as a GP' The admission prompted McCausland to quip: 'Punam, can I just say that none of us can believe we've managed to get in the same room as a GP.' The remark prompted a mixture of laughs and gasps, with TV personality Pete Wicks open-mouthed at the comedian's light-hearted jibe. However the apparent joke went down well online, with viewers praising the comedian for his honesty. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, one approving viewer wrote: 'I was just waiting for someone to make a joke/comment about seeing a GP.. yes Chris.' While a second added: 'Chris on fire with the GP joke.' Elsewhere a third wrote: 'Chris with his being in the same room as a GP comment. He's just won #Strictly.' Evidently in agreement, a fourth quipped: '@chrismccausland has already won. @TessDaly and @ClaudiaWinkle had better watch out, I think next year’s presenting gig is definitely on the line.' After a year plagued by scandal amid an ongoing BBC misconduct investigation, the show returned with all the bells and whistles on Saturday night as loyal viewers tuned in. Hilarious social media posts Since they began training, Dianne and Chris have also amused viewers with a string of tongue-in-cheek clips, which the pair have posted on Instagram Many fans are now declaring that they are calling for Chris to win the Glitterball, with posts on X including: 'Just give the glitterball to Chris McCausland NOW' Since they began training, Dianne and Chris have also amused viewers with a string of tongue-in-cheek clips, which the pair have posted on Instagram. In one recent clip, Dianne discussed how her father had left a public comment of support on Instagram, with Chris then chiming in: 'Oh the truth came out! 'He also said when Dianne was paired with me even though she's claimed all along she really wanted to be paired to me, that she said to her dad, ''listen dad, winning isn't everything.'' 'How's THAT for a vote of confidence?' Another video showed Dianne asking Chris to feel the length of her thumb, leading him to quip that 'it gave up growing!' Many fans are now declaring that they are calling for Chris to win the Glitterball, with posts on X including: 'Just give the glitterball to Chris McCausland NOW; 'What a joyous contestant' Another said: 'Whoever’s idea it was to try and get Chris McCausland on this year’s Strictly Come Dancing …….

Friday’s decrease in price comes after two straight days of modest price jumps. Before this week’s increases, the recent trend of falling gas prices throughout the country resulted in 17 states having an average price under $3 per gallon for regular gas: Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin. As of Friday, there are only 14 states under $3 per gallon. Gas prices remain a vital topic heading into the 2024 presidential election. A recent commercial by former President Donald Trump focused on high gas prices throughout the country. With President Joe Biden deciding not to seek reelection, Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, has to indicate how she will address the country’s gas prices and energy costs and how both affect the economy and people’s finances. Despite the recent trend of decreases, gas prices have fluctuated throughout the year and vary significantly among states. Overall, gas prices remain higher than when Trump was in office.Click here to see the cost of gas in different states throughout the country.

Prices are also significantly cheaper than a month ago when a gallon of regular gas in Maryland cost $3.366. Delaware Delaware is the state with the lowest gas prices in the Delmarva region. The average price for a gallon of regular gas in the state is $2.97. This was a decrease from Thursday when the price was $2.983 per gallon. Prices are less expensive than a week ago when it cost $2.995 for a gallon of regular gas, and cheaper than a month ago when gas was $3.283. Virginia Gas prices in Virginia continued to fall on Friday as a gallon of regular gas now costs $3.002 in the state. This was a decrease from yesterday when the price of regular gas was $3.012 per gallon. Friday’s prices are also less expensive than last week, when regular gas was $3.073 per gallon, and a month ago, when a gallon of regular gas cost $3.283. Washington, D.C. Gas prices in the nation’s capital continued to fall on Friday, with a gallon of regular gas now costing residents $3.368. This was a drop from Thursday when regular gas was $3.39 per gallon. Like much of the rest of the country, Friday’s price for gas was cheaper than a week ago, when it was $3.461 per gallon. Friday’s price is also considerably less expensive than a month ago, when regular gas cost residents $3.461 per gallon. Mississippi Mississippi is still the state with the cheapest gas in the nation. On Friday, the average price for a gallon of regular gas is $2.715. This was a drop from a week ago when gas was $2.755 per gallon and a month ago when the price was $2.947.

They added they would never forget the “love and support” they had received. Her parents Rob and Gwen Hall said they were “absolutely heartbroken” and that Mabli was “adored” by them and her five siblings. They said she had “brought [them] so much joy in her short life”.

In August, he pledged to make IVF free to all Americans by requiring insurance companies or the federal government to cover it. Trump’s debate statement puts him at odds with most of his party on IVF. Only two Republicans—Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski—voted in favor of the Right to IVF Act, which came before the Senate for the second time this week and included provisions similar to Trump’s promise, requiring employer-sponsored insurance and certain public plans to cover the treatment. The former president’s emphatic interest in IVF also marks a striking pivot for a campaign that has remained mostly muted on reproductive health care, including on the issue of abortion rights. And his focus offers a window into his political calculus as he attempts to retake the presidency. If his party won’t budge on abortion, IVF allows him to signal to swing voters—particularly women—that his populist instincts are still in play. Infertility is an issue that resonates with a large and growing number of American families, and the treatment has high and consistent support across partisan and demographic groups. One out of every 40 babies born in the U.S. in 2022 was conceived through IVF, compared with about one out of 65 a decade earlier. As awareness and use of fertility treatments rise, demand has begun to far outstrip supply. Roughly one out of every eight Americans experiences some form of infertility, and many LGBTQ couples and single people also turn to IVF to become pregnant. Yet few poor and rural areas in the U.S. have fertility clinics; in fact, 80 percent are in New York City. Even in areas where treatment is available, it can be prohibitively expensive. IVF costs an estimated $15,000 to more than $30,000 per cycle, and the average patient needs 2.5 cycles to become pregnant. Trump’s campaign has provided few specifics on his IVF plan; his vice-presidential candidate, J. D. Vance, told NPR that “details get worked out in the legislative process.” But legislators in their own party don’t seem keen to make it happen: Several prominent Republican lawmakers expressed opposition to (or at least confusion about) Trump’s proposal, and even some of Trump’s most loyal congressional allies have stopped short of endorsing government-mandated coverage for the procedure. However half-baked Trump’s free-IVF plan may be, his embrace of fertility rights stands in contrast with his more distant approach to abortion. Since 2022, when the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling paved the way for tighter abortion restrictions in 22 states and counting, Trump has faced intense backlash from women’s-rights advocates and health-care groups. In response, he has wavered on supporting a national abortion ban. In March, he voiced support for federal restrictions on the procedure, but during the recent presidential debate, he argued that abortion access should be left to the states. At the same time, he deflected questions about whether he would veto a ban if it came across his desk. But voters haven’t forgotten that “his fingerprints are stuck all over the Roe v. Wade reversal,” Susan Crockin, an adjunct professor specializing in reproductive-technology law at Georgetown Law, told me. Abortion will likely remain a losing issue for his campaign, she said: This spring, about two years after Dobbs, nearly two-thirds of Americans polled by Pew said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. With IVF, unlike abortion, Trump is taking a clear stance that contradicts core conservative principles. Leaving abortion to the states at least aligns with the traditional Republican position to limit the federal government’s involvement in health care: Senator Mitt Romney similarly highlighted the importance of states’ rights in abortion during his 2012 campaign for the presidency. Trump’s free-IVF pitch flouts those principles, as well as the push among some conservatives to restrict IVF on moral grounds. To many anti-abortion and abortion-rights advocates alike, Trump’s proposal most resembles the Affordable Care Act mandate for employers to cover birth control and emergency contraception, a policy that Trump’s 2016 campaign derided. “This IVF plan is pure populism. It shows he’s not someone with a conservative worldview,” says Cole Muzio, the president of Frontline Policy Action, a conservative Christian group that has lobbied for anti-abortion measures in Georgia. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) Whereas Trump’s evasiveness on abortion comes across as an attempt to please moderates and conservatives alike, his IVF stance strongly suggests which voters he’s most desperate to court. This year, the Trump campaign has been pointedly targeting white and suburban women, a crucial voting bloc in his previous presidential bids. College-educated white women, in particular, exhibit strong support for Kamala Harris, and they are also more likely to use fertility services than Black and Hispanic women or those without a bachelor’s degree. Although Trump’s promises are unlikely to sway staunch supporters of abortion rights, they might win back some swing-state voters who feel lukewarm about abortion and firmly support fertility care. Some early signs suggest that this strategy could pay off: In a September poll in Michigan, the battleground state where Trump announced his free-IVF plan, 29 percent of independent voters said they were more likely to support his 2024 campaign because of it. This advantage might come at the expense of a different, but still key, Trump voting bloc: strong opponents of abortion. Although IVF access has broad support from Christian and self-identified pro-life voters, the former president’s recent statements have angered some anti-abortion advocates, who argue that life begins at conception and that discarding embryos during IVF is therefore akin to murder. His promises could dampen enthusiasm somewhat among white evangelicals, from whom Trump is projected to need overwhelming support in order to win the election. But Trump seems to have decided that he can afford to offend these Americans without losing their votes. As Peter Wehner argued in The Atlantic last month, many anti-abortion voters will likely continue to support Trump, even if begrudgingly. Muzio agreed. “This will be the difference between quietly going into the ballot box and casting your vote for him versus going to Sunday-school class and encouraging your friends to do the same thing,” he told me. Although Harris has linked IVF and abortion access as part of a unified reproductive-rights platform, Trump has attempted to separate the two. He frames his free-IVF plan as its own pro-family issue, even tying it to a proposal for child tax credits. What remains unclear is whether this distinction is meaningful to voters. Last December, less than 1 percent of registered voters ranked abortion as the most pressing problem facing the country.

The man who would later orchestrate the murder of six million Jews and wage war against 1.6 billion people believed that effective propaganda must be simple, emotional, and repetitive to manipulate public perception and achieve political goals. The Big Lie was born. Hitler wrote: “In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility… the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily… in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they more readily fall victim to the big lie than the small lie.” In short, the bigger the lie, the likelier it is to be believed. Donald Trump invoked this same tactic in a baseless claim during his presidential debate with Kamala Harris, when he accused Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, of consuming dogs, cats, and geese. This outrageous fabrication is emblematic of the deep-seated racism that continues to plague American society. Trump’s running mate JD Vance compounded this lie by claiming Haitians are a source of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. This slur, eerily similar to the racist lies spread 40 years ago blaming Haitians for AIDS, mirrors Nazi-driven hatred. Some German physicians falsely blamed Jews for the spread of typhus, illustrating the dangerous consequences of using fear to stigmatise entire communities. Despite these inflammatory statements, local health officials have reported that communicable diseases in the county are at their lowest rate since 2016, even though Springfield’s Haitian population has grown by about 20 000. The lies spread by Trump and Vance go beyond ignorance; they are part of a broader strategy to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about historically marginalised communities of colour, particularly those from the Caribbean. This is not the first time we’ve seen such rhetoric. Trump previously described Haiti and other Black and brown nations as “s***hole countries.” The source of this latest poison is not a misguided conservative ideologue but a neo-Nazi group called Blood Tribe, with support from far-right Trump associate and failed congressional candidate Laura Loomer. Trump’s lies are more than hateful rhetoric targeting lawful residents seeking refuge from violence and chaos under the US government’s temporary protected status. The Haitian population in Springfield did not descend on the town unbidden; they were invited to fill labour shortages. The Haitian community has proven to be industrious, thrifty, and orderly, displaying virtues common to immigrant groups of all races. However, after a fatal accident involving a Haitian driver and a school bus, the incident was exploited to amplify racist attacks against the entire community. By all accounts, the Haitians of Springfield are decent, hardworking people, yet they are now subjected to a rising tide of racism. The hate spread by Trump and his associates has had serious consequences. Springfield has seen death threats, bomb scares, and the temporary closure of schools and City Hall. Haitian residents describe an atmosphere of fear and hostility, with their safety endangered by baseless lies. This unjust vilification not only affects the Haitian community but casts a shadow over all Caribbean-Americans, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and deepening social divisions. Indeed, the Haitian residents of Springfield have already been confronted by curious Americans asking whether they eat pets. Such questions reflect the ignorance many West Indians have encountered in the US, such as being asked how long it takes to drive from Jamaica to Barbados, or if people live in coconut trees. This is the soft bigotry of profound cultural and geographical ignorance. There is a broader pattern of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States, deeply rooted in anti-Black racism. The notion that immigrants pose a threat to society is a recurring theme, historically manifesting in policies and attitudes that dehumanise people based on nationality or skin colour. The portrayal of Haitian immigrants as “the other” fuels a narrative of alienation and isolation, overlooking their positive contributions to American society and the economy. As Mark Twain observed, history rhymes. The mythology of the United States as a beacon of liberty has long stood in contrast to its exclusionary practices based on race and nationality. Immigrant groups have consistently faced prejudice. From 1882 to 1917, laws excluded Chinese immigrants. One hundred years ago, national origin quotas were established to restrict immigration from non-Western European regions. Trump’s presidential travel ban on individuals from Muslim-majority countries further entrenched patterns of discrimination. We fear the long-term impact of racialised stereotypes against the people of Haiti, a fellow CARICOM member. These portrayals undermine the rich cultural heritage and resilience of Haitians, who continue to contribute meaningfully to their communities despite immense challenges. These harmful stereotypes are not isolated incidents but are part of a broader system of oppression aimed at marginalising people of colour and undermining their dignity. These facts should not go unnoticed by the approximately 4.4 million Caribbean immigrants living in the United States, nearly two-thirds of whom are naturalised citizens. With a naturalisation rate higher than the general foreign-born population, at about 49 per cent, Caribbean-Americans hold significant political power. Confronting racism and xenophobia in daily life, at the ballot box, in the workplace, and in communities, is essential. It is also significant that Kamala Harris, the woman seeking to lead all Americans, is herself the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother. Since entering the presidential race, she has been the target of racist attacks. Her opponent’s reluctance to condemn such hatred is a clear attempt to appeal to white supremacists in an era marked by extremism and disinformation. This strategy not only seeks to rally white voters but also aims to stoke unrest should he lose. The dangers of the Big Lie cannot be overstated. The impact of such tactics, exacerbated by voter apathy, is unpredictable and potentially devastating. The fight against racism and the manipulation of truth is one we cannot afford to ignore.","summary":"In Adolf Hitler’s 99-year-old Mein Kampf, he claimed that a lie, if told convincingly and repeatedly, can be accepted as truth.

I think they understand that he's so transactional and so devoid of core values that anything that they want they can manipulate him to get,\" Cuban said of Silicon Valley backers of Trump.During his interview with Cohen, Cuban added that he thinks Trump is \"the \"most unethical\" and \"dishonest\" person he's ever worked with or done business with. It's unclear what business Cuban is referring to.Cuban added that he believes a president needs to have character and empathy, and who is \"ethical when it comes to making difficult decisions.\"\"I can't even imagine why people consider Donald Trump because of his lack of character and ethics,\" Cuban said.Tesla chief Elon Musk, who Cuban often spars with on X, is now one of Trump's biggest supporters. Musk endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt and has expressed interest in serving on a possible government efficiency commission should Trump win the election.Cuban also has a theory on why Musk wants to get on the Trump train.\"If you're the wealthiest person in the world and you have control, effective control — you're the puppet master of the president, the most powerful person in the world?\" Cuban said. \"Oh my god, that's about as intoxicating — that is the definition of power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\"I mean, I would — if I had the same goal, I wouldn't care about my EV sales, right? I wouldn't care about my Starlink sales,\" Cuban added.To be sure, this isn't the first time Cuban has speculated on his Silicon Valley peers' motivations for backing Trump.In August, Cuban said he thought the tech bros who supported Trump were out for world domination.\"Watching what's happening in Silicon Valley is insane. It's not so much a support thing. It's more like a takeover thing, trying to put themselves in a position to have as much control as possible,\" Cuban said in an interview with the \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart.\"They've gotten to the point now where they feel like they should control the world right and that there should be a CEO in charge of everything because they are rich as fuck,\" Cuban added during his interview with Stewart.Cuban has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election and has been increasingly vocal about his distaste for Trump in recent months.The businessman has repeatedly railed against many of Trump's plans. That includes Trump's proposed tariffs, which Cuban has said would be disastrous for businesses.Cuban's also dislike for Trump goes beyond business. In the Monday video, Cuban accused Trump of bigotry, specifically citing the former president's promotion of baseless claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets.\"That's the Roy Cohn school of management,\" Cuban said, referring to Trump's former mentor, the infamous McCarthy-era lawyer. \"You demonize, demonize, demonize.\"But Cuban didn't always feel this way. In an August interview with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Cuban said he actually started out supporting Trump, thinking the businessman could shake up politics. But after digging into Trump's business records, Cuban said he changed his mind.\"The bigger point is Trump University. Trump SoHo. Stole $4 million from a friend of mine that had to sue to get it back. Mike Pence,\" Cuban listed off, referring to the former president's troubled real-estate training program, luxury hotel, and broken relationship with his vice president.Earlier in March, Cuban also told Axios that he would rather vote for President Joe Biden than a \"snake oil salesperson.\"\"One will tell you his snake oil will cure everything that ails you. The other will show you the details of his policies through charts, graphs, and statements,\" he said.Still, Cuban denied \"hating\" Trump earlier this month, responding to a user on X.\"I just think he was and would be a lousy president,\" Cuban wrote.Cuban told Cohen that whoever holds the presidency needs to have good character to handle whatever problems will inevitably arise.\"You want somebody who is ethical when it comes to making difficult decisions,\" Cuban said. \"I can't even imagine why people consider Donald Trump because of his lack of character and ethics.\"Cuban, Musk, and representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.","summary":"Billionaire Mark Cuban accused former President Donald Trump of lacking character, continuing his recent criticism of the 2024 GOP candidate.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-says-trump-most-unethical-person-ever-business-2024-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/66de902d5444ffafa7638b4d?width=1024&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:26:01","author":"Aditi Bharade,Cheryl Teh,Erin Snodgrass","authors":["Aditi Bharade","Cheryl Teh","Erin Snodgrass"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":256865480,"title":"Harris campaign highlights Trump’s past praise for Mark Robinson as CNN report roils battleground North Carolina","text":"(CNN) — Donald Trump’s campaign declined to say Thursday whether North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, whom the former president once described as “Martin Luther King on steroids,” should drop out of the battleground state’s race for governor. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, meanwhile, highlighted Trump’s history of praise for Robinson, in the wake of a CNN report Thursday about Robinson’s history of disturbing comments on a pornographic website’s message board. Robinson, a Trump ally who won the Republican nomination for governor in March, faces mounting pressure to exit the race following the revelations that he’d made comments more than a decade ago in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI!” and expressed support for reinstating slavery. Robinson denied having made those comments. The report immediately rippled through the 2024 presidential race, where North Carolina is a target for both Trump and Harris. The deadline under state law for a candidate to drop out was Thursday, with the state’s first absentee ballots set to be mailed out Friday. Harris’ campaign responded to the report by sharing photos on social media of Trump and Robinson together, including one of them posing with a thumbs-up. In another social media post, the Harris campaign shared video of Trump praising Robinson, calling him “one of the great leaders in our country” and labeling him “better than Martin Luther King.” The campaign superimposed the CNN report’s headline in the video. In a statement Thursday afternoon, the Trump campaign did not directly address the reporting, or whether the former president wants Robinson to drop out of the governor’s race. “President Trump’s campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country. North Carolina is an vital part of that plan. We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tarheel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN. Trump has a long history of praising Robinson. At a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, in March, Trump said he was listening to Robinson speak while he was on his plane and called him “Martin Luther King on steroids.” “I said, ‘I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two,’” Trump said at the time. Some people in Trump’s orbit heard rumblings this week that a potentially damaging story on Robinson was in the works, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Even before the CNN report was published, the Trump campaign had not invited Robinson to the former president’s upcoming Saturday rally in the state, with sources saying that the decision was likely to hold. Robinson has been to most, if not all, of Trump’s recent North Carolina events. Last month, he spoke at Trump’s economy-themed rally in Asheville, and the former president brought him onstage in Asheboro. Many people close to Trump have long held concerns about Robinson and his gubernatorial candidacy, given his previous inflammatory comments, including disparaging the civil rights movement and mocking the victims of a school shooting. Privately, some on Trump’s team had hoped Robinson would drop out as more of his contentious past comments were revealed. However, that didn’t stop Trump from giving the lieutenant governor his endorsement at a rally earlier this year. Despite efforts to distance the former president from Robinson, three senior Trump campaign advisers told CNN that there have been no efforts to pressure Robinson to withdraw from the governor’s race, and there were no plans at this time to call for him drop out. The NAACP called on Robinson to exit the race, writing on social media Thursday that the organization is “nonpartisan, but we’re not blind. And we speak out against what is wrong. Mark Robinson: drop out.” North Carolina Democrats seize on report Robinson is currently in a competitive race against Democrat Josh Stein to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. “Donald Trump and NC GOP leaders embraced Mark Robinson for years knowing who he was and what he stood for including disrespect for women and inciting violence. They reap what they sow,” Cooper said on social media Thursday. Stein, the state attorney general, has been leading Robinson in recent polling. His campaign said in a statement Thursday: “North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be Governor. Josh remains focused on winning this campaign so that together we can build a safer, stronger North Carolina for everyone.” The Democratic Governors Association also pounced on the CNN report, with spokeswoman Izzi Levy calling it “just the latest proof that Mark Robinson is unhinged, dangerous, and completely unfit to be governor.” “Now, as many Republicans warn against the damage Robinson would do as governor, it’s clear that the stakes have never been higher and we must keep our foot on the gas to defeat him in November,” Levy said. The Republican Governors Association did not respond to a request for comment on the report and whether Robinson should drop out of the race. North Carolina Rep. Jeff Jackson, the Democratic nominee to succeed Stein as attorney general, said it made him “sick” to read the CNN report about Robinson. He added that the lieutenant governor “has no business serving in any elected capacity whatsoever. And I’d like to hear from all the Republicans in North Carolina, where they stand on this, because it really should not be a difficult question.” Republicans react on Capitol Hill North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said the CNN report marked a “tough day,” but he urged fellow Republicans in the state to “stay focused on the races we can win,” pointing to the presidential election and other down-ballot contests. But he notably excluded the race for governor. “We have to make sure President Trump wins NC and support the outstanding GOP candidates running for key [North Carolina General Assembly] and judicial races. If Harris takes NC, she takes the White House. We can’t let that happen,” Tillis said on social media. Earlier Thursday, North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the House Republican campaign arm, told reporters that “the allegations were very concerning.” But Hudson stopped short of calling Robinson to step aside. “My hope is that the lieutenant governor can reassure the people of North Carolina that the allegations aren’t true,” he said. Another North Carolina Republican, Rep. Greg Murphy, who’s a member of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, also called the allegations “very concerning” but raised doubt about their authenticity. “What I read was very concerning, but given the degree of electronic manipulation that can happen these days with AI, with everything else, who the hell knows what’s true and what’s not,” he said. South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, also a Freedom Caucus member, told CNN the report was “pretty sad.” “To go this far along, and then to the people who supported him, all the money that he’s raised, and I think he needs to drop out today, so they get another candidate,” he said. Norman also said Robinson should have known that past message board comments would become public. “I think he’s a different man now – evidently, a lot of this happened in the past – but in politics, they’re going to find out everything, as rightfully they should,” Norman said. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted to read the allegations, but “if that all turns out to be true, that would be certainly something that I definitely couldn’t support.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The goal was to rally local networks to host events and spread the campaign's message. This strategic move is aimed at mobilizing Polish American voters who could be crucial in tight races.Though Polish Americans are not the largest demographic, many live in key \"blue wall\" states. There are approximately 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania, and 481,000 in Wisconsin. Harris is visiting these states this week. Her campaign sees these voters as essential in the tight races that will determine the election outcome.Tom Malinowski, a Polish-born former Democratic congressman from New Jersey, noted, \"We're talking about an election where a swing of a few thousand voters in any of those states could make all the difference.\"Filip Jotevski, who is responsible for engaging with diaspora and ethnic communities, said on Wednesday's Harris organizing call that if Trump returns to power, \"he'll sell out Ukraine\" after years of \"cozying up to Vladimir Putin.\"Trump had planned to visit a Polish American shrine in Pennsylvania on Sunday to unveil a monument to the Solidarity movement but canceled the visit, according to a source familiar with the Republican candidate's plans.During the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia, Trump twice refused to clarify whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. He suggested, \"Negotiate a deal,\" which Harris countered by saying if Trump had been president during the invasion, \"Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe.\"Gosia Dodi, a Polish American resident in Michigan, expressed her agreement with Harris, saying, \"I absolutely agree\" that Russia could target Poland if Ukraine falls. She criticized Trump's approach as \"dangerous for Poland,\" adding, \"I want the war over, but not the way he's saying.\"Trump's past suggestions to withdraw from NATO and his demands for increased defense spending have raised concerns. Pete Alibali, an immigrant from Soviet-controlled Poland, views Putin as a \"predator\" and worries about the security of smaller Baltic nations if Ukraine is defeated.Tom Kolano, a Republican from Pittsburgh, remains optimistic about Trump's stance, believing that Poland will influence U.S. policy on Ukraine. John Laka, from Wisconsin, expressed skepticism about Harris, stating, \"She's just really lacking.\"The outcome in these crucial battleground states will hinge on which candidate can secure the support of Polish American voters. The ongoing debate over Ukraine's fate will likely continue to play a central role in shaping their decision.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press","summary":"There are an estimated 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania and 481,000 in Wisconsin, three places that Kamala Harris is visiting this week","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/polish-american-voters-harris-trump-election-1956468","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476192/former-president-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:22:32","author":"Amir Daftari","authors":["Amir Daftari"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076}]}
