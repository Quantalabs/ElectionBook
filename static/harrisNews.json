I haven’t the slightest idea what Lamar is trying to say, because the lyrics are an incoherent, illiterate word salad that would make former Vice President Kamala Harris sound like a rocket scientist by comparison. From what I’ve been able to ascertain online, “Not Like Us” is basically intended as a “diss” aimed at rival rapper Drake.\n\nThe song, if you can call it that, is replete with a flurry of gratuitous F-bombs and N-words. But as bad as that is, Lamar also put out a “gay remix” that is even more obscene, with explicit descriptions of sex acts.\n\nI don’t know how either version could have received any airplay on any terrestrial radio station that valued its FCC-issued broadcast license, and the late Casey Kasem surely would be disheartened by what “Top 40” pop music has devolved into.\n\nAll that to say, I’m fairly certain the producers and directors of the Super Bowl 59 telecast on Fox on Sunday night will be sure to have one finger poised above the seven-second-delay “bleep” button, unless there’s a sanitized “radio edit” clean version Lamar could perform at the halftime show on Sunday night.\n\nAll of this raises a serious question: What was NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell—or whoever in the league’s C-suites chose Lamar as the big game’s halftime performer—thinking?\n\nThe choice of a foulmouthed rapper for the world’s biggest show should earn the NFL the equivalent of a personal foul deserving of a 15-yard penalty.\n\nWhy not pick a singer or singers who could appeal to a broader audience, one spanning multiple generations of viewers—an audience Forbes magazine estimates will be between 117 million and 120 million—who will gather around 65” plasmas at home or in pubs across the U.S. on Sunday night to watch the once-a-year spectacle that is the Super Bowl?\n\nWhile it’s too late now to call in a suitable replacement off the bench, there’s always next year (as the Washington Commanders and New York Jets are all too familiar with saying).\n\nNext year’s NFL championship game in February 2026 will be Super Bowl 60, and with the 60th being a milestone number, allow me to propose a halftime show worthy of the occasion: A Beatles reunion, of sorts.\n\nBut not just a reunion of the two remaining members of the Fab Four by themselves, however. I would have Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, both of whom are still recording and performing in concert despite being 82 and 84, respectively, be joined onstage for the 15-minute halftime extravaganza by their musician offspring—James McCartney; the late John Lennon’s sons Julian and Sean Lennon; the late George Harrison’s son Dhani Harrison; and Ringo’s son, Zak Starkey.\n\nJames McCartney, 47, is a guitarist and drummer who has worked with his father before and has released albums and EPs of his own. Dhani Harrison, 46, the spitting image of his late father, is a singer-songwriter who has performed at festivals, including Coachella. Julian Lennon, 61, a filmmaker and author as well as a musician, has recorded seven albums, most recently 2022’s “Jude,” a reference to the Beatles’ 1968 hit “Hey Jude,” which was written for and about him. Sean Lennon, 49, Julian’s half brother, has played in a number of groups, including his parents’ Plastic Ono Band and released two solo albums. Like his father a drummer, Starkey, 59, has toured with Ringo’s All-Starr Band and has performed and recorded with The Who since 1996.\n\nFor Paul McCartney, it would be a triumphant three-peat at the Super Bowl: On Feb. 3, 2002, at Super Bowl 36, he performed a pregame song dedicated to the memory of the victims of 9/11 at the Superdome in New Orleans, where this year’s Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles contest will be played on Sunday. Three years later, on Feb. 6, 2005, at Alltel (now EverBank) Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, he performed a four-song set of “Drive My Car,” “Get Back,” “Live and Let Die,” and “Hey Jude” at Super Bowl 39.\n\nEx-Beatle Paul McCartney performs during the Super Bowl 39 halftime show at Alltel (now EverBank) Stadium on Feb. 6, 2005, in Jacksonville, Florida. (Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nIf a Beatles family reunion weren’t enough starpower for the ages and worthy of the Super Bowl stage, the NFL could up the ante by also inviting the Beatles’ pre-Ringo drummer, Pete Best—who got the boot in 1962, but still performs occasionally as the Pete Best Band—to join them for a fence-mending reunion some 64 years later. (“When I’m 64,” anyone?)\n\nIf the NFL really wanted to go all in and go for the extra point, it could also invite McCartney and Starr’s fellow British Invaders Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones.\n\nIf the NFL already has performers booked for the 2026 halftime show, it should punt and reschedule them for 2027. After all, McCartney and Starr may be musical immortals, but they won’t live forever.","summary":"Somewhere, the Motown music hitmakers of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the original members of the Four Tops and The Temptations who have passed...

Time’s latest issue shows Musk sitting behind the Resolute Desk – where President Donald Trump should be positioned in the Oval Office.\n\nIn February of 2017, Time Magazine put White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon on the cover and asked the question: ‘Is Steve Bannon the second most powerful man in the world?’ At the time, Bannon was labeled ‘The Great Manipulator.’\n\nIn April 2017, The New York Times reported that Trump was still annoyed by the cover, telling people ‘that doesn’t just happen,’ a term the president used when talking about underlings overshadowing him. Bannon was out in August of that year.\n\nNow eight years later, Musk’s cover is even more provocative – which prompted uh-ohs from a number of journalists and online observers. Musk, the richest person on the planet, has received just as much attention as Trump since the Republican was sworn back in on January 20th.\n\nDOGE’s early actions – to take a wrecking ball to USAID, are chronicled in Time’s piece about the billionaire’s arrival in Washington. Government employees at the Department of Homeland Security told the magazine how they’re assuming the ‘defensive crouch’ as they wait for DOGE to arrive. In the aftermath of the Time’s cover release, Musk was making his own moves.\n\n‘I love @realdonaldtrump as much as a straight man can love another man,’ he professed on X, the platform he acquired, on Friday morning. In another Friday morning post, he cheered that Trump was the ‘Greatest president ever!’ Musk highlighted a post where Trump said he was going to end the ‘ridiculous Biden push for Paper Straws, which don’t work.’\n\n‘BACK TO PLASTIC!’ Trump wrote. Musk became an ardent MAGA supporter in July, as Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The billionaire SpaceX, Tesla and X boss endorsed Trump and then plowed millions into the Republican’s reelection effort over Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDuring the transition, Musk rarely left Trump’s side – even renting a $2,000-a-night cottage at Mar-a-Lago. During this time period, Vivek Ramaswamy – who has already exited as the co-leader of DOGE – and in turn Musk, started an online war with Bannon and other MAGA traditionalists over the use of H1-B visas. Trump appeared to take the tech entrepreneurs’ side. Musk stirred up some more trouble when he trashed the AI project Stargate, which Trump announced from the White House on January 21, just one day after the inauguration.\n\nThe DOGE leader isn’t a fan of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, one of the three tech leaders involved in the $500 billion project. A Republican close to the White House told Politico that some Trump staff was ‘furious’ at Musk for torching Stargate online. ‘It’s clear he has abused the proximity to the president,’ the Trump ally said. ‘The problem is the president doesn’t have any leverage over him and Elon gives zero [expletive].’ Trump was then asked about it. ‘He hates one of the people in the deal,’ the president shrugged.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

They run the very biased “fact-checker” PolitiFact, and one of its executives, Kelly McBride, moonlights as the baldly boosterish “public editor” making excuses for National Public Radio.\n\nTom Jones—not the hip-swaying Welsh pop singer—is their resident Brian Stelter, penning a daily media newsletter. Check out this headline: “Fox News goes all in on MAGA by adding a Trump to the payroll.”\n\n“The network continues to peddle itself as a legitimate news outlet,” the subhead reads. “Hiring the sitting president’s daughter-in-law makes that claim indefensible.”\n\nFox News is creating a Saturday night show hosted by Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of the sitting president. Just like Stelter, Jones ripped Fox as “simply an extension of the Republican Party and, in particular, a megaphone for Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. … ‘News’ really doesn’t belong in the network’s name.”\n\nHe underlined it, with a rhetorical highlighter: “If Fox News really does see itself as a legitimate news outlet, then the hire of Lara Trump is just baffling. … Don’t they see the obvious conflict of interest?”\n\nIt’s very easy to point out that NBC News hired Chelsea Clinton as an “objective” reporter. NBC still pays Jenna Bush Hager as a morning show host. But Jones said that’s different: Trump is in office now. Chelsea Clinton was making $600,000 a year for doing less than one fluffy feature story a month as her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, prepared for a 2016 run for the White House. She resigned before it became too obvious.\n\nBut if a news network is “not legitimate” for hiring a Trump while Trump is president, what about hiring a former Biden press secretary as a contributor, and later as a host of a weekend show, while Joe Biden is still president? Jones and Poynter didn’t see that as a problem for MSNBC—at all. Jen Psaki was still in the White House while she negotiated that deal.\n\nThey seem incapable of imagining anyone could write “MSNBC goes all in on Team Brandon by adding a White House spokesman to the payroll.”\n\nJones greeted the Psaki news with pure gush: “Psaki has earned rave reviews for the job she has done. Chris Wallace, back when he was with Fox News, called Psaki ‘one of the best press secretaries ever.’”\n\nWhat about Kamala Harris’ “chief spokesperson,” Symone Sanders-Townsend? In the very same newsletter, Jones expressed zero concerns, just this blurb: “The debut of ‘Symone’—MSNBC’s show hosted by Symone Sanders, a former senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris—debuts Saturday at 4 p.m.”\n\nThe headline on that newsletter was breezy: “A new press secretary, interesting reads, and notable media tidbits to wrap up your media diet for the week.”\n\nWhen “Inside with Jen Psaki” debuted in 2023, Jones posted a piece with the bland headline “Jen Psaki officially enters the Sunday morning lineup.” He liked it just fine. “Was it groundbreaking? Not really. Was it different? A tad. But was it solid? Sure.” Adding Psaki’s show to Monday nights a few months later? No problem.\n\nAgain, Jones found absolutely zero need to wonder about conflicts. He didn’t find it “baffling” that MSNBC would ignore the “obvious conflicts of interest.” Nothing was “indefensible.”\n\nThis is why conservatives don’t take the Democrat defense team of Stelter, Jones, and Oliver Darcy seriously when they preach about “legitimate” news outlets and media ethics. Everything is situational on the Democrats’ side. \n\nApparently, there are no conflicts of interest when everyone is allied in “saving democracy” from Trump. “Journalism” and Democrat messaging are indistinguishable.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Why are the first 100 days at the White House important?The first 100 days for a US President denote the benchmark of the success of a US President for decades now, and Donald Trump will also be looking at bettering his record in his second term, as compared to the statistics he recorded during his first term as the US President. Trump's first 20 days as US PresidentFor starters, Trump has issued executive orders for the implementation of tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. However, he later delayed the implementation of the same on Canada and Mexico as reports suggest that both countries have agreed to restrict their borders and keep a check on illegal immigrants. Then comes the major claim that President Trump made, saying that CBS News could lose its license owing to the fact that their news program ’60 Minutes’ had edited an interview with Kamala Harris in her favor, according to a Barron report. Among other decisions that Trump made in the initial 20 days of his Presidency was giving National Security Agency employees the option to resign or face the wrath of the layoff spree that is scheduled to come in soon. Even FBI employees were sent the same emails. FAQs:Has Donald Trump become the President of the US?Donald Trump has won the US Presidential elections 2024 in a massive way after defeating Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.

Per Pew research center 725,000 Indians are working in the USA now on H-1B visas which the GOP wants to abolish but Elon Musk of DOGE does not want to scrap and Prez Trump supports him.\n\nThe deportation of undocumented Indians is part of the mass deportation plan of the US President Trump who vowed on his campaign trail that aliens would be deported to combat the higher incidence of crime, violence and smuggling of fentanyl drugs especially on the streets of New York and other major cities and adding pressure on state governments finances in rehabilitating them in camps.\n\nTrump was a hard-core critic of the open borders policy of the Democratic government which allowed migrants into the country on grounds of their seeking asylum from despotic regimes in their countries – essentially from South America (Venezuela), North America (Mexico and Canada) and Central America (Guatemala).\n\nThe deportation of the illegal Indians staying in the US without papers comes a week ahead of the Indian premier Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to the United States on or around Feb 12th to discuss the latest developments in geo-politics such as relations with China and Russia. The Russian president Vladimir Putin is expected on a scheduled visit this week for discussions before Modi take his Air Force one to the US.\n\nMuch was made out of Indian premier Narendra Modi’s absence in the coronation of Trump on Jan 20th in the rotunda in the Capitol Hill where the foreign minister Dr S Jaishankar represented him.\n\nOpposition circles were agog with theories that while Trump had announced that his best friend Modi would meet him during his visit prior to the US elections in November and that he was under instruction from the then President Joe Biden not to call on Trump and therefore gave the goby to meeting Trump who eventually won the presidential elections.\n\nWhile President Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inauguration and Jinping gave the visit a go by not to be embarrassed at a time when his country was threatened with 60% tariffs and instead his highest-ranking vice premier was nominated to represent him.. Trump was visibly upset that despite his announcement PM Modi did not call on him during his November visit to the US and therefore hurt and did not invite him for his inauguration.\n\nThat being said, a lot of importance is being attached to Mr Modi’s visit to the US where the crucial question of the expansion of H-1B visas to skilled Indian engineers as sought by both Elon Musk and former DOGE co administrator Vivek Ramaswamy to fill up vacancies in the technology sectors. The GOP wants the H-1B programme to be scrapped. They want American labour to be encouraged. But Trump has backed Musk’s plan to expand the H-1B programme saying he himself employed H-1Bs on his properties.\n\nThe Indian diaspora in the United States is about 5.2 million strong contributing over 2 billion in taxes to the US treasuries.\n\nBirthright citizenship is another issue that may come up for discussion with the US president in view of the large number of H-1B visa holders working in technology sectors which includes IT, Computer Sciences, Academics, IT enabled services and health care sector, a large number of doctors to be and nurses are H-1B visa holders constitute a vast majority of the health care force.\n\nSome 77% of workforce in the Silicon Valley in software are Indian engineers from reputed Indian universities such as IIT’s, the only one recognised by the US government and regional engineering colleges.\n\nMany Indians including Vivek Ramaswamy, Kamala Harris, Nikki Haley and so many others whose parents migrated to the US years ago are important beneficiaries of birthright citizenship. All of them have made significant contributions to the US economy. Ramaswamy is a billionaire who made his fortune in the biotechnology sector, he was married to an Indian and his children enjoy birthright citizenship. So do Nikki Haley’s children. Harris did not have any children but adopted her husband’s children from the first wife as her children.\n\nMigration to USA by Indians was restricted to metropolitan cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. But the technology boom in the 90s and India’s opening up of the economy to FDI and portfolio investments which was taken advantage by US multinationals, which lacked access earlier, led mass migration from tier 2 cities such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru, the software capital of India and equivalent of the US Silicon Valley, Pune, Nagpur, Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore, and even smaller cities.\n\nMost of them have become US citizens and their children have become birthright citizens. India might see the new rule as being discriminatory to the new crop H-1B visa holders working in the USA and marrying other H-1B visa holders, or Indian Americans, and Modi is likely to bring up this issue of uncertainty for a skilled work force contributing to the progress and prosperity of the United States.\n\nIndia has not protested the return of undocumented Indians from the US as the country itself faces problems of illegal migration from neighbouring countries such as Bangladeshi Muslims into Assam, Bengal, and minority Burmese Rohingyas into eastern states.\n\nIndia foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has therefore said New Delhi is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States. His comments came following a meeting with U.S. foreign secretary Marco Rubio in Washington during which illegal immigration was one of the issues discussed.\n\nIndians made up the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2022 behind Mexico and El Salvador, according to Pew Research Center. It estimated their number at 725,000.\n\nAnalysts see India’s proactive stand on facilitating the return of illegal Indian migrants in the U.S. as a move to address a key concern of the Trump administration as New Delhi prepares to navigate more complicated issues, including trade and tariffs, diplomatic observers said.\n\n“Among a range of issues, where there are divergences between India and the U.S., this is one area where India can show it is transparently doing something, allowing it greater space to manoeuvre in other areas,” according to Harsh Pant, vice president of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “In other areas, such as the economy and trade, it is very difficult to do things which the new Trump administration may want India to do, and it would take time\n\nThe H-1B visa program, which brings skilled foreign workers to the United States, has been a subject of debate in the U.S. in recent years, with some strongly criticizing the program for negatively impacting American workers. Proponents assert those skilled workers benefit U.S. companies and employers. Indians, most of them professionals working in the technology industry, are among the biggest beneficiaries of the visa program.\n\nIndia is on a “stronger wicket” where H-1B visas are concerned. “On this issue, India has also been getting support from companies in the U.S. So politically, that is a safer issue for India to handle because there is a domestic support base for India,” according to analysts.\n\nAt least 20,407 “undocumented” Indians could be on the Trump administration’s radar. Of these, 17,940 “paperless” Indians were under “final removal orders”, and another 2,467 are in detention under the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nMr Modi would also be seeking greater access to American technologies in AI, raw materials supply in semiconductors or setting up semiconductor facilities in India with US MNCs like Nvidia, the biggest maker of chips, and exporter. India would also seek to bolster its defence with the latest defence equipment such as high quality surveillance equipment including high tech drones even as it makes efforts to make its own brands.\n\nUS is the biggest trading partner of India with figures touching $118 billion in FY 2023-24 and both Biden and Trump had vowed to take it beyond the $250 billion mark by 2030 during their regimes in the presidencies.

They were committed to bridging the gap between rich and poor. The Dems sought practical solutions. They focused on class. Now they seem to focus on every characteristic except class.\n\nDemocrats correctly identified a serious problem in the 1960s that was holding us back from making progress: discrimination. \n\nThe Democratic solution was affirmative action, which specified the determination of who was qualified for a position should be made without regard to race, color, religion or national origin. The idea was these characteristics could then be used to distinguish among qualified candidates.\n\nThe problem is affirmative action became a clumsy marker for who should be hired rather than a more nuanced examination of applicants’ skills, which can be found in abundance in communities that suffered discrimination. \n\n“We should hire X because X and Y are both well qualified and hiring X, a minority candidate, would increase diversity” became “We should hire X because of her or his race or sex even if Y is better qualified.” Critics of affirmative action said what was really going on was reverse discrimination.\n\nAffirmative action became about group membership; membership in that group, without more, was itself considered a qualification. \n\nDiscussions of merit became irrelevant — indeed offensive — because any interpretation of merit that did not favor the member of the identity group could be explained away as itself a manifestation of discrimination. Each group had its own standards that were met largely by group membership and intra-group assessment. \n\nDemocrats insisted any further discussion of merit was an attempt by “elites” or “racists” or “sexists” or “colonialists” to reestablish the old order.\n\nAnd “identity politics” was born. \n\n“Woke” went from being a term people of color used as synonymous with “awake” that advised vigilance about subtle racism to a largely pejorative term used to describe the position of not criticizing, questioning or discussing the claims of any of the many groups that sought top billing in the discrimination pecking order. Those claims had to be accepted by anyone who considered themselves “progressive.”\n\nThe Democrats established, in essence, a “Grievance Olympics” where various groups compete to be considered the most victimized. \n\nSo when I argue trans ideology is misogynistic because it involves a claim by men to the right to define who is a “woman,” and allowing males into private/intimate spaces increases safety risks for women, I am met with a wall of complaints (and accusations of being “transphobic”) that trans people are subjected to more discrimination and so should be accommodated because women are lesser victims than are trans people.\n\nAnd any academic who says he or she was never in an appointments meeting when there was a discussion where the primary focus was on diversity alone with no meaningful consideration of merit is not telling the truth. \n\nAfter 40 years teaching in universities, I can attest to the damage of this.\n\nI believe in affirmative action. I believe using race or sex to deny a qualified candidate of color or woman some benefit is wrong and there’s a role for distinguishing among qualified candidates in light of race or sex, a position the Supreme Court has now rejected at least in the context of using race in college admissions. But I do not think group membership is itself a sufficient qualification in any context.\n\nI think the identity politics the Democrats have promoted is corrosive. So did many people who voted in November.\n\nAnd the Democrats seem to have forgotten that in a liberal pluralistic society, people are going to say things with which others disagree and, indeed, that offend other people. The “progressive” position often supports restrictions on speech.\n\nConsider the controversy over the required use of “preferred pronouns” in the transgender context. That, in effect, requires that people be compelled to talk about others in ways that reflect beliefs the speaker may not have.\n\nIf you express concerns about immigration, about which there are certainly legitimate concerns, it does not matter how thoughtful your position may be. You are dismissed as a “bigot” or “xenophobe.” There can be no questioning of the woke canon.\n\nIf you express a concern about how the general obesity of the population is threatening national health and driving up the costs of medical treatment for everyone, we don’t discuss your position. We dismiss you as “fat shaming.”\n\nAnd our colleges and universities are being ruined by this thinking. They are becoming “safe spaces” that seek to limit student contact with any ideas with which the students may disagree. Faculty are often advised to issue “trigger warnings” for anything remotely controversial. \n\nUniversities and colleges should be places of physical safety for students, but they should also be places where all thoughts are on the table. \n\nIt was once a tenet of progressive thinking that the cure for speech you don’t like is more speech. No more.\n\nIt would be sheer folly to not acknowledge that the woke paradigm has silenced many in our universities.\n\nThe bottom line is that social justice for Democrats has become little more than virtue signaling. \n\nRather than trying to bridge the gulf between rich and poor, the Democrats have become the party of petitioning the local Starbucks to have gender-neutral toilets. \n\nIndeed, working people are abandoning the Democratic Party in droves because the party has abandoned them in favor of those who drive Priuses covered in bumper stickers urging coexistence or support for recycling.\n\nCoexistence and global warming are important issues, but neither is advanced much by bumper stickers. And there are other concerns that affect people’s daily lives — issues of wealth disparity and class — that were once a primary concern of the Democratic Party and are now being largely ignored.\n\nThink about this: West Virginia was one of six states that voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980. Donald Trump got 70% of the Mountain State’s vote in November. \n\nThe Democratic Party has abandoned working people, and working people have abandoned it.\n\nIf the Democratic Party is going to come back, it needs to be a bit woke itself (in the way that term was originally understood) — awake to the needs of everyone, not just those who are the loudest participants in the Grievance Olympics.\n\nGary L. Francione is Board of Governors professor emeritus at Rutgers University Law School.

Now, set to become the first incumbent president to attend a Super Bowl, it appears that the US’s most popular sport is genuflecting before him.\n\nTrump will reportedly attend the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in New Orleans as a guest of Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints. A pre-recorded interview conducted by a Fox News anchor will also air during the pre-game show of an event that last year was viewed by more than 123m Americans. And while he watches the action, Trump will not have to stare at a message inspired by the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategies that he is intent on bulldozing.\n\nThe real-estate tycoon is back in the White House for the first time in four years and for the first time in a Super Bowl since 2021 the message “End Racism” will not be stencilled on to the field in one of the end zones. End Racism is a slogan the NFL began to promote after George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020. The phrase formed part of Inspire Change, a community social justice initiative the league launched in the wake of the former quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s activism against racism and police brutality.\n\nTrump, however, sought to use the protests to rile up his base during his first term, urging team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem and encouraging fans to walk out. That drew a riposte from the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, who said that “divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL”.\n\nGoodell told reporters on Monday that the league will continue its “diversity efforts” and an NFL spokesman told The Athletic that “Choose Love” and “It Takes All Of Us” will be written in the end zones as an appropriate response to the recent terrorist attack in New Orleans’ French Quarter, the Washington air collision and the Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nStill, the slogan change and the president’s planned presence in the Caesars Superdome are conspicuous at a time when American sports appear to be following the corporate sector in adopting policies of appeasement or silence towards Trump, who has signed executive orders aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives in the federal government and pressurising private entities into stifling their programs. To his supporters this is a salvo in the “war on woke”. To his critics the tactic is a hallmark of a racist agenda.\n\n“President Trump loves a victory lap and this is certainly a victory lap over the NFL,” says Brandon Rottinghaus, a politics professor at the University of Houston and co-director of the Presidential Greatness Project survey.\n\nThe “Trump dance” became a viral celebration in the NFL after last November’s election, while on Wednesday the Chiefs’ biggest stars, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce, both said it will be “cool” to play in front of Trump. Kelce added that it will be “awesome” and “a great honor … no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited”. His enthusiasm raised eyebrows since he is in a relationship with Taylor Swift. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris in the election and Trump responded by declaring “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on social media.\n\nThe basketball star LeBron James, who called Trump a “bum” in 2017 and supported Harris last year, is among the previously outspoken high-profile athletes who have kept quiet so far in Trump’s second term. Of course, the administration is less than a month old. But Trump has been busy, issuing a flurry of directives on culture wars issues and inviting Elon Musk to eradicate large portions of the federal government. And Trump is explicitly using sports as a political tool, perhaps even more flagrantly than in his first term.\n\nAt half time of the College Football Playoff National Championship on 20 January – Trump’s inauguration day – ESPN, the leading American sports network, aired a video message from Trump that amounted to a political broadcast in which he said Americans had “suffered greatly” under the Biden administration. ESPN said the game averaged 22m viewers, making it the most-watched non-NFL sporting event of the past year.\n\nAfter campaigning on a pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports”, on Wednesday, surrounded by young female athletes, Trump signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from taking part in women’s sports, the latest in a series of gender-related directives. The NCAA, US college sports’ governing body, fell in line the next day with what its president, Charlie Baker, described as Trump’s “clear, national standard”.\n\nThough a sitting president’s Super Bowl attendance will be a novelty, American commanders-in-chief have a long tradition of attending baseball games: William Taft threw the ceremonial first pitch on opening day in Washington in 1910. George W Bush, a former part-owner of the Texas Rangers, famously took to the mound before a 2001 World Series game at Yankee Stadium in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Trump, though, is probably more interested in other sports, and not merely because he was booed and subjected to a chant of “lock him up” in 2019 while attending a Washington Nationals World Series game only three miles away from the White House.\n\nThe US will host the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games and Trump, who has a chummy relationship with Fifa president Gianni Infantino, has a replica of the soccer trophy on prominent display in the Oval Office. “I anticipate seeing the president very involved in the pop culture and sports worlds, it’s an easy way for him to connect to people,” Rottinghaus says.\n\nBarack Obama attended games and filled out an annual college basketball prediction bracket, but his relationship with sports seemed driven by passionate fandom more than political calculation. Trump sees sports as a vehicle with a value that goes far beyond photo opportunities with celebrities.\n\n“The infusion of sports culture and politics is a way that Donald Trump can demonstrate wins,” Rottinghaus adds. “It’s one thing to eliminate DEI at agencies in government that most people have never heard of, it’s another to get the NFL and individual teams to change the way that they message their product. That’s a different kind of win that’s really the kind of thing that his supporters want.”\n\nTrump’s fractious relationship with the NFL predates the anthem controversy. Long a frustrated wannabe team owner, he made a failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014 in what turned into a fierce rivalry with a bid spearheaded by Jon Bon Jovi. And as the owner of the New Jersey Generals, a team in the defunct United States Football League, he led an ill-fated anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL in 1986 with the aim of forcing a merger. But he was feted by fans on a visit to a Pittsburgh Steelers game last October, while in his previous term as president he named the co-owner of the New York Jets, Woody Johnson, as ambassador to the UK.\n\nThe Republican wrote on Friday that it “WILL BE A GREAT GAME!!!” However, the state of relative calm between Trump and the NFL might be contingent on the musical entertainment and whether the Chiefs win their third successive title. The half-time show is not usually overtly political but this year it is headlined by the rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose 2015 track Alright was adopted by Black Lives Matter demonstrators. In 2017 he rapped: “Donald Trump is a chump”.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, hailed the Chiefs on social media after their AFC Championship Game victory over the Bills a fortnight ago: “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs. What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.”\n\nHe also praised the Bills. But there was no mention of the Eagles thrashing the Washington Commanders earlier in the day. Philadelphia won the Super Bowl in 2018. That year Trump scrapped their invitation to the White House - an honor habitually afforded to the victorious team - after it became clear that almost none of the players or staff were willing to attend as a result of his divisive conduct. Last year Trump depicted the heavily-Democratic city as a crime-ravaged dystopia. Another Philadelphia victory might re-ignite hostilities and explode what appears to be an uneasy truce – or else offer more evidence that the sporting climate has shifted from resistance to acceptance.","summary":"Trump’s attendance at the Super Bowl on Sunday in New Orleans stands to offer more evidence that the sporting climate has shifted from resistance to acceptance\n\nAs a 2016 presidential candidate and White House occupant, Donald Trump lambasted NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at civil rights abuses.

Richard Blumenthal called the directive last week “deeply frightening,” and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray called it “disturbingly dystopian.”\n\nThe memo also calls for prohibiting governments that get Department of Transportation funds from imposing vaccine and mask mandates, and requiring their cooperation with the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars in transportation money still unspent from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, such changes could be a boon for projects in Republican-majority states, which on average have higher fertility rates than those leaning Democratic.\n\nStates controlled by Democrats were generally more receptive to mask and vaccine rules to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and have been more resistant to Trump’s immigration raids.\n\nMore births for more roads?\n\nAll administrations set their own rules for choosing which transportation projects to prioritize. But some of Duffy’s directives were received as highly unusual.\n\n“Distributing transportation funding based marriage and birth rates is bizarre and a little creepy,” said Kevin DeGood, senior director of infrastructure and housing policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. “States and regions with aging populations tend, on average, to have lower birth rates … Are they somehow not deserving of transportation investment?”\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022, the 14 states with the highest fertility rates backed Trump in the November election while the bottom 11 plus the District of Columbia supported Democrat Kamala Harris. Marriage rates tend to skew higher for red states too, but by a smaller margin.\n\nVice President JD Vance has long expressed concern about declining birth rates, citing national economic needs as well as the inherent value of children.\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn raised the idea of tying transportation funding to population growth during Duffy’s confirmation hearing.\n\n“People are leaving some of these blue states and coming to places like Tennessee,” she said. “And this means that we need to look at where those federal highway dollars are spent and placing them in areas with growing needs rather than areas that are losing population.”\n\nSarah Hayford, sociology professor and director of the Institute for Population Research at Ohio State University, said she had never heard of birth rates being used to set funding priorities.\n\n“I was a little surprised,” she said. “Often the policy around birth rates is trying to address challenges or barriers to people not having children. This seems more focused on rewarding people for already having children.”\n\nThe U.S. birth rate has been declining since 2007, which Hayford attributes in part to economic uncertainty during the Great Recession. She said research has tied higher birth rates to areas with lower education.\n\nLongstanding transportation policy already considers where kids live, said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the nonpartisan and nonprofit Population Reference Bureau.\n\n“If what you’re trying to do is support families, birth rates aren’t necessarily the best way to do that,” she said, pointing out that many growing families move to new communities when they find their homes are too small.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has not responded to questions about the memo.\n\nSo far, lawmakers and advocates are unaware of birth and marriage rates being linked to non-transportation grants.\n\nBlue states push back\n\nBlumenthal said the transportation secretary’s focus on birth and marriage rates was “reminiscent of what you might see in the People’s Republic of China.”\n\n“On its face, it’s social engineering. But clearly and indisputably, it is a dagger aimed at blue states,” he said. “It is patently discriminatory if you look at the numbers. This criteria was designed to punish blue states and coerce states to change their lawful policy on tolls, vaccines and immigration.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat, said he feared Duffy’s directives would harm some grants already announced – including $85 million awarded to Baltimore in the final weeks of the Biden administration to transform a blighted stretch of U.S. 40 known as the “highway to nowhere.”\n\n“If it’s an effort to reward red states, he ought to just go ahead and say that,” Mfume said. “Otherwise, there will be a lot of challenges by states and advocacy organizations all over the country who have no choice but to fight back, and that fight will become a legal one.”\n\nYet Jarosz said the policy’s political intentions are unclear, noting communities like San Diego and Sacramento in California are above the national average in terms of birth rates, while certain rural areas of the country are below.\n\nIs this even legal?\n\nLegal experts say it is too early to know whether anything in Duffy’s memo could be struck down by the courts.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to make a legal argument for funding equality based on political affiliation, federal law does protect against discrimination over such things as race, sex, and disabilities.\n\nJoel Roberson, who handles transportation and infrastructure cases at the Washington, D.C., law firm Holland & Knight, said administrations have widespread authority to set their own criteria for awarding money. However, communities denied funding could file a lawsuit arguing they endured an illegal “disparate impact.”\n\nAs for whether Trump could redirect transportation grants awarded under Biden, Roberson said it largely depends on the status of the project and whether Congress has already appropriated the funding.\n\nState transportation officials have expressed confidence that the new guidelines won’t impact the federal funds states use to set their own transportation priorities and build roads. But many other grants are awarded at the discretion of the administration in power.\n\nLess clear is the status of some already approved discretionary grants, such as an agreement signed just before former President Joe Biden left office committing $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations in South Side Chicago.\n\nBlumenthal, a former state attorney general and federal prosecutor, said Duffy’s edict created “uncertainty and confusion” and pointed out it doesn’t carry any legal weight like statutes and regulations do. He predicted courts would ultimately reject the policy.\n\n“Anybody can write a memo,” Blumenthal said.\n\nHaigh reported from Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe video in the player above is from a previous report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO &#8212; Shortly after he was confirmed as President Donald Trump&#8217;s transportation&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How US states&#8217; birth rates may impact grant distribution under Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy&#8217;s leadership first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-us-states-birth-rates-may-impact-grant-distribution-under-transportation-secretary-sean-duffys-leadership/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 17:37:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":288462358,"title":"Will Taylor Swift Attend The Super Bowl?

Trump hasn’t said which team he’ll root for, but he congratulated the Chiefs—and not the Eagles—on their Super Bowl berth in a Truth Social post. His appearance also follows a public clash with Eagles during his first term, in which most of the team declined to meet with Trump at the White House following their Super Bowl victory, causing Trump to call off the event. Trump had accused the team of kneeling or staying in the locker room to protest the national anthem, a then-heated debate spurred by protests against police violence, but CNN reported national anthem protests were not the reason Eagles players refused to meet Trump.\n\nWho Else May Attend The Super Bowl?\n\nKelce’s brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce will attend the Super Bowl alongside his wife, Kylie Kelce, TODAY reported. USA TODAY reported Eagles fan and former First Lady Jill Biden will attend the Super Bowl alongside her grandson Hunter Biden, citing an unnamed source close to the family, but they will not be joined by former President Joe Biden. Bradley Cooper, a longtime Eagles fan and a regular attendee of their games, is also in New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl, where he brought a Philly cheesesteak food truck on Friday, People reported. Though it’s unclear whether she’ll attend the game, Lady Gaga was in New Orleans this week to film a performance as a tribute to the victims of the New Year’s Day terrorist attack in the city, NOLA.com reported. Cardi B is also in New Orleans, where she partied on Bourbon Street Friday night to advertise her Whipshots vodka-infused whipped cream. Actor Miles Teller told People he will be at the Super Bowl, stating the Eagles will “destroy” the Chiefs. New Orleans’ Fox 8 News reported other celebrities in the city ahead of the game include NFL players Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Joe Burrow and Russell Wilson, singer Ciara, NBA players Jalen Rose and Andre Iguodala, rapper Travis Scott and comedian Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nWho Is Performing At The Super Bowl?\n\nKendrick Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show alongside frequent collaborator SZA. Lamar has not confirmed what he’ll perform, but he told The Hollywood Reporter he wants to remind people why “rap music is still the most impactful genre to date.” Other performers include Jon Batiste, who will sing the national anthem, Louisiana natives Trombone Shorty and Lauren Daigle, slated to perform “America the Beautiful,” and New Orleans singer Ledisi, who will perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” also known as the Black National Anthem. Post Malone will headline the Super Bowl YouTube Tailgate Concert, which streams live on YouTube at 4 p.m. EST.\n\nKelce drew some scrutiny earlier this week at a press conference after he said it would be an “honor” to play in front of Trump, though he added he would feel that way “no matter who the president is.” Trump, however, has had a contentious relationship with Swift. After Swift said on Instagram in September she would vote for former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump posted on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Swift, who remained largely mum on the 2016 election, emerged as a Trump critic in 2020, accusing him of “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhat To Know About Super Bowl LIX—How To Watch The Chiefs-Eagles Game And Kendrick Lamar’s Halftime Show (Forbes)\n\nTrump Attending Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl—But He’s Clashed With The Eagles In The Past (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

When they returned to our home in Moscow, my mother couldn’t stop talking about what they’d seen — not a place but a movie, Bob Fosse’s “Cabaret.” One scene in particular stayed with her. Three friends are returning from a weekend trip. Sleep-deprived, hung over and preoccupied with their sexual and romantic entanglements, they pull over at a roadside cafe. There, a teenager wearing a Hitler Youth uniform starts singing. He is both earnest and, in his brown pants tucked into white knee-high socks, puerile. But after a minute, other young people in uniform join in, and soon all but one customer are standing and singing. The protagonists duck out. They have been pushing Nazism out of their minds, but at this moment they realize that they are in the minority, that life as they’ve been living it is over. The song everyone around them is singing is “Tomorrow Belongs to Me.”\n\nI was 11 when my mother couldn’t stop talking about “Cabaret,” and I was confused. I thought my parents had gone to an actual cabaret and somehow gained an insight into the nature of the Soviet regime. A few years later, after I’d seen the movie myself, I realized my mother was right: That scene is the single most vivid portrayal of what it feels like to live in a society that is falling in line before a totalitarian leader. I experienced this in real life as an adult, when Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia and my world suddenly felt like a chessboard from which an invisible hand was picking off pieces faster than I had thought was possible.\n\nNow, in Donald Trump’s America, I am living through something similar, and it is moving at a faster rate still. For me, it began before the election, when the owners of The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post decided to pull their papers’ endorsements of Kamala Harris for president. It continued with Mark Zuckerberg remaking Meta to reflect what he called the “cultural tipping point” that was the presidential election; with ABC News handing over millions of dollars in response to one of Trump’s frivolous lawsuits and CBS considering doing the same; and most recently, with the great erasure: of records of trans care for minors provided by hospitals and of diversity-and-inclusion policies at many universities and corporations.

Richard Blumenthal called the directive last week \"deeply frightening,\" and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray called it \"disturbingly dystopian.\"\n\nThe memo also calls for prohibiting governments that get Department of Transportation funds from imposing vaccine and mask mandates, and requiring their cooperation with the administration's immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars in transportation money still unspent from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, such changes could be a boon for projects in Republican-majority states, which on average have higher fertility rates than those leaning Democratic.\n\nStates controlled by Democrats were generally more receptive to mask and vaccine rules to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and have been more resistant to Trump's immigration raids.\n\nMore births for more roads?\n\nAll administrations set their own rules for choosing which transportation projects to prioritize. But some of Duffy's directives were received as highly unusual.\n\n\"Distributing transportation funding based marriage and birth rates is bizarre and a little creepy,\" said Kevin DeGood, senior director of infrastructure and housing policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \"States and regions with aging populations tend, on average, to have lower birth rates ... Are they somehow not deserving of transportation investment?\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022, the 14 states with the highest fertility rates backed Trump in the November election while the bottom 11 plus the District of Columbia supported Democrat Kamala Harris. Marriage rates tend to skew higher for red states too, but by a smaller margin.\n\nVice President JD Vance has long expressed concern about declining birth rates, citing national economic needs as well as the inherent value of children.\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn raised the idea of tying transportation funding to population growth during Duffy's confirmation hearing.\n\n\"People are leaving some of these blue states and coming to places like Tennessee,\" she said. \"And this means that we need to look at where those federal highway dollars are spent and placing them in areas with growing needs rather than areas that are losing population.\"\n\nSarah Hayford, sociology professor and director of the Institute for Population Research at Ohio State University, said she had never heard of birth rates being used to set funding priorities.\n\n\"I was a little surprised,\" she said. \"Often the policy around birth rates is trying to address challenges or barriers to people not having children. This seems more focused on rewarding people for already having children.\"\n\nThe U.S. birth rate has been declining since 2007, which Hayford attributes in part to economic uncertainty during the Great Recession. She said research has tied higher birth rates to areas with lower education.\n\nLongstanding transportation policy already considers where kids live, said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the nonpartisan and nonprofit Population Reference Bureau.\n\n\"If what you're trying to do is support families, birth rates aren't necessarily the best way to do that,\" she said, pointing out that many growing families move to new communities when they find their homes are too small.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has not responded to questions about the memo.\n\nSo far, lawmakers and advocates are unaware of birth and marriage rates being linked to non-transportation grants.\n\nBlue states push back\n\nBlumenthal said the transportation secretary's focus on birth and marriage rates was \"reminiscent of what you might see in the People's Republic of China.\"\n\n\"On its face, it's social engineering. But clearly and indisputably, it is a dagger aimed at blue states,\" he said. \"It is patently discriminatory if you look at the numbers. This criteria was designed to punish blue states and coerce states to change their lawful policy on tolls, vaccines and immigration.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat, said he feared Duffy's directives would harm some grants already announced - including $85 million awarded to Baltimore in the final weeks of the Biden administration to transform a blighted stretch of U.S. 40 known as the \"highway to nowhere.\"\n\n\"If it's an effort to reward red states, he ought to just go ahead and say that,\" Mfume said. \"Otherwise, there will be a lot of challenges by states and advocacy organizations all over the country who have no choice but to fight back, and that fight will become a legal one.\"\n\nYet Jarosz said the policy's political intentions are unclear, noting communities like San Diego and Sacramento in California are above the national average in terms of birth rates, while certain rural areas of the country are below.\n\nIs this even legal?\n\nLegal experts say it is too early to know whether anything in Duffy's memo could be struck down by the courts.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to make a legal argument for funding equality based on political affiliation, federal law does protect against discrimination over such things as race, sex, and disabilities.\n\nJoel Roberson, who handles transportation and infrastructure cases at the Washington, D.C., law firm Holland & Knight, said administrations have widespread authority to set their own criteria for awarding money. However, communities denied funding could file a lawsuit arguing they endured an illegal \"disparate impact.\"\n\nAs for whether Trump could redirect transportation grants awarded under Biden, Roberson said it largely depends on the status of the project and whether Congress has already appropriated the funding.\n\nState transportation officials have expressed confidence that the new guidelines won't impact the federal funds states use to set their own transportation priorities and build roads. But many other grants are awarded at the discretion of the administration in power.\n\nLess clear is the status of some already approved discretionary grants, such as an agreement signed just before former President Joe Biden left office committing $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations in South Side Chicago.\n\nBlumenthal, a former state attorney general and federal prosecutor, said Duffy's edict created \"uncertainty and confusion\" and pointed out it doesn't carry any legal weight like statutes and regulations do. He predicted courts would ultimately reject the policy.\n\n\"Anybody can write a memo,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nHaigh reported from Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe video in the player above is from a previous report.","summary":"Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy circulated a memo that instructed his department to prioritize families by, among other things, giving preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average when awarding grants.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-birth-rates-state-donald-trump-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy-circulates-memo-tying-grants-marriage/15881663/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15881628_020825-wls-ap-sean-duffy-img.png?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/111824-wls-duffy-transportation-secretary-10pvo-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-08 17:12:40","author":"Jeff McMurray And Susan Haigh Associated Press","authors":["Jeff McMurray And Susan Haigh Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":288465310,"title":"Laverne Cox slams Republicans for 'eradicating trans people,' Democrats for ignoring 'working people' at SCAD","text":"Laverne Cox is taking a stand against the Trump administration.\n\n During an impassioned speech at SCAD TVfest in Atlanta on Friday, the Orange is the New Black star tore into the Republicans' anti-trans legislation before introducing a screening of her new show, Clean Slate.\n\n \"It truly feels like a miracle to be here, a Black transgender woman in this cultural environment with a television show that I co-created, executive-produced, and starred in that just premiered on Prime Video yesterday,\" Cox began. \"It is beautiful that in this environment — where trans people are under attack in ways that are unprecedented, devastating, disgusting, dehumanizing — it feels wonderful to have a moment where a Black trans woman can be honored.\"\n\n In the speech, which was supposed to last two minutes but ended up running nearly 20, the actress took aim at state policies that criminalize gender-affirming care for youth, forcing families to relocate to different states, and also lamented the federal government's new policy of only recognizing gender assigned at birth on passports.\n\n \"When states pass laws that criminalize, stigmatize trans people, it emboldens the public to do the same thing — to commit violence against trans people,\" Cox said. \"Violence against trans youth has skyrocketed in states that pass discriminatory policies affecting trans people… And it is heartbreaking, and it has been heartbreaking for years.\"\n\n President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning trans women from competing in college sports on Wednesday, despite NCAA President Charlie Baker clarifying that there are \"less than 10\" trans athletes in the league of more than 530,000 student athletes. The administration also removed information about trans health care from federal websites.\n\n Cox went on to slam the anti-trans policies ramping up under Trump. \"So much of what is happening under this chaotic new administration is blatantly illegal, and if you read Project 2025 — which is quite a read — none of this is surprising,\" she said of the Heritage Foundation's controversial political initiative to consolidate power in the executive branch. \"The Project 2025 agenda is a Christian nationalist agenda, if you read the text, right?\"\n\n She continued, \"It is a Christian nationalism with the man, the patriarchy as the head of the household after God, and women being subservient — women not being able to get a divorce, women not being able to get an abortion, and people with the capacity for pregnancy not being able to get an abortion. This is the America they dream of, in addition to dismantling the regulatory state, which we're seeing happen very quickly right now.\"\n\n Cox also characterized Project 2025 as a \"vision of America that would completely deregulate everything so the corporations can do whatever they want and make as much money as possible,\" wherein \"billionaires get even bigger tax breaks while the cost of health care goes up, while people can't afford a home or rent or groceries.\"\n\n She clarified that the broadest issues in contemporary politics stem from class dynamics: \"It is an administration that is for the wealthy and the corporations and is saying 'screw you' to all working people all over this country.\"\n\n The actress noted that although some politicians are opposing Trump's agenda and some organizations are challenging the flurry of executive orders with legal battles, \"it might be too little, too late\" to prevent rapid policy changes. \"The system is rigged in favor of corporations, plutocrats, oligarchs, the wealthy, and it might not be the time for us to be able to rise up — not just as trans people, but as working people, as people of color, as people with the capacity for pregnancy, people who just really want to get a divorce, a no-fault in divorce, and so many other things.\"\n\n The actress also railed against Democrats for not offering a radically different agenda from their Republican opponents. \"What is so disappointing to me about the Democratic Party and about so many of those people who identify as a Democrat, liberal, leftist, is that somehow we have not been able to come together across our differences and form coalitions to effectively resist this,\" she said. \"If you don't actually have an agenda for working people, a lot of people say, 'What?'\"\n\n Cox suggested that Democratic politicians have intentionally ignored trans people for the sake of avoiding \"touchy\" issues. \"Kamala Harris — love her — didn't talk about trans people at all. You'd never know it, based on what the Republicans were saying,\" she said. \"Trans people are not going to be in coalition with folks who deny our existence or who want to say that our issues are a distraction.\"\n\n She continued, \"If you read Project 2025 or just look around at what Republicans have been doing on the state level for the past five years, it is not a distraction for them. They are committed to eradicating trans people from public life. They've said it blatantly. They said it in everything that they have done. This is not a distraction. This is part of their agenda.\"\n\n Cox urged Democrats and leftists to \"take back our narratives\" and \"not just respond to the agenda that the conservatives are setting\" politically. \"They have been setting the agenda and leftists, Democrats have been responding. We can set the agenda — an agenda for working people, agenda for human rights and civil rights.\"\n\n While she speculated that \"we are probably already screwed,\" she found a note of optimism in spite of potential policy defeat. \"If that is the case, then what? And to be honest, the 'then what?,' it actually excites me because 'then what?' is community,\" she said. \"The 'then what?' is our legacy, and history is LGBTQI+ plus folks and people of color, mutual aid, chosen family, finding resources.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n She continued, \"We need systemic change, and there's not political will or politicians with courage to really make that happen. But each of us as individuals can make changes in our lives and the lives of the people we know and love.\"\n\n Cox reiterated that queer people and their allies have an opportunity \"to love each other more\" in spite of perceived political doom.\n\n \"To lean into all the things that make us human, to rehumanize each other, even people we disagree with, even people who voted for that man, we can re-humanize them. They're still human beings,\" she said. \"We are all human. And this is what I love about being an artist, being able to tell human stories, to be an arbiter of empathy with Clean Slate, to be able to tell a story of a trans woman and her family, just trying to do the best that they can — a story about love and family.\"\n\n Additional reporting by Patrick Gomez.","summary":"\"The system is rigged in favor of corporations, plutocrats, oligarchs, the wealthy,\" Cox said in an impassioned speech at the festival in Atlanta.","url":"https://ew.com/laverne-cox-slams-politicians-for-anti-trans-policies-scad-tvfest-speech-8788385","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/eVttvWmHlgkWx7MHpIOQ46IhoeM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/laverne-cox-13th-SCAD-TVfest-2025-020725-e0bed78780f84dfe86a60ed4c41b7e15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 17:05:56","author":"Wesley Stenzel","authors":["Wesley Stenzel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":288449514,"title":"NFL fans slam 'unfocused' Travis Kelce over pre-Super Bowl date with Taylor Swift... as he breaks his own rule","text":"NFL fans slam 'unfocused' Travis Kelce over pre-Super Bowl date with Taylor Swift... as he breaks his own rule\n\nREAD MORE: Bill Maher destroys NFL's 'End Racism' campaign\n\nREAD MORE: Smiling Taylor shakes off Trump controversy in New Orleans\n\nBy BEN NAGLE\n\nPublished: 16:27 GMT, 8 February 2025 | Updated: 17:01 GMT, 8 February 2025\n\nNFL fans have questioned if Travis Kelce is feeling too complacent about tomorrow's Super Bowl after he broke his own rules to head out on a double date with Taylor Swift and the Mahomes'.\n\nLast year before the big game in Las Vegas, Kelce shared his strong views on whether or not a player should head out and about in the build-up to the season finale.\n\nSpeaking to millions of listeners on his New Heights podcast, the Chiefs star told his brother Jason: 'We've got one week, we do what we need to do then we can party in Vegas for the rest of our lives.'\n\nBut one year on Kelce has been spotted out for dinner with his girlfriend Swift, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany - less than 48 hours before the biggest game of his career.\n\nSocial media was flooded with opinions on the surprise outing in New Orleans, with one fan labeling Kelce 'unfocused'.\n\nAnother added: 'Bad look.

'I didn’t see that clip but it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play.'\n\nTravis and Patrick's positive words about the 78-year-old angered Swifties on social media given his long-running feud with Taylor, who infamously accused him of promoting 'white supremacy' and 'racism' during his previous reign as president.\n\n'After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?' the songstress wrote on Twitter (X) at the time. \n\nSwift headed out with Kelce and Mahomes despite their praise for Donald Trump this week\n\nThe Chiefs duo said they are looking forward to playing in front of Trump at the Super Bowl\n\nThe president controversially declared he 'hates' Swift during his election campaign last year\n\nBut the songstress looked in fine spirits on her double-date night with Kelce and the Mahomes'\n\n'‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’???

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nToday, we’re leading with a deplorable who is furious she can’t get cheap crap from China anymore, and then looking at Trump-supporting Venezuelans, Muslims, and farmers. \n\nLet’s get to it!\n\nThis one is fun: \n\nSay goodbye to cheap Temu and Shein crap from China. Of course, every one of Donald Trump’s voters should have been prepared for this—he ran on making stuff from China more expensive. Yet here is a case where people were happy to believe his nonsensical lies. \n\nAnd before anyone wants to add their blame trump for everything bs and say that's what you get for voting for Donald J. Trump I know what trump said he said the tariffs would be on china New Mexico and Canada not on American citizens.\n\nAside from her wanting tariffs on New Mexico for some reason, this is beyond insane. Trump lied. She is now seeing the real-life impact of that lie, validating everything Democrats and economists and reasonable people warned would happen, and she’s … doubling down on her love for Trump. \n\nTariffs aren’t paid by governments. They are collected by governments, paid by importers, and they pass those costs on to consumers. It’s a freakin’ tax. Congrats, this person voted to raise prices. And if they’re angry now that prices are rising, maybe stop with the MAGA shit. \n\nDoral, Florida, in suburban Miami, hosts one of the largest Venezuelan communities in the country. Sixty-one percent of the city voted for Trump—one of his best performances in Miami-Dade County. Trump got only 28% of the vote in the city in 2016 against Democrat Hillary Clinton, and barely won it in 2020, with 50.4%. The city’s transformation has been dramatic, all to Trump’s benefit. \n\nSo it’s kinda funny that one of the first things Trump announced was the rescission of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans (and Haitians). Cue shocked Pikachu face. \n\n“Remember,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told NBC, \"Venezuela purposely emptied out their prisons, emptied out their mental health facilities and sent them to the United States of America.\" \n\nOf course, Venezuela did no such thing. That stems from Trump’s apparent confusion about the term “political asylum.” He thinks it means mental health institutions—formerly known as “mental asylums”—because he’s among the dumbest human beings to ever walk Earth. \n\nNow Venezuelans are shocked this lying bigot is targeting them. “Beyond betrayed,” one woman told NPR. \"They used us. During the campaign, the elected officials from the Republican Party, they actually told us that he was not going to touch the documented people. They said, 'No, it is with undocumented people.'\"\n\nHow gullible can you be? Trump promised to deport legal Haitian residents from Springfield, Ohio. He even promised to revoke birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed in the Constitution. His messaging has always been virulently anti-immigration when it comes to people of color. \n\nAs I often say: People believed Trump’s lies, didn’t believe his truths, then made up things Trump never said in order to justify voting for him. It is gobsmacking. \n\nIn that same camp are many Michigan Muslims. A large share abandoned the Democratic Party in droves and opted instead for a destructive mix of voting for Trump, voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and not voting at all. \n\nNow that Trump is calling for displacing all Palestinians from Gaza (much to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s delight) and for the U.S. to “own” the strip, some of those “Genocide Joe” and “Killer Kamala” voices are being … defiant. \n\nHere’s NPR:\n\n\"Abandon Harris\"—another, more hard-line protest group previously known as \"Abandon Biden\"— released a statement Wednesday condemning Trump for \"grotesque statements\" regarding Gaza. But the organization also kept up its attacks on Biden and Harris, saying in the release, \"We refuse to equate Trump's inflammatory rhetoric with the Biden-Harris administration's concrete actions—actions that spanned 15 months of material, verbal, monetary, and political support for Israel's genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.\"\n\nNetanyahu wanted to harm the Democratic ticket in the hopes of a Trump redux presidency—and it worked. The Biden administration did what it could to restrain Israel, and yes, I get that many considered that inadequate, but there were two choices in that election—Trump or Harris—and it’s clear which one would’ve been a forceful voice for ending the war and Israeli excesses. Now Trump has essentially volunteered to handle the ethnic cleaning himself. \n\nHilariously, the group “Arab Americans for Trump” just changed their name to “Arab Americans for Peace.” Nice try. You own this, as do these folks: \n\nIt’s genuinely awful for the Palestinians who didn’t vote for this shit, and got saddled with the worst, dumbest allies possible. \n\nCalifornia farmers are some of the most die-hard Republicans around. Anyone driving from Northern to Southern California on I-5 has seen the endless scroll of billboards and signs lambasting the state’s Democrats, blaming them for a lack of water. (Note that many of these farms are essentially wasting water on purpose.) \n\nSo it is somewhat funny to see those farmers suddenly get quiet as Trump has dumped a big percentage of their summer irrigation water in a bizarre publicity stunt. \n\nHaving incorrectly decided that the Los Angeles wildfires happened because of a lack of water, Trump ordered water released from two reservoirs. None of the water from those reservoirs ended up near Los Angeles, they aren’t physically connected, but it did deplete a precious resource—over 5 billion gallons, according to Trump. \n\n“Not a single drop of the water released can get to Los Angeles—there is simply no physical connection between these basins,” Peter Gleick, co-founder of the nonprofit Pacific Institute, told The Hill. “As a result, all that Trump managed to accomplish was to anger local water districts and farmers who lost more than 2 billion gallons of water that flowed, unused and unusable, into the dry lake bed of the Tulare basin, where it will be unavailable to farmers in the coming hot season.”\n\nAny fields that end up fallow thanks to lack of water won’t just further harm these Trump-loving farmers—it’s also likely to drive up grocery prices. Nearly every move Trump makes is inflationary. \n\nThat isn’t the only pain farmers can expect. \n\nAgri-Pulse: “The incoming Trump administration has stopped payments to at least one major climate-smart commodities project, raising questions about whether farmers across the country will be reimbursed for practices they implemented under the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities initiative.”\n\nThe Washington Post: “U.S. businesses that sold goods and services to USAID are in limbo. That includes American farms, which supply about 41 percent of the food aid that the agency, working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, sends around the world each year, according to a 2021 report by the Congressional Research Service. In 2020, the U.S. government bought $2.1 billion in food aid from American farmers.”\n\nDaily Kos: “Nearly 60% of Nebraska voted for Donald Trump last November.

We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.’ \n\nHowever, in the clip that aired in the primetime election special, Harris gave a much more succinct answer, saying: ‘We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.’ \n\nFollowing the release of the unedited interview, Carr spoke out to say the conduct of CBS News’ editors was ‘hard to explain.’ \n\nPresident Trump issued a far more hostile response after the footage was released, saying CBS News should be shut down and its flagship 60 Minutes show be ‘terminated.’ \n\n‘CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,’ Trump claimed in a post to Truth Social on Thursday morning.\n\n‘They 100% removed Kamala’s horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview,’ he continued. ‘This was Election changing ‘stuff,’ Election Interference and, quite simply, Election Fraud at a level never seen before.’\n\nAs CBS News faces the new president’s wrath, staff at the embattled network are said to be dreading a proposed settlement of his lawsuit. \n\nStaff members are almost universally against settling Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit, and would be especially irate if any proposed settlement comes with a mandated apology from the network, which has previously maintained that the clip with Harris was ‘not doctored.’\n\nBut executives at Paramount reportedly believe that settling the lawsuit would increase the odds that the Trump administration would approve its multibillion-dollar merger with entertainment company Skydance, according to the New York Times. \n\nAlso on Wednesday, reports emerged revealing that USAID, which was shuttered this week by Trump at the advice of Elon Musk, paid $8 million to Politico for employees’ subscriptions.\n\nTrump says this is further proof of the ‘biggest scandal of them all’ between Democrats, government bureaucracy and the media.\n\nHe questioned whether these entities are paying other media outlets, specifically The New York Times, to engage in activity that he claims amounts to ‘election interference’ and ‘fraud.’\n\nIn al all caps post to Truth Social, Trump wrote: ‘LOOKS LIKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN STOLLEN (sic) AT USAID, AND OTHER AGENCIES, MUCH OF IT GOING TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AS A ‘PAYOFF’ FOR CREATING GOOD STORIES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.’\n\n‘Did the New York Times receive money???

She Says We’re Not Done Yet","text":"A week before President Donald Trump was set to be sworn-in in front of a scaled-down crowd at the Capitol Rotunda, Washington D.C. felt completely still. Eight years earlier, the city had been electric with dissent, planes and busloads full of protesters already arriving, eager to demonstrate their displeasure with the incoming administration. This time around, there was no Disrupt J20, and only a fraction of the crowd that coursed through the capital in 2017 materialized for this year’s Women’s March. Trump’s opposition was still so dejected over the outcome of the 2024 election, it seemed they could barely muster the energy to protest. \n\n Kamala Harris’ loss to the now-adjudicated sexual abuser (and champion of accused sexual abusers) was a particularly demoralizing one for many women. It represented both an emphatic affirmation that Trump’s upset victory over the first female nominee to lead a major party ticket was no fluke, and that his work to strip American women of their constitutional right to an abortion was not disqualifying, at least to a plurality of voters. Living through the last eight years — and staring down the next four — it’s easy to feel pessimistic about the position American women are in today. And yet it could be worse. Just ask Ellen Malcolm. \n\n Malcolm lived through the failed effort to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first failed effort to elect a female vice president, the infuriating spectacle of Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearings, two of Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaigns, and many other painful electoral defeats — and, all along the way, she managed to continue building women’s political power. It is not an exaggeration to say that no one, living or dead, deserves more credit for the progress that women have made, in terms of their political representation, than Malcolm, the founder and longtime president of EMILY’s List. \n\n Today, there are 151 women in Congress. One-quarter of U.S. senators are women, and roughly 30 percent of lawmakers in the House. Four decades ago, when Malcolm embarked on her political project, not a single Democratic woman had ever been elected to the Senate in her own right, and women (split evenly between Democrats and Republicans) accounted for about 5 percent of representatives in the U.S. House.\n\n “The way it was, was women were getting shit nowhere,” Malcolm, tells me, reflecting on the political climate of the 1980s over lunch at the Tabard Inn, where she and a half dozen young female political operatives founded the EMILY’s List 42 years ago. “Nobody took women candidates seriously.”\n\n The central issue, as Malcolm and her colleagues saw it, was the fact that the men who ran the Democratic Party had no confidence that female candidates could compete financially. “They were caught in this vicious circle,” she says. “They would go to the old boys and say, ‘I’m a state legislator, and I want to run for Congress, a seat has opened up.’ And they’d say, ‘Well, you can’t raise the money, so we’re not going to give you any.’ Okay, fine, you smoke your cigar and look smart, and I’ll starve to death.”\n\n Their solution was to start soliciting early donations for Democratic women running for office. They called the group EMILY’s List, an acronym for “Early Money Is Like Yeast.” (Get it? It helps the dough rise.) “I wasn’t very experienced in politics when we began, and I think if I knew then what I know now, I would have thought, ‘Oh, forget it. This ain’t gonna happen,’” Malcolm says. \n\n Just a few weeks shy of 78, Malcolm rarely does interviews. She stepped back as public face of EMILY’s List in 2010, not long after Clinton’s defeat in the 2008 primary. “It broke my heart,” she says. But one of the lessons she’s taken in, after a half a century in politics, is that the most devastating defeats often precede the biggest leaps in progress. \n\n “It’s not one great, big ‘Hooray! We’ve won. Now we don’t have to do this again.’ No, no, no, no,” she says. “It ebbs and flows… You make a big burst forward. Then it gets slow. You lose. That goes on for a while, and then you get another opportunity, and you burst forward.”\n\n Take 1992, remembered as “the year of the woman” because so many voters, furious over the treatment Anita Hill received before an all-male Senate Judiciary Committee during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ confirmation process, turned out to elect female candidates: Four Democratic women were elected to the U.S. Senate that year, and 21 new Democratic women to the House. EMILY’s List, which raised $10 million that cycle, became the single-biggest funder of federal campaigns in the United States that year. \n\n But 1992 was followed two years later by one of Democrats’ biggest electoral wipeouts, the first time the party had lost control of House of Representatives since 1955. \n\n Malcolm remembers 1994, though, as the year that Democratic leadership finally recognized the power of women as voters, donors, and candidates. There is a graph charting the divergence between Democratic women’s representation in Congress, and Republican women’s. The two lines, roughly even through 1992, sharply diverge after that point. The line representing Democratic women shoots upward at a sharp angle, while the line representing Republican women plods along, rising and falling for just modest gain over time. It’s the image Malcolm says she wants engraved on her tombstone.\n\n “The ERA was a terrible loss, but it politicized a lot of women. [Geraldine] Ferraro was a terrible loss, but it showed us that there was a potential for fundraising from women who were excited about electing a woman,” Malcolm says. “You have to have a long view if you’re going to participate in social change. You will burn out. You will give up. Nothing will happen unless you understand that sometimes we lose and sometimes we win, and in that arc of change, we’re going to make progress. EMILY’s List is a case study of that concept: Women were 5 percent of the Democratic caucus. We are now 44 percent of the Democratic caucus.”\n\n But it’s not just about representation, she is quick to emphasize. “It’s the changes to the agenda that have taken place because of the women we elected. It was women that wanted family medical leave, it was women voters that wanted health care reform,” she says. “The whole legislative agenda has shifted because women are now considered important in politics.”\n\n After Harris’ loss,The New York Times ran a headline that wondered aloud whether the United State would ever be ready for a woman president. The piece concluded, quoting Bill Clinton and Lindsey Graham: Maybe — if it’s a Republican. Malcolm, whose life’s work has been devoted to electing Democratic women, bristled at the implication. “I suppose it could be, but I gotta tell you, I don’t know where she’s going to come from, because the Republican Party could care less about putting women into offices,” she says. “It’s why they’re going backwards.”\n\n Women account for just 14 percent of the Republican congressional caucus this year, a figure that is down from the last cycle. For the first time in a decade and a half, the total number of women in Congress declined in 2025 because the GOP caucus lost women. Even the Republican women who stayed lost power within their conference: for the first time in a decade, every single elected committee chair position went to a man. (The sole woman in GOP leadership is Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chair of the House Rules committee — a position that is appointed by Speaker Mike Johnson.)\n\n “Equal representation is a non-partisan issue, but it has become a partisan problem,” Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women in Politics, wrote in a report assessing women’s representation in Congress this year. “To achieve gender parity in elected offices at every level, both parties must do the necessary, intentional work to recruit, support, and elect women.”\n\n It’s not healthy for the Republican Party, or for the country, Malcolm says, that the GOP has so few women in its ranks. “One of the reasons I want there to be more Republican women is because I’m hoping they’ll have enough of them, and they can start speaking up more about things that happen to women, and that will maybe help us find some middle ground to make progress,” Malcolm says. “They have extreme positions, and who are the voices that are going to moderate that? It’s not going to be you and me.”\n\n When she was in college, Malcolm was an experimental psychology major. She worked with rats. “What I learned was, if you put them in a maze, the rat will figure out how to get to the food. It will go down the path,” she says. “But if you take him and he can go equidistant — either to the right or left — he won’t know what to do, and he’ll just stand there. Paralyzed.” It’s not a bad analogy for the position Democrats presently find themselves in. But, Malcolm, for her part, is confident the party will find its way out. \n\n “People are shell-shocked, and what we need to do is say, ‘You’re angry, and you have every reason to be, and there’s something you can do about it.’ I believe that the leaders that are going to get us out of this mess right now are women, because it’s the women that are going to understand, powerfully, what it means to have a far-right agenda. They’re going to understand who gets hurt, and they’re going to show us a way out,” she says. “I think women are going to come out of this in much better shape… It’s doable, but it’s gonna take all of us working together. It’s not a time for the faint-hearted, and it’s not a time to give up.”","summary":"EMILY’s List founder Ellen Malcolm's advice for getting through one of the bleakest years in memory for American women","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/ellen-malcolm-emilys-list-donald-trump-1235260413/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ellen-malcolm-2016.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 15:00:00","author":"Tessa Stuart,Tessa Suart","authors":["Tessa Stuart","Tessa Suart"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":288424156,"title":"Trump expands his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News after bombshell transcript release","text":"President Trump has expanded his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News following the release of the unedited version of the network's '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nThe president's legal team filed an update to his lawsuit on Friday, adding CBS's parent company Paramount Global as a defendant because the heavily edited interview was shown on its Paramount+ streaming platform. \n\nCongressman Ronny Jackson, a close Trump ally, was also added as a plaintiff, because he 'is a consumer of broadcast and digital news media content', and 'has thus been injured by Defendants’ conduct alleged herein', the updated lawsuit said. \n\nThe new filing, first reported by Fox News, includes multiple excerpts from Harris' unedited interview, arguing they prove CBS News cut out unflattering remarks to help the Democratic nominee in the election. \n\n'Once Defendants finally released the unedited version of the Interview, it became apparent that they had engaged in gross broadcast distortion cover-up,' the lawsuit alleges. \n\nTrump's attorneys cited one exchange where Harris gave a lengthy, rambling answer about Benjamin Netanyahu, while CBS only aired about seven seconds of her remarks. \n\n'(CBS News) manipulated not only Harris’s Reply about Prime Minister Netanyahu, but the Interview in its entirety,' the lawsuit reads. \n\nThe president's legal team have also filed a Freedom of Information request to the FCC, to obtain all records of its handling of his CBS lawsuit, including from Biden-era FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel. \n\nThe unedited version of the 60 Minutes interview was ordered by Rosenworcel's replacement in the Trump administration, Brendan Carr, as part of a complaint over 'news distortion' that the FCC is now investigating. \n\nThe unedited footage found that CBS News aired just 20 minutes of their hour-long interview. \n\nIn the Netanyahu exchange, cited by Trump's attorneys in his new filing, Harris was asked by '60 Minutes' correspondent Bill Whitaker why 'seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.' \n\nTrump's filing said Harris responded with 'word salad', which they claim was deceptively edited by CBS.\n\nShe responded: 'Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. \n\n'And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.' \n\nHowever, in the clip that aired in the primetime election special, Harris gave a much more succinct answer, saying: 'We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.' \n\nFollowing the release of the unedited interview, Carr spoke out to say the conduct of CBS News' editors was 'hard to explain.' \n\nPresident Trump issued a far more hostile response after the footage was released, saying CBS News should be shut down and its flagship 60 Minutes show be 'terminated.' \n\n'CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,' Trump claimed in a post to Truth Social on Thursday morning.\n\n'They 100% removed Kamala's horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview,' he continued. 'This was Election changing 'stuff,' Election Interference and, quite simply, Election Fraud at a level never seen before.'\n\nAs CBS News faces the new president's wrath, staff at the embattled network are said to be dreading a proposed settlement of his lawsuit. \n\nStaff members are almost universally against settling Trump's $10 billion lawsuit, and would be especially irate if any proposed settlement comes with a mandated apology from the network, which has previously maintained that the clip with Harris was 'not doctored.'\n\nBut executives at Paramount reportedly believe that settling the lawsuit would increase the odds that the Trump administration would approve its multibillion-dollar merger with entertainment company Skydance, according to the New York Times. \n\nAlso on Wednesday, reports emerged revealing that USAID, which was shuttered this week by Trump at the advice of Elon Musk, paid $8 million to Politico for employees' subscriptions.\n\nTrump says this is further proof of the 'biggest scandal of them all' between Democrats, government bureaucracy and the media.\n\nHe questioned whether these entities are paying other media outlets, specifically The New York Times, to engage in activity that he claims amounts to 'election interference' and 'fraud.'\n\nIn al all caps post to Truth Social, Trump wrote: 'LOOKS LIKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN STOLLEN (sic) AT USAID, AND OTHER AGENCIES, MUCH OF IT GOING TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AS A 'PAYOFF' FOR CREATING GOOD STORIES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.'\n\n'Did the New York Times receive money??? Who else did???' the president questioned, and warned 'Democrats can't hide from this one.","summary":"The president's legal team filed an update to his lawsuit on Friday, adding CBS's parent company Paramount Global as a defendant as he called for the network to be shut down.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14375279/Trump-CBS-News-lawsuit-expands-Kamala-Harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/08/14/95001523-0-image-m-25_1739024707650.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/08/7932431385056137168/1024x576_MP4_7932431385056137168.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-08 14:58:45","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.591},{"id":288418642,"title":"Donald Trump Revokes Joe Biden’s Security Clearance","text":"President Donald Trump has said he will revoke Joe Biden’s security clearance, which includes access to daily intelligence briefings.\n\nOn a post on his Truth Social platform, the US leader wrote:\n\n“There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information.” And he added with reference to his Apprentice TV show catch phrase: JOE, YOU’RE FIRED.”\n\nBBC News reports that Trump was acting in retaliation to Biden taking the same measure on his own arrival in the White after the 2020 election, in which Biden cancelled Trump’s access.

However, it remains to be seen if he will stay impartial, or let previous beef with pop megastar Taylor Swift affect who he is cheering on.\n\nOn paper, Trump looks more likely to favor the Chiefs, having congratulated the team when they reached the Super Bowl, writing: “What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.”\n\nHe did not show the same courtesy to the Eagles. \n\nWhen the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018, during Trump’s first term, multiple members of the team chose not to attend the invitation to the White House which is extended to all Super Bowl champions.\n\nPlayers including Malcolm Jenkins and Chris Long were among those who declined the offer after voicing support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality.\n\nThe perceived slight led to Trump rescinding the offer to the whole team.\n\nMore recently, two of the Chiefs’ star players – quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce – have reacted positively to Trump’s attendance at the game. Mahomes told reporters that it would be “cool” to play in front of a sitting president, while Kelce previously said he considered it “a great honor.”\n\n“I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool,” Kelce said.\n\nHowever, while the president has lavished praise on both men, even congratulating the quarterback and his wife Brittany Mahomes on the recent birth of their daughter, he is not quite so fond of Kelce’s partner.\n\n“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” the president fumed on Truth Social, shortly after the popstar publicly endorsed his then-rival Kamala Harris for president in September. Trump also spoke on Fox and Friends to say that he was “not a fan” of the singer.\n\n“It was just a question of time... But she’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,” he said.\n\nLike the president, Swift will be at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday, to cheer on the Chiefs.

Team Rogan wanted Trump to win.\n\nNow, Rogan is fighting back. And he’s calling Harris’ representatives liars.\n\n“I wanted to release both of [the interviews] on the same day. [That was] my goal. I even offered to do it late that [same] night. So the night that Trump came on, I’m like, ‘What if we do her when she’s done in [Houston], if she came here?’ But no one ever committed to doing it. This is really important, because they keep pretending that I lied.”\n\nHarris’ handlers had all sorts of restrictions on any possible Rogan interview, Rogan says. The chat had to be roughly an hour long, even though his show often runs three hours in length. They demanded a stenographer be present during the recording as well as Harris staffers.\n\nPlus, some insiders worried about the show’s lack of editing. All of the above made sure the proposed interview never happened.\n\nNow, Rogan is disputing the account from “Fight.”\n\n“We have all the receipts, by the way,” Rogan added. “Of course, I have a whole list of conversations that took place … I think it’s someone trying to cover their ass for the fact that she never did it, and if she did do it, it might have had a positive effect.

Moreover, Trump carried all seven swing states.\n\n“We’ve seen the great march of return, emotions I can’t even describe,” said 42-year-old Luqman, describing the overwhelming joy of displaced Palestinians finally returning home despite the devastation. She credited Trump for making the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas possible.\n\nTrump’s promises \n\nYet Luqman and other Trump voters insist they strongly oppose the Republican’s idea of displacing the nearly two million Gazans from their homeland and remain committed to holding both US political parties accountable in future elections.\n\n“That’s not something we will stand for,” said Faye Nemer, 39, a prominent businesswoman who lost relatives in Israel’s recent attacks on Lebanon. “Palestine is a red line for the community.”\n\nNemer said the community met with high-level Democrats and Republicans before deciding whom to support.\n\nTrump visited Dearborn, while Harris did not, touring the state instead with Liz Cheney, who many Americans consider a war hawk.\n\nNemer, who helped organize a lunch for Trump at a local restaurant, said he pledged support for peace and a two-state solution — an assurance that swayed many voters. She remains “very optimistic” he will ultimately deliver.\n\nBishara Bahbah, a prominent Trump supporter celebrating in Dearborn on election night, is also confident in Trump’s broader vision for Middle East diplomacy.\n\n“The president wants to see peace in the Middle East that satisfies all parties,” he told AFP, insisting Trump was speaking “hypothetically rather than realistically” about displacing Gazans.\n\nBahbah chairs the group formerly known as “Arab Americans for Trump,” recently renamed “Arab Americans for Peace” — a change he says reflects the post-election shift rather than any reaction to Trump’s policies.\n\nSilence from mayors \n\nTrump also secured endorsements from Arab American mayors Bill Bazzi of Dearborn Heights and Amer Ghalib of Hamtramck, although neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nBazzi did speak to AFP on election night, celebrating Trump’s win.\n\nFor local news publisher Osama Siblani, 70, their silence may stem from embarrassment.\n\n“They have nothing to say, but they have to answer to their constituents,” he said, noting that both mayors face re-election in 2025.\n\n“Trump came here and he lied. He said, ‘I’m going to spread peace and love in the region and in the world.’ And as soon as he got in, he wants to take Canada, he wants to take Greenland, he wants to take Panama, he wants to take Gaza.”\n\nStill, Siblani believes Democrats are to blame for their losses, pointing out that his newspaper, The Arab American News, endorsed neither candidate.\n\n“We are not responsible for this outcome; our price was low,” said comedian and lawyer Amer Zahr, 47, who voted for Stein.\n\nZahr argued that Harris could have secured Arab American support simply by signaling openness to an arms embargo on Israel.\n\nInstead, Democrats’ condemnation of Trump’s proposals and newfound willingness to talk about “ethnic cleansing” only “validates” the community’s choices by proving the party can be nudged in the right direction with the right incentives, he said.\n\nLuqman, who leans strongly left on issues like the environment and abortion, acknowledged the difficult choice many faced.\n\n“A lot of people held their nose and voted who did not want to vote Republican but did it anyway, and are now open to either party,” she said.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AFP): In America&#8217;s largest Arab enclave, where frustration with President Joe Biden&#8217;s Gaza policy led many to back Donald Trump, anger is now growing over the president&#8217;s explosive proposal to take control of the Palestinian territory.

Swift will be there to support her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, the star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be playing against the Philadelphia Eagles.What To KnowUntil 2018, Swift avoided making political endorsements, telling Time magazine in 2012: \"I don't talk about politics because it might influence other people.\"In 2018, she endorsed Democratic candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections in her home state of Tennessee. Bredesen was running against Senator Marsha Blackburn. Trump responded to Swift's endorsements at the time and told reporters that he liked \"Taylor's music about 25 percent less now,\" and said that Swift \"doesn't know anything,\" about Blackburn. Swift described Blackburn as \"Trump in a wig,\" and said that she \"represents no female interests,\" in her 2020 autobiographical documentary Miss Americana. The comments from Trump about Swift stepped up in 2024.Early that year, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"I signed and was responsible for the Music Modernization act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists.\"\"Joe Biden didn't do anything for Taylor, and never will. There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our County and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money,\" and continued, \"Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal and probably can't stand me!\"Trump did sign the bill into law in October of 2018, after it was approved by the House and Senate. The bill intended to reform copyright law and royalty payments for artists.According to an excerpt from Variety editor Ramin Setoodeh about Trump's reality series, The Apprentice, Trump was asked about his thoughts on Swift in November 2023. He reportedly responded: \"She's beautiful—very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she's liberal. She probably doesn't like Trump. I hear she's very talented. I think she's very beautiful, actually—unusually beautiful.\"He also questioned whether Swift was actually liberal, saying: \"She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.\"Trump also reportedly said that Swift has \"great star quality\" but said he does not know her music well.In August 2024, Trump shared a fake image of Swift endorsing his campaign. The image depicted Swift in a mock Uncle Sam-style poster with her face that said: \"Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump,\" which Trump writing: \"I accept!\"Trump later said of the images in a Fox Businessinterview: \"I don't know anything about them, other than somebody else generated them. I didn't generate them. Somebody came out. They said, 'Oh, look at this.' These were all made up by other people. AI is always very dangerous in that way.\"Swift addressed the AI posts when she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president in 2024. She said that it \"Conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.\" She also signed the post, \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to the comments made by now-Vice President JD Vance.After her endorsement of Harris, Trump said: \"I was not a Taylor Swift fan...But she's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.\"He later escalated his rhetoric, posting on Truth Social: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.\"What People Are SayingTaylor Swift wrote in Elle in 2019: \"Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric.\"Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Today, Bantel's social media presence is less about business and more about \"empowering people by educating them about their health.\"More recently, this empowerment has taken the form of a proactive approach to obtaining contraception for her daughter. It comes amid uncertainty over whether President Donald Trump will look to restrict access to contraception in the U.S.During her election campaign, Democrat candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly claimed her rival was looking at introducing \"restrictions.\" While Trump did say he would be \"looking at\" restrictions to a person's right to contraception, he also later appeared to walk back his comments.His position was thrown into further doubt by another interview in which he suggested he would be open to restricting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.Whatever the reality of the situation, Trump's election victory saw requests for contraceptives, including long-term birth control and so-called \"morning after\" pills soar.Bantel is among those taking action. \"Like many, I had wanted to be proactive about being prepared for the changes coming with this administration,\" she said. \"As a mother, this seems like one small way to prepare. As a health content creator, it made sense to share about doing this in case people didn't know this was possible and affordable.\"To highlight this, Bantel created a video, posted to her TikTok, drdawnbantel, showing her covertly purchasing the contraceptive Plan B from a CostCo. In the clip, Bantel can be heard asking what the \"maximum\" number of packs she can buy is. A caption included alongside the video also suggests it might be \"a good idea to stock up.\"At the time of writing, Bantel's video had been watched 1.2 million times.\"I'm surprised that it went viral, but am not so surprised about the comments,\" Bantel said. \"Many people commented that they weren't aware that they could just walk up to the pharmacy window and purchase Plan B for $6.51 at a Costco. Many commented that they would be doing this as a result of this video.\"Despite the positive response the clip has received, Bantel said she remains \"absolutely terrified\" about how much further women's \"reproductive rights\" could be eroded in the coming years and said she believes people should consider \"stockpiling\" contraceptives.","summary":"Dawn Bantel told Newsweek she has received messages from other women saying how they would follow the example set in her video.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/girl-mom-terrified-about-reproductive-rights-idea-about-plan-b-2027556","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2583526/woman-searches-plan-b.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 11:00:02","author":"Jack Beresford","authors":["Jack Beresford"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":288425508,"title":"Robert De Niro on why he’s ‘not despairing’ over Trump’s presidency","text":"Robert De Niro has said he is not despairing over Trump’s second term as president in the hope that “things will right themselves”. \n\nThe Oscar-winning actor, 81, has been a longtime critic of Trump and clashed with his supporters outside his hush money trial last year. Most recently, De Niro called him a “jerk”, “clown” and “idiot”.\n\nSpeaking in a new interview with The Guardian, the actor was uncharacteristically muted on the topic when he was asked if he was hopeful or despairing since Trump’s inauguration in January. \n\n“I’m not despairing,” he replied. “Because I always look at the bright side and hope that things will right themselves and that people will appreciate goodness and empathy and will try to do the right thing.”\n\n“Some people look at [things] differently,” he continued. “They have different values. That’s disturbing to me. I don’t understand it. But I just have to look at things in an optimistic way.”\n\nInterviewer Xan Brooks noted in the article that the strict terms of the interview with Netflix – tied to the release De Niro’s new political thriller Zero Day – included “no personal or political questions”, which might explain De Niro’s more muted, and certainly less colourful, thoughts on Trump’s presidency. \n\nSpeaking in a pre-election interview in November on Max’s Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?, De Niro – who was a vocal supporter of Kamala Harris’s election campaign – branded Trump and his allies as “not real Republicans”.\n\nWallace went on to ask De Niro whether the actor had any run-ins with the real estate mogul in New York during the 1970s and 1980s, and whether there was any personal animosity between the pair.\n\n“No. I never wanted anything to do with him,” responded De Niro. “He’s a jerk, an idiot, who wants to meet a clown like that?\n\n“You’ve got to help everybody. People are going to get overlooked. That happens, but at least you have somebody who’s sensitive to the condition of the country, the people. And I’m not saying this like this, because it’s Kamala Harris, but it is. We need someone like her to do it. She’ll make mistakes. Of course, everybody does, but we need somebody with the right intentions, this guy does not have the right intentions, and everybody knows that. It’s insanity. Period.”\n\nSpeaking outside Donald Trump’s “hush money” trial in June 2024, De Niro called Trump “tyrant” and warned of the consequences if he were to be elected for a second time.\n\n“When Trump ran in 2016 it was like a joke,” he said in the speech. “This buffoon running for president. No, never could happen. We have forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren’t taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now.”\n\nTrump and De Niro have previously exchanged blows in the past as the actor was a fierce critic of the president’s policies in his first term, while The Apprentice star has branded him a “loser” in return.\n\n“Robert De Niro, whose acting talents have greatly diminished, with his reputation now shot, must even use a teleprompter for his foul and disgusting language, so disrespectful to our Country,” Trump wrote in a 2023 post.","summary":"‘Taxi Driver’ actor has been a fierce longtime critic of the president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/robert-de-niro-donald-trump-netflix-zero-day-b2694572.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/08/10/37/Robert-De-Niro-and-Donald-Trump.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UcQrc9H7-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-08 10:12:11","author":"Ellie Muir","authors":["Ellie Muir"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":288376738,"title":"Comedian suing over DEI after allegedly being cut from roles reveals the ‘real’ problem with Hollywood","text":"One comedian is exposing Hollywood's casting culture with a lawsuit after being allegedly cut from acting roles over D.E.I. policies.

The program was filmed at famed podcast host Joe Rogan's new club, The Comedy Mothership in Austin, TX on Jan. 20 — the same day President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term.The Inauguration-inspired, 45-minute special is a satirical look at the current state of politics and culture, with Fischer blending his razor-sharp political commentary with impersonations of President-elect Trump, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Elon Musk and others in Trump’s cabinet. Fischer is well known for his unapologetic performances, having gained popularity for his impressions of political leaders and commentators; on YouTube, a skit of him mimicking the voice of Daily Wire commentator Jordan Peterson has over one million views. Along with making his own comedic videos on political and social issues on social media platforms, Fischer is currently touring the United States doing more stand-up routines.

This is not funding. It is a transaction.\"'Punish the media'The White House has said it will cancel its Politico subscriptions.Other media outlets also risk losing millions of dollars if the government drops more subscriptions, a lever for the Trump administration to undermine a press that is already facing financial strain, observers say.\"The upshot of all of this nonsense is that the (Make America Great Again) base has new lore they can use to explain away any unfavorable coverage for Trump,\" said Matt Gertz, from the left-leaning think tank Media Matters, referring to the president's key \"MAGA\" political slogan.In another kind of pressure, Brendan Carr, Trump's new head of the Federal Communications Commission, has ordered an investigation into NPR and PBS, a move that some worry is aimed at unraveling federal funding for public broadcasters.\"The new administration seems to be ramping up a multifaceted effort to punish the media,\" Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University professor, told AFP.\"We are moving beyond mere threats.\"$10 billion lawsuitIn an unprecedented move, Trump's administration announced that eight media organizations including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, NBC and NPR must vacate their dedicated office spaces in the Pentagon.It cited the need to create room for other outlets including the conservative New York Post and Breitbart.And in December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump which contended the network's star anchor George Stephanopoulos had defamed him.The settlement was seen as a major concession by a large media organization to Trump, whose previous efforts to sue news outlets have often ended in defeat.\"The spectacle of powerful media organizations debasing themselves before Trump has become so familiar that it is beginning to feel like scheduled programming,\" Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, wrote in a New York Times column.CBS News, a broadcaster at the center of another FCC probe and a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump, recently complied with an FCC request to hand over the raw footage from an interview last year with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, with the president accusing it of deceitful editing.Paramount, CBS's parent company, is now considering settling the lawsuit, media reports say, at a time when it needs Trump's support for its proposed merger with Skydance.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"US president Donald Trump has long had an antagonistic relationship with mainstream news outlets, deriding them as the \"enemy of the people.\"","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-battle-with-the-us-media-7663777","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-02/ri9e9ljs_donald-trump_625x300_05_February_25.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 09:57:03","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":288358440,"title":"What Was Travis Kelce Supposed to Say About Donald Trump?

CBS has sought to throw out the suit, arguing that its editorial decisions are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe president amended his complaint on Friday night, adding a new claim for “unfair competition” under the federal Lanham Act. The claim alleges Trump was harmed by CBS’ conduct through his role as an owner of the Truth Social platform.\n\n“President Trump was harmed as a competitor in the news media industry and suffered actualdamages in an amount to be determined upon trial of this action,” the complaint states. As a result of CBS’ editing, the suit alleges, “viewership was improperly diverted to Defendants’ media platforms, resulting in lower consumer engagement, advertising revenues and profits” for Truth Social and Trump’s other media ventures.\n\nCBS released full transcripts and video of its Harris interview earlier this week in response to a demand from the Federal Communications Commission. The transcript shows that CBS used one portion of Harris’ response on “Face the Nation” and a different portion the next day on “60 Minutes.”\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the full transcript shows that the entire interview was “manipulated.”\n\n“Defendants’ tampering went way beyond the exchange about Prime Minister Netanyahu,” the suit alleges. “This was a full-blown cover-up of an incompetent candidate in Harris, substantially motivated by commercial gain and rabid partisanship.”\n\nThe amended complaint argues that “60 Minutes” deleted other “Harris word salads that made no sense” in addition to the Gaza answer.\n\nThe complaint was also amended to address CBS’ arguments in its motion to dismiss. CBS had noted that neither it nor Trump resides in Texas, and therefore there is no reason to litigate the case in Amarillo. If the case is not dismissed, CBS asked to move it to New York.\n\nIn response, Trump added Ronny Jackson, the Republican congressman from Amarillo, as a co-plaintiff. The amended complaint alleges that Jackson is, like Trump, a consumer of news who was “deceived and misled” by the “60 Minutes” interview.\n\nThe suit alleges that Trump suffered at least $10 billion in damages on the Lanham Act claim, in addition to $10 billion on the original Texas consumer fraud claim. The suit also notes that Jackson sustained unspecified “substantial damages” on the latter claim.\n\nCBS has already argued that the Lanham Act, like the Texas statute, governs only commercial speech, and does not apply to political and editorial speech.\n\n“There can be no serious argument that President Trump’s claim arises out of commercial speech,” the company’s lawyers wrote in their motion to dismiss.\n\nParamount Global, the parent of CBS, is nevertheless considering a potential settlement with Trump, according to sources familiar with the matter. Trump called this week for CBS’ license to be revoked, and the FCC would have to approve Paramount’s pending merger with Skydance.\n\nBrian Steinberg contributed to this story.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Trump amended his lawsuit against CBS on Friday, doubling the amount&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump continues to pursue CBS &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; lawsuit and seeks $20 billion in damages. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/trump-continues-to-pursue-cbs-60-minutes-lawsuit-and-seeks-20-billion-in-damages/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Trump-Doubles-Down-on-CBS-60-Minutes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 08:59:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":288351154,"title":"Travis Kelce may be nearing the end but Super Bowl LIX could add to Mr Taylor Swift’s legacy","text":"During the build-up to Super Bowl LIX this weekend, no one’s words have been more heavily scrutinised than Travis Kelce’s. That comes with the territory when you’re Mr Taylor Swift.\n\nBeing in a relationship with the most famous woman on the planet means that when you answer a question about Donald Trump becoming the first sitting US president in history to attend the NFL showpiece, your comments gain traction.\n\n“I think no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life and having the president there… It’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool,” Kansas City Chiefs star Kelce said, fairly innocuously, during a press conference earlier this week.\n\nCue online outrage.\n\nSwift’s legion of fans were largely quick to condemn her boyfriend for tacitly supporting the presence of Trump, given the pop megastar’s history with the president.\n\nAhead of November’s US election, Swift endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris as she released a lengthy Instagram post in which she concluded that Harris “fights for the rights and causes I believe”.\n\nShe signed off her post “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady” in a dig at the now vice-president JD Vance, who, in a dig at the then vice-president Harris, had claimed in a 2021 interview that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too”.\n\nTrump, naturally, responded to the endorsement by appearing on Fox News to state that he was “not a fan of Taylor Swift”.\n\nThe spat was one of the many subplots of that election campaign and while it may have been broadly put out of their minds by the wider public, given everything that has happened in American politics since, Swifties never forget – which means it still has resonance in Kelce’s life.\n\nNot that he minds the limelight. In fact, both on and off the field, Kelce seems to thrive in it. In his day job, the 35-year-old is one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history.\n\nA 10-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro (four first-team and three second-team selections), he has had more seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards than any other TE in history and holds the record for most receiving yards in a single season by a player at his position – 1,416 in 2020.\n\nFor a stretch of time, he was simply uncoverable for defensive players – everyone knew that he was Patrick Mahomes’s favourite, and sometimes only, target yet they still couldn’t stop him. When he retires, he will go into the NFL Hall of Fame, likely as a first-ballot pick.\n\nHe has always had a knack for rising to the big occasion. As he hunts a fourth Super Bowl ring with the Chiefs on Sunday evening, he is already safe in the knowledge that he has more career postseason receptions (174), career postseason games with at least 100 receiving yards (nine) and career postseason games with at least one receiving touchdown (15) than any other player, regardless of position, in the history of the NFL.\n\nWhen the light shines brightest, Travis Kelce steps up.\n\nBy his standards, he had a quiet regular season in 2024, amassing 97 catches for 823 yards (at just 8.5 yards per catch) and scoring only three touchdowns – the yardage, yards per catch and touchdown totals being the lowest since his 2013 rookie season when he played just one game.\n\nYet, against the Houston Texans in Kansas City’s play-off opener, he caught seven passes for 117 yards and a touchdown as the Chiefs battled to a 23-14 triumph.\n\nHe is definitely slowing down and his retirement date – enforced or otherwise – may be starting to come into view over the horizon but you’d be a brave person to bet against him having a big impact against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on Sunday. \n\nAnd the man himself is adamant that the end is not nigh.\n\n“I want to play as long as I can play,” Kelce said during the Super Bowl media day this week. “It’s months like these that make me feel like I can play forever. I’ve still got a lot of football left in me.”\n\nWhen he does hang up his pads and helmet, Kelce won’t be short of opportunities outside American football. He already has his hugely popular podcast New Heights alongside his brother, former Eagles offensive lineman Jason, which was ranked as the eighth most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.\n\nIn his pre-Taylor Swift era, he was the centre of dating show Catching Kelce on E!, he has hosted Saturday Night Live, and will appear in the upcoming Adam Sandler film Happy Gilmore 2.\n\nOf course, being the boyfriend of Swift also brings a huge amount of media coverage; speculation that he will propose to her at the Super Bowl on Sunday is rife. You can even bet on such an occurrence if you so wish.\n\nOver the past two years, Kelce has become a celebrity beyond the world of American football. However, he’s still got unfinished business within the sport and Super Bowl LIX may prove to be the latest incredible addition to his glittering career CV.","summary":"One of the greatest tight ends in NFL history now picks his moments and winning a fourth Super Bowl ring with the Kansas City Chiefs could be exactly that","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/nfl/super-bowl-travis-kelce-taylor-swift-kansas-city-chiefs-b2694299.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/27/10/d84d0ace9c984b1181b2ab0fb9beddb0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wN19vkMW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-08 08:30:16","author":"Luke Baker","authors":["Luke Baker"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.394},{"id":288347618,"title":"Trump’s lawsuit against CBS expands after release of ‘60 Minutes’ transcript, adds Paramount as defendant","text":"President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News was expanded following the release of the unedited transcript and raw footage of its “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to a late-Friday filing from Trump’s legal team reviewed by Fox News Digital, the lawsuit is adding CBS News’ parent company Paramount Global as a defendant, citing how the “60 Minutes” election special was platformed on its Paramount+ streaming service.\n\nAdditionally, the lawsuit is adding Rep.

And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,” Harris responded.\n\nTrump’s FCC chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC’s “news distortion” policy after a complaint was filed.\n\nIn the preview clip that aired on “Face the Nation,” Harris was asked why it seemed like Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the US. \n\n“Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,” Harris responded in the “Face the Nation” clip. \n\nHarris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy “word salad” to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed.\n\n“We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,” Harris said in the primetime special. \n\nCritics accused CBS News of editing Harris’ “word salad” answer to shield the vice president from further backlash, and there were calls for the network to release the full transcript after it only shared transcripts of what had aired. CBS News refused to release the raw transcript at the time.\n\nCarr said it’s “hard to explain” CBS News’ conduct. \n\n“On the one hand, CBS immediately released the unredacted transcript of a recent interview with Vice President Vance. Yet for months they refused to release the one with Vice President Harris,” Carr told Fox News Digital. \n\nCarr referred to CBS News releasing the transcript of “Face the Nation” anchor Margaret Brennan’s interview with Vice President JD Vance last month.\n\n“The FCC has now opened up a proceeding and is seeking public comment on the News Distortion complaint. Transparency here is important. The FCC’s review will continue, and we look forward to the public’s feedback,” Carr added. \n\nIn October, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News alleging election interference over its handling of the “60 Minutes” interview, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing just days before the election. \n\n“To paper over Kamala’s ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” the lawsuit stated.\n\nTrump attorneys argued the edits were done in an effort to “attempt to tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party as the heated 2024 Presidential Election — which President Trump is leading — approaches its conclusion.”\n\n“CBS’ partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public,” the lawsuit read. \n\nCBS parent company Paramount Global is reportedly considering settling the suit ahead of a planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump’s FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is reportedly in favor of settling with the president.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News was expanded following the release of the unedited transcript and raw footage of its “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

I’d love to see that, but some people say that would be a long shot.” \n\nMr Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January and will leave office once Canada’s Liberal Party selects a new leader, responded to Mr Trump’s comments for the first time at an economic summit in Toronto on Saturday AEDT.\n\n“I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have, but that may be even why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state,” the outgoing Prime Minister told the gathering of business leaders and company executives.\n\nCanada is home to 31 minerals, many of them considered essential to modern technology including mobile phones, electric car batteries, solar panels and defence applications.\n\n“They’re very aware of our resources of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,” Mr Trudeau said of the US. \n\n“But Mr Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.” \n\nWhile media outlets were not in the room at the time, Mr Trudeau’s remarks were recorded by The Toronto Star and the CBC. The Prime Minister’s office did not further clarify his remarks to either publication. \n\nMr Trump and Mr Trudeau agreed to a 30-day reprieve from tariffs, after the President slapped 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports with the exception of energy resources, which would be hit with a 10 per cent levy. \n\nIn response, Canada announced it would target American goods worth $171 billion with counter-tariffs. The first round, worth $33 billion, included cosmetics, appliances, tyres, tools, plastics, furniture, coffee, wines and spirits, dairy and fruits. \n\nAs part of its plan to fend off the tariffs, Mr Trudeau pledged to adopt a more stringent plan to secure the nations’ shared border against fentanyl trafficking. \n\nThe President downplayed Canada’s role as one of America’s top trade partners, telling reporters the US “don’t need them” – but “as a state, it’s different”. \n\n“As a state it’s much different. And there are no tariffs,” Mr Trump told reporters. \n\n“So I’d love to see that. Some people say that would be a long shot. If people wanted to play the game right, it would be 100 per cent certain that they’d become a state. But a lot of people don’t like to play the game. Because they don’t have a threshold of pain.” \n\nMr Trump’s repeated talk of annexing Canada spans as far back as his November election, and was originally brushed off as a joke by Mr Trudeau and his government. \n\nBut ahead of his inauguration in January, Mr Trump pledged to use “economic force” to compel the union, describing their border as an “artificially drawn line”. \n\n“Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something,” Mr Trump said, though ruled out the use of military might. \n\n“You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security.”\n\n“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Mr Trudeau said in response to the remarks.\n\n“Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other’s biggest trading and security partner.” \n\nOfficials and experts now fear that Mr Trump’s recent doubling-down on the matter means it’s no longer being said in jest – if it ever was. \n\nPolitical science professor at Montreal’s McGill University, Daniel Beland, described Mr Trump’s stated intentions as “unprecedented” and “highly damaging”. \n\n“He is eroding Canadians’ trust towards the US in ways that will make it hard to repair the relationship,” Professor Beland told Associated Press.\n\n“It’s certainly one of the worst moments in Canada-US relations since the creation of Canada in 1867. \n\n“His talk about making Canada the 51st state is a direct attack against the country’s sovereignty. Even if we exclude that threat, he shows no respect for Canada’s sovereignty and institutions.” \n\nPremier of British Columbia, David Eby, accused Mr Trump of deploying a deliberate strategy to “destroy Canada’s economy” – leaving it no choice but to become America’s 51st state. \n\nWhile Canada’s Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre said in an interview with CTV in January: “My message to incoming President Trump is that first and foremost, Canada will never be the 51st state of the US.” \n\nDespite Mr Trump’s declaration after Mr Trudeau’s resignation that “many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st state”, a recent Leger poll, reported by The Canadian Press, found 82 per cent of Canadians were opposed to the idea. Ahead of the presidential election, they were similarly perturbed by the prospect Mr Trump as President again. \n\nRoughly two-thirds of respondents in another Leger poll backed former Vice President Kamala Harris, compared to just 21 per cent being in favour of the now-leader. \n\nMount Royal University’s Duane Bratt, a political-science professor with a focus on Canadian foreign policy, told The Hill if Mr Trump were to annex Canada, it would unlikely boost his fanbase. \n\n“I don’t think he realises that Canada would be a Democratic state – that we would be a blue state the size of California,” Professor Bratt said. \n\n“At what point is a joke not a joke? He went from talking about ‘Governor’ Trudeau and becoming the 51st state to, today, talking about economic coercion, economic force.”","summary":"Justin Trudeau has said he believes Donald Trump’s threat to annex Canada and make it America’s 51st state is far from a joke.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/real-thing-canada-on-edge-at-donald-trumps-takeover-threat/news-story/16b61ecc34054d7ac1292fd17e857db0?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/755d65ab99140deb227fb7e7cafa3176","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 07:47:13","author":"Natalie Brown","authors":["Natalie Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.146},{"id":288329262,"title":"Kanye ‘Ye’ West professes love for Hitler and claims ‘dominion’ over wife Bianca Censori","text":"No contrarian provocation, attention-seeking behaviour masking the need to promote an upcoming album, ‘this is Ye being Ye’ or recent autism diagnosis can excuse this.Controversial rapper Kanye ‘Ye’ West has gone on X for a prolonged hateful spew in which he has said – amongst many, many things – that P Diddy should be released and that “woke shit” promotes obesity, while launching homophobic slurs against those who supported Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris.He also launched a verbal attack on the Jewish community, saying that he is “never apologising for my Jewish comments” - thereby revoking his previous apology for antisemitism.“I’m never apologising for my Jewish comments.

Swift is expected to attend the Super Bowl, potentially setting up an encounter with Trump.\n\nWhy It Matters: The interaction between Trump and Kelce is noteworthy given the backdrop of Trump’s past public comments about Taylor Swift.\n\nIn September, Trump expressed his dislike for Swift on Truth Social, stating, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” This comment was met with a witty response from Kamala Harris' campaign, emphasizing the American people’s desire to move forward.\n\nMoreover, Trump’s prediction that Swift would face marketplace repercussions for endorsing Harris did not materialize. Instead, Swift continued to achieve significant success, as evidenced by her record-breaking “Eras Tour” and the launch of her new “Eras Tour Book.”\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman Looks To Raise Funds From Abu Dhabi's MGX Amid Increased Competition: Report\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ misconduct, significant viewership was improperly diverted to Defendants’ media platforms, resulting in lower consumer engagement, advertising revenues, and profits by TMTG and President Trump’s other media holdings,” Trump’s attorneys wrote in the new complaint, filed in federal court in Amarillo, TX.\n\nHis attorneys added, “The damages suffered by President Trump stem in substantial part from consumers’ withholding of trade by reduced engagement with content distributed by Truth Social and President Trump’s other media holdings, and was exacerbated by increased expenses associated with clarifying the true nature of the Interview and its content.”\n\nTrump also upped the amount of claimed damages, with him now doubling the size of his claim to $20 billion, which exceeds the cost of all spending in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump also added another plaintiff to the lawsuit: Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), the former White House physician, a move to try to address CBS’ argument that his filing of the case in Texas was an attempt at forum shopping.\n\nTrump sued CBS in October, after it aired a 60 Minutes election special featuring an interview with Harris. At one point in the interview, correspondent Bill Whitaker asked Harris why Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not listening to the Biden administration.\n\nHarris said, “Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nIn a Face the Nation promo for the interview, Harris was shown giving the first sentence in her answer. On 60 Minutes, she was shown answering with the last sentence. Trump pounced on the differences, claiming that it was an effort by the network to make Harris look better and tip the electoral scales in her favor.\n\nThe network released the unedited transcript this week and said that it showed that the interview was “not doctored or deceitful,” but an edit made because of time constraints. In fact, Fox News edited its interview with Trump from the previous June.\n\nCBS has moved to dismiss the case, which it says is an effort to punish them for their editorial judgments, something that is barred by the First Amendment. It also argued that Trump’s lawsuit was merely “generalized grievance.”\n\nTrump has targeted media outlets with numerous lawsuits, most of which have been dismissed. Many legal experts see his CBS lawsuit as frivolous, but it has landed just as CBS parent Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval for its acquisition by Skydance. Sources say that Paramount Global and Trump’s team have engaged in settlement talks.\n\nThe FCC, which has to greenlight the transaction, also has opened an inquiry into the 60 Minutes edit, even though the current chairman, Brendan Carr, has previously warned against government officials targeting newsroom decision making.\n\nIn his original complaint, Trump cited Texas’ Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which generally involves claims of false advertising. His amended lawsuit now also claims false advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, citing its clause on misrepresentation in commercial advertising and promotion. It claims that the Face the Nation promo represented an advertisement, “misleading the American public and driving engagement with the Interview and Election Special due to questions about the authenticity of this programming.”\n\nIn a previous response to Trump’s lawsuit, CBS contended that “editorial judgments are non-commercial speech that lies wholly outside the scope” of the Texas law.\n\nThe network also responded the Trump’s claim that the 60 Minutes interview hurt his electoral prospects. CBS’ attorneys wrote that “that claim is mooted by the election, which Plaintiff won.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump filed an amended lawsuit against CBS late Friday, adding a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump changes allegations in lawsuit against CBS over &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; interview with Kamala Harris, accusing them of unfairly drawing attention away from his Truth Social network. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-changes-allegations-in-lawsuit-against-cbs-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris-accusing-them-of-unfairly-drawing-attention-away-from-his-truth-social-network/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 07:08:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":288333966,"title":"Trump's lawsuit against CBS expands after release of '60 Minutes' transcript, adds Paramount as defendant","text":"FIRST ON FOX - President Donald Trump's lawsuit against CBS News was expanded following the release of the unedited transcript and raw footage of its \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. According to a late-Friday filing from Trump's legal team reviewed by Fox News Digital, the lawsuit is adding CBS News' parent company Paramount Global as a defendant, citing how the \"60 Minutes\" election special was platformed on its Paramount+ streaming service. Additionally, the lawsuit is adding Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, as a plaintiff. \"Representative Jackson is a consumer of broadcast and digital news media content in this State, District, and Division, including the broadcast and digital news media content from Defendants at issue in this action, and he has thus been injured by Defendants’ conduct alleged herein,\" the amended complaint states. Trump's attorneys amended its lawsuit to include multiple excerpts from the unedited transcript in hopes of bolstering their case that CBS News withheld unflattering exchanges in order to help the Democratic nominee. \"Once Defendants finally released the unedited version of the Interview, it became apparent that they had engaged in gross broadcast distortion cover-up and manipulated not only Harris’s Reply about Prime Minister Netanyahu, but the Interview in its entirety,\" the filing states. CBS STAFFERS UPSET OVER ‘60 MINUTES’ DRAMA, ADMIT KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW EDITS WERE AN ‘UNFORCED ERROR’ For example, in one of the exchanges highlighted from the unedited transcript, \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker pressed Harris on how the number of border crossings had \"quadrupled\" in the first three years of the Biden administration. Harris provided another \"word salad answer,\" Trump's attorneys argued. \"There are a variety of factors that relate to what we have seen globally, and what we are not immune from at our own border in terms of what we have seen in terms of the surge of immigration and irregular migration,\" Harris told Whitaker. \"And there are solutions at hand, but we’ve got to have leaders who are solution-oriented, which we've been and are, and I am going forward, instead of leaders who want to make it a problem they can run on.\" Trump's attorneys also have filed a FOIA request to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to obtain all records pertaining to his lawsuit against CBS News, including from Biden-era FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel. Neither CBS News nor Paramount Global immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment. On Wednesday, the FCC released the raw transcript and footage handed over by CBS News, which showed CBS News had aired only the first half of Harris' response to Whitaker's question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not \"listening\" to the Biden administration in a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" but aired only the second half of her response during the primetime special. \"But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,\" Whitaker said in the October 2024 interview. \"The Wall Street Journal said that he— that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties.\" \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris responded. Trump's FCC chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. FCC CHAIR CALLS CBS NEWS' CONDUCT ‘HARD TO EXPLAIN’ FOLLOWING RELEASE OF KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT In the preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" Harris was asked why it seemed like Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the U.S. \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,\" Harris responded in the \"Face the Nation\" clip. Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy \"word salad\" to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed. \"We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris said in the primetime special. Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash, and there were calls for the network to release the full transcript after it only shared transcripts of what had aired. CBS News refused to release the raw transcript at the time. Carr said it's \"hard to explain\" CBS News' conduct. \"On the one hand, CBS immediately released the unredacted transcript of a recent interview with Vice President Vance. Yet for months they refused to release the one with Vice President Harris,\" Carr told Fox News Digital. Carr referred to CBS News releasing the transcript of \"Face the Nation\" anchor Margaret Brennan's interview with Vice President JD Vance last month. \"The FCC has now opened up a proceeding and is seeking public comment on the News Distortion complaint. Transparency here is important. The FCC’s review will continue, and we look forward to the public’s feedback,\" Carr added. ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCER DEFIANT AS CBS PARENT COMPANY MULLS SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT: ‘I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE’ In October, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News alleging election interference over its handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing just days before the election. \"To paper over Kamala’s ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,\" the lawsuit stated.

Rubenstein, the Baltimore Orioles owner, who was originally appointed to the board by President George W. Bush in 2010. He was subsequently reappointed by President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden.Rubenstein had announced plans to retire in January 2025, but he pushed that date back until September 2026 after Trump's election victory.The rest of the board is a mixture of Trump, Biden and Obama allies.It includes Biden's White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, former Obama adviser Stephanie Cutter, as well as Trump's new attorney general Pam Bondi, and Lee Greenwood, whose song \"God Bless the USA,\" was repeatedly featured during his rallies. The board treasurer is television producer Shonda Rhimes.Trump, who has not identified who on the board he is firing aside from Rubenstein, claims he is terminating them because they don't share his vision for a \"Golden Age\" of the arts.What to knowTrump said he will be in charge of programming at the national cultural center going forward.One major change he promised, was that he planned to put an end to drag shows.\"Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,\" he wrote on Truth Social.According to its website, the center hosted a \"Drag Brunch\" last November, and held a June preshow titled \"A Drag Salute to Divas.\"The Bidens, the Obamas, the Bushes, and many other First Families have attended the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremonies during their terms.However, Trump and Melania did not attend the ceremony during his first term.That may be due, in part, after many artists protested against his first administration and threatened to boycott his White House events.There has already been a strong backlash to the announcement, with some asking if the president even has the legal power to fire the board and appoint himself.What is The Kennedy Center?The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was opened in 1971, by then-President Nixon, in tribute to JFK, a lifelong advocate for the arts before his assassination.Serving as the United States' national cultural center, in Washington D.C. it is one of the country's premier destinations for the performing arts, featuring a wide range of performances, including theater, ballet, music, and opera.The Kennedy Center offers educational programs and hosts the annual Kennedy Center Honors to celebrate significant contributions to the arts in America.What people are sayingDonald Trump wrote on his Truth Social social media site: \"The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!\"The Kennedy Center said, in response to Trump taking over: \"We have received no official communications from the White House regarding changes to our board of trustees. We are aware that some members of our board have received termination notices from the administration.\"Mike Nellis, former senior advisor to Kamala Harris, posted on X: \"Trump appointing himself Chair of the Kennedy Center makes sense when you remember Musk is running the country and he's bored as hell.\"Collin Rugg, news personality and co-owner of Trending Politics, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \" Trump terminates the chairman of the Kennedy Center in D.C., appoints himself as the new chairman then immediately bans drag shows targeting youth. One of the greatest trolls of all time.\"Phil Williams, an investigative reporter with News Channel 5, posted on X: \"President Trump's Kennedy Center announcement appears to be blatantly illegal.

Men are to blame. Or their masculinity is toxic. Or unless you’re able to conform to our very strict kinds of definition of what we think’s appropriate, well, then, hey, I’m going to find an alternative. And they [men] have done that,’ he told Tara Palmeri in a clip posted Friday.\n\nHe said the entire party has become a save haven for ‘shaming and scolding’ that has caused voters to abandon them. \n\n‘I think their [Democrats’] primary currency was shaming and scolding and talking down to people and telling them, ‘Hey, I know better than you,’ or ‘You’re dopes,’ or ‘You’re a bro,’ or ‘You’re ignorant,’ or, you know, ‘Don’t you—how can you be this dumb?’\n\nHe also said that Democrats need to stop referring to Trump voters as fascists.\n\n‘I know, and I love people that voted for Trump, and they’re not fascist, you know, they don’t support insurrection and those things,’ he said.\n\n‘And if you go to an extreme and you become a boutique kind of a proposition, then you’re going to lose the argument. And then we have done that,’ Fetterman added.\n\nHe also criticized Democrats for refusing to consider many of Trump’s Cabinet nominees, including now-Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom he voted for. \n\n‘She was the Attorney General of the third-largest state [Florida] in the nation, and she was a DA for 17, 18 years. So, in terms of qualifications, she absolutely was a serious person,’ he said. \n\nBondi was confirmed with just Fetterman’s loan Democrat vote in a 54-46 margin. \n\n‘And in her politics and other issues, I wouldn’t agree with those things. So if everything is a no, or everything is a freakout, or you refuse, or you demand purity in every interaction, then you’re never going to get anything done,’ Fetterman said. \n\nFetterman, an unwavering supporter of Israel in a Democrat Party often torn apart by Middle East relations, even expressed curiosity about Trump’s plot to take over Gaza. \n\n‘I think it was more to kind of shake things up and start a very more honest conversation on Gaza,’ he said, while admitting it was ‘not serious.’\n\nIn January, Fetterman eschewed party lines to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. \n\nThat made him the first Senate Democrat to make the trek down to Florida to sit down with the 78-year-old since he won the presidential election. \n\nFetterman also wrote in a post on X that he would ‘meet with anyone to secure some wins, including President Trump.’ \n\nTheir meeting was first reported by CBS News as the lawmaker revealed he is willing to reach across the aisle after the president-elect won his state in the November election.\n\nThe move by the Pennsylvania Democrat is the latest in a series of actions that have drawn wrath from some liberals since he was elected to the Senate in 2022.\n\nFetterman was a co-sponsor of the Republican-led Laken Riley Act and voted for the bill in the Senate after it passed in the House. \n\nThe legislation introduced by Republicans expands the detention of immigrants convicted of crimes including burglary and shoplifting. \n\nFetterman argued if immigrants in the U.S. illegally commit crimes, it should not be controversial to detain them. \n\nBut the bill also expands the powers of state attorneys general who claim their states have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government. \n\nSome immigrant advocacy groups have warned it would hand state officials veto power over federal immigration policy, cause chaos over immigration cases in the court system and threatens due process. \n\nBut Fetterman is one of several Senate Democrats who came out in support of the bill.\n\nThe senator has also faced criticism from liberals for his willingness to meet with some of Trump’s other more controversial Cabinet picks including sitting down with Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whom he eventually voted against.\n\nFetterman has pushed back that it is his job as a senator to vet nominees and that means meeting with them.\n\nFor more than a year now, the Pennsylvania Democrat has also stood up to anger from progressives for his staunch support of Israel since the October 7, 2023 attack while calling for the return of hostages taken by Hamas. \n\nIn 2022, Fetterman won the Pennsylvania Senate race with more than 51 percent of the vote or by more than 260,000 votes.\n\nBut Pennsylvania flipped red in 2024 when Trump was elected in the presidential race with just over 50 percent of the vote despite Fetterman campaigning heavily first for President Biden and then Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTheir meeting will be a far cry from the attacks lobbed from both sides on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump was a leading critic of Fetterman as he helped campaign for his opponent, Dr. Oz, in the 2022 midterms. \n\nHe even baselessly accused the then-Senate candidate and lieutenant governor of using drugs and called him a ‘raging lunatic’ and a ‘marxist.’\n\nFetterman blasted Trump for lying about him in the midterm. In the 2024 election, he warned of the dangers of the Republican ticket while hitting the campaign trail for Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJohn Fetterman has cast doubt on the possibility of Democrats winning back huge&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: John Fetterman confesses what other Democrats are not willing to admit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/john-fetterman-confesses-what-other-democrats-are-not-willing-to-admit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-John-Fetterman-admits-what-no-Democrat-is.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 05:12:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.294}]}
