But we're dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don't play fair and they never did.'\n\nThe remarks come just days after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly opened fire during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, killing the 31-year-old Kirk in what authorities are investigating as a politically motivated attack. \n\nAccording to investigators, bullet casings found at the scene were etched with obscure fascist memes, video game references, and online slang deepening fears that political discourse online is turning deadly.\n\nOfficials say Robinson had no prior criminal history and was previously unaffiliated with any political party. \n\nPublic records indicate his last voter registration was in July 2021 with no party declared. But according to a relative, he had voiced strong criticism of Kirk at a family dinner shortly before the Utah Valley event.\n\nRobinson now faces multiple felony charges, including aggravated murder and obstruction of justice.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued his most explosive remarks yet following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\n\nTrump blamed the 'radical left' for obstructing national healing and explicitly called for billionaire Democratic donor George Soros and 'radical left son' Alex to be jailed \n\nProsecutors have not announced whether they will pursue the death penalty despite Trump's insistence.\n\nWhile the investigation into Robinson's motives remains ongoing, Trump wasted no time casting blame far beyond the shooter. \n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Fox & Friends, Trump accused George Soros, the 95-year-old Hungarian-American philanthropist and founder of the Open Society Foundations, of playing an indirect role in Kirk's death.\n\n'We're going to look into Soros,' Trump said, suggesting he could face prosecution under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) - a law typically used to go after organized crime.\n\nPressed again on Saturday by NBC, Trump doubled down: 'He should be put in jail. He's a bad guy.'\n\nHis remarks echoed those posted on his Truth Social platform last month.\n\n'George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America. We're not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more, never giving it so much as a chance to 'BREATHE,' and be FREE,' Trump wrote.\n\n'Soros, and his group of psychopaths, have caused great damage to our Country! That includes his Crazy, West Coast friends. Be careful, we're watching you!' \n\nThe remarks come just days after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly opened fire during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University, killing 31-year-old Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk is seen at Utah Valley University, greeted by supporters and security personnel. This moment occurred minutes before the fatal shooting that ended his life\n\nThe incendiary rhetoric prompted a swift and firm rebuttal from Soros's organization, the Open Society Foundations.\n\n'The Open Society Foundations, founded by George Soros and chaired by Alex Soros, do not support or fund violent protests. Allegations to the contrary are false, and the threats against our founder and chair are outrageous. \n\n'Our mission is to advance human rights, justice, and democratic principles in the United States and around the world. We stand for fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the US Constitution, including the rights to free speech and peaceful protest that are hallmarks of any vibrant democracy.'\n\nKirk's killing has sent shockwaves through conservative circles, with tributes pouring in from right-wing lawmakers and influencers. \n\nBut the aftermath has also sparked renewed debate about the dangerous temperature of political rhetoric on all sides.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, issued a plea for unity and restraint.\n\n'Now is not the time for more finger-pointing. We need to ask ourselves what kind of political culture we are fostering and whether we're doing enough to prevent tragedy.'\n\nBut Trump showed no interest in dialing down his rhetoric.\n\nRepublicans have long accused Soros of funding violent demonstrations and riots\n\nIn 2023, Soros, 95, handed control over the philanthropic organization to his youngest son Alex. During the 2024 election, Alex supported and raised money for Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris. The younger Soros is married to Hillary Clinton’s close aide Huma Abedin\n\nTrump shared his throughts on George Soros late last month \n\nTrump accused George Soros, the 95-year-old Hungarian-American philanthropist and founder of the Open Society Foundations, of playing an indirect role in Kirk's death\n\nPeople run after shots were fired during an appearance by Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University\n\nPeople attend a vigil in Provo, Utah after right-wing activist and commentator, Charlie Kirk, an ally of President Trump, was fatally shot \n\n'They [the left] don't like what's been happening,' he told NBC. 'We've been winning very big.'\n\nOn Wednesday, in a somber video recorded from the Oval Office, Trump promised to hold not just the killer accountable, but 'each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity… including the organizations that fund and support it.' \n\nTrump's remarks also reflect a broader strategy duing his 2024 campaign when he painted a picture of a nation under siege by liberal elites, shadowy donors, and violent activists.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation into Tyler Robinson’s alleged attack is continuing. \n\nAuthorities have not publicly confirmed a motive, but sources familiar with the probe say digital evidence, including online posts, gaming chat logs, and Discord messages are being reviewed for signs of ideological radicalization.\n\nSo far, no evidence has emerged linking Robinson to any group funded by Soros or affiliated with the Open Society Foundations.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump blames huge 'barrier' for stopping America from healing after Charlie Kirk's killing... and calls for George Soros to be thrown in jail\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump says there's one major reason America can't begin to heal after Charlie Kirk's killing and he's naming names.

They didn’t want to lose sight of the brand Swift has meticulously crafted over the past two decades. \n\nTheir engagement is touted as the ideal American relationship — but it’s not.\n\nSwift is something of a marketing genius, constantly altering her image and music to adapt to what is culturally relevant. This skill for promotion reached its peak when she began dating Kelce, a relationship that was exhaustingly promoted by everyone from TMZ to the NFL. \n\nPerfect illusion\n\n Seeing the couple take the next step in their relationship is, generally, a good thing. Many conservatives rushed to defend the couple against those who were weary after the endless, inescapable coverage of their romance. \n\nTheir defense was correct: It is good for young people to see examples of healthy relationships ending in marriage. Swift, one of the most profitable musicians of all time, has become a cultural icon who many young women look up to. Seeing her mature into marriage is an encouraging illustration for her loyal fanbase.\n\n But it's also a kind of illusion. \n\n Swift and Kelce, both 35 years old, are millionaires several times over. They each have achieved international stardom, forging lives, careers, and fame long before they began building a life together. Their combined net worth is a number that would make most Americans laugh as they fret over the price of eggs, gas, and college. \n\nTheir engagement is touted as the ideal American relationship — but it’s not. Their engagement came only after they first pursued individual personal success. They waited until their mid-30s to begin the marital process, instead expending their younger years focusing on worldly success above all else.\n\nThey will likely never have to worry about mortgages or grocery bills, their children will probably never have to save money for college, and their age of retirement will not be based on financial necessity. Their coming marriage is entirely different from the typical American marriage. \n\nBroken blueprint\n\nBut why is that a bad thing?\n\n In a recent poll of Gen Z Americans, 34% of men who voted for President Donald Trump said that having children is the most important part of their personal definition of success. Of that same group, 29% defined their personal success by being married. On the other hand, 51% women who voted for Kamala Harris said the most important definition of personal success is having a fulfilling job or career. Shockingly, only 6% of those women believe that having children or being married are definitions of success. Even women who voted for Trump ranked their financial independence and career success above familial obligations.\n\n It’s no secret that our culture is divided. But this polling reveals where the line is drawn and how deeply it's splitting society apart. Young women, who make up a large portion of Swift’s audience, are focused on fiscal obligations. Young conservative men, who are seeking family life above all else, are the outliers.\n\n Gen Z sees marriage as something that can only come after they have achieved financial independence and professional success. Wherein marriage was once the foundation of a healthy, thriving society, it's now the capstone on a fully established life. \n\nNeed more proof? Shortly after World War II, the median age for marriage was between 20 and 22. Today, that number is much closer to 30. Meanwhile, between 1900 and 2022, the U.S. marriage rate dropped by almost 60%. \n\nTwisted priorities\n\nPundits use a plethora of excuses for these changes. They blame financial insecurity, inflation rates, crime statistics, souring housing prices, and societal disasters, like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. But wars, famines, and periods of uncertainty have always been a part of the human experience.\n\n The real problem is rooted in how young people are now taught to view marriage. \n\nRELATED: Misogyny? Please: Our real problem is female entitlement\n\n David Eulitt/Getty Images\n\nZoomers are taught that personal identity and financial success are life's greatest achievements. Public schools relentlessly promote college education as the predominant adolescent accomplishment and cite university degrees as distinguished identities. A secure bank account and a high-yield stock portfolio are championed above building families. \n\n The feminist movement has clearly made this problem much more severe for young women. As seen in the polling, women are subjected to this financial enslavement regardless of political affiliation. And as feminism wormed its way into every aspect of our culture, it removed the value of being a loving wife and mother. From an early age, young girls are told that they have been freed from the \"oppression\" of familial duties. Instead, they are encouraged to build corporate, highly marketable identities. \n\n It’s good to see Swift and Kelce take on the responsibility of marriage. But the idea that marriage is the capstone of an economically viable partnership is a rejection of the natural order. \n\nFans who want to see Swift sign a prenup and refuse to change her name are the manifestation of a confused generation. They have been taught to think that it's better to isolate the individual for their valuable branding rather than find peace in the glory of marriage.","summary":"Less than 20 minutes after Taylor Swift posted photos celebrating her engagement to Travis Kelce to Instagram, the comments section filled with young fans warning her to get a prenup or to resist taking Travis’ last name. \n\n For the fanbase, this engagement was an exciting personal achievement, but one that was not meant to be overshadowed by her individual professional achievements.

The latest data just confirms what many already suspected—that the situation is worse than we thought. There’s something incredibly wrong at BLS, and for the sake of our economy, it’s time to fix it. From March 2024 to March 2025—a period mostly covering the final year of the Biden administration—BLS overestimated job numbers by 911,000. In other words, for that period, the nation added a stunning 911,000 fewer jobs than were originally reported, the largest such error on record. Let that sink in.\n\nBut it’s a lot worse than that. Over the last three years, the BLS has overcounted nearly 3 million jobs that didn’t exist. \n\nThese aren’t random errors when every revision skews in the same direction. \n\nEven more troubling, the BLS numbers released last week pointed in opposite directions. One survey showed 22,000 jobs created while the other suggested nearly 300,000. Which is it?By relying on faulty data and skewed reporting methods, BLS essentially invented millions of jobs that weren’t there. That flawed data was then used by the Biden administration and the legacy media to promote a job market that didn’t exist, instead of reporting the weak jobs’ recovery. \n\nFor an agency that describes itself as the “principal fact-finding agency for the federal government” in labor economics and statistics, that’s a shocking and intolerable error. \n\nThese kinds of miscounts have become the norm for an agency tasked with producing data that regularly steers public policy and drives private economic market swings. BLS doesn’t just publish job reports—it also tracks critical issues like inflation, running the Consumer Price Index that measures how far Americans’ money goes. This isn’t just an academic exercise. There are real policy implications that result from faulty numbers. Bad numbers lead to bad policy.\n\nPolicymakers throughout the government rely on BLS data to shape decisions on taxes, spending and monetary policies. Americans across the country rely on BLS data to judge how elected officials’ decisions affect their daily lives and the issues that matter to them, meaning flawed data could change the outcomes of our elections. Most of the period covered in this week’s report took place in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s tenure. For his last year in office, BLS job numbers were off by more than 50%. That overestimation came during a highly contentious election focused largely on the economy and centered on issues like jobs and inflation. Flawed BLS data painted a far better picture of Biden’s economy than reality—potentially pushing some voters to favor him (and later, Kamala Harris) over Donald Trump. \n\nTrump ended up winning the election regardless—and he’s now proven that his concerns about BLS are absolutely correct. Trump believes the numbers were “rigged” to make the economy to appear better than it was. Perhaps. Or maybe it was just sheer number counting incompetence. Either way, this cannot happen again. Trump ran on the promise to restore transparency, accountability and efficiency to the federal government. That’s a mission he needs to take to BLS to restore it as the gold standard of jobs and labor data. That means depoliticizing the agency, improving data collection and refining its communication with the American people. There is something seriously wrong at BLS. It can and must be fixed. Americans should back the president’s efforts to do so—including his nominee.","summary":"On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published a revision of its latest job numbers, a report that shows just how far off its estimates of...

But new Treasury Department guidelines on Trump’s tax law include digital content creators like Green on the break.\n\n“It’s really exciting news. It was a surprise,” said Green, who now hopes to get “a decent-sized tax break.”\n\nThe inclusion of online content creators, such as podcasters and social media influencers, promises to sweeten the allure of internet fame and marks the rising prominence of a new class of performers. It also helps the Trump administration cultivate a group that both political parties want to leverage to reach new audiences and energize voters.\n\nMore than a quarter of large US-based influencers — those with at least 100,000 followers — reported earning tips, according to a 2024 study by the Creative Class Group. The new tax law could restructure compensation in an emerging industry to draw even more heavily on gratuities.\n\n“I see this as a way of appearing friendly to a group of people the administration probably would like to have a relationship with,” said Jeffrey Harden, a political science professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nTrump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris embraced digital content creators during the 2024 presidential election. Both presidential candidates went on popular podcasts to broadcast their message, and each party’s convention granted media credentials to online influencers.\n\nSince the election, the Trump administration has paraded digital content creators through the White House briefing room with a dedicated “new media” seat. Democrats are also spending big to find online voices, who can appeal to voters.\n\nDaniel Abas, president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit representing digital content creators, said the tax break will “have a very strong economic impact for creators, particularly earlier in their careers.”\n\nThe vast majority of creators make less than the $150,000 income cap at which the tax break begins to phase out, according to the Creative Class Group study. Creators making up to $400,000 a year could claim some portion of the deduction.\n\nEven before the new tax law, tipping was taking on a more important role in online performers’ compensation. Digital content creators reported a 40% increase in tips in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a report by eMarketer Inc.\n\nAdult content creators operating online through platforms such as OnlyFans could be among the biggest beneficiaries since they are particularly reliant on tips, Abas said.\n\nGreen, who is active on several platforms in addition to OnlyFans, said tips are a big part of her income. She is already working with her accountant, Katherine Studley, to navigate the law, which Trump signed in July.\n\n“I’m a smart enough businesswoman to realize that taxes and finances are not my strong suit,” Green said in a phone interview while traveling in Greece.\n\nStudley, who specializes in tax preparation for OnlyFans creators, called the inclusion of digital creators a “huge win” for the adult segment of the market — and a surprising move coming out of a Republican administration aligned with social conservatives. She predicted Green is one of many clients who will benefit.\n\nThe administration’s guidelines don’t specifically identify adult digital content creators, and it’s possible that future formalized guidance from Treasury and the IRS could exclude them.\n\nBut tax policy analysts and lawyers said nothing in the guidance so far suggests adult performers would be excluded. Studley cited the inclusion of dancers on the list of job categories eligible for the tip income deduction.\n\n“‘Customarily tipped,’ which would mean a stripper not a Rockette,” Studley said.\n\nSwelling Cost\n\nExtending the tipped income tax break to digital content creators could raise regulatory questions and potentially swell the cost of the four-year tax cut beyond the $32 billion estimated when Congress passed the law, policy and legal experts said.\n\nThe tax break allows qualified taxpayers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips a year from their tax bills.\n\nDefining a tip in the digital creative space could be complicated, said Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.\n\nCurrently, a tip is a voluntary and optional payment a customer makes in addition to the cost of the goods or services provided. If creators provide any additional content or benefits to subscribers, that subscription cost would not fit the current definition of a tip. Some influencers may be tempted to categorize payments as tips that in reality don’t fit the bill or restructure their pay to take advantage of the tax break, Muresianu said.\n\n“I think that will be a thorny issue with implementation,” he said. “The tax structure could reshape compensation substantially in those areas that could lead to reshaping of behavior and also a higher fiscal cost.”\n\nMichael Chittenden, an attorney at Covington & Burling LLP, said the tax break could reshape how some influencers structure their compensation, but the effect would likely be tempered by the temporary nature of the tax cut, which expires after 2028, and the income cap.\n\n“You’re not going to have, in general, people with access to the most high-dollar, sophisticated tax planning available to them to do this. But I think ideas will percolate in the creator community,” he said. “People respond to tax incentives, as a general rule.”","summary":"An OnlyFans creator who goes by Mistress is not a waitress, or a rideshare driver — professions typically associated with tipping.

To his admirers aligned with his beliefs, he was a charismatic voice of reason; to his critics, he was too sharp, too abrasive, too impossible to ignore.Like other firebrands — or, if you prefer, rabble-rousers — before him, from the left or right of the political divide, he drew not only fierce debates but also the kind of rage that tempts bullets as argument enders.Kirk’s horrific murder last week, ironically while engaging Utah Valley University students in a debate on gun control and mass shootings, will endure as a few seconds of raw, unforgettable video — grimmer than any Hollywood imagining, and far more real.Just as the Zapruder film etched John F. Kennedy’s assassination into the collective memory of generations, the Charlie Kirk tragedy carries the same permanence — the surreal made real, the one-shot, one-kill handiwork of sniper assassins made public.In Dallas in 1963, Jackie Kennedy clambered from an open-top car that could not protect her president-husband as he waved to adoring Americans and presented himself in the crosshairs of Lee Harvey Oswald — or, if you believe the conspiracy theories, another shooter poised on the grassy knoll.In Utah, Charlie Kirk was silenced mid-sentence by a shooter, 200 yards away, perched on a rooftop, like Donald Trump’s own would-be assassin last year who botched the job and handed him a second trip to the White House over Kamala Harris despite his conviction in the New York hush money case.Some argue that Kennedy’s death was not simply the act of a lone gunman but of darker forces within the state, unsettled by the first and, to date, only Catholic president of the United States. A man they deemed unstable: a playboy reckless enough to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war in the Cuban missile crisis, and humiliating enough to stain American prestige with the Bay of Pigs fiasco.Where the glib-tongued Kennedy projected a sleek liberalism that promised vigor and modernity to a postwar America, Kirk stood as the embodiment of a resurgent conservatism rooted in faith and absolutes. He spoke unapologetically of religion as the nation’s moral spine, railed against abortion as an assault on life, and dismissed gender fluidity as cultural decay masquerading as progress.If Kennedy symbolized the hopeful ambiguities of King Arthur’s Camelot (Don Quijote, perhaps?), Kirk embodied the sharpened uncertainties of a fatally divided age — each man, in his moment, a lightning rod for the passions of his time.Then there was the killing of poor Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, riding in a light-rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina — just trying to build a new life after fleeing war. It could have been anyone: a nine-to-fiver heading home, a student bound for class, or someone simply lost in her phone when tragedy struck. The randomness of the stabbing makes it scary, the not knowing who might be next; the train car becoming terrifyingly ordinary until it isn’t.The accused: Decarlos Brown Jr., a 34-year-old homeless man with a long criminal history — 14 prior arrests for assault, robbery, and firearms possession — and documented schizophrenia. Despite his erratic behavior and repeated arrests, he was released on cashless bail in January, the court deeming a written promise sufficient. His own family said he should never have been freed, given his record and psychiatric diagnoses. Why was he out then?So, too, with Kirk’s alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson. Whether driven by ideology, delusion, or rage, he stands as a symptom of a society fraying at the seams — where institutions fail to catch the unstable before they unleash mayhem.Kirk, Kennedy and Iryna — all fallen to violence in different forms — mirror a society where power, paranoia, and neglect collide. Across mighty America, streets in Philadelphia, Portland and San Francisco, among many others, reel with the walking dead, veritable zombies of fentanyl, the opioid-ravaged, the lost and broken — a reminder that the country’s worst enemy may be its own unraveling within.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/09/13/silencing-charlie-kirk","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-05/0c599391-5284-4be2-a8af-4faffde00c6f/tribune_2024_01_3053d21a_74c3_4694_8dba_e90b69a6a7cb_COLUMNIST_JOHN_HENRY_DODSON_NEW__1_.avif?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 15:22:25","author":"John Henry Dodson","authors":["John Henry Dodson"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.102},{"id":360231490,"title":"The $12 million fortune Charlie Kirk leaves his wife and kids following shooting","text":"Right-wing influencer and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at a Utah Valley University event on Wednesday, September 10.

The former VP is now sharing what she really thinks about Biden, no sugarcoating involved. The 60-year-old candidly speaks about her thoughts in her upcoming book ‘107 Days.’\n\nThere was widespread speculation about Kamala and Joe Biden not being on the best of terms during the 2024 elections. The alleged tension was blamed on the fact that Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate rather abruptly.\n\nSeveral other reports also claimed that the former President tried to sabotage his former VP on multiple occasions. Kamala graciously dismissed all the rumors at the time of the elections. The Democrats managed to put up a harmonious front for the sake of optics during Harris’s election.\n\nKamala is now labeling Biden’s behavior as “reckless” in her new book. “‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” the former VCP writes in her memoir.\n\nShe goes on to question whether what was happening was “grace” or “recklessness” in reality. “I think it was recklessness,” she concludes. The excerpt published by The Atlantic has confirmed the longstanding speculation that critics have been pondering for a long time.\n\nShe also talks about the times she felt like she was sidelined by Biden. The former VP also notes how difficult it was for her to tell him not to run for president again, adding that she was in the “worst position” to do so.\n\nVERY interesting snippets from Kamala Harris’ book, 107 Days, released by The Atlantic, especially as it pertains to Joe Biden, his age and his team!!

In the book, the former VCP also notes how Biden not running for President a second time “should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nShe points out that the stakes were “too high” at that point. She adds that the particular decision should not have been left to an “individual’s ego” or even “ambition.”\n\n107 Days is my candid, personal account of the shortest presidential campaign in modern history.

This was proven true when she emerged more popular than him in the polls.","summary":"Kamala Harris gets candid about her struggle during the 2024 Presidential run","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/it-was-reckless-kamala-harris-drops-truth-bombs-about-joe-biden-and-her-historic-presidential-run-in-upcoming-memoir","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kamala-Harris-and-Joe-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 14:17:06","author":"The Atlantic,Vaishnavi Shetye","authors":["The Atlantic","Vaishnavi Shetye"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":360191294,"title":"Accused US sniper jailed in Charlie Kirk killing awaits formal charges in Utah","text":"The Utah trade school student jailed on suspicion of fatally shooting United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk faces formal charges next week, according to the governor, following an act of violence widely seen as a foreboding inflexion point in American politics.\n\nTyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night after relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Governor Spencer Cox said on Friday, opening a press conference with the words, “We got him.”\n\nThe arrest capped a 33-hour manhunt for the lone suspect in Wednesday’s killing, which US President Donald Trump has called a “heinous assassination”.\n\nKirk, co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and a staunch Trump ally, was gunned down by a single rifle shot fired from a rooftop during an outdoor event attended by 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.\n\nThe sniper made his getaway in the ensuing pandemonium, captured in graphic detail in video clips that circulated widely on the internet and television news reports.\n\n @dawn.today US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination. Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people. The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com \n\nA bolt-action rifle believed to be the murder weapon was found nearby, and police released images from surveillance cameras showing a “person of interest” wearing dark clothing and sunglasses.\n\nA break in the case came when a relative and a family friend alerted the local sheriff’s office that he had “confessed to them or implied that he had committed” the murder, Cox said.\n\n“I want to thank the family members of Tyler Robinson, who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement,” the governor said.\n\nSecurity camera footage and evidence gathered from the suspect’s profile on the chat and streaming platform Discord also helped investigators link him to the crime, Cox added.\n\n @dawn.today A young Utah man suspected of killing influential United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university in the city of Orem was in custody on Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox told reporters. “We got him,” Cox told reporters. The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend or “implied that he had committed the murder” to that friend and that person in turn had contacted the Washington County sheriff’s office on Thursday. A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox told reporters. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk’s murder, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel said at the press conference. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com \n\n‘Watershed in American history’\n\nThe killing has stirred outrage among Kirk’s supporters and condemnation of political violence from across the ideological spectrum.\n\n“It is an attack on all of us,” Governor Cox said, calling Kirk’s murder a “watershed in American history” and comparing it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nCox declined to discuss possible motives for the killing. But in describing inscriptions investigators found on ammunition recovered from the scene, he said one of the casings bore the message: “Here fascist! Catch!”\n\n“I think that speaks for itself,” he said in response to reporters’ questions.\n\nState records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. But a relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nMany Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence.\n\nDemocrats, decrying political violence more generally while calling for stronger gun laws, have countered that Trump himself routinely uses inflammatory rhetoric to demonise his political foes, judges and the mainstream media.\n\nRight, left or crazy?\n\nRachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the symbology found on the bullet casings suggests the shooter was part of the so-called Groyper movement, associated with far-right activist and commentator Nick Fuentes.\n\n“It’s an eclectic ideological movement marked by video game memes, anti-gay, Nick Fuentes white supremacy and irony,” she said.\n\n“It certainly leans right, but it is quite eclectic. In a way, the ideological beliefs of the shooter don’t matter,” she said.\n\n“What matters is how they’re taken by society. And if our society chooses to keep pointing fingers, whether the person turns out to be right, left or just unstable, then the violence will grow from the pointing of fingers, regardless of the act itself.”\n\nKleinfeld said most perpetrators of political violence were not clearly on one ideological side or another, but typically driven by “a hodgepodge of conspiracy beliefs and mental illness”.\n\n“So it wouldn’t be surprising at all if this person was a person of the far right, if this person was a person who held a variety of different beliefs and was sort of unclassifiable,” she added.\n\nKirk’s murder comes amid the most sustained period of US political violence in decades. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump himself has survived two attempts on his life, one that left him with a grazed ear during a campaign event in July 2024 and another two months later, foiled by federal agents.\n\nDemocrats have fallen victim, too. In April, an arsonist broke into Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.\n\nEarlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife.\n\nIn her first public comments since her spouse was slain, Erika Kirk vowed in a tearful but defiant video message on Friday evening that “the movement built by my husband will not die” but grow stronger.\n\nSpeaking from the studio of his radio-podcast show, she urged young people to join Turning Point, exalting her husband as a fallen political hero who “now and for all eternity will stand at his saviour’s side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr.”\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson?\n\nEighteen-year-old Robinson seemingly had a bright future ahead of him.\n\nThe Utah teen had scored in the top percentile on his college entrance exam and earned himself a four-year scholarship to Utah State University in Logan. His proud mother posted a video on Facebook in which her firstborn son, the oldest of three, read aloud the school’s letter offering him the grant.\n\n“He’s so excited to start his journey and it’s going to be so amazing for him!” she wrote in another post.\n\nRobinson, now 22, was arrested for aggravated murder and other charges over the shooting. He has no criminal history, according to state records reviewed by Reuters.\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand what allegedly led Robinson to that rooftop. Officials have not yet identified a precise motive for the shooting, though they offered some clues on Friday morning in announcing his arrest.\n\nHe was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records. He is listed as an “inactive” voter, which indicates that he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Robinson was living at his parents’ house in Washington, a farming and residential community of approximately 28,000 near Zion National Park in southwestern Utah.\n\nRobinson’s grey Dodge Challenger — the vehicle that authorities say he drove to the site of the shooting on Tuesday — was parked on Friday outside the two-story stucco home, in a relatively new housing development built among alfalfa fields.\n\nDozens of media members were gathered outside, along with half a dozen police cars parked along the street.

Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.\n\n“I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,” said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family. “Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.”\n\nRobinson was arrested late on Thursday without incident after a family friend called authorities and said Robinson had either confessed or implied that he was responsible for Kirk’s murder, officials said.\n\nRobinson graduated in 2021 from Pine View High School in St George, Utah. A video online of the commencement ceremony shows him carrying his diploma on stage as attendees cheer. He briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester that fall, the school confirmed to Reuters.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why he left, but Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system, confirmed that he is a third-year student in the school’s electrical apprenticeship programme.\n\nA Facebook post from his mother said Robinson had earned a score of 34 in high school on the ACT college entrance exam, which would put him in the top one per cent of test takers, according to the Princeton Review test preparation company.\n\nHe has two younger brothers, according to his parents’ Facebook posts. His mother listed her job online as a social worker at a non-profit healthcare company, while his father is the principal of a company that makes stone countertops, according to state records.\n\nHis mother’s Facebook posts over the years — most of which were deleted on Friday — mostly doted on her family: documenting trips to Alaska, the Caribbean and Disneyland; celebrating school plays, Halloween costumes and adopted pet rabbits; expressing pride as the three boys moved up in school.\n\nNone of the posts appeared overtly political.\n\nOther posts show Robinson and his brothers occasionally with guns, though that is not uncommon in a state with permissive firearms laws.","summary":"The Utah trade school student jailed on suspicion of fatally shooting United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk faces formal charges next week, according to the governor, following an act of violence widely seen as a foreboding inflexion point in American politics.\n\n\nTyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night after relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Governor Spencer Cox said on Friday, opening a press conference with the words, “We got him.”\n\n\nThe arrest capped a 33-hour manhunt for the lone suspect in Wednesday’s killing, which US President Donald Trump has called a “heinous assassination”.\n\n\nKirk, co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and a staunch Trump ally, was gunned down by a single rifle shot fired from a rooftop during an outdoor event attended by 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.\n\n\nThe sniper made his getaway in the ensuing pandemonium, captur","url":"https://www.dawn.com/news/1941720/accused-us-sniper-jailed-in-charlie-kirk-killing-awaits-formal-charges-in-utah","image":"https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131736276afd660.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 13:56:57","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":360186928,"title":"‘America, are we dating?’: Oasis finally wins over the US with triumphant tour","text":"After a crowd of nearly 90,000 finished singing Don’t Look Back in Anger, Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher had a question.\n\n“Are we dating?” he asked fans at the Rose Bowl, a stadium just outside Los Angeles, last Sunday night. “America, Oasis, the new hot couple, yeah?”\n\nIf the Gallagher brothers and the United States are going steady, it comes after three decades of a turbulent, on-again, off-again relationship. But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear: Oasis has finally taken over America.\n\nIn the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes about newly minted Anglophiles and joke T-shirts saying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline in Variety read: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”\n\nThat all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the band has sold 7 million albums here. But by comparison, Nirvana has sold more than 27 million in the US; even Gin Blossoms have sold 10 million, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.\n\n“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam later said of the US. It was a matter of contrast, as the New York Times pointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.\n\nBut in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.\n\nAnd these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.\n\nThe mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”\n\nBut LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, told Rolling Stone. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2016. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” she posted on Instagram.\n\nBut what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writer Lizzy Goodman points to the Gallagher brothers’ unfiltered, brash personas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs are timeless, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.\n\nThe US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”\n\nMaybe we finally have.","summary":"As the rock band played the final stop of their sold-out reunion tour near LA, it was clear: Liam and Noel Gallagher have become icons stateside\n\nAfter a crowd of nearly 90,000 finished singing Don’t Look Back in Anger, Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher had a question.\n\n“Are we dating?” he asked fans at the Rose Bowl, a stadium just outside Los Angeles, last Sunday night. “America, Oasis, the new hot couple, yeah?”\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/13/oasis-reunion-tour-los-angeles","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7231954cfea12f7c4a25f293eaf984b35200e67/983_0_4537_3630/master/4537.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 13:00:05","author":"Matthew Cantor","authors":["Matthew Cantor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.283},{"id":360184012,"title":"Georgia Democrat defies odds in Trump country, sparking hope for a political shift","text":"A lone Democrat competing for a state senate seat in a deeply Republican Atlanta suburb garnered nearly 40 per cent of votes in a special primary election in August, amplifying her party's hope that discontent with President Donald Trump could spur future wins.\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain if Debra Shigley's success truly foreshadows a Democratic wave. Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson highlighted that Democrats often perform well in low-turnout special elections, and parties typically fare better locally when not in control of the executive branch.\n\n“To read the tea leaves too much is a fool’s errand, because it’s such a low turnout,” Robinson said. \n\n“All it shows is that Democrats are more angry than Republicans are, and fear and anger are the most important motivators in voter turnout.”\n\nDemocrats have consistently exceeded expectations in special elections nationwide since Trump took office, with data revealing a significant swing in their favour. The Downballot, tracking 39contests, indicates Democrats have, on average, performed 15.7percentage points better than Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential candidate performance.\n\nWhile Republicans largely held their seats, Democrats successfully flipped a state senate seat in Pennsylvania in March, and two in Iowa during January and August.\n\nThis trend is now playing out in Georgia's District 21, where Democrat Shigley has advanced to a September 23 runoff against Republican Jason Dickerson, who is expected to be favoured. The seat became vacant after Trump appointed state Senator Brandon Beach, who secured over 70 per cent of the vote in 2024, to serve as US treasurer.\n\nGeorgia's special legislative elections lack party primaries, meaning Shigley competed directly against six Republican candidates. Investment company president Dickerson secured second place with 17.4 per cent of the vote.\n\nShigley is a lawyer and mother of five who started a business that delivers hair care services to women of color. She lives in the affluent suburb of Milton, and it is her second political race after she lost in 2024 to Republican state House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones.\n\nShigley promises to champion working families and push to lower the costs of housing, health care and groceries. But she says her campaign is also generating enthusiasm because it's letting Democrats organize and “make their voices heard” in a moment when “folks have felt a lot of despair.”\n\n“The chaos that’s happening right now is causing folks not just pain in their pocketbook but the anxiety when you look at the headlines and feel it’s just one chaotic measure everyday,” Shigley said at a recent campaign event in the district, which includes suburbs in Fulton and Cherokee counties about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of downtown Atlanta.\n\nConnor Roberts, who knocked on hundreds of doors for Shigley over the summer before starting his freshman year at college, said people may not be switching which party they vote for, but many who lean liberal are “really fired up” about Trump's actions and are voting in special elections when they usually wouldn't.\n\nDickerson, for his part, has made standard conservative appeals on the campaign trail, advocating for lower taxes, less bureaucracy, stricter immigration enforcement and election integrity. He is self-funding his race.\n\n“Dickerson is stepping up to serve our community rather than lobbyists or special interests,” his campaign website says.\n\nDickerson has said his experience as a businessman would help him work with other legislators to pass conservative policies. He also touts his track record helping people access housing and scholarships through his foundation.\n\nThe Democratic Party in Cherokee County, home to most of the district, has historically been weak, according to party chair Nate Rich.\n\nBut Rich said it has come alive for Shigley's campaign, which has drawn hundreds of volunteers and unprecedented enthusiasm from voters. In his view Democrats need a platform that promises to do more than just oppose Trump, and Shigley's emphasis on helping working families does just that.\n\n“The small army that we built, we're training them up,” Rich said.\n\nEven if Shigley loses, Democrats hope grassroots organizers will multiply statewide with races coming up in 2026 for governor, U.S senator and other offices.\n\n“The way we win the governor’s seat and the U.S. Senate seat is by organizing up and down the ballot, and it’s races like Debra’s that are going to lay the groundwork that is going to build the broad-based coalition that we need to win,” said former state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat and gubernatorial candidate who has campaigned for Shigley multiple times.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party chairman Josh McKoon said Republicans also need to mobilize their voters to avoid losses like the 2021 U.S. Senate runoff, but the state still leans conservative.\n\n“If Democrats are saying that because she got 39 per cent of the vote in a rock-bottom-turnout special election, that's good news, then they’re having to look really hard to find good news for Georgia Democrats,” McKoon said.\n\nHow voters feel about Trump a year from now will matter most for the 2026 elections, said Charles Bullock III, a political science professor at the University of Georgia.\n\nMcKoon noted that the GOP picked up ground in the 2024 presidential election and is confident voters still largely support Trump statewide. But Bullock said there are signs that people across party lines are displeased with the president's immigration crackdown and tariffs, which could continue to drive up prices.\n\n“What’s going to be at play in 2026 is does Trump deliver on his promises, and if he does, are they still popular?” Bullock said.\n\nOnly if Democrats flip more seats across the country, he said, will Shigley’s race “tell us something broader.”","summary":"Debra Shigley gained nearly 40 per cent of votes in a deeply Republican Atlanta suburb","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-election-debra-shigley-democrat-b2825923.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/13/12/07/AP25252674694444.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9NnlXvq9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-13 12:34:45","author":"Charlotte Kramon","authors":["Charlotte Kramon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.044},{"id":360197546,"title":"Suddenly, the Tune Changes","text":"Hello it’s the weekend. This is The Weekender ☕️\n\nIn the days before law enforcement officials announced that they had found a suspect for the murder of Charlie Kirk in 22-year old Utahn Tyler Robinson, prominent figures on the right were out for blood.\n\nWhat they wanted, they said, were full-scale reprisals against the left. Chris Rufo, the influential activist, called for a crackdown of federal law enforcement on the opposition. Steve Bannon described Kirk as a “casualty of war,” adding: “we are at war in this country.” Stephen Miller posted a mini-manifesto on X, echoing the Gettysburg Address to call for the “defeat of this wicked ideology.”\n\nThat was all before law enforcement had identified a suspect. Nothing was known about the shooter apart from the fact that the person had successfully shot and killed Charlie Kirk. No motive, no identity, no background, no clues as to potential ideology.\n\nThen, on Friday morning, FBI and Utah state law enforcement officials announced that they had arrested Robinson on suspicion of murder after his father turned him in. Robinson’s motive remains unclear, but early signs suggest its traceable more to the depths of online fever swamps than to an ideology that maps clearly on to either political party.\n\nThat’s prompted a turnaround, and some blame shifting. That’s partly fallen on FBI Director Kash Patel. Rufo wrote that he doubted whether Patel had “the operational expertise to investigate, infiltrate, and disrupt” violent movements. Bannon complained on-air that Patel had flown “thousands of miles” to praise “our great partnership in Utah.”\n\nBannon’s complaint had more to do with law enforcement not providing more details about Robinson and what had taken place; he kept calling the suspect “antifa.”\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) made the most obvious 180. On Wednesday afternoon, Mace was demanding the death penalty and calling the shooter — at that point unidentified — a transphobic slur. On Friday, after Robinson was announced as the suspect, Mace wrote that Kirk “would want us to pray for such an evil, and lost individual.”\n\nOne figure that maintained tonal consistency throughout it all was President Donald Trump. During a “Fox and Friends” appearance on Friday morning, he said that the focus needs to be to “beat the hell out of” what he described as “radical left lunatics.”\n\n“The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime,” he said. “The radicals on the left are the problem, and they’re vicious and they’re horrible and they’re politically savvy.”\n\n— Josh Kovensky\n\nHere’s what else TPM has on tap this weekend:\n\nAs red states incentivize their citizens to sue anyone who might have in some way helped with an abortion, California has passed a bill designed to protect doctors and pharmacies that prescribe the abortion pill from being targeted. More on the new law below.\n\nIn remarks to Fox News on Friday, Donald Trump made it pretty clear that he has no idea how funding the government works and knows nothing about a little thing called the Senate filibuster.\n\nThe Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on economic data and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ efforts to produce non-partisan data on unemployment in America continue.\n\nCalifornia Passes Unusual Law To Protect Abortion Patient, Provider Identities \n\nThe California legislature passed a new bill this week that would keep the names of the patient, provider and pharmacist off of abortion medication packaging, a move to protect those involved if the medication is traveling into an anti-abortion state.\n\nIn particular, anonymizing the provider and pharmacist will shield them from red state lawsuits for aiding and abetting the abortion. The new legislation will have nationwide implications, as many mailed abortion pills are prescribed by pharmacies based in California.\n\nIt’s a direct response to the atmosphere of anti-abortion surveillance in red states, where partners of women getting abortions have been deputized to turn them and their providers over to state authorities. In one such case out of Texas, a Collin County woman was admitted to the emergency room to address bleeding. A nurse allegedly told the man she was with that the woman had been pregnant, leading the man to search the house for evidence that she’d taken medication to end the pregnancy. Information on the packaging led to a state lawsuit against New York doctor Maggie Carpenter, who has thus far been protected from prosecution by New York’s shield law. \n\nThe new bill is expected to be signed by California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n— Kate Riga\n\nThe Trump Admin’s Attack on BLS Data Continues\n\nIt’s still unclear how exactly the Bureau of Labor Statistics will operate under the new Trump administration, but a barrage of federal economic data released this week made it a hot topic. \n\nThe Department of Labor is investigating how the BLS collects and reports “closely watched economic data,” CNN reported on Wednesday. Leadership at the Department of Labor initiated the investigation after data from a BLS annual revision showed U.S. employers added nearly 1 million fewer jobs between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported, prompting Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to criticize BLS data practices. The Friends of the BLS, an advocacy group made up of some former BLS commissioners, shot back in a statement, saying that underfunding by Congress and the administration, not skill or political bias, is the real problem at BLS.\n\nChavez-Deremer’s own Labor Department released data Thursday showing new weekly unemployment claims hit their highest level since Oct. 2021, while last Friday’s monthly BLS jobs report showed spiking Black unemployment and stagnant hiring.\n\nThis all comes against a backdrop of public anxiety that by politicizing the science of statistics, Trump risks compromising the U.S. economy. His pick to head BLS is Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, whom experts on both sides of the aisle have called unqualified. And a CNN report from late last week uncovered Antoni’s now-deleted X account where he espoused homophobic, misogynistic, and otherwise offensive views, including a sexually explicit post about former Vice President Kamala Harris, and one mocking late Sen. John McCain’s (R-AZ) death.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) could stand in the way of Antoni’s Senate confirmation. A member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee before which Antoni will have a hearing, Murkowski told Bloomberg she has “extreme reservations” about his candidacy and said some of his comments “are disqualifying.”\n\n— Layla A. Jones\n\nPresident Trump’s Filibuster Problem \n\nPresident Donald Trump dismissed congressional Democrats’ demands in exchange for their votes just weeks ahead of the deadline to fund the government for the next fiscal year. A failure to do so, of course, would result in a government shutdown.\n\n“Don’t even bother dealing with them,” President Trump said of congressional Democrats during a Friday Fox News interview. “We will get it through because the Republicans are sticking together for the first time in a long time.”\n\nThis, of course, is an unrealistic statement if Republicans actually want to keep the government open past Sept. 30. What the president may not be realizing — or possibly ignoring because he likely wants a shutdown he can try to blame on Democrats — is the reality of the filibuster.\n\nAs I have reported many times over the past few months, any legislation — whether it’s a CR or a series of appropriations bills — to fund the government is subject to the filibuster in the Senate. Meaning Senate Republicans will need several votes from their colleagues across the aisle to avert a shutdown.\n\nPresident Trump’s statement also brings to mind Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought’s recent remarks calling for the appropriations process to be “less bipartisan.” \n\n— Emine Yücel","summary":"Hello it&#8217;s the weekend.

He had help, or at least inspiration.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?\n\nKAMALA HARRIS (D), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do\n\nREP.

Now it’s not a leap to believe, as I’ve said many, many times on this show that those words, MAGA Republicans are fascists. They’re dangerous, repeatedly and endlessly uttered by prominent individuals can come across like an order, or at least like an exhortation to act.\n\nAnd Joe Biden, you know, he may be a doddering old fool, but his speech three years ago at Independence Hall helped light the fuse.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic, that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Afterward, the Angle tried to warn everyone.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: They sent poor Biden out to do his angry man routine. Democrats are the ones doing the real damage to America. Theirs is a relentless assault on our bedrock principles, on the idea of a politically blind justice system, on our national sovereignty, on parental rights and education, on our right to free speech. This period of intimidation, recriminations, threats, having the military stand behind Biden like that. This isn’t going to end unless we end it, unless they are defeated politically.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, Charlie understood this better than most, because he willingly, frequently, boldly put himself out there, and he went toe-to-toe with liberals, with Leftists, with anarchists, atheists. He gave them their chances to debate him, but they never won, and they still haven’t won.\n\nHe and I discussed possible fallout from the Left’s violent rhetoric many times on the show, including in this appearance.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: They’re trying to provoke, I think conservatives and Republicans to do something that we shouldn’t do and that’s uncharacteristic. We have to remember we have to stay peaceful, because their language the Democrats are using seems to almost try to get Republicans and get grassroots activists just to say, I’m mad as heck, and I’m not going to take it any longer. You’re starting to see the Democrats really act as if it’s the last gasp of a dying regime.\n\nWe have to remember that the more that we focus on these issues, the more we organize, the more they’re going to be threatened, and their language, I’m afraid is only get more outrageous.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It’s hard to even watch that now. In their laboratories of radicalism and hatred, Leftists mixed the lethal toxin that triggered this. Now, in the month before the Butler assassination attempt, Joe Biden planted the seed in the public consciousness that a threat needed to be neutralized. Call it a genuine threat, threat to our freedom, the greatest threat to democracy that was Donald Trump.\n\nNow, the obvious inference is, this is such a grave danger that it needs to be stopped by any means necessary. That’s how Thomas Crooks and Ryan Routh saw the situation. Of course, for years, Democrats, though, have refused to confront the lethal toxin they were brewing, and instead, it was just this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Violence doesn’t come from Democrats, just to be clear, it is MAGA. It’s specifically MAGA faction.\n\nSEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): The greatest terrorist acts we’ve seen since 9/11 are not from foreign terrorists. They’re from home grown Right-wing extremist groups.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Republican Party has enhanced and embraced and encouraged violence, especially under the extreme MAGA cult of Donald Trump.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: More dehumanizing language, more lies, zero self-reflection. Now, they might wonder why a new YouGov poll found that almost two and a half times more Democrats than Republicans then believe violence can sometimes be justified to achieve political goals. 14 percent of Democrats, only 6 percent of Republicans. That same YouGov survey found that Democrats by a two to one margin believe it’s always or usually acceptable to celebrate the death of someone they oppose, 11 percent to 6 percent.\n\nAnd of course, if you’re on social media, you’ve seen the most heinous, vile reactions to Charlie’s murder from Leftists from all walks of life, and some of the most disturbing reactions, I believe they came from professors and teachers. These people shouldn’t be within 100 yards of anyone wanting to learn.\n\nTake this character, Melvin Earl Villaver, Jr. After Charlie was assassinated, he posted, today is one of the most beautiful days ever. This was such a beautiful day. Then he reacted to another comment that Charlie was an old looking 31-year-old by saying that racism and white supremacy age you. This is just despicable. After a wave of complaints, the president of the university condemned the comments as deeply inappropriate, but the non-tenured ghoul from Clemson University has still not been fired.\n\nLook, these people, health care workers. This reveals more about them than it would ever reveal about anyone they were criticizing. And Senator Chris Murphy, who has just killed his presidential ambitions was egging this all on just a few days ago, before Charlie’s assassination.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Our only opportunity, our only chance to save our democracy is to fight fire with fire right now. We’re at a war right now to save this country, and so you have to be willing to do whatever is necessary in order to save the country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Fight fire with fire. Do whatever is necessary. Well, we know what that means. We know what it meant to the people who carry out violence. After Butler, he knew how sad, young, confused, angry men could take that. They took it as a go command. Today, Nancy Pelosi brushed off the idea that Democrats bore any responsibility for this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): People don’t have any intention of saying something that’s going to lead to something dangerous, but we cannot take responsibility for the minds that are out there and how they hear it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Last April, Charlie wrote on X about another poll that showed 48 percent of liberals said it would be at least somewhat justified to kill Elon Musk. Stunning. And 55 percent said the same about Donald Trump. None of us could believe it. Charlie decried this assassination culture, as he called it. That was infecting the Leftist mindset. The Left is being whipped into a violent frenzy, he wrote, any setback whether losing an election or losing a court case justifies a maximally violent response. This is the natural outgrowth of Left-wing protest culture, tolerating violence and mayhem for years on end, the cowardice of local prosecutors, school officials have turned the Left into a ticking time bomb.

In an interview with i-D, the artist, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, confirmed that one of the main reasons behind the absence of U.S. tour dates on his \"Debi Tirar Mas Fotos World Tour\" was so there was no risk his fans could be picked up by ICE agents. \"But there was the issue of — like, f---ing ICE could be outside [my concert].

He did encourage his U.S. fans to travel to the territory, or other countries, to catch his shows. \"People from the U.S. could come here to see the show,\" he said. \"Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world.\" The singer told i-D he has been fond of touring in America, calling his shows there \"successful.\" \"There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I’ve performed there many times.

He became a roadblock","text":"From the outside looking in, Gov. Gavin Newsom unofficially announced he was running for president on Thursday, March 30, 2023, the day he transferred $10 million from his state campaign funds to launch his PAC, Campaign for Democracy, along with a nationwide tour. Newsom unofficially suspended his campaign a month later, on April 25, the day President Biden announced he was seeking reelection. This timeline is important when it comes to talking about Kamala Harris. Newsom, like Harris, has been in the wings for years as part of the next generation of Democratic national leaders — and, like Harris, he was ready for the spotlight when Biden decided to stick around instead. The title of Harris’ upcoming book, “107 Days,” is in reference to the amount of time she had to launch a campaign, write policy, secure the nomination and fundraise after Biden bowed out in the summer of 2024. An excerpt from the memoir titled “The Constant Battle” was published this week in the Atlantic. In it, Harris suggests some of the foes she was battling during her time in the White House were Biden loyalists who did not want to see her succeed as vice president. It’s a rather scathing critique given the stakes of the 2024 election. The excerpt in its entirety is an uncomfortable glimpse into one of the most chaotic moments in American politics. Unsurprisingly there have already been reports of pushback from former Biden aides with one being quoted as saying: “No one wants to hear your pity party.” Which is why it is important to remember the timeline. In March 2020, while campaigning in Detroit, a 77-year-old Biden stood next to Harris, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and told his party that he viewed himself “as a bridge, not as anything else,” adding: “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.” Recognizing his age was a concern for voters back then, the message Biden sent that day suggested he was running for only one term. And then more than three years later, Biden changed his mind and his message. In doing so, he did not just go back on a campaign promise, he prevented the future of his party — like Newsom, Whitmer, Booker and Harris — from making a case for themselves in a normal primary. That’s why the book is called “107 Days.” That’s how much time he gave his would-be successor to win the presidency. Biden was a tremendous public servant whose leadership steered this nation out of a dark time. He also was conspicuously old when he ran for president and considered a short-timer. The first woman to be elected vice president didn’t decide to run for the top job at the last minute. But Biden went back on his word in 2023 and drained all the energy out of his party. It was only after the disastrous debate performance of June 2024 that the whispers inside the Beltway about his ability to win finally became screams. “Joe was already polling badly on the age issue, with roughly 75 percent of voters saying he was too old to be an effective president,” Harris writes. “Then he started taking on water for his perceived blank check to Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza.” That's not slander against Biden; that's the timeline. It may not be what some progressives want to read, but that does not mean the message or messenger is wrong. Legend has it James Carville, key strategist for Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential run, once went to a white board at the campaign’s headquarters in Arkansas and wrote three key messaging points for staffers. The catchiness and humor of one, “the economy, stupid,” elevated it above the other two: “change vs. more of the same” and “don’t forget health care.” Clinton’s victory would later cement “the economy, stupid” as one of the Democratic Party’s most enduring political quips — which is really too bad. Because the whole point of Carville going to the white board in the first place wasn’t to come up with a memorable zinger, it was to remind staffers to stay on the course. The Democrats’ 2024 chances were endangered the day Biden changed direction by running for reelection, not when he stepped aside and Harris stood in the gap. That’s not to suggest her campaign did everything right or Biden staying in for as long as he did was totally wrong. But there’s a lot to learn right now. Democrats are extremely unpopular. Perhaps instead of dismissing the account of the party’s most recent nominee, former Biden aides and other progressives should take in as much information as they possibly can and consider it constructive feedback. In 2020, Biden had one message. In 2023, it was the opposite. I’m sure there are things to blame Harris for. Losing the 2024 election isn’t one of them.

I Think I Know What’s Going On.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAn NBC News Decision Desk poll of Gen Z adults this week confirmed what many culture-watchers across the political spectrum have long argued: Young men and women are not aligned when it comes to life goals, especially when you compare right-wing men to left-wing women. But when you look closer, the poll actually suggests that it’s young conservatives, not liberals, for whom life expectations more dramatically diverge in terms of gender lines. Young liberal women and young liberal men share a broader worldview about what a successful life looks like. Young conservatives do not—especially when it comes to prioritizing marriage and children. Donald Trump’s working-class base already struggles with familial stability. The gaps between what conservative young men think offers them social status versus what conservative young women prioritize seems primed to only exacerbate existing frictions, and may mean that these young people don’t wind up with the families they say are so important.\n\nAccording to the poll, Gen Z adults—those ages 18 to 29—have pretty divergent views on what a successful life looks like. Among young men who voted for Donald Trump, “having children” tops the list of personal successes. Among young women who voted for Kamala Harris, having children is ranked 12 out of 13 possible choices, just above “fame and influence” and just below “being married.” Young women were more likely to select everything from career happiness to being spiritually grounded as more important for a successful life. And it is indeed telling that there is such a stark divide between the genders, one that grows starker still with political affiliation.\n\nWhat was most striking to me, though, wasn’t just the political gender divide, but how much more united liberal young people were than conservative ones. While a majority of Harris voters, male and female alike, agreed that having a fulfilling job or career was key to a successful life, there was no single marker of adulthood that a majority of young Trump voters said was important to life success. Conservative Gen Zers, it seems, don’t have a unified vision of what a successful life is—and the real outliers are conservative men.\n\nIt’s important to understand how this poll works before reading too much into the responses, because it’s a bit of a funny one. Respondents were asked what makes for a successful life, then given 13 possible answers, among which they could choose only three. And the question wasn’t about what any respondent wants in their own life; it was “Which of the following is important to your personal definition of success?” Many respondents, in other words, may very well want things like children and marriage, may think marriage or children are components of a good life, or may already have children or be married—they just don’t rank those things in their top three picks for defining what “success” looks like.\n\nWhile other polls have found that, among young adults without children, men are significantly more likely than women to want children in the future, only about 1 in 5 young women say they don’t want children at all; nearly half do, and close to a third just aren’t sure. Given that the average American mother has her first child in her late 20s, we can also assume that a great many Gen Z women already have kids, they just may not equate motherhood with success. And it’s not like young men want a giant brood and women want to stay childless: American adults under 40 say they plan to have about two children, a number that is the same for women and men alike.\n\nAll of this makes the fact that more conservative men chose “having children” as personally definitional to success much more telling. For women regardless of politics, and for liberal men, it seems that children and marriage may be components of a good life, but they aren’t considered some sort of accomplishment. For conservative men, they are. Perhaps the big divide here isn’t about what one wants one’s family to look like, but in how one conceives of parenthood in the first place. For Trump-voting men, having kids may be a kind of flex, a status symbol, a feather in their cap—and, conveniently, something for which women actually take on the lion’s share of the labor.\n\nConservative women are far less likely than conservative men to define personal success according to childbearing, although they are much more likely to do so than liberal women or men. Twenty-six percent of Trump-voting women listed “having children” as one of their three markers of success; only 6 percent of Harris-voting women and 9 percent of Harris-voting men said the same. But with 34 percent of Trump-voting young men saying children are definitional to success, the gap between right-wing women and right-wing men is particularly wide. And between right-wing men and left-wing women, it’s enormous.\n\nThis does not bode well for conservative parental happiness, and bodes really poorly for any young liberal women who make the mistake of marrying Trump-voting men. Among the ranks of Gen Z Republicans, men already outnumber women by nearly 2 to 1, the widest partisan gap of any age cohort. The conservative Gen Z men who want marriage and children already have a smaller pool of young women to date, given the dearth of young right-wing women and the fact that many liberal women understandably don’t want to wind up with men who don’t believe they should have the right to their own bodies and may not support their careers or personal independence. And even conservative women may not want to pair up with men who pollsters have found to be startlingly misogynist and who don’t seem particularly inclined to course-correct on the very sexist ideas that put so many young women off. A 2024 YouGov poll found that just one-third of Gen Z men agreed that “Things would be better if women held more powerful positions in society and men did more around the house.” A previous NBC poll found that while 58 percent of Gen Z women strongly disagreed that women taking on traditional roles would make America a stronger nation, just a third of Gen Z men said the same.\n\nYoung liberals are far less divided, with men and women alike agreeing that things like career meaning and financial well-being are important for success. A majority of both male and female Harris voters selected having a fulfilling job or career as one of their three choices for defining success. Forty-six percent of female Harris voters and 42 percent of male ones selected “having money to do things you want.” Well over a third of male and female Harris voters agreed that “using talents and resources to help others” is part of a successful life; 39 percent of female Harris voters also listed “having emotional stability.”\n\nThe top five most-selected answers were the same among male and female Harris voters; the only difference was that “emotional stability” ranked above “using talents and resources to help others” for Harris-voting women, while the reverse was true for Harris-voting men. But otherwise, young liberals are surprisingly aligned in how they define success: It means a meaningful career, financial stability, doing good in the world, and emotional maturity.\n\nNot so among young conservatives. While 34 percent of Trump-voting young men picked having children as definitional for success, no other answer was selected by more than a third of them. Among Trump-voting young women, 40 percent selected “financial independence” as important to their definition of success, but the next most popular choice—having a fulfilling job or career—was chosen by just 32 percent. Conservatives of both sexes were simply less unified in a personal definition of success. For conservative men, success requires children, marriage, financial independence, and a meaningful career. For conservative women, career and financial independence made the top five, but they put home ownership and spiritual grounding above marriage and children.\n\nIn other words, conservative men prioritize procreation, while conservative women prioritize professional and financial stability—and that professional and financial stability may very well be compromised if they procreate with conservative men.\n\nRight now, young conservative men are being fed a steady stream of misogyny online, whether by virulent woman-haters like influencer and accused rapist Andrew Tate or by “tradwife” social media accounts featuring hot young women raising large broods, content that is ostensibly targeted at women but actually seems to be mostly consumed by men who fetishize female submission. The Tates and the Trads are not necessarily the same men, with the Tates emphasizing male promiscuity and the Trads encouraging a more traditional kind of married patriarchy. Both, though, feed into a fantasy of male entitlement with few attendant obligations. Neither offers a model of masculinity that might appeal to the young women who say they want meaningful work and financial independence, even as they might also want marriage and children.\n\nThis is a problem for the young women, conservative and liberal alike, who say they want meaningful jobs and financial independence. An unsupportive partner can sabotage a woman’s career, and a man who believes that it’s a woman’s job to take care of the children and the household is a man who is not going to do his fair share of those tasks. These at-home demands are the primary reason women drop out of the workforce and become financially dependent on men. And when mothers leave the workforce to stay home full time, they wind up hugely vulnerable: There are not just lost wages that can extend into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but a permanent loss of lifetime earnings and wage growth, less saved for retirement, lower Social Security payments, a more difficult time finding a job in ones 40s or 50s after years out of the workforce, and susceptibility to financial abuse and control, not to mention the lower rates of health and happiness seen in stay-at-home moms. There are few decisions more important than who you have a child with, and ambitious women who have children with unhelpful men are primed for some serious misery.\n\nConservative Republicans have long believed that women are simply better suited to child-rearing than men, and it doesn’t seem like young conservative men are much more progressive on this than their fathers, even while young women have shifted left. Young conservatives, then, are entering the romantic marketplace with wildly different expectations about their own roles and obligations, and what one owes a partner and partnership. And it seems clear that, as a result, many men won’t get what they want and will end up resentful over it, while women may simply go their own way. Marriage and childbearing have largely been decoupled among the more-conservative working class, a demographic that Trump dominates. Most mothers without a college degree are not married when they have children; by contrast, huge majorities of mothers with college degrees are married.\n\nNot that these young pro-Trump men may notice or care: Fewer than 1 in 10 said “having emotional stability” was important to a successful life, compared to nearly 40 percent of women who voted for Harris. (One has to wonder if these Trumpian men would find more procreative success if they prioritized emotional stability, something any sane woman certainly requires in a partner.)\n\nThat these gendered and politicized expectation gaps around parenthood morph into gendered and politicized gaps in the act of parenting itself is borne out in other data. College-educated fathers—a group that trends more liberal than their non-college counterparts—spend almost twice as much time with their children than those without a college degree. They spend an average of 3.7 hours per week on necessary caregiving, like changing diapers; dads without a college degree do just 1.9 hours per week of that kind of nonnegotiable labor. College-educated fathers are more likely to be married. While just 10 percent of dads with a college degree live apart from their children, 27 percent of dads without a degree do. More than half of these dads who don’t live with their kids don’t see them regularly—although, again, even among the dads who don’t share a home with their kids, college-educated ones are more involved and see their children more often.\n\nNone of this seems like a coincidence. There is much that pro-marriage and natalist conservatives can learn from how Zoomers define success—but the lesson is decidedly not that young women don’t care about children or family. It’s that conservative men are getting in the way of their own familial aspirations by seeing children as an achievement and then not actually doing the work to care for them—and not always doing the work to support their female partners’ ambitions. The tough truth for pro-family conservatives is that if they want stronger families, they need more young men to reject Trumpian misogyny, embrace the tenets of modern egalitarian feminism, and see having children not as an achievement that ends at ejaculation but as a lifelong relationship in which they have as much stake—and as much obligation—as women.","summary":"The lesson is decidedly not that young women don’t care about children or family.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/gen-z-poll-gender-divide-conservatives-liberals-marriage-family.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/a8e15853-06f3-4ea0-a897-737e99b0ffbe.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 09:50:00","author":"Jill Filipovic","authors":["Jill Filipovic"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.217},{"id":360146040,"title":"Who Showed Up to Lead in a Dark, Tense Week?","text":"Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nWelcome to this week’s edition of the Surge. Here we are again! Wish we weren’t.\n\nThis was an awful week. The jokes begin in the third entry, if you want to skip ahead, and they cover the very funny subject matter of the president’s relationship with a deceased sex criminal. Then the gags really get going when we talk about the tensest state of affairs between Russia and NATO since the Cold War. Can’t get enough? How about a conflict of interest at the Federal Reserve? Finally, everyone’s comfort food: relitigating Democrats’ calamitous performance in the 2024 election.\n\nThank you all for reading.\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\nA national horror.\n\nThe assassination of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus Wednesday was a national shock to the system we hope the nation doesn’t experience again. Kirk was the father of two very young children. Even with all the snuff footage that social media algorithms were autoplaying for us Wednesday afternoon, it was the photos of his family that we found most difficult to look at.\n\nWe’re not going to attempt an obituary of Kirk here. We didn’t know him, and it’s not our place. But the country feels much more dangerously heated than it did on Wednesday morning, and it wasn’t exactly Disneyland then. In that vein, there are two people we’d call attention to as proper leaders during a week when leadership was needed. The first is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who knows that a lot of disaffected young people look up to him, and released a note-perfect video against creeping political violence on Thursday. It’s simple and powerful, and it comes from someone who understands how much worse things can get. The second is Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a sober-minded leader long concerned about growing division, who recognizes that the last thing anyone needs right now is the temperature being dialed up any further. Thank God this was under his jurisdiction. And rest in peace, Charlie Kirk.\n\nSenate Democrats\n\nWhat’s the endgame?\n\nThe next government funding deadline hits on Sept. 30, and there’s a lot of pressure from the Democratic base for legislators to put up more of a fight than they did during the last round of this in March. Their problem in the spring was largely a failure to manage expectations. Democrats—who have some say in this in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to break a filibuster—promised and promised that they wouldn’t just roll over but were never in a position to secure anything meaningful. So the abrupt rolling-over didn’t land well.\n\nSix months later, we once again see a lot of talk from Democrats, but not an improved position. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the respective Democratic leaders in the Senate and House, are demanding health care concessions—like an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies—in exchange for their votes. It’s a worthy goal and an issue on which there’s split opinion in the GOP. But it’s not the sort of big policy you typically see attached to a seven-week continuing resolution that punts the bigger funding fight into November. And it’s also not what those members of the base urging Democrats to take a stand against Donald Trump’s abuses of power are talking about.\n\n(Ugh, three paragraphs!) So let’s say Republicans don’t budge, which they’re not inclined to. Let’s say House Republicans, then, are able to pass a funding extension into November without Democratic votes. What do Senate Democrats do in that moment? A small number of them could join Republicans to keep the government open. Or Democrats could all link arms and shut down the government for a few days of protest before reopening it. Or Democrats could all link arms and shut down the government indefinitely, the endgame for which is Republicans gutting the legislative filibuster. Choose wisely.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nSignature? Me? Nuh-uh.\n\nWay back when—in the early part of this week, when life was still a barrel of laughs—the House Oversight Committee released pages of Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th “birthday book” that it had received from the Epstein estate. Therein, amidst a bunch of other pervy stuff, lay the Trump page that the Wall Street Journal first reported on months ago—which the president, who vehemently denied everything in the article, sued the publication for. It appears exactly as the WSJ reported it: “It contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair.”\n\nWe’re so old we remember when this used to be called “getting caught red-handed” and the comms team would have to scramble to explain why they had denied it in the first place. Instead, the comms team continued to deny that Trump ever wrote this and argued that the signature looked nothing like his. (It did! Very much! Exactly like it!) Congressional Republicans either used that line or said they hadn’t seen the image. This might be the most clear-cut denial of reality we’ve seen in at least … eh, a couple of weeks? Anyway, the Epstein story isn’t going away.\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nAn update from the front (Poland??).\n\nOh, here’s some more great news: NATO had to shoot down enemy targets over allied airspace for the first time ever. Enough, enough, we’re done! Who’s a newsletter got to bribe to get citizenship in Tahiti? Do you have to “join France” first?\n\nAnyway. This entry is about war in Europe. Russia sent more than a dozen drones from Belarus into Polish airspace, some quite deep into Poland, prompting NATO to scramble jets and take them down. Russia and Belarus claimed that it was all a big misunderstanding—these drones are supposed to do war in Ukraine, but sometimes they get wonky and have a mind of their own, you know how it is—but of course it wasn’t. It was a provocation to test NATO’s response and organization as Vladimir Putin eyes Polish supply lines into Ukraine. Perhaps the most important thing to monitor, too, would be the reaction of the traditional anchor of NATO—the U.S. president—and whether an incursion into an allied member state actually bothers him. Here was the official reaction of that U.S. president on Wednesday morning: “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!” Yeah, what’s that all about? And one more thing, Vladimir: Why can’t you just order a regular cup of coffee anywhere these days?\n\nMaybe time for a new FBI director?\n\nWe’re just saying that a major objection to Patel’s nomination as FBI director, along with his background as an explicit MAGA partisan with revenge on the mind, was whether he was the most qualified of candidates to lead a sprawling national law enforcement agency. So let’s look at his record this week. At 6:21 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Patel posted that “the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.” At 7:59, he posted that that subject “has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.” These pronouncements conflicted with what Utah state officials were saying at the very same time. It was embarrassing, and had the look of someone under a lot of pressure getting ahead of himself during a very fluid situation.\n\n“This is what happens when you let good cops be cops,” Patel, having finally gotten out of the good cops’ way, said Friday morning following the suspect’s apprehension. (He added other flourishes, too, such as saying of Kirk, “I’ll see you in Valhalla.” We need a complete and total shutdown of the internet.) So, what do you all think? New FBI director time? Many people are saying.\n\nStephen Miran\n\nJust a thought ahead of another high-stakes confirmation …\n\nLast week, some Republican senators showed regret over confirming RFK Jr. This week, Kash Patel live-tweeted his criminal investigation. Next week, there’s another nominee coming to the Senate floor who’s expected to sail through despite a clear and glaring conflict of interest.\n\nStephen Miran is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Trump has nominated him to fill a temporary vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors until the end of January. (That vacancy stems from ex-Governor Adriana Kugler’s abrupt and still unexplained resignation in August.) But instead of resigning his White House job, Miran is instead taking an unpaid leave of absence from it. In other words, he might feel compelled to heed the president’s demands on interest rates if he wants to keep his White House job—and golly, this might be something that President Trump has thought about, too. Nevertheless, this all seemed copacetic to GOP members of the Senate Banking Committee, who advanced his nomination this week. He should be confirmed in time for the Fed’s interest-rate meeting next week. This might not change much practically in the short term; the Fed is already poised to cut rates at this meeting. But it’s another crack in the Fed’s independence, something GOP senators proclaim to be upset about—though gosh, not a vote-against-y of level upset. Maybe next time!\n\nKamala Harris\n\nThe Surge Book Club has reconvened.\n\nFinally, the end; it’s ciggy-and-book time. The first excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ upcoming book, 107 Days, was published in the Atlantic this week, and there were actually a few interesting lines that weren’t lawyered and calculated into emptiness. For example, she writes that her “mantra” about whether Biden should run again—“It’s Joe and Jill’s decision”—was “recklessness” in retrospect. “This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition.” She also takes her swipes at Biden’s aides who felt that her success as Vice President would come at Biden’s expense.\n\nThe excerpt prompted typically anonymous swipes in return from “former Biden White House officials” about how Harris “was simply not good at the job,” “had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration’s key work streams,” and was a lousy presidential candidate in both 2019 and 2024. Now, let’s suppose all that’s true, that she was both a terrible politician and a terrible vice president. Who put her on the 2020 presidential ticket? Who immediately endorsed Harris for the 2024 nomination after leaving the race? Would following this argument to its logical conclusion land Biden’s team in a flattering light?","summary":"After a national shock to the system, two people stepped up.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shooting-donald-trump-democrats-government-shutdown-kash-patel.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/4c29a4c8-9182-4979-b4d9-adef6d4ae8b7.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1041%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 09:45:00","author":"Jim Newell","authors":["Jim Newell"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":360287924,"title":"Kamala Harris Stayed Silent on Joe Biden Too Long – And That Pause May Have Cost Her the Presidency","text":"In the 2024 election season, Kamala Harris pulled off a tricky balancing act. When Joe Biden stepped down and backed her as his successor, whispers started about the tension between their teams. Sources close to Biden suggested his advisors nudged him out, while Harris’s camp focused on showing she could lead without provoking Biden’s allies. But it didn’t go as planned when Kamala Harris tried to dodge questions about the rumored feud during a live interview on The View. \n\nThe moment arrived in October 2024. A reporter tossed then-Vice President Kamala Harris a straightforward question: How would her own presidency differ from Joe Biden’s if she’d been in charge from the start? Instead of a crisp answer, Harris paused.\n\nAccording to Josh Dawsey’s book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, she fumbled for words, which frustrated campaign staff. One insider, Stephanie Cutter, even tried to arrange a do-over. Sources say she quietly asked Whoopi Goldberg and Ana Navarro to repeat the question after a commercial break.\n\nIt never happened. Harris knew immediately she’d missed her shot.\n\nCritics now say that the TV interview was a key moment in her campaign. She could have escaped Biden’s shadow but seemed locked to him instead. When asked about the feud rumors, her vague reply only made things worse. People saw it as proof she couldn’t break free.\n\nRELATED: “His blood is in your hands” – Charlie Kirk Supporters Blast Biden for Fake Sympathy\n\nWhile Harris paused while appearing on The View, she eventually put space between herself and Biden’s divisive comments. One moment that drew attention was Biden calling Donald Trump supporters “garbage,” a remark he walked back later. But by then, the words had already hit hard. Many heard them as dismissive, even elitist. And Trump, never one to miss an opening, seized it!\n\nIn response to Joe Biden calling Trump supporters Garbage, Donald Trump pulls up in a Garbage Truck for a press conference. 🤣 pic.twitter.com/UDri3NODlv\n— Jacob Harvey (@HarveyJacob77) October 30, 2024\n\nSensing an opening last October, Harris took her chance during an ABC News interview. She made her disagreement known, though not harshly. But she said she always made it clear, and stressed she’d never fault voters for their choices. Her job, she insisted, was to serve every American. It was a smooth shift in tone: practiced, steady, and showing she understood where people were coming from.\n\nBut in politics, timing is everything. By the time Kamala Harris tried to distance herself from Joe Biden, the story had already taken hold. For months, she’d avoided weighing in on the tensions between them. Then, when she finally spoke up, many voters had already moved on. It felt more like a team suddenly changed direction because things weren’t working.\n\nKamala Harris may have broken barriers, but the presidency wasn’t in the cards. Her awkward moment on The View and the delayed break with Joe Biden showed how staying quiet too long can speak louder than any speech.\n\n🚨 Harris Knew Biden Should Drop Out But Had to Appear Supportive!\n2024 was a summer of gaslighting for the Biden White House.

I am painfully aware I should not be the one writing about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. \n\nI have criticized him publicly for making points with which I disagreed. I clearly wasn’t paying enough attention to his mission because I didn’t call or write to him and didn’t give him a chance to discuss it. \n\nYet, he always made it clear that his goal was to hear both sides of an argument. I didn’t give him the opportunity to hear my side, and today, I can’t apologize. \n\nI regret my decision not to approach Kirk with my concerns directly. Politics is heated. It’s been called a blood sport with no room for error, but the truth is, he and I were on the same team. Sometimes, team members disagree on the play. There were certainly areas where we were never going to come together. \n\nOPINION: CHARLIE KIRK’S HONORABLE LEGACY OF CIVIL DISCOURSE\n\nStill, I saw great things blooming from his work, and I didn’t highlight them.\n\nCharlie was one of the greatest defenders of life we will see in our lifetime. He was a staunch advocate of the unborn. We watched debate after debate as he methodically prodded some of the most rabid pro-abortion activists into finally recognizing that an unborn baby is a person deserving of a chance at life. \n\nKirk’s debates were meant to inspire thought, not judgment. Apparently, it was too effective for the radical Left. They hate it when independent people think.\n\nPolitics was in his blood from a very young age, but let me be clear, politics alone was not the reason the Left hated him. His common-sense political viewpoints weren’t dangerous to them — quite the opposite, actually. \n\nIf Kirk said something they found offensive, that was a tool to rally their troops. The radical Left news organizations centered hours of programming on 30-second clips of Charlie’s opinions. And, politicians joyfully used him to provoke hatred, the great motivator on the left.\n\nNo, it was not politics that made Kirk dangerous to the Left. It was something far more dangerous and undefeated. It was Christ. \n\nKirk regularly preached a message of the love and joy we find in Christ our Savior. He asked people to join him as a happy warrior for the cause. Love is what they feared. \n\nBoth love and hate have the ability to control human behavior. The Left chooses hate. They need their followers to hate someone because hate creates victimhood and a thirst for revenge. And every victim needs a savior. \n\nHe broke the cycle of victimhood. He showed young Americans not just the beauty of life, but eternal life. There is no “messaging” on the Left that can compete with Christ.\n\nI am sure they assumed Kirk’s popularity would fizzle out, and his movement would quietly end. In the purely political world, we see things in cycles — two-year, four-year, six-year, even eight-year cycles — but he wasn’t controlled by the political cycle like we are. He didn’t shy away from truth and light just because it wasn’t the winning message that cycle. He stood on principle.\n\nGod, family, life, and freedom were always the message. The Left couldn’t tolerate it, and in 2020, they thought they beat it. They got Joe Biden into the White House and won the youth vote. They falsely believed that had ended Kirk’s career. \n\nBut his resolve grew deeper. The mission of Turning Point USA was never about a political cycle or a candidate. It was about preserving the free America we love. Kirk mixed his political platform with the Gospel. The Gospel doesn’t mix well with the culture war launched by the Left. In response, they ramped up their hatred for him.\n\nKirk was regularly telling young men and women to go to church, get married, have babies, and follow Christ. That’s not always a popular message in a political cycle, but Charlie played the long game. \n\nThe day before Kirk was shot, the New York Post published a new poll that found “young men who voted for Donald Trump prioritize having children above all else — but being a parent is of so little importance to young women who voted for Kamala Harris, it charted second to last out of 13 options.” \n\nA revival was happening in this country. The men wanted to lead their families again. The long game was working. The innate desire to mate, have children, and love each other was being affirmed and embraced. Kirk’s message of love had permeated the next generation of men.\n\nTRUMP AND VANCE LEAD MOURNING AFTER CHARLIE KIRK KILLED IN UTAH\n\nVictimhood was out, valor was in, and the Left was permanently losing ground. \n\nYou could cut the political tension with a knife. It took the Left decades to break the nuclear American family. Kirk was on a mission to rebuild it, and he had half the team ready to rock. The Left became desperate to stop him. \n\nEven the radicals know God-centered marriages bear good fruit. Christ-centered relationships take care of communities. The Gospel is the most dangerous message in the world because they can’t fight or silence God.\n\nWe relearned a lesson this week. Good doesn’t win every battle because Satan is real. But he will not win the war. This is not a passive fight. The fight for good, the fight for love, and the fight for God is daily. It’s minute by minute, especially in a world where Satan has disguised hate as love. \n\nWe will never be silenced.\n\nKirk was not carrying a weapon the day he was killed. He was carrying a microphone. We live in a world where the Left calls speech “violence” to encourage people to respond to speech with violence. It’s a dangerous rationalization that will undoubtedly end in more bloodshed.\n\nSpeech in America is free, but protecting it comes at a price. Now, we will take up the microphone and carry on.\n\nFor Kirk and the country, we continue the mission to spread the Good News. He encouraged the men to lead their families once more. We will stand by their sides, and we will show American women the overwhelming joy family brings. We will break the lies of the Left and their hold on the next generation of mothers.\n\nKirk was recently interviewed and asked how he would want to be remembered. He responded, “I want to be remembered for courage for my faith. That would be the most important thing. The most important thing is my faith in my life.”\n\nEDITORIAL: WHAT THE MURDER OF CHARLIE KIRK MEANS\n\nThe pain of loss is real for those left behind in the world. We lost a freedom fighter. We lost a voice for our movement, and we lost a man of great faith. Our hearts break most for Kirk’s young wife and family, whose world was shattered by pure evil. This young family is now separated by the divide between this life and the next. For that, we are devastated.\n\nWe know Kirk is celebrating his homecoming with our Lord and Savior. We rejoice in the knowledge that he is in paradise. His wife and children will see him again. Godspeed, Charlie. We’ll take it from here.\n\nTudor Dixon is a former Republican gubernatorial nominee, executive in Michigan’s steel industry, breast cancer survivor, and working mother of four girls.

The Conservative commentator and right-wing activist was assassinated on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University for his American Comeback Tour. Now Erika, 36, has paid tribute to her late husband with an emotional statement to the nation.\n\nErika appeared in a YouTube livestream on Friday night to remember her \"perfect\" husband and began by thanking law enforcement and first responders who were at the scene, before tearfully thanking President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha. Speaking of her late husband, she said: \"Two days ago, my husband Charlie went home to see the face of his savior and his God. Charlie always said that when he was gone, he wanted to be remembered for his courage and for his faith.\"\n\nFondly remembering her husband, Erika said: \"Charlie loved life. He loved his life, he loved America, he loved nature, which always helped him closer to God. He loved the Chicago Cubs, and my goodness did he love the Oregon Ducks. Most of all, Charlie loved his children, and he loved me with all of his heart, and I knew that every day.\n\n\"He made sure I knew that every day,\" she continued. \"Every day, he would ask me, 'How can I serve you better? How can I be a better husband? How can I be a better father?' … He was such a good man. He still is such a good man. He was the perfect father. He was the perfect husband.\"\n\nAddressing her late husband directly, Erika said: \"Charlie baby, Charlie, I promise I will never let your legacy die, baby, I won't. Oh, Charlie, I love you. I love you, baby. Rest in the arms of our lord as he blankets you with the words I know your heart always strives to hear. Well done, my good and faithful servant.\"\n\nErika recalled how she broke the news of her husband's death to their three-year-old daughter. She said: \"When I got home last night, Gigi, our daughter, just ran into my arms and I talked to her and she said, 'Mommy, I miss you' and I said I miss you too, baby and she goes, 'Where's daddy?' How do you tell a three-year-old? She's three. And I said, 'Daddy loves you so much, baby, he's on a work trip with Jesus so he can afford your blueberry budget.'\"\n\nErike vowed, \"No one will ever forget my husband's name, and I will make sure of it. My husband’s mission will never end,\" before closing her speech by promising to \"never let [his] legacy die.\" She added: \"I can't wait to see you again, one day.\"\n\nCharlie — who was a close ally of Donald Trump — leaves behind Erika and their two children, a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. They kept their children's names and faces off social media to protect their privacy. \"We have a girl and a boy, and it's no one's business what their names are or their faces,\" he said in a video from June.\n\nCharlie and Erika got married in 2021, three years after they met at a Turning Point USA event. Charlie established the organization which was credited by the president for helping to swing young voters towards the Republican party. \n\nErika's tribute comes after politicians and celebrities from both sides of the political spectrum, sent condolences over his death. Barack Obama took to X to write: We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy. Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children.\n\nKamala Harris mirrored the statement: \"I am deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah. Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family,\" the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, wrote on X. \"Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance called Kirk \"a genuinely good guy and a young father\" and urged prayers in after the horrific shooting.\n\nMaria Shriver wrote: \"This is a violent act of hate that we all must denounce, all of us, regardless of party.

It is one of the last known images of Epstein, whose death was ruled to be suicide.\n\nYears earlier, Serrano took a portrait photo of Donald Trump in 2004 – the same year the property tycoon began starring on The Apprentice TV series.\n\nAs Trump faces scrutiny over his past links to Epstein, and pressure to release all files in the sex offender’s case, Serrano offers a rare insight into the two men.\n\nPhotographing Epstein\n\nSerrano’s portrait of Epstein was “23 years in the making”, he says, after he agreed to do it in exchange for a sculpture the wealthy collector owned that the artist had wanted since the mid-1990s.\n\nAt the time, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender who had served time in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite this, Serrano says he didn’t have reservations about taking the photo because he “wanted the statue” that Epstein owned.\n\nSerrano believed the 16th century statue of the Virgin Mary should be paired with one he owned of St John.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein is rolling in his grave laughing about how he is still talked about,” the artist says.\n\n“He wasn’t an interesting guy. Except for being a paedophile, there was nothing about him that should have made him so interesting to so many people.”\n\nEpstein ‘collected people’\n\nSerrano – who was first introduced to Epstein in the mid-90s – says he and his wife had “a few meetings” with him and considered him to be a “strange guy”.\n\nHe says he has “shocked” when he learnt Epstein had been “exposed and indicted as a paedophile”.\n\n“We never saw that side of Epstein,” he says.\n\n“To me, he looked like a guy who didn’t have a job and was always on a vacation having fun.\n\n“I never asked him about where his money came from. I knew he was very rich. I also knew he knew a lot of people.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein did not collect art but he collected people. He made it his business to know everybody, anybody who was a celebrity, famous, rich – anyone with a reputation.”\n\nSerrano says he doesn’t “judge” the subjects of his photography, who have also included members of the Ku Klux Klan, and he was “happy” with the outcome of the Epstein portrait.\n\nBut how does he think Epstein’s victims feel seeing the image?\n\n“I don’t see how one thing has to do with the other,” he replies.\n\n“Does that mean the victims would feel better looking at the portrait of him in the mugshot, which is a horrible picture?”\n\nHe adds: “Their take on Jeffrey Epstein is very different from everyone else’s. So they see something that we can’t even imagine what they see.”\n\nPhotographing Trump\n\nWhile Serrano believes Epstein was uninteresting, his opinion of Trump couldn’t be more different.\n\nHe describes the US president as “fascinating” – so much so that he collected more than 1,000 items linked to him for an art installation called The Game: All Things Trump.\n\nThe objects, products and items of merchandise had been created for Trump’s businesses and brands, including Trump Vodka, Trump University and even Trump Steaks.\n\nAn 11ft-tall sign spelling the word “Ego” from the Trump Taj Mahal resort in Atlantic City also featured in the display, along with Serrano’s own portrait of Trump.\n\nHe calls the photograph “one of the best portraits I’ve ever seen of Donald Trump”, and reveals he had a particular way of working with him – staying quiet.\n\n“I didn’t give him any reason to upset him,” Serrano says.\n\n“He sizes you up very quickly. (I didn’t want to say) anything that would turn him off or that would bore him or that would make him in any way want to leave.”\n\n‘Quiet’ Trump ‘tried to figure me out’\n\nSerrano – whose photo of Trump was taken for the artist’s 2004 portrait series called America – says he spent about half an hour with the future US president to capture the image, describing him as “quiet” throughout the process.\n\n“I often like to leave people to their own thoughts when I’m taking a portrait,” the artist says.\n\n“I like to make the kind of portraits where it feels like I’m not even there. It’s just you, the viewer and the sitter.\n\n“I think he was just trying to figure me out. And so since we didn’t talk, you know it was just a silent conversation between us.”\n\nRead more:All we know about Trump and Epstein’s ‘friendship’What’s in Epstein’s ‘birthday book’?\n\nThe artist won’t answer directly when asked if he is a Trump supporter but calls him “the epitome of the American dream”.\n\n“I don’t think the art world has ever taken Donald Trump seriously except as a subject for ridicule,” he says.\n\n“My perception and my intent with Donald Trump was far from that, because I think that’s a very simplistic way of doing things.\n\n“My view of him is that he’s a really smart guy.\n\n“Whatever you think about him, you can’t argue with the fact that he often gets his way and I think that’s because Donald Trump is persistent. He doesn’t let go. He’s like a pitbull who doesn’t let go.”\n\n‘Epstein story will be buried’\n\nSerrano also took a portrait photograph of Trump’s former presidential election rival Kamala Harris for The New Yorker magazine but says the circumstances were very different.\n\n“When I do portrait for a magazine… I’m happy to do for them but there’s no skin in the game for me,” he says.\n\n👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈\n\nDespite the pressure facing Trump to make public all files related to the Epstein case, Serrano believes “the story will die at some point”.\n\n“It’s kind of like the Kennedy assassination. People have been obsessed with conspiracy theories, theories about John F Kennedy’s assassination for years,” he says.\n\n“It’s a story that comes and goes, but I think this story will go.\n\n“At some point, maybe some point soon, the Jeffrey Epstein story will be buried, along with Jeffrey Epstein.”","summary":"Andres Serrano says he doesn&#8217;t set out to be a controversial artist &#8211; but he&#8217;s certainly proved to be one during his career.

Most said they have no animosity toward the former president, but they either would not give to the library or would only give a limited amount.\n\nThe donors pointed to several factors, including not wanting to make themselves a target of the Trump administration and reserving their money for the Democratic Party’s future.\n\nSome of them said they had personal interactions with Biden’s inner circle that were so unpleasant they believed it would be difficult to ever raise significant funds for the former president.\n\n“I’d like him to have some nice library,” one donor told NBC News. “I just don’t see that’s where I’m going to spend my money.”\n\nAnother donor said “no way” when asked by the outlet about giving to the library.\n\nBiden also faces residual frustration from the party over his decision to initially seek re-election despite health issues that ultimately led to him dropping out of the race last summer after his highly scrutinized mental acuity was put on display during a presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris then quickly secured the party’s nomination before losing to Trump in November.\n\n“I want an $800,000 refund,” personal injury lawyer John Morgan told NBC News, referring to money he said he raised for Biden that went to Harris last year.\n\n“I don’t believe a library will ever be built unless it’s a bookmobile from the old days,” Morgan joked.\n\nSusie Buell, a major donor to the party, told the outlet nobody had asked for her donation but that she is “not inclined to give to libraries.”\n\nThe chairman of the library board, Rufus Gifford, who led fundraising for Biden’s re-election campaign and was finance director for former President Barack Obama, expressed optimism that donors will want to contribute.\n\n“Those of us who have been around for a while and love the guy but also understand the full picture want to see what we can do to protect and promote his legacy,” Gifford told NBC News. “This isn’t about the past.

The assassin wrote 'Hey fascist, catch!' on the bullets in his rifle. \n\n'Mike Nellis is the business partner of Loren Merchan, the daughter of Judge Merchan who tried to sentence Trump to jail for the rest of his life. Mike Nellis should be investigated. He should be shunned from polite society. He's raising his kid to be a mini communist. The type of communist who picks up a rifle and murders an innocent father. I hope The Feds are monitoring you.'\n\nNellis then turned it around on Loomer: 'It was you and Nick Fuentes attacking Charlie Kirk and calling him a fascist over the last several weeks. You're the one who deleted your tweets, not me. Stop deflecting and take responsibility.'\n\nThere is no apparent record of Loomer calling Kirk a fascist, while Mediaite reported that neo-Nazi Fuentes - who is banned from Turning Point USA events - called Kirk a 'fascist' and a 'traitor' back in May. \n\nAfter Kirk's death, however, Loomer did delete a harshly critical post of him from July 13. \n\n'I don't ever want to hear Charlie Kirk claim he is pro-Trump ever again. After this weekend, I'd say he has revealed himself as a political opportunist and I have had a front row seat to witness the mental gymnastics these last 10 years,' she claimed. \n\nShe added that Kirk was behaving 'like a charlatan' and 'stabs Trump in the back.'\n\nNellis claimed that things became personal soon after. \n\n'Loomer is now DMing me and threatening my family. Last year, she doxxed my home address. So much for the tolerant right,' he wrote, adding that he was 'on the phone with the police' about it.\n\nLoomer responded: 'But I thought you wanted to defund the police? Ps: what threat? It's a crime to file a false police report. Just like it's a crime to dodge a congressional subpoena which you and your business partner both did. You will be charged for filing a fake police report if you are.'\n\nNellis later said that he and his family were safe and had officially filed a police report against Loomer. \n\n'The funny thing about Loomer being obsessed with me is that I have her muted. I only see her posts when someone else sends them to me. Meanwhile, she’s tweeted at me like 50 times in the last 24 hours. Get a life,' he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile Fuentes, who infamously clashed with the late conservative activist Kirk, has reacted to his assassination. \n\nFuentes, 27, who was prohibited from attending any of Kirk's Turning Point USA events, went live on Thursday night and described his passing as a 'tragedy'. \n\nHe said: 'As I watched the chaos and tragedy unfold yesterday afternoon it didn't feel real. People have been profoundly affected by this.\n\n'It doesn't feel real, it feels like a nightmare that we will never wake up from', while making note of their long standing rivalry. \n\nHe added: 'I say that as somebody who is not even a fan, not even a friend, and actually an adversary, a foe.'\n\nFuentes also addressed his supporters, known as Groypers, saying: 'To all of my followers if you take up arms, I disavow you. \n\n'I disown you. In the strongest possible terms. That is not what we're about.'\n\nHis supporters are known to use the acronym 'RKD4NJF', which stands for 'rape, kill and die for Nicholas Joseph Fuentes'.\n\nThe two had clashed first back in 2019, with Fuentes claiming Kirk was too moderate and not sufficiently far-right or anti-immigrant enough.\n\nSupporters of Fuentes started heckling Kirk at his Turning Point events due to his mainstream stance on conservatism. \n\nAfter Fuentes' words were shared on social media on Friday after the arrest of the main suspect Tyler Robinson, a clip of him talking about Kirk just last month resurfaced.\n\nIn it, he said: 'I do not want to hear, and you can not allow, Charlie Kirk to go to one more public event, without being protested, without being shouted down.\n\n'This guy goes around from campus to campus in the most, artificial, phony, fake way. \n\n'You sit there and call yourself a Christian and then you make excuses for the genocide of two million people', referring to Palestine.\n\nOfficials announced on Friday that Robinson, a student and Utah native, was handed over by his own family after they suspected him of killing Kirk. \n\nAuthorities said he inscribed messages on bullets referring to internet culture and anti-fascist sentiments before firing the shot that killed Kirk on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials said he had become more political in recent years, and mentioned Kirk going to Utah Valley University. \n\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox added: 'In the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU. \n\n'They talked about why they didn’t like [Kirk] and the viewpoints that he had.'\n\nRobinson is alleged to have said at dinner with family that 'Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate'. \n\nPresident Donald Trump said he now wants to see the killer get the death penalty for the assassination of Kirk, whom he described as the 'finest person'.\n\nKirk, a father of two, known for his fierce MAGA views and debates with college kids across the country, collapsed immediately after being hit by the gunfire.","summary":"Mike Nellis, now a Democrat strategist, revealed the threat on social media Friday evening after a fight with Loomer over the assassination of Charlie Kirk.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15094093/Democrat-strategist-Laura-Loomer-fight-Charlie-Kirk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/13/05/102101833-0-image-m-14_1757736124362.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 04:26:31","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

People who frequently interact with major Democratic donors say other potential obstacles include the threat of becoming a target of Trump. \"This is a very difficult time to raise large checks for Democrats because of how vindictive Donald Trump is,\" Democratic National Committee Fundraising Chair Chris Korge told NBC News, citing conversations with donors.

Pat Ryan said Friday on CNN’s “The Arena” that he does not believe labeling Republicans as “fascist,” “Nazi” or “Hitler” contributes to the “overall problem” between the two parties.\n\nConcerns over political violence heightened Wednesday after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was murdered in front of a crowd of students in Utah. While discussing the assassination, CNN’s Kasie Hunt asked Ryan if he thought phrases like “Nazi” or “Hitler” used by people on the left against Republicans “contributes to the problem overall.” (RELATED: How Charlie Kirk’s Alleged Assassin Was Caught)\n\n“I actually don’t think it does,” Ryan said. “I think people are trying to grapple with a really unprecedented time in our country where we’re seeing maybe history not fully repeat, but history rhyme at some of the darkest times in our world’s history and struggling in good faith to try to put some intellectual thought into that and find the right language to describe the fact that the constitution I risked my life for 27 months in combat is being tested and pushed.”\n\n“And, in many cases, I think not being honored by this president, that’s hard to figure out how to, how to put word to that in a way that is constructive. So those are words that are more academic. I think it is the call for violence to me,” Ryan added. “That is where the calls for violence linked to that, that are, that are the problem, the idea that we’ve heard from many leaders in both parties, unfortunately, that there’s some deeper evil if you feel a certain way.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Kirk had been speaking and debating with students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, as he was known to do. About 20 minutes into the event, a fatal shot struck him, and security rushed him to the hospital. While Kirk was initially in stable condition, the TPUSA founder ultimately succumbed to his injuries.\n\nDuring breaking news of Kirk being shot, some Democrats suggested he was at fault for his death because of his political beliefs, while others blamed President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and Republicans for a surge in political violence.\n\nSince last year, tensions between Republicans and Democrats have risen during the 2024 presidential election cycle, as corporate media and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign escalated their rhetoric against Trump. The then-GOP presidential candidate was called a fascist by Harris, with former President Joe Biden saying he should be locked up.\n\nOn July 13, 2024, the first assassination attempt against Trump occurred in Butler, Pa. During the campaign rally, Trump was speaking to a crowd when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks fired multiple rounds, grazing Trump’s ear and killing volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore. Just months later, on Sept. 15, 2024, a second attempt against Trump was uncovered when Secret Service agents found would-be assassin Ryan Routh hiding in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., with an AK-47-style rifle.\n\nIn June, Democratic Minnesota state Sen. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot at their home. Additionally, a self-proclaimed socialist who supported the Black Lives Matter movement set fire to Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Siriano unveiled three custom-designed pieces: a bra, coat and pants, all featuring an animal print fashioned from Humane World for Animals' newly redesigned logo, with the bra serving as the striking centerpiece and the other items designed to complete the full look. The pieces were all created in an animal-cruelty-free black and white material, aligning seamlessly with the monochrome theme of Siriano's collection this season.\n\nThis partnership aims to unite Humane World for Animals' global mission to end animal suffering with Christian Siriano's inclusive, bold and socially conscious design approach, bringing compassion and care for animals to life through the lens of fashion. Earlier this year, Siriano designed a custom couture gown using the Humane World for Animals animal print for Grammy-nominated artist Sia, who wore the piece during a live performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to promote the organization's rebrand announcement earlier this year.\n\n\"I've always believed fashion can be more than beautiful; it can be meaningful,\" said Christian Siriano. \"Partnering with Humane World for Animals allows me to spark conversation and awareness around caring for animals. The bra, as the centerpiece, embodies how animals are close to our hearts and serves as a reminder of the love and responsibility we share toward them. Together with the additional pieces, it reflects both style and purpose, showing how creativity and compassion can truly coexist on the runway.\"\n\n\"This partnership marks an exciting evolution in our ongoing collaboration with Christian, bringing our shared mission to one of fashion's most influential stages,\" said Kitty Block, president and CEO of Humane World for Animals. \"By working with visionary designers, we can show the world that compassion and style go hand in hand. This is about more than fashion; it's a statement that caring for animals is always in style.\"\n\nHumane World for Animals has long advanced a powerful narrative at the intersection of fashion and ethics. The organization has spearheaded advocacy to end the fur trade for decades by working with designers and retailers to adopt fur-free policies. Through legislation, sustained public education, corporate campaigns and support for humane alternatives to fur, Humane World for Animals has helped usher in a new era where cruelty in fashion is becoming ethically obsolete.\n\nDownload Photos/Video \n\nAbout Humane World for Animals\n\nTogether, we tackle the root causes of animal cruelty and suffering to create permanent change. With millions of supporters and work happening in over 50 countries, Humane World for Animals—formerly called the Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International—addresses the most deeply entrenched forms of animal cruelty and suffering. As the leading voice in the animal protection space, we work to end the cruelest practices, care for animals in crisis and build a stronger animal protection movement. Driving toward the greatest global impact, we aim to achieve the vision behind our name: a more humane world.\n\nAbout Christian Siriano\n\nAward-winning CFDA designer Christian Siriano has established himself as a tour de force in the fashion world since launching his eponymous collection in 2008 following his studies in London under Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.

It is one of the last known images of Epstein, whose death was ruled to be suicide.\n\nYears earlier, Serrano took a portrait photo of Donald Trump in 2004 - the same year the property tycoon began starring on The Apprentice TV series.\n\nAs Trump faces scrutiny over his past links to Epstein, and pressure to release all files in the sex offender's case, Serrano offers a rare insight into the two men.\n\nPhotographing Epstein\n\nSerrano's portrait of Epstein was \"23 years in the making\", he says, after he agreed to do it in exchange for a sculpture the wealthy collector owned that the artist had wanted since the mid-1990s.\n\nAt the time, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender who had served time in jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite this, Serrano says he didn't have reservations about taking the photo because he \"wanted the statue\" that Epstein owned.\n\nSerrano believed the 16th century statue of the Virgin Mary should be paired with one he owned of St John.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein is rolling in his grave laughing about how he is still talked about,\" the artist says.\n\n\"He wasn't an interesting guy. Except for being a paedophile, there was nothing about him that should have made him so interesting to so many people.\"\n\nEpstein 'collected people'\n\nSerrano - who was first introduced to Epstein in the mid-90s - says he and his wife had \"a few meetings\" with him and considered him to be a \"strange guy\".\n\nHe says he has \"shocked\" when he learnt Epstein had been \"exposed and indicted as a paedophile\".\n\n\"We never saw that side of Epstein,\" he says.\n\n\"To me, he looked like a guy who didn't have a job and was always on a vacation having fun.\n\n\"I never asked him about where his money came from. I knew he was very rich. I also knew he knew a lot of people.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein did not collect art but he collected people. He made it his business to know everybody, anybody who was a celebrity, famous, rich - anyone with a reputation.\"\n\nSerrano says he doesn't \"judge\" the subjects of his photography, who have also included members of the Ku Klux Klan, and he was \"happy\" with the outcome of the Epstein portrait.\n\nBut how does he think Epstein's victims feel seeing the image?\n\n\"I don't see how one thing has to do with the other,\" he replies.\n\n\"Does that mean the victims would feel better looking at the portrait of him in the mugshot, which is a horrible picture?\"\n\nHe adds: \"Their take on Jeffrey Epstein is very different from everyone else's. So they see something that we can't even imagine what they see.\"\n\nPhotographing Trump\n\nWhile Serrano believes Epstein was uninteresting, his opinion of Trump couldn't be more different.\n\nHe describes the US president as \"fascinating\" - so much so that he collected more than 1,000 items linked to him for an art installation called The Game: All Things Trump.\n\nThe objects, products and items of merchandise had been created for Trump's businesses and brands, including Trump Vodka, Trump University and even Trump Steaks.\n\nAn 11ft-tall sign spelling the word \"Ego\" from the Trump Taj Mahal resort in Atlantic City also featured in the display, along with Serrano's own portrait of Trump.\n\nHe calls the photograph \"one of the best portraits I've ever seen of Donald Trump\", and reveals he had a particular way of working with him - staying quiet.\n\n\"I didn't give him any reason to upset him,\" Serrano says.\n\n\"He sizes you up very quickly. (I didn't want to say) anything that would turn him off or that would bore him or that would make him in any way want to leave.\"\n\n'Quiet' Trump 'tried to figure me out'\n\nSerrano says he spent about half an hour with Trump, who he describes as being \"quiet\" throughout the process of having his portrait photo taken.\n\n\"I often like to leave people to their own thoughts when I'm taking a portrait,\" the artist says.\n\n\"I like to make the kind of portraits where it feels like I'm not even there. It's just you, the viewer and the sitter.\n\n\"I think he was just trying to figure me out. And so since we didn't talk, you know it was just a silent conversation between us.\"\n\nRead more:All we know about Trump and Epstein's 'friendship'What's in Epstein's 'birthday book'?\n\nThe artist won't answer directly when asked if he is a Trump supporter but calls him \"the epitome of the American dream\".\n\n\"I don't think the art world has ever taken Donald Trump seriously except as a subject for ridicule,\" he says.\n\n\"My perception and my intent with Donald Trump was far from that, because I think that's a very simplistic way of doing things.\n\n\"My view of him is that he's a really smart guy.\n\n\"Whatever you think about him, you can't argue with the fact that he often gets his way and I think that's because Donald Trump is persistent. He doesn't let go. He's like a pitbull who doesn't let go.\"\n\n'Epstein story will be buried'\n\nSerrano also took a portrait photograph of Trump's former presidential election rival Kamala Harris for The New Yorker magazine but says the circumstances were very different.\n\n\"When I do portrait for a magazine… I'm happy to do for them but there's no skin in the game for me,\" he says.\n\n👉 Follow Trump100 on your podcast app 👈\n\nDespite the pressure facing Trump to make public all files related to the Epstein case, Serrano believes \"the story will die at some point\".\n\n\"It's kind of like the Kennedy assassination. People have been obsessed with conspiracy theories, theories about John F Kennedy's assassination for years,\" he says.\n\n\"It's a story that comes and goes, but I think this story will go.\n\n\"At some point, maybe some point soon, the Jeffrey Epstein story will be buried, along with Jeffrey Epstein.\"","summary":"Andres Serrano says he doesn't set out to be a controversial artist - but he's certainly proved to be one during his career.","url":"https://news.sky.com/story/epstein-is-rolling-in-his-grave-laughing-artist-reveals-why-he-photographed-convicted-paedophile-and-donald-trump-13425082","image":"https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein_7011341.jpg?20250904185445","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:01:00","author":"David Mercer","authors":["David Mercer"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.175},{"id":360058028,"title":"Letters: In the current climate, how can nation increase kindness?","text":"How can our nation\nincrease kindness?\n\nRe: “Activist fatally shot at college event” (Page A1, Sept. 11).\n\nDuring rush hour on Wednesday afternoon, while the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk was fresh news, anti-Trump protesters along El Camino felt a new, palpable anger from passing traffic.\n\nUsually, among the honks and waves of support, we receive a few thumbs-down and even fingers-up. But on Wednesday, our critics were mad. I was puzzled at first when a scowling young man pulled over to the curb and pointed to the words “Due Process” on my sign, sneering, “Due process with a gun, you mean.” The next man to vent clarified, shouting across traffic at a red light, “You’re destroying the country!

When the danger of assassination is introduced into political speech, how many voices will merely prefer to remain silent?\n\nDemocracy itself is killed when debate platforms are turned into battlefields.

It predates Julius Caesar and is probably as old as mankind. It’s worth noting, however, that given your political style of denigrating, demonizing and blaming your political opposition, more than 80% of Americans feel that partisan division has increased significantly since 2016.\n\nWhile you are not directly responsible for the recent rise in political violence, you are in a unique position to bring the partisan temperature down.

Ignorant, narcissistic, agenda-oriented grifters and con artists are the problem. People who don’t cooperate and who are in it for the money are the problem. That’s not gender-based. So, yes, let’s get more women involved along with more people of all races, all genders and all viewpoints, but let’s make sure they are community-oriented, team-spirited and willing to work for the good of all.\n\nWe’ve got some real serious problems that desperately need committed, caring and knowledgeable people of all types to solve them.

That was thanks in large part to outreach on social media platforms and in communities targeted with the help of prominent personalities like Charlie Kirk.\n\n\"We crushed the youth vote, even Democrats acknowledge it,\" Kirk said at an appearance this year at the Cambridge Union in the United Kingdom. \"Both young men and young women moved to the right dramatically.\"\n\nJohn Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics, who has studied young voters, said Kirk's organization's biggest success came with getting Trump and other GOP leaders to buy into his vision.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not president today without the support of young men, and Charlie Kirk deserves and deserved credit not just for organizing young men but persuading an older generation to listen and to invest,\" he told ABC News.\n\nKirk's name was ubiquitous in focus groups with young voters, he added.\n\n\"People recognized that he was able to display an element of strength and masculinity unlike others and what they appreciate was that even though many don't agree with his positions or rhetoric, they give him credit for showing up and taking questions and free speech,\" Della Volpe said.\n\nKirk expanded on his strategy in an interview with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, last March.\n\n\"Right around 2021 we had a goal: could we move the youth vote ten points over ten years?\" Kirk told Newsom on the first episode of the governor's new podcast. \"We believed Democrats were taking them for granted ... President Trump harmonized with the strategy by going on podcasts, going on TikTok.\"\n\nIn the last five presidential elections, Democrats have won the White House when they captured at least 60% of young voters -- a benchmark Kamala Harris failed to meet, winning 54% of voters under 30 years old, compared to Trump's 43%.\n\n\"When Democrats win 60% of the youth vote, they win elections,\" Della Volpe said. \"The job of a Republican is to decrease that margin.\"\n\nAccording to ABC News exit polling, Trump performed better with voters under 30 -- winning 43% to Harris' 54% -- than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004, when George W. Bush won 45% of voters under 30.\n\nTrump drew even with Harris with men under 30 (49% to her 48%), an 8-point improvement from the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHarris won 61% of young women, compared to Trump's 38%.\n\nIn the key swing state of Michigan, Trump won 50% of young voters, compared to 47% for Harris. In Wisconsin, he won 48% of those voters, compared to 49% for Harris; In Pennsylvania, he won 44% of young voters vote compared to her 55%.\n\nIn these three \"Blue Wall\" states that Trump flipped in 2024, he improved on his 2020 performance with voters under 30 by 9-13 points, depending on the state, according to ABC News exit polling.\n\nNationally, Trump also won 57% of young white men without college degrees, compared to 40% for Harris.\n\nIn the Sun Belt swing state of Arizona, Kirk's home state, Harris managed to win 65% of voters under 30. But Democrats lost ground with Latino voters and other groups of voters Republicans were able to motivate, giving Trump the edge.\n\nThat may have also been partially due to Kirk's efforts as an organizer.\n\nDespite his embrace of false stolen-election claims in 2020, and after GOP candidates were shut out of statewide office in Arizona in 2022, Kirk and his group established a \"Ballot Chasers\" program in 2024.\n\nIt was a $100-plus million effort to reach and mobilize hundreds of thousands of low-propensity Trump supporters in battleground states like Arizona and Wisconsin, and get them to vote early and potentially by mail, despite Trump's public misgivings about mail-in voting.\n\nIt was one of many outside programs that effectively made up the Trump campaign's outsourced ground game.\n\n\"I'm not sure he moved a lot of people, but he organized a lot of people who shared his views,\" Della Volpe said.\n\nRepublicans debated the share of credit Kirk's \"Turning Point USA\" deserved for its contributions to the larger effort -- but Trump and his campaign credited Kirk and his organization's work for pushing them to victory last year.\n\n\"Charlie Kirk will tell you, TikTok helped, but Charlie Kirk helped also,\" Trump said at the White House in May about Kirk's contributions to his winning campaign. \"He's done great, and I appreciate all the help.\"","summary":"\"Both young men and young women moved to the right dramatically,\" he said.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charlie-kirks-influence-younger-voters-helped-donald-trump/story?id=125518800","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/302b1bd8-f036-45e5-81fc-6fc5b0af7469/charlie-kirk-trump-gty-jt-250910_1757532513698_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 22:57:48","author":"Benjamin Siegel","authors":["Benjamin Siegel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.442},{"id":360043046,"title":"Who is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's murder?","text":"Robinson, now 22, was arrested for aggravated murder and other charges.

Robinson, 22, was taken into custody on Thursday night, around 33 hours after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel told reporters. The agency had received more than 11,000 tips as of Friday morning — the most since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, he said. Robinson was captured after he confessed to a family friend, or \"implied that he had committed\" the murder to that friend, Cox said. That person in turn contacted the Washington County Sheriff&apos;s Office on Thursday. Law enforcement officials had previously released a series of security camera images of a person of interest and asked the public to help identify him. Kirk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single bullet as he spoke onstage at an outdoor amphitheatre at Utah Valley. Trump called the shooting a \"heinous assassination.\" The killing has stirred outrage among Kirk&apos;s supporters and denunciations of political violence from Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments. The charismatic 31-year-old helped build support for Trump among young voters in the 2024 presidential election. \"It is an attack on all of us,\" Utah&apos;s governor said, drawing parallels between Kirk&apos;s murder and the assassinations of President John Kennedy, his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. \"It is an attack on the American experiment,\" Cox said. \"It is an attack on our ideals.\" The shooting has punctuated the most sustained period of US political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since supporters of Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump himself has survived two attempts on his life, one that left him with a grazed ear during a campaign event in July 2024 and another two months later foiled by federal agents. Details about Robinson&apos;s life have begun to emerge. At the time of the shooting he was living with his parents at his family&apos;s home in Washington County, in the southwest corner of Utah near the Nevada border, Cox said. He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records. He is listed as an \"inactive\" voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year&apos;s presidential election, when Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris. A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political in recent years and had said to another relative that he disliked Kirk and his viewpoints, Cox said. Investigators are still working to understand what led Robinson to that rooftop. Officials have not yet identified a precise motive for the shooting, though they offered some clues on Friday morning in announcing his arrest. Cox told reporters that a family member interviewed by law enforcement said Robinson had recently mentioned Kirk&apos;s scheduled appearance at Utah Valley University, where he was shot. \"They talked about why they didn&apos;t like him and the viewpoints he had,\" Cox said, without offering further details. Robinson was arrested for aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious injury and obstruction of justice, according to an affidavit filed by investigators. He has not been formally charged in court and is being held at the Utah County jail. Investigators previously said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk. Investigators also spoke to Robinson&apos;s roommate, according to the affidavit. It was unclear whether they were referring to a current or former roommate. The roommate showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord — a chat and streaming platform popular with gamers — and messages to the roommate in which he discussed retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then ditching it in a bush wrapped in a towel, the affidavit said. That matched the description of the gun recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus. Ammunition found at the scene had been engraved with inscriptions, Cox said. The messages on the casings included: \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\", \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao\" and \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by arrow symbols that appeared to be a reference to a button-sequence for a videogame, according to the arrest affidavit. The bullet that killed Kirk had also been inscribed: \"Notices Buldge OWO what’s this?” an apparent reference to a joke meme about online role play and gaming. Politicians, commentators and amateur sleuths have filled social media and online forums with speculation and blame-casting about the killer&apos;s identity and ideology. Cox told reporters he would leave interpretation of the messages on the ammunition to others for now. Kirk, a well-connected activist, author and podcast host, was friends with Vice President JD Vance, Trump&apos;s family and others at the highest echelons of the US government. Patel, the FBI director, also offered a personal tribute at the press conference: \"Rest now brother, we have the watch. I&apos;ll see you in Valhalla,\" he said in closing his remarks, referring to the heavenly reward for warriors in Norse mythology. Kirk, co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, began his career in conservative and right-wing politics as a teenager. Trump told Fox News&apos; \"Fox and Friends\" program that Kirk&apos;s ability to connect with young people and explain his policies had helped him win the 2024 election. \"He had a big impact on the election,\" the president said. \"I got so many young voters. No Republican&apos;s ever gotten anything close.\" Kirk appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event \"American Comeback Tour\" of college campuses, having just returned to the US from an overseas speaking tour in South Korea and Japan. Known for his often-provocative discourse on race, gender, immigration and gun regulation, Kirk would use such events to invite members of the crowd to debate him live, and was frequently challenged by both people on the left and the far right. \"We will never be able to solve all the other problems, including the violence problems that people are worried about if we can&apos;t have a clash of ideas, safely and securely,\" the governor said at Friday&apos;s briefing. \"That&apos;s why this matters so much.\" download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"The suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was taken into custody following a two-day manhunt.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-captured/h3lp59vqh","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/3bec8b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/520x293+0+49/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd9%2F94%2F9288959f41b697a89e9459c22023%2F20250913179113208346-original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 21:30:55","author":"Aap / Utah Department of Public Safety Via Sipa Usa","authors":["Aap / Utah Department of Public Safety Via Sipa Usa"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":360044980,"title":"‘It Was Wrong’: David Axelrod Calls Out Dems Over Major Policy Mistakes","text":"President Barack Obama’s former chief campaign strategist, David Axelrod, on “Fast Politics w/ Molly Jong-Fast,” rebuked the Democratic Party for its border and COVID-19 policy.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s favorability is only 33.3%, while its unfavorability is 60.5%, according to the RealClearPolling average. Axelrod argued on the podcast that the party appeared more focused on “vulnerable populations” than the issues many Americans face. (RELATED: DC Mayor Orders Local Cooperation With Federal Crime Crackdown)\n\n“It was insane to spend three years before you did something serious about the border,” Axelrod said. “Insane! And it was wrong not to be much more active in trying to reopen schools!”\n\n“I have great solicitude for vulnerable populations, but Democrats allowed themselves to be portrayed as caring more about vulnerable populations than understanding the vulnerabilities of large numbers of Americans,” he added. “So I think that the party itself has work to do.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden did not sign an executive order to clamp down on the border until the final year of his presidency, after 6 million southern border encounters. He also claimed for months before signing it that there was no action he could take to mitigate the crisis.\n\nThe executive action halted new asylum requests once the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. reached a daily average of 2,500 over the span of a week.\n\nDemocratic Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz acknowledged on “The Chuck ToddCast” Sept. 2 that the teachers union and partisanship played a role in his party not pushing to reopen schools during the pandemic.\n\n“I said to my Democratic colleagues, I’m like, ‘When we open schools, it’s going to be very popular. When you guys come out and tell parents you want to keep their kids in the house for another year, I’m telling you this is where this is going.’ And none of my colleagues wanted to hear it, Chuck,” he told host Chuck Todd.\n\nTodd asked if their refusal was due to “the power of the teachers union.”\n\n“It’s part teachers union,” Moskowitz said.\n\n“Part also, we were at a point of polarization that if [Republican Florida Gov.] Ron DeSantis wanted to open schools then I had to be against it … things had become so toxic at that point,” he added.\n\nExtended school closures and remote education during the pandemic had deleterious effects on students’ aptitude in key subjects like math and English.\n\nMoreover, framing former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party as excessively far left on transgender issues was one of the most effective advertising campaigns in increasing support for President Donald Trump and GOP candidates down the ballot during the 2024 election, according to multiple reports.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

After playing a montage of prominent left-wing politicians and media personalities calling President Donald Trump a “fascist” on Friday’s episode of “The Scott Jennings Podcast,” Jennings turned his attention to Democrats, including Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Goldman of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Eric Swalwell of California.

Whatever could have given Tyler Robinson the idea that Charlie Kirk and conservatives are fascists who want to destroy the country?”\n\n“We may never know folks, we may never know,” Jennings added sarcastically.\n\nHarris escalated attacks on Trump in the closing weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign, devoting a major speech to attacking the former president as a threat to democracy and portraying him as “unstable” days after calling him a “fascist” during an Oct. 23 town hall on CNN, which was the first clip of the montage Jennings played. Others in the montage included MSNBC hosts Joy Reid and Rachel Maddow and left-wing legal analyst Elie Mystal.\n\n“For the last ten years, the American left, Democrats and, yes, I’m sorry to say, many people in the media have dedicated themselves to branding Republicans and conservatives as fascists, Nazis,” Jenning said. “The left normalized this language and the media platformed and endorsed it. The brand was created, the talking points went out as they say, and it is now an article of faith on the American left that if you have voted for Donald Trump or espoused conservative views, you’re a fascist, someone who wants to destroy the Constitution and our country.”\n\n“Every conservative view is met with, well, that’s hateful. Every conservative view is met with, well, that view is killing people,” Jennings said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump survived two attempts on his life during the 2024 presidential campaign, one during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the other on September 15 while Trump was playing a round of golf in Florida. Trump also survived an assassination attempt during his successful 2016 campaign for President when a 20-year-old man from the United Kingdom tried to take a police officer’s gun to shoot Trump during a June 2016 campaign event in Las Vegas.\n\n“The left hated Charlie Kirk because they did not know how to debate him beyond simply calling him or any of us who do this for a living fascists, Nazis and hateful people, whose views cause death and therefore cannot be platformed or allowed,” Jennings said.\n\n“They have no idea how to debate, so they use these labels and they did so with no thought whatsoever given to the implications,” Jennings continued. “The killer of Charlie Kirk took the arguments made by Democrats on your televisions every night and wrote them on the bullets.” (RELATED: Susie Wiles Reveals What She Told White House Staff After Charlie Kirk Assassination)\n\nTPUSA events have been targets of violent protests in the past.

Use AI tools that are available to you—don’t run from what you may not immediately understand. Be conscious of the trends and movements growing around you when you’re building a company. And above all, trust your intuition.\n\nThese were just some of the gems of wisdom that dropped during the 2025 Forbes Power Women Summit yesterday—from cultural icons like Hoda Kotb and Bethann Hardison, tech titans like Kara Swisher and May Habib, and self-made billionaires Sara Blakely and Lucy Guo. Videos of all of these conversations will be rolling out on Forbes.com in the coming days and weeks, but for now, if you missed yesterday’s festivities, I encourage you to catch up on it all with this comprehensive live blog written by Forbes reporters Zoya Hasan and Alex York.\n\nNews was broken throughout the day, too: Melinda French Gates announced a $100 million partnership between Pivotal Ventures, the company she founded to accelerate social progress and expand women’s power, and Wellcome Leap, the breakthrough health organization led by Regina Dugan.

Darlene Rodriguez, a native New Yorker who is now the co-anchor of Today in New York on NBC 4 New York, was working the night shift for WNBC at the time, but jumped in her car to start reporting when she got the call about the first plane crashing into the World Trade Center’s North Tower.\n\n“It’s never really gotten away from any of us, really,” Rodriguez says. “We all learned a lot that day. You learn about what’s important, you learn about how people should be treated and what really matters.”\n\nMaggie McGrath\n\nExclusive Forbes List: The 10 Richest Women In America 2025\n\nMacKenzie Scott, Melinda French Gates, Alice Walton\nILLUSTRATION BY NEIL JAMIESON FOR FORBES\n\nThe Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans continues to be dominated by men, and this year—unlike in recent years—the gap is widening. There are just 62 women among the nation’s 400 wealthiest people, good for just 15.5% of the ranking. That’s down from 67 women last year, or about 17%. It’s the first time that women have failed to increase their presence on the list since 2019. The silver lining? Nearly three-quarters of the women who remain among the top 400 are richer than a year ago. In aggregate, these 62 super-rich women are worth $872 billion, up from $839 billion in 2024.\n\nICYMI: News Of The Week\n\nA new NBC News poll reveals that the gender divide between Gen Z men and women extends far beyond politics: there is a fundamental disagreement in how each cohort views a “successful” life. Gen Z women—especially those who supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election—place the highest value on fulfilling careers, financial flexibility, and emotional stability, while Gen Z men—disproportionately aligned with Donald Trump—place greater importance on marriage, children, and traditional family life.\n\nFormer German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock became the 80th president of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. She is the fifth woman to serve in the post since it was created in 1946. “I am fully aware that peace and development can only be sustained when half of the world’s population, when women have an equal seat at the table,” she has said.\n\nAccording to a new report from Redfin, the Black homeownership rate fell to 43.9% in the second quarter of 2025, a decline that coincides with a rise in unemployment among Black women—and this may be “putting a double burden on Black households,” writes Forbes contributor and Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather.\n\nUnrivaled, the 3-on-3 women’s basketball league founded by WNBA stars Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, has closed an oversubscribed Series B investment round led by Bessemer Venture Partners, the league announced. The deal values Unrivaled at $340 million, a record figure for a new professional sports league. (Editorial note: Forbes EVP Moira Forbes invested in an earlier round of funding for Unrivaled.)\n\nNew Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee universal free childcare. The announcement from Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, scheduled to take effect November 1, 2025, landed with both excitement and skepticism: For families, the prospect of saving an estimated $12,000 per child per year can feel life-changing. For policymakers, it raises questions about funding and whether other states can follow a similar path.\n\nThe Checklist\n\n1. Have your kids pay for college. Or at least, some of their tuition. While most parents want to give their kids every advantage, including a debt-free college education, research tells us that having kids contribute to college tuition builds confidence and offers lessons in financial literacy, responsibility, and work ethic.\n\n2. Figure out if your company needs a “bot-optimized website.” Are AI bots tanking the traffic coming to your website? ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath recently sat down with Webflow CEO Linda Tong to talk about this crucial issue and what business leaders can do to combat it.\n\n3.

Gabrielle Giffords wounded in Tucson shooting\n\nSix people were killed and 13 others wounded, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, during a constituent meeting outside a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nGiffords, a Democrat, was shot in the head at point-blank range, critically injuring her, before the shooter unleashed a spray of bullets. Giffords survived the shooting.\n\nThe shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was described by police as mentally unstable. Giffords was the focus of the gunman's assault, authorities said.\n\nJune 14, 2017 -- Rep. Steve Scalise shot during congressional baseball game practice\n\nFour people were shot -- including then-House majority whip and Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise -- when a gunman opened fire on Republicans practicing for a congressional baseball game at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nScalise was rushed to a trauma center with fractured bones and internal organ damage. A Capitol Police Officer was among the three others shot.\n\nThe gunman was shot and killed at the scene after police returned fire.\n\nScalise has since recovered.\n\nOct. 8, 2020 -- 13 men arrested for plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\nThirteen members of a militia group were arrested and charged for planning to storm the Michigan statehouse, kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and start a civil war.\n\nUltimately, the state attorney general charged 20 state felonies against eight people alleged to have engaged in planning and training for an attack on the statehouse and a plan to kidnap lawmakers, including Whitmer.\n\nFive of the eight were convicted of crimes in support of the plot, according to the Michigan attorney general. Four other people were convicted of federal charges in relation to the plot.\n\nTwo of the militia members have since been sentenced to 19 years and 16 years in prison.\n\nJan. 6, 2021 -- January 6 attack on the US Capitol, pipe bombs at RNC and DNC\n\nA mob of pro-Trump protestors stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers met to ratify the results of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe protestors stormed the Capitol and threatened the lives of elected officials, violently assaulting law enforcement officers.\n\nTwo pipe bombs were also placed outside the Democratic and Republican national headquarters the day before the riots.\n\nNearly 1,600 individuals faced charges associated with the Capitol attack, including 608 people who faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nOn his first day back in office in January 2025, President Donald Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people charged in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nAt least five people died during the attack and around 140 officers were injured during the riot, the Department of Justice said.\n\nFeb. 14, 2022 -- Kentucky mayoral candidate targeted in attempted shooting\n\nWhile running for office, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg was the target of an attempted shooting at his campaign headquarters. No one was injured in the incident.\n\nQuintez Brown walked into Greenberg’s campaign office and fired multiple shots at Greenberg while he was meeting with four staffers, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kentucky.\n\nStaffers closed and barricaded the door, and Brown was captured several blocks from the shooting, authorities said.\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2025, Brown was sentenced to over 17 years in federal prison for attempting to assassinate Greenberg.\n\n\"As part of his guilty plea, Brown admitted that he acted because Greenberg was running for mayor,\" the U.S. attorney's office said.\n\nOct. 28, 2022 -- Paul Pelosi attacked with hammer in his home\n\nFormer Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer in their San Francisco home.\n\nDavid DePape was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in a state trial over the attack. He had broken into the Pelosi home seeking to hold the then-speaker hostage.\n\nA jury found DePape guilty of false imprisonment of an elder by violence of menace, residential burglary, threatening a family member of a public official, dissuading a witness by force or threat and aggravated kidnapping.\n\nIn a separate federal case in which DePape was convicted of seeking to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, he was also sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nIn an October 2024 letter to a judge, Paul Pelosi detailed that he has continued physical and mental impacts including trouble balancing and headaches early every day.\n\nDec. 4, 2023 to Jan. 3, 2024 -- New Mexico state legislature candidate orchestrates shootings, murder for hire\n\nA New Mexico man who ran for the state legislature as a Republican and lost his bid is serving an 80 year prison sentence for allegedly orchestrating attacks at the homes of four Democratic lawmakers. No one was injured in his attempts.\n\nSolomon Peña is accused of paying four men to shoot at the residences of local Democratic officials. He allegedly paid the men in cash and sent them text messages with addresses for his alleged targets, according to prosecutors.\n\nHe was then taken into custody as detectives served search warrants at his apartment and at the home of two of the men he allegedly paid.\n\nThis came after a Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputy stopped a vehicle about 4 miles away from state Sen. Linda Lopez's home just 40 minutes after the shooting. The driver, identified as Jose Trujillo, was arrested on an outstanding warrant.\n\nIn the vehicle which was registered to Peña, police said they found more than 800 fentanyl-laced pills and two firearms. Trujillo pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nPeña orchestrated a \"politically motivated shooting spree\" and plotted \"to murder witnesses to obstruct justice,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico.\n\n\"After his electoral defeat, Peña falsely claimed the election was rigged and began pressuring members of the Bernalillo County Board of Commissioners not to certify the results. When they refused, Peña recruited Jose Trujillo and Demetrio Trujillo to carry out a series of shootings at the homes of several public officials,\" prosecutors said in a statement.\n\nJune 13, 2024 -- 1st attempted assassination of Donald Trump\n\nThen-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a gunman opened fire from the roof of a nearby building.\n\nOne rally spectator was killed and two others were critically injured during the shooting.\n\nTrump dropped to the ground when he was shot and was surrounded by agents before being hustled off the stage. Countersnipers on-site killed shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\nInvestigators have determined that he acted alone, but a motive for the attack has not been publicly disclosed.\n\nSept. 15, 2024 -- 2nd attempted assassination of Donald Trump\n\nTrump faced a second assassination attempt at the Trump International Gold Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nProsecutors said suspect Ryan Wesley Routh allegedly put together a plan, including purchasing a military-grade weapon, researching Trump's movements and using a dozen burner phones in an alleged attempt to kill Trump based on political grievances.\n\nRouth allegedly came within a few hundred yards of Trump before a Secret Service agent spotted his rifle poking out of a tree line. Authorities say Routh fled the scene but was later apprehended. Routh is currently on trial.\n\nOct. 6, 2024 -- Kamala Harris campaign office in Arizona shot at 3 times in a month\n\nAn office shared by then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and the Democratic Party in Tempe, Arizona, was damaged by gunfire three times in less than a month, according to police.\n\nThe three shootings occurred late at night and no one was injured in any of the shootings.\n\nA suspect was arrested on Oct. 24 in connection with the three shootings, facing multiple charges including unlawful discharge, shooting at a non-residential structure, terrorism and criminal damage.\n\nPolice said Jeffrey Michael Kelly was seen posting anti-Democratic signs in Ahwatukee, attaching baggies labeled \"biohazard\" containing white powdery substance to the signs. Now on trial, he could face up to life in prison if convicted.\n\n\"Threats, intimidation or violence toward political officials -- no matter what party they are a part of -- are completely unacceptable,\" Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said during the press briefing.\n\nDec. 4, 2024 -- Murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson\n\nUnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson died after being shot multiple times at point-blank range by a gunman outside a Manhattan hotel, according to police.\n\nThe shooter appeared to have been lying in wait at the hotel where he shot Thompson, authorities said.\n\nAlleged shooter Luigi Mangione was captured after a manhunt that lasted several days. \n\nInvestigators suspect that Mangione was frustrated with the healthcare system in the U.S. when he targeted Thompson, who was the CEO of the country's biggest insurance company.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Mangione wanted to send a message about corporate greed. Mangione was likely motivated by his belief that health insurance companies were \"parasitic\" and believed unilateral action could be symbolic to others.\n\nApril 13, 2025 -- Arson at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence\n\nA mechanic who has expressed disdain for Democrats on social media was arrested for starting a fire at Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence.\n\nShapiro and his family were at the residence at the time of the fire, but they were not injured and safely evacuated, according to police.\n\nCody Balmer allegedly broke a window with a hammer and then threw two home-made Molotov cocktails into the governor's mansion. Moments after he allegedly firebombed the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion, Cody Balmer called 911 and confessed.\n\nBalmer waived his initial hearing and is expected in court in October.\n\nMay 21, 2025 -- Killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C.\n\nTwo Israeli embassy staffers were shot and killed while exiting an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe suspect shouted \"free, free Palestine\" after shooting Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, according to FBI Director Kash Patel, who called the shooting an \"act of terror.\"\n\nThe suspect fired 21 times as the couple exited the venue, authorities said. Suspect Elias Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of murder and has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.\n\nJune 1, 2025 -- 13 people injured in Colorado firebombing attack, 1 later dies\n\nA man threw Molotov cocktails during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, injuring 13, authorities said. One person later died of their injuries.\n\nSuspect Mohamed Soliman told police he wanted to \"kill all zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" according to state court documents. He has pleaded not guilty to federal hate crime charges.\n\nJune 14, 2025\n-- Minnesota lawmaker shootings\n\nA masked gunman disguised as a police officer shot and killed Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in their home, Gov. Tim Walz said.\n\nBefore Hortman was shot, the gunman shot State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette multiple times at their home. Both lawmakers were Democrats.\n\nSuspect Vance Boelter had a list of possible targets and went to the homes of public officials to conduct violent attacks, FBI Director Kash Patel said. Boelter has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAug. 8, 2025 -- Shooting at CDC headquarters\n\nA police officer was killed when a gunman opened fire near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters and the Emory University campus in Atlanta, authorities said.\n\nSuspect Patrick Joseph White had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him sick and depressed, according to law enforcement. He had increasingly focused on the vaccine as a source of his grievances, they noted. He was found dead after the shooting, officials said.\n\nCDC Director Susan Monarez told employees that the promotion of misinformation played a role in the deadly shooting. Monarez has since been ousted as director.\n\n\"The dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences. I will work to restore trust in public health to those who have lost it- through science, evidence, and clarity of purpose,\" Monarez wrote.\n\nThe suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nSept. 10, 2025 -- Shooting of Charlie Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth activist organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on social media.\n\nTyler Robinson allegedly shot and killed Kirk on Wednesday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at a press conference in Utah on Friday.\n\nRobinson, 22, has been booked into the Utah County Jail. Charging documents against Robinson are expected to be filed early next week, Cox said.","summary":"Public officials and law enforcement have been raising the alarm that political violence is on the rise in America.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-timeline-recent-political-violence-america/story?id=125473910","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d5620c1a-cab8-4255-8003-b2daaaef4ea1/charlie-kirk-1-rt-gmh-250911_1757598366925_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 20:16:00","author":"Brittany Shepherd,Nadine El-Bawab","authors":["Brittany Shepherd","Nadine El-Bawab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":360028716,"title":"‘Want An $800,000 Refund’: Dem Donors Hard Pass On Giving Money To Biden Library Effort","text":"Former President Joe Biden is struggling to raise money to build a presidential library as some past Democratic donors are refusing to dole out funds for the project, NBC News reported Friday.\n\nDonors listed a slew of reasons they were withholding their donations such as “distasteful” personal experiences with Biden’s inner circle, and “residual anger” over him initially deciding to seek a second term despite his health issues, according to the outlet. The former president has been reportedly having trouble gathering funds since 2024 — even before President Donald Trump was reelected to succeed him.\n\n“I don’t believe a library will ever be built unless it’s a bookmobile from the old days,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based personal injury lawyer and longtime Biden supporter, according to NBC News. “Couple [Biden’s age and medical issues] with the perception that [the party’s] woes rest with his decision to seek a second term and we have the Hindenburg heading straight towards us.”\n\n“I want an $800,000 refund,” Morgan added, in reference to the large amount of money he gave to support Biden’s reelection bid — which was eventually channeled into failed 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris‘ campaign following Biden’s withdrawal.\n\nOne donor who requested anonymity to speak freely, told the outlet, “Me? No way.”\n\n“I’d like him [Biden] to have some nice library,” another donor said per NBC News. “I just don’t see that’s where I’m going to spend my money.”\n\nSusie Buell, another Democratic donor, said, “No one has asked, but I am not inclined to give to libraries,” NBC News reported.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost between $200 million and $300 million, according to the outlet, which is significantly less than former President Barack Obama’s $850 million Presidential Library slated to open in Chicago in the spring.\n\nChris Korge, fundraising chair for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), said he pushed Biden’s team to table reelection ambitions and focus on funding a library instead, NBC News reported.\n\nEven if Biden had begun requesting donations sooner, it’s unclear if fundraising would have been successful. Donors have complained they lacked access to him while he was in office despite being asked frequently to make donations, per the outlet. They have blamed Biden’s inner circle for isolating him to hide his mental decline, and therefore hesitating to hold any kind of fundraising events at the White House.\n\nAnother prominent donor said Biden has kept his circle of donors small, as he “was not good at making his donors feel appreciated,” according to NBC News. The donor detailed how Biden’s approach to donors, along with obstacles like his age and mental ability, would cloud the path ahead.\n\n“I don’t think ‘hill’ is the proper term,” he said. “It’s going to be much steeper than that.”\n\nA donor who has been involved in Biden fundraising in the past highlighted recently published works exposing Biden’s mental decline and rehashing the Democrats’ failed 2024 presidential campaigns, claiming they are dragging the party down when they need to be moving forward.\n\n“Democrats need to pick themselves up and start doing and stop whining and complaining about what happened,” the person told the outlet. “Joe Biden has been a public servant to this country on the world stage for decades, we owe him a huge debt of gratitude.”\n\n“The ending was not pretty, we all know that,” the person added. “But the country and he deserves a foundation and library museum.”\n\nRufus Gifford, finance director for former President Barack Obama and fundraiser for Biden’s re-election campaign, was named chairman of the library board. He believes donors will eventually chip in to push the project forward.\n\n“Those of us who have been around for a while and love the guy but also understand the full picture want to see what we can do to protect and promote his legacy,” Gifford said. “This isn’t about the past. It’s about the future.”\n\nThe Bidens did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They’re saying it in their own words.”\n\nShe went on to list some of the “blind quotes” with no identity attached to them.\n\n“One today from a ‘Biden aide,’ but not with their name attached: ‘VP Harris was simply not good at the job. She had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration’s key work streams. She would just dive-bomb into photo ops and expose how out of depth she was.’”\n\n“That’s ugly,” Hostin chimed in. \n\n“To say that about the first female vice president, the sitting vice president that you served under. When you serve in the White House, you serve both the president and the vice president, is extraordinarily disrespectful as far as I’m concerned. And if you’re going to say it, put your name to it.”\n\nFarah Griffin went on to explain the areas in which Harris pulled her weight as Biden’s veep. “I have a feeling if you read the book and you hear more from her, that she actually did have quite a substantive role in the administration,” she said.\n\nAfter co-host Ana Navarro warned the Biden administration to watch their words, noting that the nasty remarks will only reflect him in a poor light given the fact that Biden “picked her twice” as his VP, Hostin jumped in to highlight one person who did name themselves in their comments about Harris.\n\n“Ron Klain, who was Biden’s chief of staff, did put his name to something and he said, ‘I thought she did a good job as vice president. I feel badly that she found the experience negative,’ and then he said, ‘I don’t think we — meaning the Biden administration — ‘did a good job enough job of selling her.’ He put his name to that.”","summary":"\"If you're going to say it, put your name to it,\" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asserts\n\n\nThe post &#8216;The View&#8217; Tells Biden Team to &#8216;Say It With Your Full Chest&#8217; After Releasing Nameless Kamala Harris Jabs | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/the-view-joe-biden-nameless-kamala-harris-jabs/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rump-1-4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 19:52:21","author":"Raquel 'Rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'Rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":360024650,"title":"Who is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s murder?","text":"The suspect in Charlie Kirk‘s shooting, Tyler Robinson, is a 22-year-old Utah native who authorities say had allegedly criticized the conservative influencer in a recent conversation and was living with his family at the time of the shooting.\n\nRobinson was arrested late on Thursday after a family friend called authorities, officials said on Friday.\n\nInvestigators have not publicly identified a motive. Utah Governor Spencer Cox told reporters that a family member interviewed by law enforcement said Robinson had recently mentioned Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University, where he was shot on Tuesday.\n\n“They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints he had,” Cox said.\n\nRobinson had also become more political in recent years, the family member told investigators, and authorities said he had engraved what appeared to be anti-fascist messages on bullet casings they found with the suspected murder weapon.\n\nRobinson, who was arrested for aggravated murder and other charges, has no criminal history, according to state records reviewed by Reuters. He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records. He is listed as an “inactive” voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, when Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nRobinson graduated in 2021 from Pine View High School in St. George, Utah. A video online of the commencement ceremony shows him carrying his diploma on stage as attendees cheer.\n\nHe briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester that fall, the school confirmed to Reuters. It was not immediately clear why he left the college.\n\nIn a video posted by his mother on Facebook, Robinson can be seen reading aloud from a letter offering him a four-year scholarship from Utah State University, as she cheered. Another post said Robinson had earned a score of 34 on the ACT college entrance exam, which would put him in the top 1% of test takers, according to the Princeton Review test preparation company.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, he was living at his family’s home in Washington County, in the southwest corner of Utah near the Nevada border, Cox said.\n\nHe has two younger brothers, according to his parents’ Facebook posts. His mother is a social worker at a non-profit healthcare company, while his father’s occupation was not immediately clear.\n\nFACEBOOK POSTS SHOW DOTING MOTHER\n\nHis mother’s Facebook posts over the years – most of which were deleted on Friday – mostly doted on her family: documenting trips to Alaska, the Caribbean and Disneyland; celebrating school plays, Halloween costumes and adopted pet rabbits; expressing pride as the three boys moved up in school. None of the posts appeared political in any way.\n\nOther posts show Robinson and his brothers occasionally with guns, though that is not uncommon in a state with permissive firearms laws.\n\n“Driving away without him was one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do in a long time,” his mother wrote in one post about helping him move to college in 2021. “He’s so excited to start his journey and it’s going to be so amazing for him!”","summary":"Robinson was arrested late on Thursday after a family friend called authorities.","url":"https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/who-is-tyler-robinson-the-suspect-in-charlie-kirks-murder/","image":"https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-24.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 19:25:07","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"za","sentiment":0.289},{"id":360007900,"title":"After Charlie Kirk Assassination, Jasmine Crockett Falsely Claims Both Attempted Trump Assassins Were Republicans","text":"Days after the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett inaccurately claimed on “The Breakfast Club” that both men who allegedly attempted to assassinate President Donald Trump were Republicans.\n\nAlleged attempted Trump assassin Ryan Routh, who is currently on trial, seems to be registered as an unaffiliated voter and reportedly voted in the Democratic primary in March 2024. Crockett claimed during a Friday appearance on the radio show that neither alleged assassin had voted for Democrats. (RELATED: Trump Shooter’s School Issues Statement To Correct Reporting)\n\n“[I]t looks like the two people that went after the president before he was the president had ties to the Republican Party. Like, they had not voted Democratic,” Crockett said. “They were registered as Republicans. Like, so let’s talk about it.”\n\nRouth also seems to have previously contributed to Democrats while living in Hawaii, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\nMoreover, one of Routh’s social media posts mirrored Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden’s repeated assertion that “democracy is on the ballot” during the 2024 election, according to reports.\n\nDeceased attempted Trump assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project through the ActBlue donation platform in January 2021, when Biden was inaugurated, according to campaign finance records. However, he was a registered Republican, a voter-registration record reveals, according to The New York Times.\n\nLittle is still known about Crooks, who was killed after attempting to assassinate Trump during a Butler, Pennsylvania rally on July 13, 2024.\n\nCrockett in May also smeared Republicans as fundamentally “violent” on “American Fever Dream,” while dismissing left-wing extremism.\n\n“They try to act like, ‘Oh, political violence, it’s the Democrats and it’s the liberals,’ and it’s like, actually, actually, actually — I mean, I’m not gon’ say that like a left-leaning person cannot be violent, ’cause that would be like crazy to say that somebody can’t be,” Crockett said. “But baby, baby, y’all got the white supremacists galore, okay? Like all of ’em. You got the Proud Boys, you got the neo-Nazis, you have people that literally should be classified as domestic terrorists, because a lot of times that is what they are doing — they’re engaging in domestic terrorism.”\n\n“And guess what? They all align with your side, including the KKK. So like, I mean, this is who aligns with that. So like, inherently in like who you are, y’all are violent. And most of your violence has to do with people that’s got a little bit of melanin. But nevertheless, like, y’all are a violent group,” she continued. “Like, you attract violent actors. And like, I’m sorry, I know they tried to make Black Lives Matter out to be the most violent — ‘Oh, what about Black Lives Matter?’ No, no, no. So that’s the thing — like, they try to pretend like that.”\n\nKirk was assassinated on Wednesday while speaking to a large crowd of students at Utah Valley University (UVU). Authorities found anti-fascist messages inscribed on the ammunition from the rifle they recovered near the assassination, according to Republican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox at a Friday press conference.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
