Carini pulled out 46 seconds into the match and told reporters after the fight that she had \"never felt a punch like this.\"The match sparked questions about the gender of Khelif, who last year was blocked from competing in the World Championships after failing an unspecified sex-verification test by the International Boxing Association (IBA). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubt on the validity on the test, which also disqualified Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting from competing in the 2023 World Championship. IBA has also been stripped as boxing's governing body by the IOC.Khelif claimed gold in the women's welterweight Olympic division on Friday, winning Algeria's first medal in women's boxing. Yu-ting won gold in the women's flyweight division on Saturday.The harassment lawsuit alleges an \"aggravated cyber-harassment\" against Khelif, according to a statement from the boxer's lawyer, Nabil Boudi, who was quoted by the Associated Press. Variety reported on Tuesday that the complaint was filed against X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, which means under French law that it was filed against unknown persons. Investigators at the Paris prosecutor's office will be open to determine who could be at fault in Khelif's complaint.Boudi told Variety that Trump would also be part of the investigation, saying, \"Trump tweeted, so whether or not he is named in our lawsuit, he will inevitably be looked into as part of the prosecution.\"Newsweek reached out to Boudi via email for comment Tuesday evening.The former president has made several comments about Khelif's gender identity since her fight with Carini. During a campaign rally on August 3, Trump told supporters, \"Now all you have to do is look at the boxers.\"\"This young girl from Italy, a champion boxer, she got hit so hard she didn't know what the hell hit her,\" Trump said of Carini.\"It's a person that transitioned,\" he added, referring to Khelif. \"He was a good male boxer. And (Carini) didn't even go down. He hit her with two jabs and she said, 'I'm out.'\"At a rally in Montana on Friday, Trump appeared to mock Khelif's victory, telling the crowd, \"And I'd like to congratulate the young woman who transitioned from a man into a boxer.\"\"You saw he [sic] won, she won the gold medal,\" Trump said, who went on to praise Carini as a \"beautiful Italian boxer\" who is \"a very good boxer, you know, against other women.\"\"It's crazy what they're doing. How crazy is it ... and she wants it,\" Trump added, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. \"She wants men to play in women sports.\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment as well on Tuesday.Variety also reported that author J.K. Rowling and billionaire and X owner Elon Musk were mentioned in the lawsuit. Rowling, best known for her Harry Potter books, has made controversial statements in the past about her views on transgender people, including several posts on X about Khelif's presence at the Olympics.Musk reacted to a post on X by American swimmer and conservative figure, Riley Gaines, on August 1, which read, \"Men don't belong in women's sports\" with the hashtag, #IStandWithAngelaCarini. The post included a photo of Khelif. Musk wrote in response to Gaines, \"Absolutely.\"Carini has said that she apologized to Khelif for the tumult that has swirled since their fight.\"All this controversy certainly made me sad, and I also felt sorry for my opponent, she had nothing to do with it and like me was only here to fight,\" the boxer told Italian publication Gazzetta dello Sport.Carini added that it was \"not intentional\" when she failed to shake Khelif's hand after choosing to quit their match, saying, \"I was angry, because my Games had already gone up in smoke.\"\"I have nothing against Khelif and on the contrary if I happened to meet her again I would give her a hug,\" Carini added.Khelif told reporters after winning gold on Friday, \"I'm fully qualified to take part in this competition. I'm a woman like any other woman. I was born as a woman, I live as a woman, and I am qualified.\"","summary":"The Algerian boxer has been at the center of controversy after false claims spread online regarding her gender identity.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-part-investigation-boxer-imane-khelifs-new-lawsuit-report-1938890","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2449418/donald-trump-part-investigation-imanekehliflawsuit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:43:33","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":254057432,"title":"Trump’s team begins to reduce the difference in ad spending in key states. From the Politics Department.","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.

After Democrats’ long-held edge, Team Trump starts to close the battleground ad spending gap By Ben Kamisar If you live in a swing state and are already sick of seeing presidential campaign ads, buckle up. You’re about to see a whole lot more, thanks in large part to a big uptick in spending on the Republican side. With Democrats holding a massive advantage on the airwaves throughout much of the year, Donald Trump’s campaign has started pouring serious money into battleground advertising for the first time since he emerged as the presumptive nominee after largely leaving that responsibility to allied outside groups. From June 3 through July 28, the Joe Biden-turned-Kamala Harris campaign spent almost $65 million on TV, radio and digital advertisements across six battleground states, according to the tracking firm AdImpact: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (That total does not include spending from its joint fundraising committees.) Over that same period of time, the Trump campaign spent less than $230,000. But over the last two weeks, a dramatic shift from the Trump campaign has helped close the gap. It has spent a total of $13 million in those key states, compared to $16.5 million from the Harris campaign. The increase from both camps comes after Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic standard-bearer and the conclusion of the Republican National Convention. The Democratic decline in spending that precipitated it came as Biden’s campaign was thrust into turmoil after his poor debate performance. A similar trend emerges when ad spending from outside groups supporting the campaigns is included, showing a major Democratic week-to-week edge that has been all but wiped out. And there’s much more to come, with groups previewing another massive flurry of ad spending as both sides seek to define the new Democratic ticket. Plus, the Trump and Harris campaigns have proven they’re able to raise money hand over fist, which they’ll be able to deploy across the country in what’s expected to be the most expensive presidential race ever. Democrats argue the advantage they held for months shouldn’t be discounted. And while it’s now Harris at the top of the ticket, much of the emphasis of the Biden-Harris administration’s accomplishments and the criticism of Trump still holds. But we’ve written before about how Republicans have cut into the Democrats’ fundraising edge, and these ad spending numbers show the fruits of that effort. Democrat Ruben Gallego leans into border security in battleground Senate race By Alex Tabet PHOENIX — TV ads showing candidates touring the U.S.-Mexico border have become a staple of Republican campaigns across the country. But this summer, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego got in on the action as his party tries to win voters’ trust in his battleground Arizona Senate race — and beyond. “Ruben Gallego has stood side by side with me. The only member of Congress that has come regularly to my border,” Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway said in the ad. “He is fighting for solutions. Better technology. More manpower.” It’s far from the only border security ad on Arizona’s airwaves. Gallego’s competitor, GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake, has been bashing him on the border, with one ad tying Gallego to Biden and Harris’ policies and featuring a 2017 clip of Gallego on the House floor referring to “Trump’s stupid, dumb border wall.” The back-and-forth on the issue reflects the central role the border is playing in many voters’ calculations, as well as Democrats’ realization that the public did not see their rhetoric or policies as up to the task of handling a growing number of migrants in recent years. Gallego’s early efforts to prove himself to voters on the issue are now reflected in other Democratic campaigns. One of the first TV ads Harris launched after taking over as the party’s presidential candidate focused on border security, though the issue did not feature in a year-plus of Biden’s broadcast TV advertising captured by the tracking firm AdImpact. The issue also illustrates Gallego’s efforts to redefine himself — and his opponent’s efforts to highlight his progressive past — as he tries to move from a deep-blue House district to statewide office in one of the nation’s most tightly divided battlegrounds. It’s why Gallego struck a different tone, though not an entirely different angle, when NBC News asked if he still believes Trump’s border wall initiative is “stupid” and “dumb.” “I think border walls are necessary in certain areas. Putting border walls in areas that you don’t need only costs more money and then also costs manpower,” Gallego said, arguing a full-fledged southern border wall is a performative waste of taxpayer dollars.

Tim Walz hit the stage at a labor union convention in southern California on Aug. 13, touting his teaching background and pro-worker message in his first solo appearance since joining the Democratic Party ticket last week. “The vice president and I, we know exactly who built this country. It was nurses, it was teachers, and it was state and local government employees that built this nation,” Walz said in a Los Angeles ballroom filled with thousands of members of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union. “People in this room built the middle class. That’s not just a saying, it’s a fact: when unions are strong, America is strong.” Since launching her campaign on July 21, Vice President Kamala Harris has scored endorsements from multiple labor unions. In addition to the 1.4-million-member AFSCME, Harris was also endorsed by the United Auto Workers (UAW), hospitality workers’ union UNITE HERE, and the AFL-CIO. The Teamsters Union, whose president spoke at this year’s Republican National Convention, has not made a presidential endorsement this cycle. Walz began his 5-state tour—taking him through Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York—in Harris’ home state of California. Walz headlined a private campaign fundraiser in Newport Beach on Aug. 13. In his AFSCME speech, Walz discussed being a “dues-paying member of my teachers’ union for years” and his efforts as governor of Minnesota to secure paid family and medical leave for workers. “We will stand together on the fundamental principle to collectively bargain for your own lives and your own jobs,” he said of himself and Harris. Walz championed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and criticized former President Donald Trump for expressing past support for “right to work” laws, which block unions from making contractual agreements with employers, including those that may compel employees to join. Trump, while speaking with the South Carolina Radio Network during his 2016 presidential campaign, said he had “great support” from union workers, but expressed “love” for the “right to work.” “It is better for the people. You are not paying the big fees to the unions,” Trump said. When Reps. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) and Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced the National Right to Work Act, the Trump administration affirmed its support for “right to work” laws. “The president believes in the right to work. He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what’s in the best interest for job creators,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters during a Feb. 3, 2017, press conference. California has not voted for a Republican president since George H.W. Bush in 1988. The GOP has often turned to the state as an example of the downstream effects of liberal policies—pointing to its high taxes, homelessness crisis, and rising housing costs. In his final remarks, Walz said the Democratic Party faces a tough race heading into November. “You don’t hope to win. You plan, prepare, and work to win.”","summary":"The Minnesota governor leaned on his years paying union dues as a school teacher and criticized the former president for supporting 'right to work' laws.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/walz-kicks-off-5-state-campaign-tour-in-union-convention-speech-5705237","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/12/id5704383-GettyImages-2165605547-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:29:56","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.158},{"id":254057702,"title":"Nikki Haley has blunt message for Trump, GOP as Kamala Harris gains momentum: 'Quit whining'","text":"Former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley weighed in on the state of the 2024 race Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris gains momentum in key battleground states ahead of the November election. Haley told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier on \"Special Report\" Republicans and former President Trump should focus on policy and messaging instead of crowd sizes at rallies, Harris' race, or attacks on her intellect. \"You can't win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they're smart,\" she said. \"It's not about her. It's about the American people. Talk to them and let them know you need their vote.\" The former South Carolina governor also encouraged Republicans to \"quit whining\" about Harris and \"quit complaining\" that she hasn’t given a formal sit-down interview since replacing President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. \"We knew it was going to be her. She's not going to give an interview. They're going to hold out as long as they can. That's their right. They can do it. That doesn't mean we can't talk about what she believes in. And we should be getting out there and doing that,\" said Haley. \"I take her at her word that she thinks that illegal immigrants should be able to vote and be given driver's licenses.

She told reporters on the tarmac in Detroit last week that she’s asked her team to schedule her first interview since becoming the Democratic nominee before the end of the month. Haley told Baier that Republicans should focus on courting suburban women, independents, moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats. \"The target issues are the economy, the fact that Kamala wants to raise taxes, the fact that she's taking money from those that didn't go to college and has given it to those that did, the fact that when Afghanistan fell, the fact that when they lifted sanctions on Iran, the fact that when they, you know, actually said that they would help Israel and then pulled back, where was Kamala when that happened?

A campaign official told Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy that Harris will not push the subject of single-payer or \"Medicare-for-all\" this go around, as she seeks her first term as commander-in-chief. In 2019, Fox News spoke to Harris in the hallways of Capitol Hill, asking about her plans for providing health care. \"How important is it to your health care plan to get rid of private insurance companies? Because there is some confusion about that,\" Doocy asked Harris on Jan. 30, 2019. WHAT THE LATEST POLLS IN THREE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES SHOW IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN \"I’m glad you asked. Yeah. So, the bottom line and the most important is that everyone have access to health care,\" Harris said. \"That is the goal. That is the purpose for me supporting the policy of ‘Medicare-for-all.’ \"If Congress votes in a way that reflects the values and desires of the American people, then Congress will vote for a policy that gives everyone access to health care,\" she later said. On July 29, 2019, Harris published a piece on her campaign website about her plan to provide \"Medicare-for-all.\" BERNIE SANDERS DISAGREES, BUT TRUMP KEEPS INSISTING HARRIS IS MORE LIBERAL THAN THE VERMONT SENATOR She wrote, \"There is perhaps no more complicated or more personal issue for Americans than health care.\" Harris also wrote that the American health care system is \"a patchwork of plans, providers and costs\" that frustrates people and leaves them powerless against the insurance companies in charge. Her proposed solution was to provide \"Medicare-for-all\" because \"Medicare works\" and \"it’s popular.\" \"'Medicare-for-all' will cover all medically necessary services, including emergency room visits, doctor visits, vision, dental, hearing aids, mental health, and substance-use disorder treatment, and comprehensive reproductive health care services,\" Harris wrote. \"It will also allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.\" But her plan in July was different from what she proposed in January that year, because it would allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans to their clients. In an interview with The Hill in October 2019, Harris said she knew she would be called \"a flip-flopper\" after she backed away from her initial support of \"Medicare-for-all,\" and developed her own health care plan. Her plan in January 2019 called on eliminating private insurance. Then in July 2019, she chose to include a role for private insurance companies to privately administer Medicare plans, though under strict rules. Even in 2017, Harris backed a single-payer plan proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. KAMALA HARRIS BACK SANDERS' SINGLE-PAYER PLAN THAT PROBABLY COSTS TRILLIONS Harris told constituents at a town hall in Oakland on Aug. 30, 2017, that she planned to co-sponsor Sanders’ forthcoming \"Medicare-for-all\" bill, explaining that it was \"just the right thing to do.\" SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE: WHAT IS IT? \"It’s not just about what is morally and ethically right. It also makes sense from a fiscal standpoint,\" Harris said at the time. Harris had previously stated that she supported the single-payer system as a \"concept,\" but that lawmakers needed to \"work out the details.\" Her announcement to co-sponsor Sanders’ bill was the first time she had publicly supported a single-payer plan. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Under this European-style health care system, the government is solely responsible for covering health care costs. Sanders rolled out an earlier version of his proposal during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2016. The plan was first estimated to cost $13.8 trillion over the first 10 years, but that ballooned to $32 trillion and required an average annual tax increase of $24,000 per household.

Burr did not vote to convict Trump after the first impeachment. Neither impeachment resulted in conviction in the Senate, where a two-thirds supermajority vote is required to convict.On Monday, Spectrum News reported that Burr said during an interview in July that he intends to vote for Trump this year despite his vote in 2021, which he argued was not intended as \"a disqualifier as to whether you can serve\" but instead a protest of Trump's decision to abandon former Vice President Mike Pence at the Capitol while rioters chanted out their desire to \"hang\" him.\"My vote on the president wasn't on anything the House presented,\" Burr told the outlet. \"It was on the fact that I thought that the president leaving the vice president, without surging to Capitol Hill a protective detail, to take a vice president with a nuclear football, and to make him secure was a breach of office.\"Burr went on to say that while \"maybe someone will have a hard time squaring\" his support for Trump with finding him guilty of incitement to insurrection, he does not \"have a hard time squaring with it\" because he \"firmly understood why [he] voted for impeachment.\"\"And l like I said, that's not a disqualifier as to whether you can serve,\" Burr added. \"It's a bad choice I thought a president made one time.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the offices of Trump and Pence via email on Tuesday evening.Pence, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination last year, has repeatedly said that he will not be backing his former running mate in this year's election, pointing out \"profound differences\" between himself and Trump \"on a range of issues\" during a Fox News interview earlier this year.Trump turned on Pence following his refusal to attempt to block the certification of Biden's 2020 win, while also accusing the former vice president of being \"not a very good person\" and \"going to the Dark Side\" after Pence denounced him for putting \"himself over the Constitution.\"Former Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who became another frequent target of Trump's rage after certifying Biden's Arizona victory, announced in a social media post that he would be putting \"differences aside\" by endorsing both Trump and pro-Trump U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake on Tuesday.A small but significant number of former Republican lawmakers have recently committed to endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, over Trump in this year's election.","summary":"Seven Republican U.S. senators voted to convict Trump on charges of incitement of insurrection in January 2021.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-endorsed-republican-who-voted-convict-him-1938859","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2449407/republican-voted-convict-impeachment-endorses-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:24:42","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":254057338,"title":"Kamala Harris running ads with fake news headlines – Axios","text":"US Vice President Kamala Harris has been using Google search advertisements that link to real news articles from legitimate sources, but with the headlines and descriptions altered to paint the Democratic presidential candidate in a more favorable way, according to an Axios report. The Harris campaign has been running such ads linking to stories by “nearly a dozen” news outlets, including CNN, AP, CBS, NPR, The Guardian, USA Today and others since at least August 3, Axios reported on Tuesday. The ads apparently mimic real news results “closely enough” that they can potentially mislead users. Axios wrote that such ads are a “common practice,” but acknowledged that according to Google’s ad transparency center, Harris’ rival Donald Trump is not running these types of misleading ads. Some of the outlets claimed they were blindsided and “unaware” that their brands were being featured this way, according to Axios. A spokesperson for The Guardian said the company will be “reaching out to Google for more information about this practice.” Meanwhile, Google has insisted that the practice does not violate its rules, claiming that since the ads are labeled as “sponsored,” they are “easily distinguishable” from legitimate search results. However, the tech giant admitted that due to an alleged “technical glitch” in Google’s Ad Library, some of the ads “appeared” to lack the necessary disclosures, Axios wrote.

At one point in the rambling discussion, the Republican presidential nominee, 78, was discussing a Time Magazine cover story about his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, when he weirdly compared the Democrat to his wife, Melania. He accused Harris, 59, of getting a ‘free ride’ from the press as she continues to forego media interviews – when he off-handedly remarked that Harris bears a resemblance to his wife. ‘But I saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today, she looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live,’ Trump said. ‘It was a drawing. And actually, she looked very much like a great first lady: Melania.’ He went on to mispronounce the vice president’s name, repeatedly referring to her as ‘Camilla.’ ‘She didn’t look like Camilla,’ Trump said. ‘That’s right. ‘But of course, she’s a beautiful woman. So we’ll leave it at that.’ Americans across the country watched the exchange happen live – and many said on social media they found Trump’s comments about the vice president off-putting. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa, however, did not seem surprised by the former president’s remarks. ‘I KNEW IT. His brain is short-circuiting because she is attractive AND formidable,’ she posted on X. ‘Lol he is toast.’ She said the former president ‘recognizes and is slightly scared of – and in a weird way, craves the approval of – strong intelligent women,’ saying there are ‘some mommy issues going on there.’ Rangappa also claimed that Trump equates attractive women with being ‘dumb or weak’ so he can ‘sexualize and exploit and dismiss.’ Trump has been accused of having ‘mommy issues’ in the past, with Former President Barack Obama saying at his second annual Obama Foundation summit in 2018 that progress is hindered in the US because ‘we are still confused, blind, shrouded with hate, anger, racism [and] mommy issues.’ Many in attendance and in the media took that as a swipe at then-President Trump as it came just a few months after Politico Magazine published an article entitled ‘Donald Trump’s Mommy Issues.’ In the article, author Peter Lovenheim argues that his apparent failure to bond with his mother may have played a role in Trump’s personal and professional life. He notes that Trump’s mother, Mary Anne Trump, sustained a life-threatening illness when the former president was just a toddler. With his mother incapacitated with the illness and his father, Frederick Trump, never home as he focused on building his real estate empire, Lovenheim posits that Trump never successfully bonded with a primary caregiver as a child. He said such an issue can result in two common psychological issues: either an individual develops ‘attachment anxiety, leading them as adults to crave intimacy, but having difficulty seeking reassurance – or they have attachment avoidance, where as adults, they generally distrust others and convince themselves they don’t need close relationships.’ Lovenheim argued at the time that Trump was displaying signs of having attachment avoidance, pointing to what he described as the former president’s sense of self-reliance and inability to acknowledge self-doubt; his boasting of sexual encounters and the fact that he has had multiple marriages and very few close friends. The author also cited Trump’s many flattering comments over the years about his mother – calling her ‘fantastic,’ ‘tremendous,’ ‘very warm’ and ‘very loving – but providing a lack of early childhood memories to support those sentiments.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8216;mommy issues&#8217; were on full display in his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ex-FBI agent claims Trump&#8217;s unresolved issues with his mother surfaced during interview with Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/ex-fbi-agent-claims-trumps-unresolved-issues-with-his-mother-surfaced-during-interview-with-musk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trumps-mommy-issues-came-out-in-Musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:16:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.033},{"id":254057210,"title":"Haley criticizes Trump campaign as she refuses to commit to campaigning for former rival","text":"Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley criticized the Trump campaign’s approach to defeating Vice President Kamala Harris and refused to commit to campaigning for her former Republican rival. In an interview on Fox News’s Special Report with Bret Baier, Haley scathingly critiqued former President Donald Trump’s campaign, claiming several flaws. When pressed by Baier as to whether she would commit to campaigning for Trump, given she has endorsed him, Haley dodged the question. “I mean, he is welcome to call. I have talked to him. He is welcome to do that,” she said when asked if she would accept Trump’s request to campaign for him if asked. “They are doing what they think is best. And that is his right, to run the campaign he wants to run. He has chosen that.” “All I’m saying is I want to see them focus and I want to see them win,” Haley continued. “We have too much at stake. We have to win this election. And I genuinely hope that he will go out to the 20% of people that are going to decide this election and say, ‘You know what? I need your vote, and I’m going to fight hard to do it, and these are the issues I’m going to fight on.'” She criticized the campaign on multiple fronts, repeating complaints from other Republicans that Trump shouldn’t attack Harris based on her racial identity and other insults. “The campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes,” she said. “It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she is dumb. It’s not — you can’t win on those things. The American people are smart. Treat them like they are smart.” “The Republican Party, Donald Trump, people here at Fox, quit complaining that she is not giving an interview; you don’t need an interview from Kamala Harris,” Haley added at another point. “I take her at her word that she wants to raise taxes for households over $100,000. … Take her at her word.” Haley also took several other swipes at Trump, beginning the interview by saying that she ran because she didn’t believe Trump was the best candidate but doesn’t want Harris to be president and so wants Trump to win. The former South Carolina governor also said she doesn’t want to serve in a second Trump administration and would refuse the offer if Trump gave one. “No, I’m not interested in serving in the administration. I said that on the campaign. This was never about a position for me. This was never about something else. I ran because I love this country so much,” Haley said. “It was really in that vein that I ran. But now it’s in that vein as a voter that I want to see Donald Trump win. Because we can’t afford to have a President Kamala Harris.” Haley was the last major Republican to run against Trump, becoming his foremost rival after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) dropped out. She lost nearly every primary before dropping out of the race in March and endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention in July.","summary":"Former U.N.

Kamala Harris is now leading Donald Trump in some national polling averages as well as in some swing-state polls. True, her lead is within the margin of error in most cases, but that’s an improvement from where the Democrats were before Joe Biden dropped out of the running and orchestrated instantaneous unification around his No. 2. I don’t think I’m overstating things. Her current lead, the millions of dollars she’s bringing in, the thousands of volunteers who are signing up to help, the big big mo’ – I think all of it comes directly from her campaign’s decision not to give the press corps too much access too fast. I think that decision comes directly from the fact that Harris saw firsthand what the press corps did to Joe Biden’s campaign. Some members of the press corps have noticed how well Harris is doing without them, and apparently, it doesn’t sit right. Here’s Chris Cillizza with a representative sampling. The former Post writer said the vice president has been “almost entirely” ignoring the media since she launched her campaign, and that’s bad, he said. It “bypasses the argument that the media is a critical part of our political system and any candidate who wants to be president -- whether they are winning or losing -- should be regularly subjected to scrutiny from the press.” Even if I agreed that candidates who want to be president should be regularly subjected to media scrutiny, I don’t think this press corps, as it is currently organized, is able to. There are exceptions, of course, but this press corps is generally not equipped to scrutinize candidates on matters of fact and substance. I say this because this press corps has conspicuously traded matters of fact and substance for vibes. It didn’t matter what Joe Biden did – pull the country out of a pandemic, dodge a recession, tame inflation, grow jobs, grow wages, enforce anti-monopoly laws, revive every single one of the so-called “left behind” counties that voted for Trump in 2016 because of “economic anxiety” – it didn’t matter what he did. The press corps decided nothing was more important than his age, and lo! 2024 became an election about vibes and vibes ended his candidacy. Vibes are this press corps’ forte, not fact and substance. If fact and substance were its strength, there would have been a different reaction to The Disaster Debate during which Biden talked about policy and issues while Trump didn’t bother. Trump was incoherent and false, but he came off as confident and strong, and he came off as such, because the press corps’ forte isn’t fact and substance. If fact and substance were important, there would also have been a different reaction to Biden’s NATO press conference last month. He did it after the Disaster Debate to show he still had what it takes. He talked for an hour about foreign affairs, international laws and war. But this press corps didn’t hear any of that after Biden said “Vice President Trump” by mistake. There’s no grace for the old in Washington, nor is there interest in anything but vibes in the Washington press corps. There was a time when liberals and Democrats would have nodded in agreement with Chris Cillizza on the merit of candidates being regularly subjected to scrutiny. But after this press corps made a fetish of Biden’s age, I don’t see any more room for the benefit of the doubt – and there’s no going back. This press corps made the election about vibes and it’s going to remain an election about vibes, and if those vibes now grind against the instincts of this press corps, tough shit. You reap what you sow. In the future, we might look back and see the most important difference between the Biden and Harris campaigns is their level of trust in the press corps. The president believed voters would reward him for the substantial things he has done, and he trusted – indeed, he depended on – the press corps to inform voters, as it’s supposed to. But where he saw fact and substance, the press corps saw only vibes. And in depending on the press corps to get his message across to voters, Biden effectively handed over power that was rightfully his. He allowed the press corps to be the principal arbiters of his reality, rather than reserving that right for himself. You could say Biden was waiting for power to be given to him and he suffered gravely for it. By contrast, the Harris campaign is not letting the press corps wedge itself between her and voters. She is not allowing the news media to mediate her message. In effect, she’s preventing the press corps from speaking for her and, as a consequence, she’s preventing it from exercising a de facto veto on her speech. In that, she is taking power – defining her campaign as well as Trump’s. She is turning the narrative about Biden’s age (81) back against Trump’s (78), such that whatever he says in self-defense is seen as proof of the allegations against him. This decision leaves the press corps on the outside looking in. She’s sustaining a conversation with voters directly, on her own terms, and she’s doing well as a direct consequence of that decision. But being on the outside looking in feels bad to people who crave attention. They have incentive to turn attention back to where they think it belongs. That’s why some are busy manufacturing a phony moral standard by which to scam Harris into playing by their rules. That phony moral standard goes something like this, courtesy today of Chris Cillizza: “It’s been 23 days since Joe Biden ended his candidacy. It’s been seven days since Kamala Harris was formally named the Democratic presidential nominee. She has yet to sit for an interview with any media outlet. And she has answered less than five total questions from the press.” He’s being coy but, in essence, he’s saying that Harris is violating some kind of taboo, that she’s doing something wrong, or worse, that she’s hiding something of great importance from voters. This, of course, is favorable to her opponents, but let’s be clear: she’s violating nothing. There are no rules. There is no lawbook declaring that candidates shall talk to reporters. There is a playbook, if that’s what you mean, but not a lawbook. The vice president could go the whole time without talking to one reporter and she would not have done anything morally wrong. This is really important and I will repeat myself till I burst. This is a democracy. Harris is obliged to talk to Americans. That’s the end of her moral and democratic obligation. She’s not obliged to talk to the press corps, as if it were a constituency. If she stopped talking to voters, well, that would be disqualifying. Obviously, that’s far from the case. This is not to say she shouldn’t, but that’s a different question, isn’t it? If Harris decides to talk to the press corps about matters of fact and substance relevant to her, it will be her decision made out of concern for tactics and strategy for her campaign. Reporters like Cillizza have a bad habit of presenting themselves to voters as if they operated in their interest, and we know, after watching reporters make a fetish of Biden’s age, that nothing could be further from the truth. We should not only stop tolerating this bad habit. We should be hostile towards it. The most powerful thing Harris has done – a game changing decision, if you want to call it that – was to learn from Biden’s fatal error. He tried to meet the press corps’ phony moral standard, only to have it move around, beyond his reach, thus surrendering his rightful power to define himself and his campaign. In the end, his dependence on the press corps made it so he had to ask for permission to campaign. Harris isn’t asking.","summary":"The first thing you need to know about the vice president’s approach to the Washington press corps is look how well she’s doing as a result.

But “The Daily Show” isn’t most shows. “[Election years] are the seasons we get most excited about,” Desi Lydic, who is hosting this upcoming week starting on Tuesday night, told TheWrap. “We’re really clicked in and prepared to turn at a moment’s notice, and shift the story to accommodate for the day’s news. That’s kind of what we’re built for.” Earlier this summer, the team was prepared for “the world’s most terrifying and also perhaps boring reboot” in another face-off between former President Donald Trump and sitting President Joe Biden. But between the assassination attempt on Trump on July 13, and Biden stepping down as the primary Democratic candidate to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, any level of predictability has been thrown out the window. Lydic, who was hired on “The Daily Show” in 2015, learned the “hard” way that it’s a fool’s errand to guess the results of any election. “We were all so sure of what the outcome was going to be [in 2016], and I think most of us were incredibly shocked on Election Night,” Lydic said. “You cannot predict what’s going to happen. Polls are one thing, but the American people will speak and we just have to wait and see.” As unpredictable as this election season may be, “The Daily Show” found calm waters after some turmoil in years past. Toward the end of 2022, Trevor Noah shocked the comedy community when he announced he was stepping down from hosting “The Daily Show” to focus on his standup career and touring. That decision led to last year’s history-making season of the series, which employed a revolving door of guest hosts rather than immediately naming Noah’s successor. “It was definitely an adjustment,” Lydic said, noting that it was “a little nerve-wracking” to start 2023’s season. “It was very much an experiment to try out having on different voices every week, like how is that going to work? How are we going to write to that? How are we going to produce to that? And how can we come in and help support them as correspondents?” As stressful as it may have been, that season allowed Lydic to work with some of her comedic heroes, such as Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, whom she described as “nothing but loving and supportive and cool,” as well as Marlon Wayans. Lydic credited Jennifer Flanz, who has been the showrunner of the Comedy Central staple since 2013, for that stability as well as the “incredible” team of nearly 200 people on staff. She praised Flanz and the series’ writers for “seamlessly” writing for a new voice every week. “[It’s] a real testament to how good everyone is here at their jobs and how hard everyone works,” Lydic said. But on a larger scale, it prepared the “Daily Show” team for the current form of the show. Ever since Jon Stewart returned as a host and executive producer earlier this year, the late night show has blended its old format with the new. While Stewart hosts on Mondays, correspondents Lydic, Michael Kosta, Ronny Chieng and Jordan Klepper take turns each week hosting Tuesdays through Thursdays. These alternating hosting duties even apply to the show’s live events, such as its coverage of the upcoming DNC the week of Aug. 19. While the news team will be hosting from Chicago Monday through Wednesday, Stewart will host live on Thursday night. It’s a format change that’s paid off. This year, “The Daily Show” is nominated for seven Emmy awards, including Outstanding Talk Series. Additionally, Lydic specifically is nominated for Outstanding Performer In A Short Form Comedy Or Drama Series for her segment, “Desi Lydic Foxsplains.” “I always wanted to get that opportunity, but I never thought that I would ever have the chance to sit at the desk,” Lydic said. That dream has now repeatedly become a reality as this week marks Lydic’s third time hosting. The most difficult element of hosting has been the authenticity the role requires. Lydic explained that when she acts as a correspondent, she’s portraying a “very arch” version of a specific perspective. “When you’re sitting at the desk, that’s a really vulnerable exercise. We are ourselves at the desk, and it’s our point of view. We get to form a take on something, and we get to have a hand in shaping the show and inviting on guests,” Lydic said. “It’s such an incredible challenge, and it’s been an absolute gift.” Hosting a late night show is a daunting job for anyone. “No one hands you a manual. You don’t know how to do it until you just jump in,” Lydic said. But as she and her co-hosts have been navigating these new waters, Lydic is happy to have a team behind her that is “the best in the business” as well as a “mentor” in Jon Stewart. “[Stewart has] been incredibly generous and supportive,” Lydic said. “Mostly just watching him in action and absorbing all of it, it’s a gift.” Stewart originally signed back onto “The Daily Show” as a co-host through the 2024 election, as well as an executive producer through 2025 with the option to renew his commitment to the show. As for whether or not Stewart will continue his stint past the election, that remains unclear. “I don’t know what the ultimate plan will be. It’s above my pay grade at this point. But we’re all operating right now from a place of ‘This is a show. This is what the show looks like,’” Lydic said. For now, Lydic is having a “great time” passing the hosting baton around with Stewart at the helm. “I’ll watch Ronny and learn something in the way that he tackles the desk. Same thing with Jordan and Costa. We really learn from each other, and we’re sending stories to one another. We’ve got each other’s backs,” Lydic said. “Then we’re all collectively watching Jon on Mondays. It’s the ultimate master class. So we’re enjoying this era. We’re having the best time, and we’ll see what happens.” This marks Lydic’s ninth year at “The Daily Show.” When asked if she was planning to continue on the show or if she wants to host her own project one day, the comedic actor said that she’s “open to everything.” “I waited tables for 10 years and was trying to book small guest star gigs on shows for a long time. So it is not lost on me what a privilege it is to be on a show for nearly a decade now,” Lydic said. “I’m having the time of my life, and I’m excited to see what’s to come.”","summary":"The Emmy-nominated senior correspondent tells TheWrap about collaborating with the Comedy Central show's other co-hosts, and Jon Stewart's involvement after Election Night\n\n\nThe post Desi Lydic Says &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; Is Built for These Crazy Political Times appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/the-daily-show-desi-lydic-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/desi-lydic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:02:59","author":"Kayla Cobb","authors":["Kayla Cobb"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.034},{"id":254057064,"title":"Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has quickly established himself since being picked as Kamala Harris's running mate last week","text":"Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has quickly established himself since being picked as Kamala Harris's running mate last week | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

The NLRB said it would look into the charges, which are a request for the agency to investigate. UAW President Shawn Fain, whose union has endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris, said in a statement that Trump is anti-labor. “Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly,” Fain said. Brian Hughes, a senior advisor with the Trump campaign, called the allegations “frivolous” and a “shameless political stunt” designed to erode Trump’s strong support among American workers. The NLRB said it would investigate the complaints, one filed against the Trump campaign and the other naming Tesla Inc., the electric vehicle, battery and solar panel manufacturer based in Austin, Texas, and led by Musk. The charges stem from statements made by Trump Monday night during a conversation between the two men on X, the social media platform Musk now owns. The former president spent much of the discussion that lasted more than two hours focused on his recent assassination attempt, illegal immigration and plans to cut government regulations. But during a discussion about government spending, Trump praised Musk for firing workers who went on strike. The UAW contends this could intimidate workers for the Trump campaign or at Tesla who might want to join a union. “You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk. “I look at what you do. You walk in and say, ‘You want to quit?’ I won’t mention the name of the company but they go on strike and you say, ’That’s OK. You’re all gone.'” Musk said, “Yeah,” and laughed while Trump was talking. It wasn’t clear what employees Trump was referring to. In June, eight former workers at SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, sued the company and Musk, alleging he ordered them fired after they challenged what they called rampant sexual harassment and a hostile “Animal House”-style work environment at the company. In addition, the NLRB determined that a 2018 Twitter post by Musk unlawfully threatened Tesla employees with the loss of stock options if they decided to be represented by a union. Three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld that decision, as well as a related NLRB order that Tesla rehire a fired employee, with back pay. But the full 5th Circuit later threw out that decision and voted to hear the matter again. Sanjukta Paul, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the UAW charges have real substance because the comments from Trump and Musk could “chill” efforts by workers to act collectively, including union organizing, or just getting together to improve working conditions. “You’re approvingly describing, you’re wholeheartedly commending the blatant violation of our main federal labor statute,” she said. “It would constitute interference with protected rights.” Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues, said the UAW’s move “puts the spotlight on Trump and attempts to put him on the defensive in terms of his attitude and demeanor toward unions.” He added that the union is watching Musk’s comments because it has targeted Tesla’s U.S. factories for organizing drives.","summary":"UAW President Shawn Fain, whose union has endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris, said in a statement that Trump is anti-labor.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/13/trump-praised-elon-musk-firing-works-labor-uaw-kamala-harris/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1245631304-e1723593071949.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:01:38","author":"The Associated Press,Tom Krisher","authors":["The Associated Press","Tom Krisher"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":254057000,"title":"Harris to target price gouging in first policy speech","text":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first policy-centered speech as Democratic presidential candidate on Friday, taking aim at price gouging, in a sign her whirlwind campaign could rattle big companies and corporate executives. Harris will travel to Raleigh, in North Carolina, a state Democrats hope to flip this election, to outline her plan “to lower costs for middle-class families and take on corporate price-gouging,” her campaign said today. Harris canceled an event in North Carolina last week because of Tropical Storm Debby. Focusing her first major policy speech on the economy, and locating it in North Carolina shows how her campaign has revived Democrats’ hopes of flipping a state they have only won twice in the last half-century. With less than three months before the Nov. 5 election when she takes on Republican Donald Trump, Harris has drawn new enthusiasm and dollars to the ticket after President Joe Biden stepped aside, and seen polls swing in her favor in some states. Her campaign sees states like Pennsylvania as a must-win, but North Carolina is more of a reach. Biden lost the state to Trump by a 1.3% margin – just 74,000 votes, but his prospects there were dim before he stepped down on July 21. TARGETING CORPORATE GREED Harris’s speech will be closely watched to see how her style or substance differs from Biden, whose economic policies received low marks from voters angry about the cost of housing, medicine, groceries and gasoline. On Saturday, Harris announced her support for eliminating taxes on tips, a position similar to Trump’s. Harris will hold a White House event with Biden on Thursday that is expected to focus on healthcare costs. Biden has blamed corporate greed for still-elevated prices, accusing companies of boosting profits by shrinking portion sizes and by failing to pass on falling costs to consumers. Big consumer goods companies have hiked prices in recent quarters, and food prices have risen 25% between 2019 and 2023. Harris policed “corporate greed and price gouging” when she was California’s attorney general from 2011 through 2016, challenging pharmaceutical, oil, electronics and cosmetics companies, a campaign official said. Harris “knows costs are too high and will make tackling inflation a ‘Day One’ priority,” added the official who declined to be identified speaking about the event beforehand. The approach marks a striking difference from Trump, who has argued that loosening regulations on industries from finance to energy will lower costs and spur growth. Nationally, Harris was ahead of Trump by five percentage points, 42% to 37%, in an Ipsos poll published on Thursday, widening her lead from a July 22-23 Reuters/Ipsos survey.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first policy-centered speech as Democratic presidential candidate on Friday, taking aim at price gouging, in a sign her whirlwind campaign could rattle big companies and corporate executives.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/13/breaking-news/harris-to-target-price-gouging-in-first-policy-speech/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_20240813_brk_kha01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 00:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.514},{"id":254056510,"title":"Auto workers union seeks NLRB investigation of Trump and Musk comments about firing striking workers","text":"By TOM KRISHER, AP Auto Writer DETROIT (AP) — The United Auto Workers union has filed unfair labor practice charges against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the two discussed on social media about Musk supposedly firing striking workers.

The former president spent much of the discussion that lasted more than two hours focused on his recent assassination attempt, illegal immigration and plans to cut government regulations. But during a discussion about government spending, Trump praised Musk for firing workers who went on strike. The UAW contends this could intimidate workers for the Trump campaign or at Tesla who might want to join a union. “You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk. “I look at what you do.

Tim Walz, VP Kamala Harris’ running mate, introduces himself to donors in Newport Beach","text":"In a speech peppered with Midwest jokes and self-deprecating quips, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz gave an introduction of sorts to friendly voters in Orange County on Tuesday, Aug. 13. Walz, who was named Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate just last week, headlined a fundraiser in Newport Beach, one of his first solo events since joining the ticket. Standing before a large ballroom at the Balboa Bay Resort, a waterfront hotel in Newport Beach, Walz ran through his resume: governor, congressman, educator, coach — “We won the damn state championship,” he reminded a cheering audience. He ran through his platform — supporting gun ownership when balanced with certain regulations, paid family leave and clean air regulations. “They keep talking about these are radical things, and I’m like, go ahead and label me whatever you want because I’ll damn sure guarantee you 80% of people in Minnesota and across the country want those things,” said Walz to applause. He sought to endear himself to a campaign-estimated 200 people, many who paid between $1,000 and $100,000 for tickets to hear him speak for about 30 minutes on a warm weekday. Responding to being asked whether he was surprised to be named the vice presidential contender, Walz joked, “I couldn’t be more surprised if I woke up with my head stapled to the carpet.” “I’m surprised,” he said, “but I’m also encouraged. Not about me because this isn’t my story. This is an American story.” Introductions and some jabs at their GOP opponents aside, Walz kept the conversation largely focused on Harris, his running mate. “You know better than anybody in this state what we’ve got in the vice president,” Walz said. “She’s found her voice.” “We’ve got 84 days to take this country in the direction we know is true to our values, the promise of America,” Walz said. “The idea for my daughter, for my son, for countless young people across this country to wake up on the 85th day, to know that we have Madam President Kamala Harris.” Walz also noted his daughter, Hope, was in attendance at the Orange County event, drawing large cheers. He briefly shared his family’s own deeply personal story about using in vitro fertilization treatments – a procedure that involves retrieving a woman’s eggs and combining them in a lab dish with sperm to create a fertilized embryo that is transferred into the woman’s uterus in hopes of creating a pregnancy – that contributed in the birth of his daughter. Making a seeming jab at past comments from Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Walz said, “If it’s your choice not to have children, that’s a choice you need to make and celebrate.” Vance has drawn scrutiny for past comments he’s made about women without biological children, including Harris. While Tuesday’s event was a fundraiser, meaning Walz could expect to be well-received, his jokes seemingly landed with the crowd. He often elicited laughter and cheers. “I’ve never seen so much enthusiasm in all the years I’ve been doing this,” said attorney Wylie Aitken, one of the hosts of Tuesday’s fundraiser. “It’s amazing that when everybody was kind of down and out and feeling, legitimately, concern with (President Joe) Biden, etc., then suddenly to have this reversal and to see this incredible enthusiasm that’s energized everyone.” Aitken’s been involved in local Democratic politics for a long time and is impressed by what he said is the enthusiasm Harris and Walz have brought to the Democratic ticket. “It’s a historic moment, not just for democracy, but I think we have our best shot at putting a woman in the White House, and that’s going to be fantastic,” Aitken said. Multiple California Democratic House members were at the fundraiser, including Reps. Nanette Barragán of South Gate, Mike Levin of San Juan Capistrano and Katie Porter of Irvine. “I was excited and energized before, and I continue to be,” said Levin, who noted that he appreciates Walz’s background as a former House member from a competitive district. “I think Tim Walz will do a great job as the vice presidential nominee.” Levin was an early Democratic House member who called on Biden to set aside his re-election bid, even telling the president that directly during a call. As Walz stood behind him greeting those who had come out to see him, Levin said, “I want to win the election in November and defeat Donald Trump. Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz give us a great chance to do just that.” Before speaking at Tuesday’s fundraiser — where he had four American flags behind him and a bar and charcuterie station for attendees at the back of the room — Walz addressed a crowd of more than 4,000 union workers in Downtown Los Angeles earlier. “Just to be clear, the vice president and I, we know exactly who built this country — It was nurses, it was teachers, and it was state and local government employees that built this nation,” Walz said there. “And it’s not just a saying, it’s a fact: When unions are strong, America is strong.” Former President Trump visited Newport Beach for a fundraiser of his own in June. It’s one of places in the U.S. that have raised the most money for the former president this election cycle: His campaign committee has brought in, so far, $770,000 in the 92660 and 92663 ZIP codes; the Biden-Harris campaign committee has raised a little over $145,000, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Staff writers Clara Harter and Hanna Kang and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"With self-deprecating jokes and some jabs at GOP opponents, Walz promoted Harris and the Democratic ticket in Orange County.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/13/gov-tim-walz-vp-kamala-harris-running-mate-introduces-himself-to-donors-in-newport-beach/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LDN-L-WALZ-LA-0814-DC-7-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 23:39:42","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":254055542,"title":"Letters: Harris vs. Trump | Secretive process | Democracy on ballot | Big lie? | Against fascism","text":"As Harris ascends, Trump stumbles Now that Joe Biden has bowed out of the race, Democrats have newfound energy. Kamala Harris should get a bump in the polls when she showcases her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention. Recent polls show the race is now a toss-up, whereas only a few weeks ago, Donald Trump was significantly ahead. And Trump has made one blunder after another. He recently questioned the fact that Harris was Black, saying if she was Indian, she couldn’t also be Black. Apparently, he never heard of the word “biracial.” In his recent interview with a group of Black journalists that went viral, he was asked why he keeps repeating obvious lies that neither Nikki Haley nor Barack Obama were born in America. He ducked the question and went on a rant that he was the best president for Blacks since Lincoln.

As a CSAA policyholder who just received a Notice of Cancellation of Insurance, I avidly read Mike Zukerman’s opinion piece. The cancellation is due to my property’s wildfire risk score of 4 out of 30 (zero being no risk), but the CSAA notice says that “the risk score is not based solely on the wildfire risk score, but is a combination of factors, which may be weighed differently under certain circumstances unique to an individual property.” CSAA has refused to provide my risk assessment report or an explanation of the “combination of factors.” CSAA’s obfuscation, refusal to provide critical information and short timeline to get another policy in place is only inflaming the “heated home insurance market,” not cooling it. Kathleen Lassle Alamo Trump puts democracy on November ballot Donald Trump is a convicted felon (34 counts), with other cases pending; liable for sexual assault and slander (E. Jean Carroll); impeached twice; a 2020 election-denier; the leader of the Jan. 6 insurrection; cheated on all three wives; paid off Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about their affair; separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents; refers to immigrants as “vermin” and “criminals”; left thousands dead of COVID-19 due to lack of coherent policies; stacked the Supreme Court, resulting in the overturning of Roe v. Wade; a racist, a Project 2025 supporter (as is J.D. Vance); a climate change-denier; and would have the United States quit NATO and cease Ukraine support. J.D. Vance called Trump “reprehensible,” “an idiot,” and said he may be “America’s Hitler”; favors a nationwide abortion ban, even in cases of rape and incest; opposes divorce and gay marriage; claims he would have done the job that Vice President Mike Pence refused to do, to overthrow the 2020 election results. Wake up, America. Democracy itself is on the November ballot. Eric Mills Oakland What exactly was Democrats’ big lie? Re: “With liars in both parties, let’s write in Nikki Haley” (Page A6, Aug. 6). I was puzzled reading Dick Patterson’s letter equating Donald Trump’s and the Democrats’ “big lies.” Trump’s big lie, that he was cheated out of the presidency in 2020, has cost America so much. The tradition of peaceful transfer of presidential power, which for over two centuries has been the hallmark of American democracy and envied by fledgling democracies around the world, is gone. So many American lives have been ruined, or disrupted, with legal woes. The rift it created continues to take a toll on American life every day. The Democrats’ “big lie” is hard for me to fathom. It’s that they did not announce to the world that President Biden was not healthy, and therefore, not able to function as president. I think that he’s a functioning president who declined to run for reelection because of his age. Where is the big lie in all this?

Attempting to obscure the truth, the comics page’s Bruce Tinsley jokes about the far-right’s embrace of fascism.

I try to forgive Trump supporters, assuming that most are just badly informed (as they would be if Fox “News” is a primary source). But they are abetting the attempted destruction of our democracy by a con man. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it’s fascism. Vote against it.

Vance says he was nowhere near AppHarvest and had left the company and its board in April of 2021, before the conditions detailed in the CNN report. “This is twice in one week where CNN has blatantly ignored its own reporting in an attempt to smear JD Vance,” Team Vance National Press Director, Taylor Van Kirk, told The Post. “The American people know that CNN only operates as an arm of Kamala’s campaign and peddles garbage meant to mislead.” Vance’s spokesman said the network intentionally obscured important facts while reporting the story of an investment Vance made the now-bankrupt tech startup. The Vance team claimed CNN is “laundering” opposition research from the Kamala Harris campaign for president and that the network “purposely buried the key fact that JD was unaware of problems the company experienced after he left the board in April of 2021.” Team Vance admits the senator was one of the company’s first investors in 2018, but is refuting CNN’s claims he oversaw a toxic workplace. They say instead: Vance left AppHarvest’s board in April of 2021, well before any of the alleged toxic activity at the company took place.

The interview on Spaces, X’s platform for live audio conversations, covered everything from illegal immigration to union busting. At one point, Trump and Musk underscored the need for an American leader who would inspire fear in other countries. Over the course of two hours, the richest man in the world and the former president of the United States reminded us that they share some striking similarities — giant egos, a love of attention and social media, yet at the same time a sense of victimhood. (Vice President Kamala Harris might love Venn diagrams, but she’d have to hate this intersection.) While Trump had been banned following the events of January 6, and reinstated when Musk took over, he only returned to the platform in text for yesterday’s conversation. Both Musk and Trump promoted the interview as a marquee entertainment event, with Musk promising that it would be “unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!” Yet the two men gabbed mostly about the predictable topics: the US border, crime, and then still more about the border. The interview was yet another opportunity for Trump to spew insults and make false statements, with no pushback from his interviewer — not even when Trump told Musk, the CEO of an EV company, that he planned to “drill, baby, drill” in his second term. The livestream started nearly an hour late due to technical difficulties. Almost 20 minutes after it was set to begin, Musk wrote that there appeared to be a “massive DDOS attack on X.” (A DDoS attack intentionally disrupts a site by flooding it with traffic; it wouldn’t be accurate to call it a DDoS attack if a lot of people organically wanted to tune in.) Previous Spaces events on X have been rife with glitches, too — a live convo between Musk and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, in which DeSantis announced his presidential bid, crashed when over 500,000 people tried to listen in. Before the Trump interview, Musk said that X would be conducting stress tests to ensure the livestream could handle the traffic. Top livestreams on YouTube and Twitch have handled millions of concurrent viewers before, and the most popular streamers on those platforms regularly enjoy hundreds of thousands of viewers. Today, Trump returned to Truth Social, the social media site that he has a majority stake in, to praise Musk and lash out against the media for reporting on the technical issues that delayed the livestream. “I absolutely HATE the Fake News Media,” he wrote. “So bad for our Country!” Trump and Musk’s rocky history Trump and Musk haven’t always been on good terms. In the run-up to the presidential election in 2016, Musk said in a CNBC interview that Trump was “not the right guy,” noting that he didn’t have the “sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” Still, once Trump was in office Musk initially fostered a friendly relationship with the president, even agreeing to join two White House advisory councils. He quickly stepped down after Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. Then, at a rally in 2022, Trump claimed that Musk had told him he voted for him in 2016, calling the billionaire a “bullshit artist.” Musk sniped back that Trump should “sail into the sunset,” and in response Trump wrote on Truth Social that Musk had come to the Oval Office to ask for help “on all of his many subsidized projects,” and that he could have told Musk to drop to his knees and beg. --- A fact check on Trump and Musk on immigration One topic the two men continually returned to was immigration, and the insistence that there’s a scourge of crime committed by undocumented immigrants sweeping the nation. Trump said that over 20 million people have illegally crossed the US border under President Joe Biden, far outpacing estimates from experts. He repeated the unsubstantiated claim that many of them were coming from jails and mental institutions and called them “stone cold killers in many cases.” Trump and Musk also agreed that migrant crime was “destroying” cities like New York and San Francisco. “They just let violent criminals out in New York,” said Musk. “The only one they’re going to prosecute is Donald Trump,” the former president interjected. In fact, violent crime in US cities has plummeted in the first half of 2024. --- All that appears to be water under the bridge now. Musk officially endorsed Trump in July on the day of his attempted assassination, and is backing a super PAC aiming to get 800,000 Americans in swing states to vote for Trump. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the two speak on the phone several times a month now to discuss topics such as “immigration, technology and science.” Why the two see eye to eye As the conversation wound down, Trump congratulated Musk on getting “60 to 70 million” listeners, appearing to mistake the number of passive views the event got on X with the number of people who had tuned in (a little over 1 million). Musk mused that the total number of views the interview would eventually get would be in the hundreds of millions. It was a moment that summed up what the two men have in common — a tendency to self-aggrandize and inflate their accomplishments. They both have a habit of saying incendiary things, whether on camera or online, and have used social media to grow a fervent fan base around their cult of personality. Trump has been mostly absent on X even after being reinstated in November 2022, posting primarily on Truth Social. He’s under an exclusivity clause that limits non-political posts he can make outside of Truth Social — but this interview appears to fall under an exemption because it’s related to politics. Yesterday, in the lead-up to the interview, Trump made multiple posts on X boosting his presidential campaign, pinning a campaign ad to the top of his profile. Prior to August 12, Trump hadn’t posted on X in almost a year. Now, though, Musk and Trump are also united by a sense of personal grievance and persecution. Trump complained that the Democrats had weaponized the legal system against him, referring to the many criminal investigations he’s under. “The Biden administration did something that’s never been done in this country, and that’s go after their political opponent — me — with this nonsense,” Trump said. A few days ago, Musk posted a graphic (the source of which is unclear) on X portraying himself and his political views as the side resisting oppression — much like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, or Neo in The Matrix. “When it’s fiction you understand,” the picture reads. “You refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in.” Musk groused that people painted him as a “far-right guy, which is absurd because I’m, like, making electric vehicles,” he said. “I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama’s hand when he was president.” While Musk said he used to vote for Democrats, in 2022 he announced he would start voting Republican because the Dems had become the party of “division & hate.” In the past year he has repeated rhetoric echoing the white supremacist “great replacement” theory, which alleges that there’s a conspiracy to replace white people by bringing undocumented immigrants into the US. He has also consistently been dismissive of LGBTQ+ equality, showing particular contempt for transgender people. Musk’s daughter, who is trans, has criticized his treatment of her gender identity on Instagram’s Threads. --- A fact check on Trump and Musk on inflation Turning to the economy, both men blamed excess government spending during the pandemic as the primary cause of inflation. Economists generally attribute recent US inflation to a mix of reasons — not just government spending, but also supply chain interruptions combined with a surge in consumer demand. The $2.2 trillion CARES Act, one of the major Covid-19 stimulus packages, was signed into law by Trump. --- There were plenty of strange asides that the two men touched on during the conversation on X, highlighting their shared chaos — such as when Musk brought up building tunnels to “solve traffic.” Trump praised China’s high-speed rail system, but Musk was referring to tunnels for Tesla cars, like the Las Vegas Loop. Both agreed that Harris was a “far left” politician, with Trump repeating his accusation that Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race was a “coup” conducted by the Democratic Party. While on the subject of government overspending, Trump declared that he would shutter the Department of Education and “move education back to the states” during his second term. The former president also appeared to praise Musk for his mass firing of disgruntled Twitter employees in late 2022. “I won’t mention the name of the company,” he said, “but they go on strike and you say, ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.’” After the X interview, the United Auto Workers filed federal labor charges with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing Trump and Musk of “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.” At the top of the interview, Musk said that he wanted to show what Trump was like outside of an adversarial interview, despite the fact that the former president is famous for holding countless rallies where he speaks without restraint. “It’s hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don’t hear them talk in a normal way,” Musk claimed, adding that the event was aimed at “open-minded independent voters.” It remains to be seen how many voters were impressed by Trump’s and Musk’s vibes.","summary":"Last night, former President Donald Trump returned to X, the social media site once known as Twitter in as bombastic a form as possible: a livestream with the site’s now-owner Elon Musk.

The outrage stemmed from a post on social media put out by the Trump War Room on Tuesday morning which showed two images side-side-by-side. One showed a suburban house with an American flag outside, while the other showed a large group of people, most of whom were Black, sitting on what appeared to be a street curb. The people on the curb were African immigrants outside a shelter in New York City. The first image was captioned “Your neighborhood under Trump,” while the second was captioned “Your neighborhood under Kamala.” “Import the Third World. Become the Third World,” the post read. Social media users were quick to react with outrage and disbelief to the post, with one writing: “This is one of the most racist posts I’ve ever seen. Wow.” Another added: “The racism is off the charts here!” “So the strategy is “we hate Black people,” wrote one user, with another adding: “The pivot: ‘just do explicit racism now’.” “There have been Klan rallies which employed more subtlety than this,” another wrote. “Oh my God this is comically racist,” wrote another user. Civil rights organization the NAACP also weighed in on the post, writing in response: “Don’t just take our word for it. They are showing all of us just how racist they are. This is what’s on the ballot this November.” Tuesday’s social media post comes following Trump’s disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention late last month. The former president was asked by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott about his history of false claims about his rivals and his inflammatory remarks to officials and reporters of color. “Why would Black voters trust you when you have used language like that?” she asked. “I don’t think I’ve been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump replied. “You don’t even say hello, how are you.” He later said that he had appeared at the event as “a favor” and “out of respect for the Black community.” During his appearance at the conference, Trump also baselessly questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity and falsely claimed that she only recently “made a turn” and “became a Black person.” “She happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” he said, prompting outrage from those present. Trump’s remarks were later widely condemned as racist by members of both parties, and in a statement, Harris’ campaign communications director said Trump “showed ... the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office.” At a campaign event in Texas, Harris condemned her rival as putting on “the same old show of divisiveness,” telling her audience, “the American people deserve better.” The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment about the post on X and the backlash.","summary":"‘There have been Klan rallies which employed more subtlety than this,’ another wrote","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-campaign-racism-social-media-post-b2595906.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/13/20/SEI216556991.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UmlgCBln-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-13 23:19:46","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":254055214,"title":"LI GOP claims ‘vulnerable’ Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi could lose seat off Trump’s coattails","text":"Republicans citing internal polling data claim they have a shot — albeit an uphill one — to topple Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in the 3rd Congressional District encompassing Nassau County and parts of neighboring Queens. A poll conducted for the Nassau County GOP shows Suozzi leading his Republican opponent, former state Assemblyman Michael LiPetri, 51% to 37%. But Republicans aren’t discouraged by the sobering initial horse-race survey, saying it only tells part of the story. “Tom Suozzi is vulnerable because of national and local New York issues. If these issues are left unresolved, it is likely that President Trump will win this district and Republican Mike LiPetri can beat Tom Suozzi,” according to the Aug. 2 survey analysis conducted by pollster McLaughlin & Associates for Nassau County Republican Party chairman Joe Cairo. “Tom Suozzi’s modest lead on the benchmark ballot collapses once voters learn more about his very liberal record on the important issues like congestion pricing, immigration, taxes and crime,” the internal analysis added. When informed of Suozzi’s voting record, LiPetri leads 50% to 41%, the survey said. “With enough resources to increase his name awareness and stance on the issues, Mike LiPetri can beat Tom Suozzi,” the analysis says. Former Republican President Donald Trump leads Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House by a narrow 47% to 45%, while 72% of voters said the US is heading on the wrong track. Suozzi, a former Nassau County executive, previously served in Congress for three terms but gave up his seat in 2022 in a failed run for governor, getting trounced by then-sitting Gov. Kathy Hochul in the Democratic primary. But he won a special election in February to win back the seat after his successor, serial lying Republican Rep. George Santos, was expelled for ethical misdeeds. Suozzi defeated Nassau County Legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip by 8 percentage points in a hard-fought race in February that included fierce GOP attacks on his record. Team Suozzi was not concerned by Republicans claiming that LiPetri could dethrone him. “Congressman Suozzi’s work across party lines to solve the border crisis, restore the SALT deduction, bring money back to NY and to help heal the partisan divide is what his constituents want and will support him continuing to do,” said campaign senior campaign adviser Kim Devlin. McLaughlin & Associates surveyed 400 likely general election voters in District 3 from July 23-25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.","summary":"\"Tom Suozzi is vulnerable because of national and local New York issues,\" the survey found.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/13/us-news/mike-lipetri-could-topple-rep-tom-suozzi-nassau-county-gop/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87731239.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PxKBBwvk-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-13 23:16:27","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":254055374,"title":"Newsom tries shifting blame for homelessness crisis to local officials","text":"Last week Gov. Gavin Newsom donned blue jeans and a t-shirt to participate in a well-choreographed cleanup of a squalid encampment in Los Angeles, declaring that homelessness is the “biggest scar on the reputation of California.” That it is, and it’s an image that former President Donald Trump is weaponizing in his presidential duel with a Californian, Vice President Kamala Harris. However, California’s seemingly intractable homelessness crisis is also the biggest scar on Newsom’s governorship, one he wants to erase by blaming city and county officials for a lack of evident progress. Thursday’s media event, chronicled by Newsom’s $200,000-a-year personal photographer, was clearly aimed at portraying him as diligently working to solve the problem, while locals drag their feet. “I’m here on behalf of 40 million Californians who are fed up,” Newsom said, adding, “I’m one of them. I want to see results. “We have cleared every hurdle,” he said, referring to a recent Supreme Court decision making it easier for local officials to clear encampments. “We’re done with excuses.” For the umpteenth time, Newsom threatened to “redirect” money the state has been sending to local governments for homelessness programs if he doesn’t see progress. However local officials have said those threats are the biggest impediment to creating permanent facilities and services to move California’s homeless residents — approaching 200,000, by far the most of any state — off the streets. Most of the state money has been in the form of one-year grants and without guarantees of long-term funding; the mayors and other officials say they cannot maintain ongoing programs. “Now is not the time to play politics when people’s lives are at stake,” Carolyn Coleman, CEO of the League of California Cities, replied in 2022 to one of Newsom’s periodic threats. “Failing to release state funding will not put roofs over the heads of Californians or deliver desperately needed supportive services.” Moreover, while Newsom has talked a good game about reducing homelessness, his own administration has been less than efficient. Earlier this year, state Auditor Grant Parks sharply criticized Newsom’s Interagency Council on Homelessness, saying that in the three years since a previous audit found the state was not effectively coordinating homelessness efforts, the agency still “has not continued to track and report on this information since that time.” Clearing encampments, as Newsom and state workers did last week at a state-owned site, is the easiest aspect of the crisis. But what happens to residents when their camps are cleared? A situation in Sacramento, just a few minutes from the Capitol, illustrates that difficulty. For the past two years, about 50 people have lived in city-issued trailers parked in a vacant lot dubbed Camp Resolution. However the lease on the property expired this month and the city wants to close the camp, labeling it “a failed experiment” with unsanitary conditions. Lawyers representing the residents are trying to block closure, but a judge refused to intervene. City officials say camp residents have rebuffed efforts to be moved to other sites or into housing. It’s virtually certain that encampments of some kind will still be very visible when Newsom’s governorship ends 29 months hence. Will they continue to be part of his legacy, or by then will he have shifted the onus onto others?

Chaos at America’s southern border has been one of the key topics in recent years, including speculation about whether the Democratic Party has used immigration to gain voters. Earlier in August, past comments from Kamala Harris' 2019 campaign website came to light, having linked to a study touting what it called the electoral benefits of not deporting some illegal immigrants, saying that the policy \"could provide sizable contributions to the margin of victory in swing states.\" The Times published a report on Monday also discussing the potential electoral implications of immigration in an article titled, \"Immigrants Are Becoming U.S. Citizens at Fastest Clip in Years.\" REPUBLICANS SAY SCHUMER MUST ACT ON VOTER PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP BILL IF DEMOCRAT 'REALLY CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY' \"The federal government is processing citizenship requests at the fastest clip in a decade, moving rapidly through a backlog that built up during the Trump administration and the coronavirus pandemic,\" The Times reported. \"At ceremonies in courthouses, convention centers and sports arenas across the country, thousands of immigrants are becoming new Americans every week — and becoming eligible to vote in time for the presidential election this fall.\" The report quotes an executive of an immigration assistance organization about how naturalization of immigrants may be \"reshaping the electorate\" shortly before the 2024 election. \"The surge in naturalization efficiency isn’t just about clearing backlogs; it’s potentially reshaping the electorate, merely months before a pivotal election,\" Xiao Wang, chief executive of immigration assistance organization Boundless, said. The Times described the organization as \"a company that uses government data to analyze immigration trends and that offers services to immigrants who seek professional help in navigating the application process.\" Wang added that \"every citizenship application could be a vote that decides Senate seats or even the presidency.\" The Times noted numerous ways in which the Biden Administration worked to \"to dial back his predecessor’s hard-line immigration agenda.\" \"At under five months, application processing speed is now on a par with 2013 and 2014. About 3.3 million immigrants have become citizens during President Biden’s time in office, with less than two months to go before the close of the 2024 fiscal year,\" The Times wrote. \"After taking office in 2021, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that sought to dial back his predecessor’s hard-line immigration agenda and ‘restore faith’ in the legal immigration system. Among other steps, the order called for action to ‘substantially reduce current naturalization processing times’ with the goal of strengthening integration of new Americans.\" DONALD TRUMP JR: DEMOCRATS WANT NON-CITIZEN VOTES AND HERE'S HOW WE PLAN TO STOP THEM According to the Times, the Biden-Harris administration sought to reduce the backlog of pending citizenship applications by using new technology and additional workers. The backlog was due to the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration and the COVID-19 pandemic. This slowing of the citizenship process, the Times wrote, impacted the 2020 election. \"Intent on curbing legal immigration, the Trump administration conducted lengthier reviews of naturalization applications. The processing time roughly doubled to about 10 months during Mr. Trump’s tenure,\" the Times reported. \"The bottleneck prevented some 300,000 prospective citizens from naturalizing in time to vote in the 2020 election, according to estimates by Boundless.\" The article cited research claiming that many of the major demographics of immigrants tend to vote for the Democratic Party.

Instead, his congressional campaign said the then-National Guardsman would go to Iraq if called but added that he was determined to stay in the race at the same time. “Although his tour of duty in Iraq might coincide with his campaign for Minnesota’s 1st Congressional seat, Walz is determined to stay in the race,” the campaign said in the release. While Democrats have said Walz in 2004 told the National Guard he intended to retire, the press release made no mention of those plans — and instead seemed to try to gain support off the possibility of him being shipped onto the battlefield. The campaign’s release quoted Walz as saying: “As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.” The press release shows Walz was playing it both ways: trying to gain traction from his service while never intending to serve long enough to see Iraq, critics say. He ended up stunning members of his battalion with his decision to retire from the service right before deployment — a troubling situation now at the crux of controversy since the Minnesota governor became Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ veep running mate. Walz retired from the National Guard just two months after the press release was issued, in May 2005, before his unit was reportedly given mobilization and “stop loss” orders in July 2005 that prevented soldiers from being excused from service for anything other than illness. His Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery unit mobilized in October of that year and deployed to Iraq in late March 2006, according to reports. Walz’s former unit spent 17 months in Iraq and suffered three casualties. In his 24 years of military service – with the Nebraska National Guard from 1981 to 1996 and the Minnesota National Guard from 1996 to 2005 – Walz never saw combat, having only been deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom involving the war in Afghanistan and to Norway in support of NATO. Retired Minnesota National Guard Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends, who was tasked with preparing the 500 soldiers in the 1-125th Battalion for combat after Walz’s departure, told The Post that Walz “went behind everyone’s back” in a “shady” way when he put in his retirement paperwork, going above his commander and making the request to more senior leaders. The revelation of Walz’s hasty retirement when faced with serving in the Iraq war, which his opposition to was a central theme of his congressional campaign, is just one of a number of controversies surrounding the way Kamala Harris’ VP pick has represented his military career. Walz has been criticized in recent weeks for saying he was a command sergeant major in the National Guard. The rank, which was recently scrubbed from his biography on the Harris-Walz campaign website, was ultimately taken away upon his retirement because he did not complete the necessary coursework to obtain the promotion. Walz’s rank was reduced to master sergeant upon his retirement. The Minnesota governor has also faced accusations of “stolen valor” from combat veterans and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance for how he described his time in the National Guard. “What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you’re not,” Vance, a Marine veteran, said earlier this month. “I’d be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.” Last week, the Harris campaign admitted that Walz “misspoke” about his past military service when he suggested in 2018 that he fought on a battlefield. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said as he clamored for increased gun control. On Tuesday, Walz appeared to address recent attacks about his exaggerated service record, telling a crowd at Tulane University in Louisiana that he “firmly believe[s] you should never denigrate another person’s service records.","summary":"Tim Walz’s own 2005 congressional campaign touted that the then-candidate would go to Iraq if deployed — before he now-famously ended up ditching the National Guard to allegedly avoid getting sent, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/13/us-news/tim-walz-campaigned-on-possible-deployment-to-iraq-in-2005-then-left-natl-guard-before-being-sent/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/democratic-vice-presidential-nominee-minnesota-87727934.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Kc17yYxd-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-13 23:00:07","author":"Caitlin Doornbos,Victor Nava","authors":["Caitlin Doornbos","Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":254056738,"title":"Trump and Musk may be in hot water after disastrous X interview","text":"The United Auto Workers has filed separate federal labor charges against Donald Trump and Elon Musk after comments the two made during their predictably disastrous interview on X, on Monday night.

It is equally against the law to threaten workers with loss of work for engaging in any of these protected activities. Unions by and large have consolidated behind the Democratic ticket. The AFL-CIO, which represents 60 unions and 12.5 million workers, unanimously endorsed Harris in July. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers—the two largest teachers unions in the United States—have also endorsed Harris; their endorsements were likely strengthened by Trump’s boast to Musk that he would “close up the Department of Education” if he were to become president.

It’s disgusting, illegal and totally predictable from these two clowns.” The union’s unfair labor complaints against the Trump campaign and Tesla Inc. were filed with the National Labor Relations Board after Trump appeared to praise Musk for his union busting tactics. “Well, you’re the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk, who chuckled as he spoke. “I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in and you just say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike. I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, ‘That's okay. You're all gone.

It wasn’t immediately clear which workers Trump was referring to; Musk owns X and is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla.

Researchers used a piece of raw meat to demonstrate how they are working to improve scanning technology to quickly distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells during surgeries. The Bidens then championed the announcement of $150 million in awards from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Those will support eight teams of researchers around the country working on ways to help surgeons more successfully remove tumors from people with cancer. It brings the total amount awarded by the agency to develop breakthrough treatments for cancers to $400 million. Cancer surgery “takes the best surgeons and takes its toll on families,” Biden said. He said the demonstration of cutting-edge technology he witnessed would offer doctors a way to visualize tumors in real time, reducing the need for follow-on surgeries. “We’re moving quickly because we know that all families touched by cancer are in a race against time,” Biden said. The teams receiving awards include ones from Tulane, Dartmouth College, Johns Hopkins University, Rice University, the University of California, San Francisco, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the University of Washington and Cision Vision in Mountain View, California. Before he leaves office in January, Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in 2022 to cut U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years, and to improve the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. “I’m a congenital optimist about what Americans can do,” Biden said. “There’s so much that we’re doing. It matters.” Experts say the objective is attainable — with adequate investments. “We’re curing people of diseases that we previously thought were absolutely intractable and not survivable,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Cancer is the second-highest killer of people in the U.S. after heart disease. This year alone, the American Cancer Society estimates that 2 million new cases will be diagnosed and 611,720 people will die of cancer diseases. Still, “if all innovation ended today and we could just get people access to the innovations that we know about right now, we think we could reduce cancer mortality by another 20 to 30%,” Knudsen said. The issue is personal enough for Biden that, in his recent Oval Office address about bowing out of the 2024 campaign, the president promised to keep fighting for “my cancer moonshot so we can end cancer as we know it.” “Because we can do it,” Biden said then. He said in that speech that the initiative would be a priority of his final months in office, along with working to strengthen the economy and defend abortion rights, protecting children from gun violence and making changes to the Supreme Court, which he called “extreme” in its current makeup during a recent event. Both the president and first lady have had lesions removed from their skin in the past that were determined to be basal cell carcinoma, a common and easily treated form of cancer. In 2015, their eldest son, Beau, died of an aggressive brain cancer at age 46. “It’s not just personal,” Biden said Tuesday. “It’s about what’s possible.” The president’s public schedule has been much quieter since he left the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, making Tuesday’s trip stand out. Advocates have praised Biden for keeping the spotlight on cancer, bringing stakeholders together and gathering commitments from private companies, nonprofit organizations and patient groups. They say that the extra attention the administration has paid has put the nation on track to cut cancer death rates by at least half, preventing more than 4 million deaths from the disease, by 2047. It has done so by bolstering access to cancer treatments and reminding people of the importance of screening, which hit a setback during the coronavirus pandemic. “President Biden’s passion and commitment to this effort has made monumental differences for the entire cancer community, including those who are suffering from cancer,” said Jon Retzlaff, the chief policy officer at the American Association for Cancer Research. Looking ahead, Retzlaff said, “The No. 1 thing is for us to see robust, sustained and predictable annual funding support for the National Institutes of Health. And, if we see that through NIH and through the National Cancer Institute, the programs that have been created through the cancer moonshot will be allowed to continue.” Initiatives under Biden include changes that make screening and cancer care more accessible to more people, said Knudsen, with the American Cancer Society. “You’ve already paid for the cancer research. You’ve already paid for the innovation. Now let’s get it to people,” Knudsen said. She also said she’d like to see the next administration pursue a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes, which she said could save 654,000 lives over the next 40 years. Scientists now understand that cancer is not a single disease, but hundreds of diseases that respond differently to different treatments. Some cancers have biomarkers that can be targeted by existing drugs that will slow a tumor’s growth. Many more targets await discovery. “We hope that the next administration, whoever it may be, will continue to keep the focus and emphasis on our national commitment to end cancer as we know it,” said Dr. Crystal Denlinger, CEO of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a group of elite cancer centers.

The IDF has made significant progress, and Israel musn’t agree to anything that could jeopardize victory. At this point, Hamas’ central goal is simply to hang on long enough for Kamala Harris to win in November and then save it from final eradication. Iran is helping out: Its officials now claim Tehran will shelve plans to retaliate against Israel for killing Hamas boss Ismail Haniyeh if Jerusalem engages in good-faith cease-fire talks. Meanwhile, Hamas boss Yahya Sinwar is reportedly demanding Israel cease fire now as a precondition for cease-fire talks, which would give him immediate breathing room and let him stretch out the talks for months. In fact, Iran actually wants an excuse to hold off: It fears losing face if it doesn’t respond to the killing of Haniyah in Tehran, but its last strike at Israel was an embarrassing bust. And if it escalates now, it risks an IDF counter-strike that could smash its oil industry, costing the regime big-time and potentially feeding mass unrest. Israel’s destruction of Hamas may be slower than the world would like, but it’s been constant, steady and, indeed, laudable. Lately, it’s taken out several key leaders, including Haniyeh and Hamas’ military chief in Gaza, Mohammed Deif. Every day seems to bring a new operation that eliminates more top terrorists; why stop now? Not to avoid an Iranian attack: Again, it’s Iran looking for an excuse to de-escalate — it wants Israel exclusively engaged with its puppets. Meanwhile, Sinwar is nothing but an arm of Iran; his only goal is to keep Hamas alive so it can regain control of Gaza, rearm and prepare for the next Oct. 7. Alas, President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris are OK with that. They’re desperate for a cease-fire on almost any terms to appease the Democratic Party’s left wing, which is all-in to save Hamas. That’s why they insist Hamas has been sufficiently wounded, and it’s time to end the war; why they claim “too many civilians” have died, without even knowing the number and while ignoring Israel’s painstaking attempts to minimize casualties. We note that we have not once heard Biden or Harris demand Hamas stop using Gazans as human shields. Iran’s “give us reason not to shoot” bluff, and Sinwar’s “stop attacking and then I’ll talk” stances are aimed directly at Washington, to fool it into squeezing Israel to let Hamas off the hook. A cease-fire that doesn’t immediately bring the release of the remaining hostages simply lets Sinwar hold onto them and string out the talks indefinitely until a President Harris rides to Hamas’ longer-term rescue. If they can maneuver Blinken into pushing Israel to give up the Philadelphia Corridor separating Gaza from Egypt, all the better: That’ll let Hamas recover even faster. The broader American public still supports Jerusalem’s war goals: Rescue the hostages, destroy Hamas and ensure that Gaza can never again become a launching pad for terror attacks. Israel needs to stand tough as Blinken, Biden and Harris try to bully it into sacrificing its security needs to their partisan domestic political needs.","summary":"Pressure on Israel to make concessions to Hamas has grown intense, and Antony Blinken’s latest Mideast trip is likely to tighten screws further.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/13/opinion/israel-should-ignore-biden-harris-calls-for-a-cease-fire-and-finish-the-job/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-wddngeutu-1723588708202.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723574344&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 22:53:23","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":254057582,"title":"Breitbart Business Digest: July’s Food Inflation Leaves Families Hungry for Relief","text":"The Unwelcome Return of Food Inflation Just when you thought it was safe to venture back into the grocery stores, food inflation is roaring back. The producer price index (PPI) for food rose 0.6 percent in July, the biggest increase since February. Annualized, this amounts to a 7.6 percent rate of food inflation. The index tracking finished consumer foods also rose by 0.6 percent following a 0.4 percent increase in the prior month. There were some very steep increases in prices that American families likely noticed in July. The prices of fresh fruits and melons jumped 10.3 percent. Beef prices jumped 7.7 percent. Pork prices rose 1.8 percent. Coffee prices percolated up 3.3 percent. The indexes for these items are seasonally adjusted, so the increases do not result from a seasonal taste for iced coffee or the surge in grilling burgers or ribs. The cumulative effect has been devastating. Since Biden took office, the producer price index for food sold to consumers is up 26 percent. That’s five times as much inflation as we saw during Donald Trump’s White House tenure. The summer surge in food prices suggests that inflation is very likely to remain a top concern for voters as we head toward election day. The latest polling by YouGov for the Economist indicates that 96 percent of voters say inflation is an important issue, including 77 percent who say it is very important. Twenty-four percent say it is the single most important issue, more than twice as many as for any other issue. A survey released Monday by the Financial Times showed that 78 percent of registered voters say inflation has been one of the three biggest sources of personal financial stress over the past month, followed by income at 45 percent and rent at 31 percent. Asked to name the single biggest source of personal financial stress over the past three months, 45 percent said inflation, dwarfing income and rent, each at 13 percent. And food inflation is at the heart of concern over price increases. Seventy-eight percent of people selected food inflation as having a big impact on their financial situation. That is followed by household supplies and everyday necessities at 55 percent and gasoline at 51 percent. This July surge is likely to be all the more troubling for voters because they were told that food inflation was a thing of the past. Food prices, as measured by the PPI, rose mildly in March and actually declined in April and May. But they rose 0.4 percent in June and then accelerated again last month. This suggests the doom and gloom surrounding food prices has been better grounded in reality than the rosy projections of journalists, economists, and Democrat politicians telling us that we conquered food inflation. Kamala Is Haunted by the Ghost of Rising Grocery Prices Kamala Harris has very good reason to be concerned about inflation. Thirty-nine percent of registered voters name Democratic policies as one of the three major causes of price increases, according to the Financial Times poll. That puts it behind “large corporations taking advantage of inflation” at 59 percent and ahead of lasting pandemic impact at 35 percent. The Fed is named by just 26 percent and Republican policies by just 24 percent. Harris, following Joe Biden’s lead, has been trying to divert the public’s attention away from Democrat policies and onto “corporate greed.” After not mentioning inflation for a few weeks, she has recently taken to saying something along the lines of these words from her Michigan speech (according to Chris Giles of the Financial Times): We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead. Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was attorney-general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be my day one priority to fight to bring down prices; to take on the big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging; take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families; to take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. That is the work we will do together.” The problem is Harris does not actually believe half of this, and the half she does believe isn’t true. As Giles of the FT points out: Notice there is no talk about disinflation, but an ambition to bring down prices and some specific areas where Harris would like to act. Taken literally, this is a call for the Fed and other parts of government to lower the price level and seek deflation. If this were literally true, the only valid response would be, “you cannot be serious.” Giles concludes that we’re not meant to take Harris pledge to bring down prices as literally true. “The upshot: Take Harris seriously, but not literally,” Giles writes. She does not mean what she’s saying when she promises to bring down prices. The other half of her argument is that inflation is mostly caused by “illegal price gouging” and “price-fixing schemes” and the like. The trouble with this thesis is that last month’s food inflation happened while profit margins—measured as “trade services” in the PPI—decreased. Overall trade services fell 1.3 percent in July, the largest monthly decline since 2015. Trade services for food retailing plunged 3.7 percent, the largest decline since 2009. Compared with a year ago, retail food profit margins are up just o.2 percent, lagging behind almost every major indicator of inflation. Whatever is driving food inflation, it is not greed, price-fixing, or price-gouging. The FT poll showed that 38 percent of registered voters want Harris to take a completely different approach from Biden’s economic policies. Another 23 percent want major changes. Following Biden’s “greedflation” script is not going to do it.","summary":"Just when you thought it was safe to venture back into the grocery stores, food inflation is roaring back.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: July’s Food Inflation Leaves Families Hungry for Relief appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/08/13/breitbart-business-digest-julys-food-inflation-leaves-families-hungry-for-relief/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/bbd-8-13-24-getty-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 22:50:08","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":254057580,"title":"Joe Biden Implies He Would Attend Donald Trump's Inauguration: 'I Have Good Manners'","text":"President Joe Biden implied Tuesday that he will attend an inauguration for former President Donald Trump if he wins the election in November against Vice President Kamala Harris.

Though, it’s worth noting that the features I had access to were only half of what OpenAI demonstrated when it launched the GPT-4o model in May. The vision aspect we saw in the livestreamed demo is now scheduled for a later release, and the enhanced Sky voice, which Her actor Scarlett Johanssen pushed back on, has been removed from Advanced Voice Mode and is still no longer an option for users. So, what’s the current vibe? Right now, Advanced Voice Mode feels reminiscent of when the original text-based ChatGPT dropped, late in 2022. Sometimes it leads to unimpressive dead ends or devolves into empty AI platitudes. But other times the low-latency conversations click in a way that Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa never have for me, and I feel compelled to keep chatting out of enjoyment. It’s the kind of AI tool you’ll show your relatives during the holidays for a laugh. OpenAI gave a few WIRED reporters access to the feature a week after the initial announcement, but pulled it the next morning, citing safety concerns. Two months later, OpenAI soft launched Advanced Voice Mode to a small group of users and released GPT-4o’s system card, a technical document that outlines red teaming efforts, what the company considers to be safety risks, and mitigation steps the company has taken to reduce harm. Curious to give it a go yourself? Here’s what you need to know about the larger rollout of Advanced Voice Mode, and my first impressions of ChatGPT’s new voice feature to help you get started. So, When’s the Full Roll Out? OpenAI released an audio-only Advanced Voice Mode to some ChatGPT Plus users at the end of July, and the alpha group still seems relatively small. The company currently plans to enable it for all subscribers sometime this fall. Niko Felix, a spokesperson for OpenAI, shared no additional details when asked about the release timeline. Screen and video sharing were a core part of the original demo, but they are not available in this alpha test. OpenAI still plans to add those aspects eventually, but it’s also not clear when that will actually happen. If you’re a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you’ll receive an email from OpenAI when the Advanced Voice Mode is available to you. After it’s on your account, you can switch between Standard and Advanced at the top of the app’s screen when ChatGPT’s voice mode is open. I was able to test the alpha version on an iPhone as well as a Galaxy Fold. My First Impressions on ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode Within the very first hour of speaking with it, I learned that I love interrupting ChatGPT. It’s not how you would talk with a human, but having the new ability to cut off ChatGPT mid-sentence and request a different version of the output feels like a dynamic improvement and a stand-out feature. Early adopters who were excited by the original demos may be frustrated getting access to a version of Advanced Voice Mode restricted with more guardrails than anticipated. For example, although generative AI singing was a key component of the launch demos, with whispered lullabies and multiple voices attempting to harmonize, AI serenades are currently absent from the alpha version. “I mean, singing isn’t really my strong suit,” says ChatGPT. OpenAI in the GPT-4o system card claims this, potentially temporary, guardrail was implemented to avoid copyright infringement. During testing, ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode alpha declined multiple direct requests from me for songs, though the chatbot hummed nonsense tunes when asked to provide nonverbal answers. Which leads us to the creepiness factor. A white static noise appeared in the background multiple times during my longer interactions with the alpha, like the ominous buzz of a lone lightbulb illuminating a dark basement. While I was trying to coax a balloon sound effect out of the Advanced Voice Mode, it generated a loud pop followed by an uncanny gasping noise that gave me chills. Although, nothing I encountered during my first week matched the insanity of what OpenAI’s red teamers heard while testing. On “rare instances,” the GPT-4o model deviated from the assigned voice and started to mimic the user’s vocal tone and speech patterns. With that in mind, the core impression ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode left on me wasn’t one of unease or apprehension, but a much more buoyant sense of entertainment. Whether ChatGPT was giving hilariously wrong answers to New York Times puzzles or generating a spot-on impression of Stitch, from Lilo & Stitch, acting as a San Francisco tour guide, I was laughing quite often during these interactions. Advanced Voice Mode was solid at generating vocal impressions, after some nudging. The chatbot’s first attempt at animated character voices, like Homer Simpson and Eric Cartman, seemed like the standard AI voice with just a few adjustments, but follow-up prompts for heightened versions sounded recognizably close to the original. When I asked for an exaggerated version of Donald Trump explaining the Powerpuff Girls, the AI generation was campy enough to earn a spot on the next season of Saturday Night Live. With the US presidential election just a few months away and election deepfakes front of mind, I was caught off guard by ChatGPT’s willingness to provide vocal impressions of a major candidate. ChatGPT generated imitations of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as well, but the voices didn’t sound as close as the bot’s take on Trump’s speech. While the tool is best at English, it can switch between multiple languages within the same conversation. OpenAI red-teamed the GPT-4o model using 45 languages in total. When I set up two phones with Advanced Voice Mode and had them talk to each other like friends, the bots easily moved between French, German, and Japanese at my request. Although, I do need to spend more time testing to gauge how well the chatbot’s translation feature really works and its weak points. ChatGPT brought theater kid energy when asked to perform a variety of emotional outbursts. The audio generations weren’t hyper-realistic, but the range and elasticity of the bot’s voice was impressive. I was surprised that it could do a decent vocal fry on command. Advanced Voice Mode doesn’t transcend the issues facing chatbots, like reliability, but its entertainment value alone could potentially pull the spotlight back to OpenAI—one of its biggest competitors, Google, just launched Gemini Live, the voice interface for its generative chatbot. For now, I’ll keep testing it out and see what sticks. I’m using it most when I’m home alone and I want something to keep me company while researching articles and playing video games. The more time I spend talking with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, the more I think OpenAI made a wise choice rolling out a less flirty version than what was originally demoed. Don’t want to get too emotionally attached.","summary":"The new voice feature from OpenAI for ChatGPT is often entertaining and will even do a Trump impression.

Bob Casey defends Tim Walz against stolen valor claims: ‘Should be lauded and commended’","text":"BETHLEHEM, Pa. — After breaking briefly with Democratic power-brokers over a Russian prisoner exchange, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) is back standing with them as another controversy hovers around the top of the ticket. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Casey responded to claims of stolen valor surrounding Kamala Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz. “I think when someone serves as Governor Walz did for 24 years, I think that service should be lauded and commended, not to be denigrated,” Casey said. Walz has faced sharp criticism from a former Minnesota National Guard commander, as well as GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, over past comments that seemed to misrepresent the extent of his military service. “We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in 2018 while discussing the issue of gun control. The gov later said he misspoke and acknowledged he never experienced direct combat. In the weeks following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, Casey was one of a few swing-state Democrats who opted to publicly support Biden as party leader. At times, Casey’s staffers went to considerable lengths to protect the senator from questions about Biden’s mental state. Meanwhile Casey’s opponent, Republican businessman Dave McCormick, has sought to capitalize on the incumbent’s pattern of falling in line when the going gets tough. “Bob Casey is lying about Joe Biden’s failing cognitive abilities, skirting responsibility for rising costs, and refuses to take responsibility for fueling open borders,” McCormick posted to X/Twitter on Monday. “Now, he’s covering for Tim Walz’s lies,” McCormick added. “You can’t trust Casey to tell the truth.” The race between Casey and McCormick is expected to be the country’s most expensive this election cycle, with total ad spending projected to reach $360 million.","summary":"After breaking briefly with Democratic power-brokers over a Russian prisoner exchange, Sen.

But legal challenges still loom. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced that officials have verified that independents Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Claudia De la Cruz of the Party for Socialism and Liberation each collected more than the 7,500 signatures needed to qualify. Raffensperger said 11,336 signatures were accepted for Kennedy after county election officials reviewed petitions, while 8,075 were accepted for Cornel West and 7,682 were accepted for De la Cruz. While Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians have secure places on the Georgia ballot, other parties and independent candidates can qualify by petition. But Georgia Democrats are still legally challenging efforts to place the three candidates and Green Party nominee Jill Stein on Georgia’s ballots. It is part of a nationwide effort to block candidates who could siphon votes from Vice President Kamala Harris. Hearings on the Georgia challenges are scheduled to begin Monday. After an administrative law judge makes a recommendation, Raffensperger will issue a final ruling. A decision must be made in time for Georgia to mail military and overseas ballots beginning Sept. 17. While some other states routinely put minor-party and independent candidates on ballots, Georgia voters haven’t had more than four options since 1948. The last time there were any candidates besides a Republican, Democrat and Libertarian was in 2000, when independent Pat Buchanan qualified. Kennedy was kicked off New York’s ballot earlier this week when a judge ruled that the address in New York City’s suburbs that Kennedy listed as a residence on nominating petitions was a “sham” address he used to maintain his voter registration and to further his political aspirations. The judge ruled in favor of challengers who argued Kennedy’s actual residence was the home in Los Angeles he shares with his wife, the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Cheryl Hines. Kennedy has vowed to appeal It is unclear if Kennedy’s home address will be an issue in the Georgia hearings. Democrats have alleged that all the petitions followed improper procedures, making them invalid. The Kennedy campaign’s Paul Rossi said in a July 31 online news conference that there was nothing wrong with the campaign’s petitions, with Rossi describing the allegations as “throwing spaghetti at the wall.” “Because they can’t challenge the signatures, they’ve made allegations which are simply not correct at all,” Rossi said. Until this year, the only road to getting on the ballot in Georgia was by collecting signatures from 7,500 registered voters statewide. But Georgia’s Republican-majority legislature passed a law directing the secretary of state to also place on the ballot candidates of any party that makes ballots in at least 20 other states. That move was widely interpreted as trying to make trouble for Biden, although former President Donald Trump’s Republican campaign has also regarded the Kennedy campaign with suspicion. The Green Party, which has nominated Stein, says it aims to make Georgia ballots using the 20-state rule.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nATLANTA – Three independent and third-party candidates got one step closer to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Georgia officials confirm that Kennedy and 2 others meet signature requirements for presidential ballot amidst ongoing disputes first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/georgia-officials-confirm-that-kennedy-and-2-others-meet-signature-requirements-for-presidential-ballot-amidst-ongoing-disputes/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/fHM2RSuoNeR1bXtD70uL6yi8ujc=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/GEHQ2K7RFZBF3NAWPKTEQA3BVU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 22:32:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":254056224,"title":"The Market Might As Well Close Every August","text":"Every year, I wonder why the stock market doesn’t close in August since so many traders go on vacation and the algorithmic program traders whipsaw the market up and down on light volume. Due to creating these air pockets, I expect this “down, up, down again” market action will persist until the trading volume is exhausted – or until more traders return after Labor Day. The collapse in Treasury yields should force the Fed to cut a full 1% since the Fed funds rate is now 1.5% above the 10-year Treasury rate. If the Fed waits until September 18th, it will be too little, too late, since the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) will have likely cut rates twice by then. With layoffs continuing to be announced, unemployment could be 5% or higher by October. Based on rising unemployment, declining PCE inflation and plunging Treasury yields, it is far beyond time for the Fed to act by cutting rates now, before their Jackson Hole meeting in late August. Many pundits have blamed recent market volatility on domestic politics or economic statistics, but I think most of it traces to the Japanese carry trade, as magnified by program trading. That’s a situation where investors sell the Japanese yen to benefit from the U.S. dollar’s appreciation versus the yen, as the U.S. dollar yields far more than the near-zero interest rates in the yen. However, as U.S. recession fears mount, U.S. Treasury yields began to collapse and the Japanese carry trade became temporarily unwound, so the Nikkei 225 Tokyo stock index plunged 12.4% last Monday, only to resurge by 10.23% Tuesday. Here are the most important market news items and what this news means: - With over 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 announcing their second-quarter earnings so far, earnings growth is averaging an impressive 10.9% and Nvidia will be the grand finale on August 28th. - Despite a manufacturing sector that has struggled for the past 21 months, the service sector and booming energy exports continue to fuel U.S. GDP growth. The Atlanta Fed is now estimating 2.9% annual GDP growth for the third quarter. - The Presidential election cycle is now in full force since Kamala Harris followed Donald Trump and promised “no taxes on tips.” Kamala Harris has not yet also promised no taxes on social security benefits like Donald Trump, but do not be surprised if she come up with more promises. As a result, the September 10th debate is shaping up to be a big deal, and consumer confidence is expected to rise as the Presidential candidates promise us everything and anything. - There is mounting evidence that China’s economic woes are mounting. This is hurting Germany since China is its biggest export market for vehicles. Not surprisingly, the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment, which tracks analysts’ economic expectations for the next six months, plunged to 19.2 in August, which is substantially below economists’ consensus estimate of 29. The current economic situation component in the ZEW index plunged and may have been influenced by severe flooding in recent months that has hindered many manufacturers of aluminum and specialty components for the automotive industry. - At the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole next week, central bankers from around the world will meet and may signal that further key interest rates cuts will be forthcoming. Export nations like Germany are expected to benefit as key interest rates are cut, since it should stimulate demand. The most favorable outcome from the Jackson Hole meeting will be if central banks signal more key interest rate cuts to stimulate their respective economies. Naturally, it would also help if these central banks also signaled that inflation has been defeated. - This week the big news will be inflation. The Labor Department announced on Tuesday that the Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.1% in July, which was below economists’ consensus estimate of 0.2%. Wholesale service costs declined 0.2% in July, which was a positive development since service costs had risen in previous months. However, wholesale goods prices rose 0.6% in July, due largely to an increase in gasoline prices. The PPI report was very positive and indicative that inflation continues to cool. - The CPI is also expected to be favorable, but all eyes will be on shelter costs, namely owners’ equivalent rent. Fortunately, home prices are now being cut at the fastest pace in the past two years, especially in popular regions like the Sunbelt, so owners’ equivalent rent may continue to soften. - There is one major inflation glitch, namely energy prices. The fear in energy markets is that Russia’s crude oil exports will continue to decline and that Ukraine may hit Russia’s Arctic pipeline, which would be devastating and potentially send crude oil prices to $100 per barrel. Ukraine is making advances against Russia and actually crossed into Russian territory in Kursk as well as several other villages and severely disrupted Russian supply lines. Additionally, Ukraine blew up a Russian natural gas rig in the Black Sea, west of Crimea that was reported to hold 40 Russian military personnel. Reportedly, this natural gas rig was packed with “reconnaissance equipment.” Russia also set Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on fire with black smoke pouring out of one of the two cooling towers, but so far there have not been reported elevated radiation levels. Overall, we remain in the dog days of summer, where trading volume is expected to remain weak. I have noticed that small capitalization stocks continue to meander higher, which is a positive development as the stock market’s breadth and power improve. The fact that Eli Lilly (LLY) has emerged as the new market leader as it blew by Novo Nordisk (NVO) to become the new leader in weight loss drugs, helps to reduce the stock market’s obsession with the Magnificent 7.","summary":"Commentary Every year, I wonder why the stock market doesn’t close in August since so many traders go on vacation and the algorithmic program traders whipsaw the market up and down on light volume.

During a streaming audio conversation with tech billionaire Elon Musk on Monday, Trump hinted that he might flee to Venezuela \"if something happens with this election.\"Eliason, a George Washington University Law School professor specializing in white- collar crime, suggested on Tuesday that Special Counsel Jack Smith, whose office is prosecuting Trump, should move to force the former president to surrender his passport due to increased concerns about him fleeing prosecution following his comments to Musk.In a post to X, formerly Twitter, Eliason noted that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan did not require Trump to give up his passport as a condition of his release pending trial, while arguing that \"in light of\" Trump's remarks on Monday, \"Smith should move to modify Trump's release conditions and have her require that he give up his passport.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the offices of Smith and Trump via email on Tuesday.Earlier this month, Chutkan rejected Trump's motion to dismiss the federal case based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling partially on his side with regards to presidential immunity. Smith also this month asked for a slight delay to the case to prepare for changes brought by the Supreme Court ruling.During Trump's talk with Musk on Monday, which was hosted on X after a delay of more than 40 minutes due to technical issues, the former president suggested that he might leave the country while arguing that Venezuela would \"be a far safer place\" than the U.S. for future meetings with Musk if Harris becomes president.\"If something happens with this election, which would be a horror show, we'll meet the next time in Venezuela, because it'll be a far safer place to meet than our country,\" Trump told Musk. \"OK, so we'll go. You and I will go, and we'll have a meeting and dinner in Venezuela.\"Trump has repeatedly pushed baseless claims that the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, an autocratic ruler who was declared the winner of what was widely viewed as a fixed election last month, has been releasing violent criminals from prisons and mental institutions and sending them to the U.S.A former speechwriter for Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed in 2022 that the Russian strongman had a backup plan to flee to Venezuela alongside his leadership team in the event that Russia loses its ongoing war with Ukraine.","summary":"Trump told Elon Musk on Monday that he may go to Venezuela \"if something happens with this election.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-should-move-now-make-trump-give-passport-ex-prosecutor-1938818","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2449363/jack-smith-donald-trump-passport-flee-venezuela.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 22:19:10","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019},{"id":254055390,"title":"Madonna, 65, holds hands with new boyfriend Akeem Morris, 28, ahead of 66th birthday celebrations in Italy","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Aug 13th 2024 1AM 18°C 4AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement 'I am really struggling and I need help.

He is a Jamaican born soccer paper. They were first pictured together on her Instagram page. On the fourth of July, Madonna shared a raunchy slideshow of pictures featuring her and Akeem racy poses, including one where his hand sits atop her cleavage as they lay on a couch together.

The images included were of Akeem and Madonna is racy poses together while spending time on the Fourth of July. Just one week prior, Madonna shared another steamy image of her and Akeem. Madonna shocked once again as she went topless in a steamy set of snaps posted on social media including a steamy one of her sitting on the lap of her new toyboy lover. She cheekily captioned the post to her 20million fans: 'Hot Fun in The Summer Time……… [fire emoji]' Despite her being topless no doubt the thing that will get tongues wagging was one of the snaps which featured her on top of the hunky new boytoy who posed with a smile right behind her. The megastar took to Instagram to share a gallery of snaps as she showcased her bare chest behind her blonde locks. The only thing Madonna had on were several diamond-encrusted platinum necklaces featuring varying sized pendants including crosses and a New York Yankees logo.

Her first-ever career retrospective ended up kicking off with a four night run at London's O2 Arena beginning on October 14, and went through Europe until early December. During a previous tour date in Brooklyn in December, the dance music pioneer joked that she had to 'almost die to get all my kids in one room.' She shares 27-year-old daughter Lourdes with her former boyfriend and fitness trainer Carlos Leon and her 23-year-old son Rocco with her ex-husband, filmmaker Guy Ritchie. Madonna later adopted her son David Banda, 18; daughter Chifundo 'Mercy' James, 18; and twin daughters Stella and Estere, 11. The pop icon was rushed to hospital in June 2023 after being found unresponsive as the result of what was later determined to be a serious bacterial infection. The songstress was taken to the ICU and had to be intubated, and she later revealed that she was put into a medically induced coma as she battled for her life despite going into lung and kidney failure. She suffered an acute septic shock on June 24, 2023 according to Radar Online, and emergency responders were reportedly able to revive her with Narcan. The substance is traditionally used to treat people in the midst of opioid overdoses, but it can also help revive someone suffering from septic shock. At her Brooklyn show, Madonna said her 'lungs weren't working' and her 'kidneys were failing,' and she claimed there was a 40 percent chance that she would not survive. The tour then shifted to the U.S. and Canada beginning with shows at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York that went around North America until mid-April when she headed to Mexico City for five concerts. Ultimately, the Celebration Tour ended on May 4 with a massive free concert at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach that attracted a whopping 1.6 million fans, which is now considered the biggest standalone concert of all time, according to the Economic Times.

But thanks to Tim Walz, my life-saving OB-GYN does.","text":"Life is about choices. Shortly after my beloved grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it was clear that I had a choice: I could remain thousands of miles away, in Brooklyn, New York, where I have happily lived for eight years, or I could pack up my family of four and move to rural South Dakota to be closer to my extended family. My husband and I decided to move. But on the day before we started looking for houses, I found out I was pregnant. Suddenly, I wasn’t just choosing to move to a new state. I was choosing to move to a new state with a near-total abortion ban while carrying a high-risk “geriatric” pregnancy and a history of pregnancy-related complications. Around the same time, the country was presented with its own surprise choice. After President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris dramatically changed the course of the upcoming election. The Democratic nominee for president injected hope and joy into an election cycle previously dominated by fear and despair. Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate pushed progressive optimism into overdrive. Walz has defied the stereotypical caricatures of white, straight, male Midwestern politicians. From fighting to end period poverty in schools, to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and providing free breakfast and lunch for all Minnesota students, Walz is a living reminder that the middle half of this country is not uniformly conservative or inherently regressive. In 2023, in response to the Supreme Court defying decades of legal precedent and overturning Roe v. Wade, Walz signed a law enshrining abortion access into Minnesota statutes, ensuring that the state will continue to offer abortion care regardless of the courts system. Now, at 22 weeks pregnant, it’s a law I am directly benefiting from. Living just 30-ish minutes from the state’s border, I drive 45 minutes into Minnesota to receive my prenatal care at Pipestone County Medical Center. It was not easy to set up care in a neighboring state; I had to guarantee that my insurance would cover out-of-state costs, that my provider in New York state could send over medical records, and that the team in Pipestone, Minnesota, could take on another (out-of-state) patient. After two weeks of calls, emails and yes, even faxes, appointments were made and I was assured by a nurse that I was in good hands, that I would be cared for, that if the worst-case scenario occurred my Minnesota team would be legally able to help. In South Dakota, abortions are banned with very limited exceptions and providing an illegal abortion is a felony. While physicians are permitted to administer abortion care if the life of the pregnant person is in danger, like all abortion exceptions the language is vague and has left doctors, nurses and health care providers to navigate a treacherous gray area. I’m all too aware of the risks. Studies have shown and countless stories have highlighted a horrifying post-Roe reality: pregnant people in need of lifesaving abortion or miscarriage care have been turned away, or have been forced to endure invasive, unnecessary C-sections in order to spare attending doctors the possibility of hefty fines and possible jail time. One recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics found that Texas’ abortion ban is responsible for an increase in the state’s infant mortality rate. At 37 years old, my pregnancy is automatically considered more dangerous. I also have experienced multiple miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and the loss of a twin at nearly 20 weeks gestation that forced me to give birth to one baby who was alive alongside the remains of a fetus. Given this history, I did not want to even chance the possibility of becoming another statistic in yet another study that highlights the devastating impact of abortion bans. So I will make the choice, over and over again during my pregnancy, to cross state lines and ensure comprehensive prenatal care that, if necessary, could legally include an abortion. I will choose to give birth in a state I do not call home, just in case I experience a labor complication that South Dakota state physicians might be too scared to help me survive. But this choice is not offered to countless pregnant people in South Dakota, or in the 21 other states that ban or severely restrict a common medical procedure that an estimated 1 out of every 4 women (as well as trans and nonbinary people) undergo in their lifetime. An estimated 25 million women live in a state that bans or severely restricts abortion care. One recent Associated Press analysis found that more than 100 pregnant people have been either turned away from or negligently treated at emergency rooms since 2022. An estimated 1 in 5 women are traveling an average of 86 miles to receive the abortion care they want and need. Recently, two women living in Texas have filed federal complaints after they were denied abortion care to treat life-ending ectopic pregnancies and, as a result, nearly died. Fellow Texan Ryan Hamilton wrote down, in excruciating detail, the sequence of events after complications from an incomplete miscarriage — and medical staff reluctant to intervene — that nearly led to his wife's death. Walz’s so-called “abortion sanctuary state” gave me that choice, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing my physicians will never face federal prosecution for providing me with the care I may need. Now, the nation has a similar choice. As Republicans continue to attack abortion rights and champion a nationwide abortion ban, Harris and her running mate are providing the country with an alternative — one that trusts pregnant people to make their own decisions about their bodies, pregnancies and families; that empowers physicians to do their jobs and adhere to their Hippocratic oaths; that continues to ensure parenthood is not a punishment for having sex but one of life’s overwhelming, joyful, scary, wonderful decisions. Life is about choices. I hope, come November, this country makes the right one.","summary":"In 2023, Tim Walz signed a law enshrining abortion access into Minnesota statutes.

Tim Walz’s lockdown orders, told Fox News Digital that the now Democratic vice presidential candidate essentially \"shut down and destroyed\" her small business, warning Americans, \"You do not want tyranny at this level.\" A mother of eight children and soon to be 18 grandchildren, Hanson said besides a speeding ticket she received as a teenager, she had always been a law-abiding citizen and owned businesses with her husband for more than 30 years. At the time the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in 2020, Hanson said The Interchange Wine & Coffee Bistro in Albert Lea, about 90 miles south of Minneapolis, had been open for eight years. Her wine and coffee bistro initially complied with the shutdown ordered that March. However, Hanson said she watched for months afterward as Walz never fully re-opened the state when it came to businesses deemed non-essential, such as the bars, restaurants, gyms, dance studios and hair salons. By contrast, the governor never shut down liquor stores, the \"big box stores\" or even strip clubs. Hanson eventually decided to re-open her business and defied Walz's renewed shutdown order for bars and restaurants six times between December 2020 and January 2021. She was convicted in December 2021 on misdemeanor charges and received the maximum sentence of 90 days and a $1,000 fine. Hanson ended up serving two-thirds of her sentence, 60 days. …Read more White House DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING ON TV: Harris’ history on immigration is completely at odds with her ad spots running now, say detractors …Read more Capitol Hill TASK FORCE GO: House Trump shooting task force takes significant step in high-profile probe …Read more NO LAUGHING MATTER: ‘Squad’ member blasts Blinken as ‘joke’ for celebrating Geneva Convention anniversary …Read more FIRST ON FOX: Ted Cruz rips into National Park Service's response to pro-Hamas DC protest …Read more Writing on the Walz 'MINI CALIFORNIA': Rural Minnesotans unleash on Gov Walz's 'very liberal' policies …Read more 'RAN AWAY': Gov.

Tim Walz (D-MN) delivered his first solo speech as the 2024 vice presidential nominee Tuesday and directly addressed the recent controversy regarding his military record. Walz, who was tapped to serve as Vice President Kamala Harris‘s running mate just one week ago, delivered remarks at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, where he told the crowd he was “damn proud” of his family’s history of military service. Walz has proven to be a fundraising boon to the Harris ticket. The campaign announced it raised more than $36 million in the initial 24 hours after Harris announced Walz as her selection on top of more than $300 million raised in July. However, former President Donald Trump, his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), and their allies have spent the past week digging into and attacking Walz over apparent inconsistencies regarding his service, specifically his decision to retire from a 24-year-long National Guard career just months before his unit was deployed to Afghanistan. Reports also resurfaced multiple videos of Walz stating he carried “weapons of war” in war after winning his first congressional election. Walz was never deployed to an active combat zone while deployed overseas, and the governor does not appear to have ever corrected statements incorrectly defining his military record. “With my dad’s encouragement, a guy who served in the Army during the Korean War, I signed up for the Army National Guard two days after my 17th birthday,” Walz, who also spent his years in the military teaching back home in Minnesota, told the AFSCME crowd Tuesday afternoon. “Then, in 2005, I felt the call of duty again, this time giving service to my country in the halls of Congress. My students inspired me to run for that office, and I was proud to make it to Washington.” “I was a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee and a champion of our men and women in uniform. I’m going to say it again as clearly as I can, I am damn proud of my service to this country,” he continued. “I firmly believe you should never degenerate another person’s service record. To anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: Thank you for your service and sacrifice.” Walz’s apparent olive branch to Vance belies a relationship that will only grow more heated over the final months of the election. Democratic operatives specifically told the Washington Examiner that, in addition to his progressive policy bona fides, Walz was selected as Harris’s running mate to help her with middle-aged white men in the Midwest and to attack Vance. During his introductory speech last week in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Minnesota governor said he “can’t wait” to debate Vance before jokingly alluding to unfounded internet rumors about the junior senator from Ohio performing sex acts on furniture in his youth. Reporting on Walz’s military service and accompanying accusations of stolen valor have received mixed reviews from the veteran community and appear to predictably split along party lines. A number of members of his old unit, including his commanding officer, have accused the governor of cowardice and disavowed his actions, but a group of more than 1,000 veterans and military families signed an open letter Tuesday claiming to be “appalled at Donald Trump and JD Vance’s politically motivated attacks” against Walz. “JD Vance’s recent comments attacking Governor Walz’s service record are disrespectful and deeply disappointing, especially given Vance’s own service — which we are also profoundly grateful for,” the letter, first obtained by USA Today, reads. “But given Donald Trump’s long record of expressing disdain for service members, veterans, and their families, it’s unsurprising that his running mate has stooped to such lows.” Following Tuesday’s remarks, Walz will begin a fundraising tour of his own that will see him hit the following five states over the next three days: California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.

Then in 2005, I felt the call of duty again, this time of being a service to my country in the halls of Congress. My students inspired me to run for that office,\" Tim said. \"I saw the United Auto Workers had a name for Trump. They called him a scab. He went to Mar-a-Lago and told his friends 'you're rich as hell and we're going to cut your taxes.' Then he turns around and tells workers their wages are too high,\" the Democrat VP candidate said.","summary":"\"Vice President Harris grew up in a middle class family and picked up shifts at McDonald’s.

This shift came after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris.Real Clear Polling's average shows Harris with a mere 0.5 percentage point lead. Some mainstream polls, such as those from Harvard and CNBC, still have Trump ahead by a few points.If you're a Trump fan, you might be crying into your pillow. How did this happen, and can Trump still win? Is Kamala the next president of the United States?Kamala Harris Time Cover Despite Being the Most Unpopular VP in HistoryTrump fans argue that Kamala has been the most unpopular vice president in modern history and the entire US population is pissed off at inflation.Trump supporters might think there's no way hundreds of thousands of people suddenly became ok with Biden/kamala's inflation overnight and actually support Kamala now. That couldn't be farther from the truth.Polls show most voters from both parties were happy with Biden out of the race. Democrats are distancing Kamala from Biden's policies as she had a minimal role in his presidency and was often sidelined.While the Trump camp is divided on what issues to target now that Biden has dropped out, every Kamala supporter, on the other hand, is just powering through any doubts they might have and giving her full support.Trump is watching as Kamala gets Obama-level energy at her rallies, and deep down, he knows Kamala is no Obama, so probably a large chunk of that energy is literally just hatred for Trump.Kamala Harris Time Cover Vs. Trump-Elon InterviewWhile the Kamala Harris Time Cover stole the show for Democrats, many tuned into Trump's return to X (formerly Twitter) to be interviewed by its new owner Elon Musk.While the interview had some interesting points, overall, Trump repeated many of the stump speech throwaways he's been repeating for six years.Here's a quick recap: \"The war had zero chance of starting if I were president,\" Trump told Elon Trump argued that his 'strong' relationship with Putin could have prevented the conflict, saying that he had even told Putin not to take action. Trump warned about the threat from \"nuclear warming,\" which he said posed a greater danger than \"global warming.\" Elon Musk may join Trump's administration if he wins the election. Harris's rise to the top of the Democratic ticket has been met with positive media coverage and endorsements from celebrities. Meanwhile, Trump's recent public appearances have unsettled his advisors and contributed to his decline in the prediction markets.How Trump Can Still Win the ElectionDespite the Kamala Harris Time Cover crowning her the new president (and they've been wrong before) this election is far from over, as Kamala has many weaknesses.Here's how Trump could exploit those to win:Weakness #1 - Limited public engagement.Kamala is avoiding unscripted interactions or events, which means they fear mistakes, negative press, gaffes, bad posturing, and perceived low status. Trump can counteract this by making himself and his policies visible and accessible. The public can exploit this by constantly hurling bullshit that could be true but is hard to disprove their way.Weakness #2 - Highly controlled messaging and context: They plan all appearances and statements. Trump can counteract by doing as many debates as possible with Harris and if he wins he may swerve the vote back to him.Weakness #3 - Focusing on positive developments. The maintenance of Kamala's image is more important than Kamala herself, to herself and her campaign. She has few appearances because they must be scripted and positive, but this means she can't afford to face genuine criticism or defend herself.Final ThoughtRegardless, we don't think Kamala will be as hard on crypto and innovation as Joe Biden was.But certainly, Trump seems better for the economy. It will be a crazy election cycle. Stay tuned.","summary":"After the Kamala Harris Time cover, which made its debut today, Harris has surged ahead of former President Donald Trump in the prediction markets.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/crypto-flips-bullish-after-kamala-harris-time-cover-democrats-leap-ahead-polymarket-3739702","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4541586/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 22:03:28","author":"Isaiah McCall","authors":["Isaiah McCall"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":254055116,"title":"Inside the tax battles Tim Walz fought — and won — in Minnesota","text":"Six years before Tim Walz was tapped to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, he was busy running for governor of Minnesota. Shortly before Election Day, Walz huddled with dozens of business leaders at a luxurious hotel off the shores of Gull Lake. Eric Gibson, then president of Ultra Machining Company, recalled asking Walz whether the Democrat believed that high corporate and state taxes hurt workers. \"We're not taxing people,\" Walz replied, according to Gibson. \"We're taxing businesses.\" For Geoff Baker, \"it was a bit of an 'oh s---' moment,\" he recalled to CNBC, confirming Gibson's account. \"That's not what I wanted to hear,\" said Baker, president of McFarland Truck Lines. Minnesota currently taxes corporate income at 9.8%. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation says that's the highest corporate tax rate of any state in the nation. Walz's approach to corporate and other business related taxes hasn't changed noticeably since that meeting on Gull Lake. Especially not since Democrats secured a trifecta majority in 2022, taking control of the state House, the Senate and the governor's office. \"It's been tense,\" said Douglas Loon, president and CEO of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, describing the trade association's relationship with Walz. The chamber has over 6,000 members, including Fortune 500 giants like Target, UnitedHealth Group and Best Buy.","summary":"Gov.

The Evangelicals for Harris group announced on Saturday that activist Ekemini Uwan will be hosting their Zoom call this week, one of many identity-based online Zoom meetings in support of the new Democratic Party nominee that have sparked controversy. Uwan has described herself on her website as a \"reparations activist whose work spans the globe, as she has advocated for global reparations on behalf of Africans and African Descendants on the floor of the United Nations three times.\" Evangelicals for Harris, formerly Evangelicals for Biden, is a project of Faith Voters, a 501(c)4 organization. With the Zoom event approaching, past statements from her about race and policy have gone viral on social media.

It’s rooted in theft. It’s rooted in plunder. It’s rooted in power. It’s rooted in privilege,\" Uwan said at an evangelical Christian racial reconciliation conference in 2019. She has also made numerous statements about law enforcement, such as calling to defund and even abolish the police as an institution. \"I would like to see at least 80% of the budget taken out and used for different services, that’s across the board around the country, then I’d like to see the police departments destroyed and rebuilt in phases. It has to happen in phases,\" she said in a July 2020 episode of her podcast. \"I mean, completely reimagining what it is, I mean, down to changing the name so it’s no longer police. Y’all are public safety guardians, okay? And you do not have access to guns so easily willy-nilly, you can't go into a situation with your gun.\" ‘THEY TAKE US FOR GRANTED’: BLACK AMERICANS SOUND OFF ON MISCONCEPTIONS DEMOCRATS HAVE ABOUT THEM She declared in October 2016 that the police \"needs to be destroyed and rebuilt. Policing was founded on the re-enslavement of Black people.\" She has also made numerous statements to the United Nations regarding reparations, including declaring Catholic and Protestant churches should pay their \"debt\" to Africans and their international diaspora. She also has made more conventional progressive demands, such as calling to abolish the electoral college, establishing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and defending critical race theory. Fox News Digital reached out to Uwan about her past comments ranging from referring to Whiteness as \"wicked\" to calling for the police to be destroyed. The activist defended her statements by declaring she \"told the truth about the wickedness of whiteness,\" and said that people of European ancestry identifying as White is what enables White supremacy. \"This statement is not about the intrinsic dignity and image of God within people of European descent. Whiteness is not a synonym for white people; the racial construct of whiteness refers to an identity rooted in the evil lie of white supremacy,\" she wrote. \"The call to divest is a call to dismantle the racist lies of white supremacy for white people. I told the truth about the wickedness of whiteness, which is a central pillar of the racial caste system, the need to divest from it, and their need to reclaim and embrace their God-given ethnicity.\" \"I preached the gospel and told them there is grace and that the blood covers. I am an anti-racist Public Theologian. I hold up a mirror, make people face the racist reflection staring back at them, and give them hope found in the gospel of Jesus Christ,\" Uwan said. \"I’m not perfect in my work, but I prayerfully employ discernment and pursue wisdom, precision, and fidelity. I know that calling out well-guarded idols can produce protective, defensive, and blatantly hostile responses. My prophetic ministry, at its best, is fueled by agape love.\" Fox News Digital also reached out for comment from both the Harris campaign and the Faith Voters organization behind the upcoming Zoom event and did not receive an immediate response.
