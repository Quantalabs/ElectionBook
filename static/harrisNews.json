For the unversed, the former US Vice President is currently on her 107 Days book tour to promote what the project's website describes as \"the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.\"On September 27, 2025, X page @VigilantFox posted a clip of Maher criticizing Harris' book and the tour, stating that listening to the former Vice President every day for years is more than what he can take. He put forth his view, saying how the more the public got to know Harris, \"the less they liked her.\"Commenting on the book and its concept, Bill Maher said, “You don’t need 107 days. You tell people your plan. ‘This is what I am for. This is my thing.’ You’re selling something. You’re selling a vacuum cleaner. If I’m selling a vacuum cleaner, I’ll tell you why I think it’s best. I’m not going to tell you every goddamn day for two years. Did I tell you about the attachment that gets under the, yeah, you did. You told me a thousand times!”Moreover, during a recent episode of his Club Random Podcast dated September 22, 2025, Bill Maher revealed who he voted for in the 2024 election. Despite criticizing her book tour, Maher admitted to having voted for Kamala Harris, stating, “I always say to my woke friends, we voted for the same person. You’re just why she lost. That’s my line to them and I will stand by that.\"Bill Maher proceeded to comment on Harris' opponent and the current President of the US, Donald Trump, stating that he is straightening out the things that required mending, dubbing some of his approach as \"colossally wrong.\"More details about Kamala Harris' 107 Days memoir explored in the wake of Bill Maher's comments on the projectKamala Harris' 107 Days is a \"candid, personal account of the shortest presidential campaign in modern history\", as described by the former US Vice President via an Instagram post dated September 10, 2025.According to NBC's report dated September 23, 2025, which includes excerpts from Harris' memoir, the former US Vice President expressed her feelings toward former US President Joe Biden. Recalling the time she spoke to her campaign staff for the first time in July at the Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters, Harris wrote: “My feelings for him were grounded in warmth and loyalty, but they had become complicated, over time, with hurt and disappointment.\"Moreover, Harris mentioned the conversation she had with Biden when he dropped out of the presidential race, recalling how the Bidens wanted to wait for a few days before endorsing her. However, the former Vice President talked Joe Biden out of the plan as it would hurt her chances of securing delegates to ensure a place in the party's nomination.Kamala Harris also wrote about when Joe Biden spoke to the nation to explain his decision to drop out of the presidential race, \"it was almost nine minutes into the eleven-minute address before he mentioned me.\"Additionally, Kamala Harris mentioned another instance of the same, citing Joe Biden's speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2024, stating: \"He spoke for nearly an hour, detailing the accomplishments of our administration. It was a legacy speech for him, not an argument for me, and he was entitled to it. But if we waited for some personal stories about working with me and what qualities he had seen that led him to endorse me, they weren't there.\"Kamala Harris' election campaign memoir, 107 Days, was released on September 23, 2025. In addition to expressing her feelings about Joe Biden's endorsement of her, the former Vice President has also opened up about her decision not to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, among other instances.","summary":"American comedian and actor Bill Maher recently commented on Kamala Harris' extended book tour.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/you-don-t-need-107-days-bill-maher-reacts-kamala-harris-extended-book-tour-saying-people-like-less-know","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/09/fb165-17589845890593-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 23:21:28","author":"Divya Singh Rana","authors":["Divya Singh Rana"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":364075196,"title":"Mikie Sherrill remains silent on issue of trans athletes in women's sports as Trump calls her out for it","text":"New Jersey Democrat candidate for governor Mikie Sherrill has not addressed her congressional voting record on bills related to transgender athletes in women's sports. President Donald Trump called out Sherrill for her stance on the issue in a Truth Social post on Thursday. \"Sherrill wants Open Borders (again!), men playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender for everyone, and all of the things that almost DESTROYED America,\" Trump wrote. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Fox News Digital has reached out to Sherrill's campaign multiple times for clarification on her stance on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports, but has not received a response. Sherrill has been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue. She voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, twice, when the bill was first proposed in 2023, and again this past February when it was re-introduced. Sherrill has also co-sponsored the Equality Act, but also co-sponsored the Transgender Bill of Rights, which more explicitly \"guarantees certain rights for transgender and nonbinary people with respect to public services and accommodations.\" Sherrill is a self-proclaimed \"advocate for women’s athletics.\" She previously proposed the Women in NCAA Sports Act in the U.S. House of Representatives alongside Rep. Maria Salazar D-Fla., and led a resolution to honor Billie Jean King with the Congressional Gold Medal. However, she has recently been the subject of criticism on social media for her congressional voting record on the issue of trans athletes in women's sports. Former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer and women's sports activist Paula Scanlan, the first UPenn swimmer to speak up about the school's Lia Thomas controversy in 2022, called out Sherrill on X over the issue this week. The New Jersey GOP attacked Sherrill for this record directly in a campaign graphic last week. Sherrill's opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, mentioned this issue for Sherrill in a post back in July. New Jersey is the original home state of well-known transgender track and field athlete Sadie Schreiner, who previously competed for Rochester Institute for Technology and went viral multiple times for posting videos sharing the athlete's first-hand experience as a biological male trans athlete competing against, and often dominating, females. Schreiner is from Hillsborough, according to the athlete's RIT Athletics page. Schreiner has filed a lawsuit against Princeton University for an alleged incident at a May 3 women's race. Schreiner's lawsuit claimed the athlete attempted to participate in the women's 200-meter sprint at the Larry Ellis Invitational as one of the 141 participants unattached to a university or club. The suit alleges officials told Schreiner the athlete could not participate 15 minutes before the race began. Schreiner alleged the university violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which designates \"gender identity or expression\" as a protected status. Schreiner has since filed a second lawsuit against SUNY Genesco for being banned from a women's race in March, per multiple reports. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS Back in January, a New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. Among 1,022 Republicans, that number was 94%. The 81 independents who were interviewed represented the group with the most reluctance to say transgender athletes shouldn't be allowed to compete. Just 64% said they were against it, while 26% refused to answer. Just 3% of the Democrats and 1% of the Republicans refused to answer. Nearly 70% of Americans say biological men should not be permitted to compete in women's sports, according to a Gallup poll last year. Additional data suggests the issue impacted the 2024 election. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, prominent Democratic figures have backpedaled on their party's support for males in women's sports, including Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom and even Kamala Harris. In her recent book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote.

Several polls suggest they are—and the shift could have major implications.\n\nThe New York Times recently spoke with 11 young voters who backed Trump in the 2024 election but now say they regret their decision. When asked to describe life under Trump, they used words like “aggressive,” “overpowering,” and “reckless.” Frustration ran across his policies—from hard-line immigration stances to the lackluster economy and his handling of foreign conflicts.\n\nIn the latest edition of the Times’ “America in Focus” project, Trump voters in their late 20s and early 30s aren’t impressed with his presidency explained why. \n\nMustafa, a 28-year-old Republican from Georgia, didn’t hold back.\n\n“The way that he’s been handling things recently, dictatorship,” he said.\n\nThis represents a real shift. Trump’s support among young voters was a key factor in his 2024 victory. Yet an August survey from the Pew Research Center found only 69% of Trump 2024 voters under age 35 still approve of his performance—a steep 23-percentage-point drop since the start of his second term. \n\nThe trend started showing up earlier this year. As far back as April, his approval rating among voters under 30 had fallen to a -27 points on net, even though he had lost those voters by 10 points to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris last year. Young people are clearly driving much of his slumping approval rating today.\n\nThe issues driving the discontent are telling. A spring poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, which surveyed more than 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds, found opposition is especially high on tariffs (19% support, 50% oppose) and Trump’s economic policies. Among those struggling financially, 51% believe Trump’s policies will hurt their finances over the next few years, while just 18% think the policies will help.\n\nYoung voters generally don’t hold deeply conservative views and are highly sensitive to rising costs, including housing, student debt, and stagnant wages. They also tend to have weaker partisan loyalties, with many identifying as independents or rating both parties poorly.\n\nThose traits helped draw many young voters to Trump in 2024. But even as his support among this demographic grew, it was always fragile—seemingly driven more by a desire to shake up the political establishment than a wholehearted endorsement of his policies.\n\nNow, Trump has become the establishment, and young voters—including a notable share of young Republicans—are beginning to push back. This isn’t just a smattering of dissenting voices, though their stories matter too. Even some of his biggest supporters are starting to question his leadership.\n\nMustafa, who works in the automotive industry, told the Times that he expected Trump to “end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East,” but instead, he sees the U.S. “focused on Ukraine and Israel more than I feel like the United States.”\n\nQuinton, a 33-year-old account manager from Georgia, blasted Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\n“The job market is just not good at all. I have a lot of friends and family members who are struggling to find work,” he said. “He made it seem like he was going to look out for the working-class people, and it’s the exact opposite.”\n\nJohn, a 28-year-old delivery driver in Florida, voiced similar frustration. \n\n“Even though my specific investment in cryptocurrency is doing good overall, he has ruined the cryptocurrency market for a lot of cryptocurrencies,” he said. “This is not really what I voted for.”\n\nOthers pointed to Trump’s draconian deportation plans. Kelsey, a 32-year-old independent in the tech industry, said, “I just think it’s way too aggressive. Even if it’s the worst of the criminals, can they be treated more humanely once they get to the deportation centers?” \n\nSarah, a 32-year-old engineer in Montana, added that she’s having a “hard time trusting in my current democracy” when she doesn’t see constitutional principles “honored” in those processes.\n\nYoung voters aren’t the only group pulling away. Polling shows Latino voters have soured on Trump as well, partly over the same immigration agenda.\n\nWhether this disillusionment translates into anything concrete—like more Democratic votes in next year’s midterms or a revolt against Trump-aligned candidates in 2028—is still an open question. But for now, the warning signs are flashing.","summary":"Are young voters finally turning on President Donald Trump?

Of course I do.”\n\nHarris – who was in Philadelphia plugging her new book “107 Days” about the 2024 loss to now President Donald Trump, declined to say whether the tour is the start of a political comeback that includes running for president in 2028.\n\nBut insiders told the Journal that the book — and critical reaction to it– shows that Harris’ leadership is faltering in the party. \n\nSome longtime supporters told the outlet they are ready to move on from Harris, while more vocal Dems are openly airing their frustrations with Harris’s re-emergence — especially her book, which is critical of ex-President Joe Biden and her pool of choices for a running mate, before settling on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nIn her tome, she characterized Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as overly ambitious and ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, as someone who’d be politically risky running alongside a black woman.\n\nAshley Etienne, Harris’ former communications director, called the ex-veep’s book a a missed opportunity for not focusing on the Biden administration’s accomplishments and her role in them as the first female vice president.\n\n“I would have advised her to write a different book, one that cements her legacy,” Etienne told The Journal. \n\nFaiz Shakir, who ran Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, said the book affirms concerns people had about Harris.\n\n“Her campaign struggled with being a campaign of conviction, of clarity, of deep, principled positions,” Shakir said.\n\n“It’s a sign of weak leadership to just start blaming these kind of outside actors for your own shortcomings. It hurts the Democratic Party.”\n\nHarris, however, insisted she didn’t write tell-all book, claiming “it’s about just presenting people with a journal of my experience running for president of the United States.”\n\nHarris’ biggest liability on the national stage remains how she stayed mum as Biden’s mental health plummeted month after month. \n\nIn her book, Harris notes Biden “got tired,” but said, “I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”\n\nHarris recently angered the growing far left contingent in her party by failing to mention socialist Zohran Mamdani by name in an MSNBC interview, instead saying she supports “the Democrat” in the race for NYC mayor.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Harris was more definitive, saying “No, I did endorse Mamdani,”\n\nWhen asked about the growing tensions within the moderate and far-left wings of her party playing out in the Big Apple and elsewhere, Harris added, “There is a lot of consensus around the priorities of this moment, and that’s where I’m focused.”\n\nTh ex-veep signed with A-list talent agency Creative Artists Agency in February to represent her in speaking and publishing engagements and is demanding $250,000 a speech, sources told the outlet.","summary":"Kamala Harris says she still views herself a top leader within the Democratic Party – at least in her own mind.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/27/us-news/kamala-harris-believe-shes-still-a-leader-in-the-democratic-party-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/112267527.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dHFaOXhv-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 19:42:31","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":364017846,"title":"Bill Maher says to bring back 'old America,' the left must tone down their radical progressivism","text":"On Friday's episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" host Bill Maher argued that to get back to what he called \"old America,\" Democrats must scale back their more radically progressive ideology. \"If we are ever going to get back to the old America, that's got to be the Democrats' part of the bargain.

It’s a campaign that began soon after Trump returned to office and one that critics see as an abuse of power that puts every American who dares to criticize the president at risk of retaliation.\n\n“Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Comey indictment came less than a week after Trump installed a former White House aide and confidant to the role of U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The president had forced the ousterof his previous pick because he wasn’t sufficiently responsive to calls from Trump to bring charges against his longtime targets.\n\n“This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power,” Warner said. “Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores.”\n\nAn escalation in retribution\n\nThe first former president convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to conceal an alleged affair — Trump won the White House despite a host of other legal troubles over his alleged retention of classified information after leaving the White House in 2021 and his role in stoking denials of his 2020 electoral defeat that culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThursday’s moves were the latest in a concerted effort by Trump to wield the vast powers of his office in unparalleled ways to punish his enemies since returning to the Oval Office in January. During his campaign, Trump made clear this was his intention if he returned to office.\n\n“In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,” he said in 2023. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nEarlier this week, he signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa — short for “anti-fascists” — as a domestic terrorist organization, a move testing broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\n\nThe Thursday memo went further, targeting liberal-leaning groups and donors, and “represents a significant abuse of power where the government is either changing the law or bending definitions to try and investigate and punish their political opponents in a way that is really unprecedented,” said Caitlin Legacki, of Americans Against Government Censorship, which was founded to fight the Trump administration’s weaponization of the federal government against its political rivals.\n\nAs for Comey, she said, “It reeks of selective prosecution, it reeks of vindictive targeting and calls into question the integrity of many of the charges being brought by the office.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, denied Friday that he’s on a campaign of retribution.\n\n“It’s about justice, really. It’s not revenge, it’s about justice. It’s also about the fact that you can’t let this go on,” he told reporters. “They are sick, radical left people and they can’t get away with it.”\n\nAsked who is next on his list, he responded: “It’s not a list, but I think there’ll be others.”\n\nA widespread pressure campaign\n\nBeyond Comey, Trump has also pressured prosecutors to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a massive civil fraud case against the president. Attorney General Pam Bondi last month named a special prosecutor to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against James and Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another top Trump target. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Justice Department has also begun examining mortgage fraud allegations against Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor who’s won success in lower courts in challenging Trump’s effort to remove her from her job in a move she says is designed to erode the central bank’s independence. Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow him to oust her.\n\nOn Friday, Trump called on Microsoft to fire former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, whom he has long held a grudge against, from her position as president of global affairs.\n\n“Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” he wrote. Trump previously stripped her of her security clearance, along with numerous others.\n\nHe has also stripped Secret Service protection from a slew of former officials, including his 2024 Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, members of former President Joe Biden’s family, and people who’ve fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump has also targeted major institutions, revoking security clearances for attorneys at law firms he disfavors, pulling billions of dollars in federal research funds from elite universities, and securing multimillion-dollar settlements against media organizations in lawsuits that were widely regarded as weak cases.\n\nEarlier this week, he threatened ABC over the network’s decision to allow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to return to the airwaves.\n\n“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump crowed.\n\nAnd his administration has fired or reassigned federal employees for their earlier work, including prosecutors who worked on cases against him. The Justice Department also fired Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was politically motivated.\n\nTrump celebrates the indictment\n\nTrump, meanwhile, cheered the Comey indictment, saying “JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” had been served, even as Comey denied wrongdoing and expressed confidence in being acquitted at trial.\n\nThe indictment was the culmination of a pressure campaign that burst into public view over the weekend when Trump aired his frustrations with Bondi on his social media site and demanded she move forward with charges against Comey, James and Schiff.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” he wrote on Truth Social Saturday. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer and a White House aide, to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to quicken the pace after the ouster of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to bring charges against James.\n\nThe charges against Comey came even as prosecutors in the office had written a memo detailing concerns about the pursuit of an indictment and their likelihood of success at trial.\n\nThe former FBI director said in a video he’s innocent but knew “standing up to Donald Trump” would come with costs.\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I am innocent,” Comey said.","summary":"“Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” Trump wrote.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/09/27/trump-retribution-campaign-microsoft-fire-former-deputy-attorney-general-lisa-monaco/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2169585602-e1758986314867.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 15:26:29","author":"Jill Colvin,The Associated Press","authors":["Jill Colvin","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":364074514,"title":"Trump demands Microsoft fire global affairs head Lisa Monaco","text":"President Donald Trump declared Friday that Microsoft needs to fire Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs.\n\nCiting her roles as “a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet ‘Boss’ Attorney General Merrick Garland,” Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco’s current role gives her access to “Highly Sensitive Information,” which he deemed “unacceptable.”\n\n“It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” he wrote.\n\nAs Trump noted, Monaco worked with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden, including as a deputy attorney general under the Biden administration.

Phil Murphy (D) in 2021 and now faces same-old, same-old hack Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill.\n\nIf Garden Staters want more of Murphy’s misery — through-the-roof utility bills, nation-leading taxes, woke schools, decaying infrastructure, oppressive crime and massive state debt — they should race to back Rep. Sherrill.\n\nIf not, Ciattarelli is the clear choice.\n\nStart with Sherrill’s professed top priority: “affordability.”\n\nHer plan to tame costs boils down to: more handouts (at taxpayer expense), targeting mysterious “bad actors,” locking in pricey “clean energy” and, of course, fighting big, bad Orange Man.\n\nNo joke: She actually blames Donald Trump for high prices — even though inflation struck during the Biden years (when Trump was out of office), and was fueled by reckless federal spending that she herself, along with her fellow Democrats in Congress, rammed through.\n\n“There’s no cost higher than the price that all of us will have to pay if we don’t stand up” to Trump, she huffs. \n\nFunny: Lots of other states manage to keep their utility bills and taxes down even while supporting Trump…\n\nHer pathetic plan to lower grocery bills centers on going after “large corporations [that] jack up food prices and take advantage of consumers during a crisis.”\n\nSounds like she’s cribbing from socialist Zohran Mamdani’s book on magically repealing the laws of supply and demand.\n\nShe’d “transform New Jersey’s energy picture” by building “cheaper and cleaner energy generation” and “hit our emissions and clean-air goals.”\n\nHello? It’s precisely Democrats’ drive for zero emissions that has sent electric bills soaring: A report by Affordable Energy for New Jersey cites a $1.4 trillion price tag for Murphy’s greener-than-green Energy Master Plan.\n\nSherrill doesn’t just vow to lock in that plan, she wants to double down on it, .\n\nIn other words, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result — and that’s not remotely the only Sherrill policy that fits that definition of insanity.\n\nShe’ll stick to the Murphy policies that ram DEI into every school district, leave property and income taxes ever-growing and fail to control crime. \n\nHilariously, her idea for providing relief for the state’s onerous taxes (the nation’s second-highest, after New York) is (get this!) to “close tax loopholes” — i.e., raise taxes even more.\n\nAnd, like Murphy, she opposes letting parents opt out of LGBTQ education.\n\nSherrill also has a trust problem: She pretended not to know that her stock holdings have soared by $7 million since she entered Congress — most likely because she doesn’t want to answer questions about her “good luck.”\n\nBy contrast, Ciattarelli, a CPA and former business owner, would reverse the Murphy agenda, relying on common-sense ideas to tackle Jersey’s biggest ills:\n\nActually lowering income taxes, for both individuals and businesses, which could then pass the savings on to customers via lower prices.\n\nChopping state spending dramatically and limiting budget growth to the inflation rate.\n\nScrapping Jersey’s sanctuary-state policy and banning sanctuary cities.\n\nPushing through a new Energy Master Plan to keep costs down by allowing for new sources of reliable and affordable electricity while repealing “unrealistic and unaffordable mandates” to electrify everything from cars to household appliances and home heating.\n\nFixing bail-reform flaws and tapping sensible judges who’ll keep repeat offenders behind bars.\n\nExpanding charter schools and school choice for families.\n\nYes, the Garden State has leaned blue for years, but there’s a limit to how much pain even liberals can take.\n\nLast November, Jersey voters gave Sherrill’s boogey man, Donald Trump, a full 46% of their votes, making Kamala Harris’ six-point margin of victory the smallest the Garden State’s given a Democratic presidential hopeful in 32 years.\n\nAnd last week, an Emerson College poll had the race locked in a dead heat, with Sherrill and Ciattarelli each pulling 43% support.\n\nHer party knows she’s in trouble: The Democratic National Committee just doubled its spending on the campaign to $3 million, the most it’s ever shelled out in Jersey for an off-year election.\n\nSo hopes are high for Ciattarelli. He’s the Garden State’s best chance at shedding the blues once and for all.","summary":"New Jersey voters sick of the blue-state blues have a shot at some relief this November, by backing Republican Jack Ciattaralli for governor.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/27/opinion/the-post-endorses-jack-ciatarelli-for-new-jersey-governor/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/republican-jack-ciattarelli-responds-questions-111917547_5d7092.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/v5iZkkaE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 14:54:52","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":363983578,"title":"JD Vance makes scathing remark after Kamala Harris leaked surprising comments Trump made to her in private","text":"Vice President JD Vance has had some choice words for Kamala Harris in a recent interview that comes right after she revealed something Trump said to her.\n\nThe VP appeared in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News for The Ingraham Angle on Friday, when he was asked about former Vice President Harris’ new memoir 107 Days, which tells all about her presidential campaign in 2024.\n\nIn particular, Ingraham quoted a moment when Harris called Vance ‘a juvenile and shapeshifter’ when Vance let loose about his own opinion of her.\n\nVance and Harris were not very interactive in-person during the elections; however, they did make mention of each other from time to time when up on the podium.\n\nFor Vance, he’s been clear that he doesn’t think she has what it takes to be a political leader, but now, he’s expanded on that claim with a far more scathing remark.\n\n“She is now blaming the campaign, her loss, for the fact that it was short,” the Fox News host claimed. “That’s one of the main things she cites. If she had more time, she could have gotten more traction.”\n\nTo this, Vance said: “The problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short. It was too long.\n\n“When people actually listened to what she had to say, per polling, it went down and down and down. A 150-day campaign, three additional senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Trump won 312 electoral votes and Harris won 226.\n\nVance said that the votes speak for themselves, and it was a matter of people coming to their own conclusions the more she spoke.\n\n“The more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there is no substance there,” Vance said. \n\n“When we disagreed with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate the viewpoint. I listen to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes.”\n\nHe went on to say she doesn’t know how to speak to her audience, saying: “That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s going to continue to be the problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint and articulate it for the American people.”\n\nHis chat comes after Harris made her own comments about Trump in her book, specifically speaking of the time after his second assassination attempt made by Ryan Routh.\n\nShe explained that while Trump would say bad things about her in public, when it came to talking with her behind closed doors, all he had to say were good things.\n\nHe allegedly said to her when she spoke to him after the incident: \"How do I say bad things about you now? I'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\"\n\nTrump also is said to have admitted that his daughter Ivanka was a 'big fan' of Harris'.\n\nHowever, Harris didn’t buy it.\n\n\"He’s a con man.

I find that it is increasingly rare that people from opposing sides of politics can even be near each other — let alone be friends or have a meaningful conversation. This is most certainly a sad state of affairs. It didn’t used to be this way, and in countless conversations with both Democrats and Republicans, I do feel that blame can be placed on both sides.\n\nThat being said, I have witnessed something very intriguing this past year that began slowly and has only increased with each passing month. Almost every single Republican I have spoken to over the past year, no matter how far right they are, for the most part has nothing but great things to say about Mexico’s president. Think about that for a moment. At a time when political polarization in the U.S. is at extreme levels, when there is increasingly little if any common ground being found on issues, when respect for the other side is at embarrassingly low levels, there is widespread respect and admiration from Sheinbaum.\n\nSo why is that? In countless conversations with Republican friends, I can boil it down to 7 key areas:\n\n1. Professional Demeanor. In politics, as in life, how you look, act and dress matters a lot. Sheinbaum always looks and dresses sharp. She always looks professional. She has a magnetic smile and carries herself with elegance. She exudes class.\n\n2. Education. This is a funny one. Although she graduated from Berkeley — a university not exactly associated with right-leaning political ideology — people are willing to look past that. Why? Having an undergraduate degree in physics matters to people. Having a Ph.D. matters to people. Being a scientist matters to people. Being part of a team that won a Nobel Peace Prize matters to people. She clearly is very intelligent and worked hard to achieve the level of academic success few reach.\n\n3. Hard work ethic. Sheinbaum works tirelessly. She is always active and her every move is covered on government social media sites. Every weekday morning she has a press conference at 7:30 a.m. for 60-90 minutes. Imagine preparing for a press conference to take any question on any topic as well as do a deep dive presentation on a given topic every single day! Every weekend she hits the road or the skies, traveling to different cities and states around the country to meet with people and do massive rallies to connect with Mexicans of all economic levels. She is visible. She is present. She is a constant cheerleader for the country. And people like and respect that.\n\n4. She walks the walk and talks the talk. In an age where many people have become completely cynical about politicians being corrupt — from insider trading to nepotism to closed-door fundraisers to access to billionaires’ private jets, few people believe that politicians actually do what they say. Sheinbaum has won admiration and respect by living a simple life, even as president. She — as did her predecessor — eschewed the presidential palace to live in a small apartment in the National Palace. She very often is seen being driven around in modest SUV’s on her weekend road trips. On two of her international trips, to Brazil for the G20 meeting and then to Canada for a G7 meeting, she flew commercial airlines — in economy class!\n\n5. She has embraced the business community. Often times, political rhetoric from the left leaves the business community feeling alienated. Correct or not, the business community often feels that some politicians on the left view them solely as a force that must be constrained or a source of income that must be extracted. They feel that there is not an appreciation or respect for the jobs that are created, taxes that are paid, or soft power that is projected through their efforts. Sheinbaum, unlike her predecessor, was quick to publicly embrace the business community. She created a business advisory council and named a successful, well-known business leader, Altagracia Gómez, to lead it. Every Thursday she dedicates her morning press conferences to business and the economy, and often has members of the business community presenting and sharing updates on new investments or initiatives. Her secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, was a very respected leader in the business community and led Mexico in the previous round of the USMCA negotiations during the first Trump presidency.\n\n6. She has taken some real tangible actions against the cartels and in the drug trade. No reasonable person expects her to solve these issues overnight, but she has made high profile arrests, handed over criminals to the U.S., worked with the DEA, sent troops to the border, shut down fentanyl labs, and recently announced a security agreement with the United States. She has shown a dramatic difference from her predecessor in her level of understanding of the significance of the problem to the U.S. and demonstrated sincerity in her willingness to solve it.\n\n7. She has put on a masterclass in how to work with Trump. My friends respect that she has learned how to work with Trump. She has demonstrated patience and restraint. She has focused on data, dialogue and the mutual benefits of free trade rather than threatening to respond to Trump’s tariffs. She has maintained her professionalism as she has drawn red lines that cannot be crossed with respect to Mexico’s sovereignty. I have often heard that she has been the best example of a politician working under the pressure of the Trump administration. This is especially admirable given how dependent the Mexican economy is on the U.S., which puts her at a significant disadvantage in negotiations.\n\nSo what can Democrats learn from all of this? A lot! At the risk of getting skewered by my Democratic friends, I think there are four key learnings from Sheinbaum that the U.S. left should consider.\n\n1. Engaging in “an eye for an eye” politics with a leader like Trump is a losing strategy. He excels at that style of engagement, and it is nearly impossible to beat him at his own game. Overcoming a political opponent by simply mirroring their tactics rarely works.\n\n2. Creating an adversarial relationship with the business community is a losing strategy. Especially when there is a much larger economic war that must be won against China. Like it or not, the choice we are left with is to embrace our business community and try to influence the actions we want from them, or accept an increasing level of Chinese influence and dominance across the business spectrum.\n\n3. The professionalism and perception of a candidate’s demeanor and background matters — often more than policy ideas. For example, some voters may agree with the policy ideas of certain politicians, but find their public persona to be a barrier. A candidate like Bernie Sanders might have some good policy ideas, but many people are deterred by the perception that he is an “angry socialist.” Elizabeth Warren might have some good policy ideas, but her tone is often perceived as lecturing. AOC might be a dynamic speaker, but many people focus on her prior career as a bartender as a shorthand for her perceived lack of experience. I am not making personal judgements on these politicians, but to ignore people’s perceptions has proven to be a mistake.\n\n4. Walking the walk and talking the talk matters. Nobody likes a hypocrite, and politicians whose actions appear to contradict their words risk losing public trust — especially when they criticize others for similar behavior. When a political party’s messaging focuses on inequality or critiques the wealthy, certain actions can create a powerful perception of hypocrisy, whether justified or not. Voters notice things like Nancy Pelosi’s stock trading, Bernie Sanders taking private jets, Hunter Biden getting lucrative consulting jobs, or prominent party members like the Clintons, the Obamas, or Kamala Harris enjoying a lavish lifestyle with the same wealthy class their rhetoric often targets. Al Gore faced criticism for talking about the threats of global warming while flying around the world in private jets to attend conferences. While politicians on both sides of the aisle face this kind of scrutiny, when a party’s core message is about championing the common person against powerful interests, these perceptions of hypocrisy can be especially damaging.\n\nWe live in interesting political times. A day doesn’t go by in which I don’t feel a mix of fear, anxiety, stress and concern about the state of politics in the world. But there are glimmers of hope. There are politicians that provide inspiration. There are times when the political divide is crossed to make progress. We all just have to work harder at making it work, be more open minded to what the other side is saying, and learn what we can from examples like President Sheinbaum.\n\nTravis Bembenek is the CEO of Mexico News Daily and has been living, working or playing in Mexico for nearly 30 years.","summary":"The president's level-headed professionalism and her embrace of the business community has earned her respect among U.S. conservatives, Travis Bembenek writes.\n\n\nThe post Why my Republican friends like Sheinbaum, and what Democrats can learn from her: A perspective from our CEO appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/opinion/republicans-like-sheinbaum-ceo-perspective/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1047421_Sheinbaum-La-Transformacion-Avanza-Tlaxcala_impreso.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 12:00:16","author":"Travis Bembenek","authors":["Travis Bembenek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.369},{"id":364079620,"title":"Kamala Harris’s new book details her steep challenges without acknowledging her failures","text":"Kamala Harris’s book 107 Days confirms two truths: Joe Biden never should have sought re-election and she did not belong on a national ticket.\n\nBiden was snared by Father Time and hubris. The 46th president was not the transformational figure he saw in the mirror. More than half the US rated him a failure.\n\n“People hate Joe Biden,” Harris quotes David Plouffe, her senior strategist and an Obama White House veteran, as saying.\n\nWhat’s unstated is that Harris was never a vote-magnet. When she ran for attorney general of California in 2010, she won by less than 1%, a margin of fewer than 80,000 votes in a deep blue state. Seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, her bid ended in December 2019, two months before the Iowa caucus.\n\nFast forward to 2024. Harris’s second White House run was hardly conventional, plunged as she was into the maelstrom with just those 107 Days to go. Clearly, thanks to Biden and his enablers, Harris faced steep challenges. Nonetheless, timidity and indecision pocked her campaign. Fear of being overshadowed led her to pick a disheveled dad for vice-president. No one foisted the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, on Harris. He became her prime-time emotional support pet, all the same.\n\n“There was a feeling that we needed to feed the beast,” she confides. “But I knew that beast would eviscerate me if I wasn’t properly prepared.”\n\nThat moment of proper preparation failed to arrive.\n\nNow Harris unloads on Walz, lacerating him for his poor debate, accusing him of falling into a trap. With cameras rolling, JD Vance, then an Ohio senator, played Mr Nice Guy instead of a pit bull, lulling Walz into somnolent irrelevance.\n\n“When Tim fell for it and started nodding and smiling at JD’s fake bipartisanship, I moaned to Doug [Emhoff, her husband], ‘What is happening?’” Harris recalls. “I told the television screen: ‘You’re not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate.’”\n\nHarris is not finished.\n\n“The following weekend, Saturday Night Live did a sketch in which actors posed as Doug and me, sitting on our couch, watching the debate. While I did not in fact spit out wine, it was otherwise uncanny in its portrait of our evening.”\n\nSNL gifted Harris a cameo, a consolation prize at best.\n\nWalz was not the pick of Harris’s dreams. That honor goes to Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, population 103,000, a fraction of the size of a congressional district. He quit the 2020 race on 1 March, months after Harris, after sharing Iowa with Bernie Sanders, then spent four years as transportation secretary under Biden. Harris felt she couldn’t pick him, because he was a gay man and she was a woman of color. Harris’s campaign memoir may be many things. Profiles in Courage, it is not.\n\nHarris betrays shortcomings on policy. She says little that is coherent about the border or inflation.\n\n“Immigration had surged, and to some it felt like an invasion: we couldn’t gaslight the people who felt that way by denying the problem,” she half-heartedly acknowledges.\n\n“We did not succeed in making a passionate case for a complete immigration overhaul that combined securing the border with a better legal mechanism for the people who arrive here with a dream of success and contribution.”\n\nIn plain English, the electorate refused to buy what Harris tried to sell.\n\nRegardless, Harris does not grapple with the incompatibility of porous borders on the one hand, and Obamacare on the other. “Open immigration can’t exist with a strong social safety net,” to quote Paul Krugman. “If you’re going to assure healthcare and a decent income to everyone, you can’t make that offer global.” The costs are too high for enough voters to stomach both.\n\nIn the end, Donald Trump drew nearly even with Harris among Hispanic voters. In southern Texas, thousands backed Trump, after rebuffing him four years earlier.\n\nHarris failed to make the case that inflation was “transitory”. She bathes in self-praise for breaking a Senate tie on the Inflation Reduction Act. But congressional titles mean little.\n\n“Part of the challenge of this very short campaign,” she writes, “was that we had to focus on needs that felt more immediate, like how to deal with the grocery bill or the cost of childcare.”\n\nThat problem didn’t suddenly arise. The administration appeared clueless, in much the same way the Trump administration now claims prices aren’t rising.\n\nHarris also elides the role of identity politics as a factor in her defeat. In 2019, she authored The Truths We Hold, signaling her intent to vie for the nomination by running left, seemingly unaware Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren had more credibly staked out that lane.\n\n“We need to speak truth: that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces,” Harris proclaimed.\n\nUnlike Barack Obama in his 2004 convention speech or in The Audacity of Hope, his 2006 book, Harris left little room for nuance. Nor is she afflicted with a surplus of self-awareness.\n\n“I wish I could have gotten the message across that there isn’t a distinction between ‘they/them’ and ‘you,’” she writes without a hint of irony, referring to a brutally effective Republican ad on the issue of transgender rights.\n\n“The pronoun that matters is ‘we’,” Harris says. Now.\n\nPro-tip: faculty lounge orthodoxies and campus activist jargon can play poorly outside ivy-covered walls.\n\nHarris also reminisces about “A-list talents such as James Taylor and Yo-Yo Ma” headlining a fundraiser in Martha’s Vineyard. A cultural chasm divides blue-collar voters from such preppy purlieus. Harris offers no prescriptions for healing the breach. As a politician, she lagged among voters without four-year degrees.\n\n“There is so much at stake,” she intones. “I cannot fail these people.” But she did.\n\n 107 Days is published in the US by Simon & Schuster","summary":"In 107 Days, Harris leaves little room for nuance – nor is she afflicted with a surplus of self-awareness\n\nKamala Harris’s book 107 Days confirms two truths: Joe Biden never should have sought re-election and she did not belong on a national ticket.\n\nBiden was snared by Father Time and hubris.

Here's what she said","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' highly anticipated book detailing her experiences on the unprecedented 2024 campaign trail only included three mentions of Michelle Obama, the majority of which were quotes about the former first lady and prominent Democrat voice, a Fox News Digital review of the memoir found. The name \"Michelle\" or \"Michelle Obama\" appears in the book, \"107 Days,\" only three times across its 300 pages, including two mentions related to the Obamas' delayed public endorsement of the vice president to serve as the 2024 Democratic nominee for president. \"Saddle up! Joe did what I hoped he would do. But you have to earn it,\" former President Barack Obama told Harris when the pair shared a conversation about a presidential endorsement following then-President Joe Biden dropping out of the race in July 2024. \"Michelle and I are supportive but not going to put a finger on the scale right now. Let Joe have his moment. Think through timing,\" Obama continued, according to Harris' notes of their conversation, which she published in her book. OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE In another section of the book, Harris details that on July 26, 2024, the Obamas endorsed Harris through a video message after holding off an endorsement since July 21, 2024. \"The big news of the day for my campaign wasn’t news to me. Barack and Michelle Obama had decided the time was right to endorse me. They’d wanted to make a film of them calling me, and it was now up on social media,\" she wrote in a second example of mentioning Michelle Obama. The former first lady is again mentioned for a third and final time in a section of the book detailing that Harris' husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, was \"moved way up the roster\" of speakers at the Democratic National Convection (DNC), delivering a prime-time speech the same evening as the former first couple. KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION The book detailed Harris' account of the conversation Emhoff shared with DNC planners of the speech, which included the final mention of Michelle Obama: \"'You’re going Tuesday,' he was told.\" \"'Oh, okay, who am I on with?' he asked.\" \"'Barack and Michelle. You three are the prime-time package.'\" \"No pressure.\" Fox News Digital searched \"first lady\" and \"the Obamas\" for any other mention related to Michelle Obama, but turned up empty-handed. The lack of mention regarding Michelle Obama in a personal manner came despite the former first lady hitting the 2024 campaign cycle, including stumping for the Harris–Walz ticket at rallies; the New York Times publishing an opinion piece capturing Michelle Obama's speech during a Harris–Walz rally in Michigan; and addressing the DNC in Chicago to champion the Democratic ticket. \"My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment,\" Michelle Obama said of Harris during her DNC speech. \"She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency. And she is one of the most dignified. A tribute to her mother, to my mother and to your mother, too. The embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country. Her story is your story. It’s my story. It’s the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life.\" KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' Conversely, former first lady Hillary Clinton is mentioned 14 times in Harris' book, including personal anecdotes. Former first lady Jill Biden was mentioned five times, all of which included anecdotes, an assessment of Jill Biden's mood during a meeting or a photo of the first couple accompanied by a favorable caption reading, \"Hillary supporters sour that she’d been run over by Barack.\" Barack Obama is mentioned nine times, including reflecting on conversations the pair shared, anecdotes about his White House and staff, as well as a comment that \"Hillary supporters sour that she’d been run over by Barack\" during the 2016 election.

At least those in the cheap seats could take comfort in knowing the event might be worth the price of a good therapy session.\n\nFintan O’Toole, the evening’s interviewer, got straight to business. He focused on history’s lessons and soon the discussion turned to the savagery in the Middle East.\n\n“Gaza,” Obama said, “is an example of the prison of the past.” He outlined the competing and very real historic grievances on both sides.\n\n“The starting point is to acknowledge history,” he said, offering what on this side of the Atlantic might be considered the most palatable interpretation from middle America. He was unequivocal about the current slaughter.\n\nO’Toole asked how we got here, and Obama gave a concise history of liberal democracy’s evolution — from World War II through the Cold War, globalization, and the fallout that left many disillusioned. There was nothing particularly new in his account, but it’s how he tells it: distilling complex systems and ideas into a version that goes down easily, leaving an aftertaste of more.\n\nOf course, hanging over everything was He Whose Name Shall Not Be Spoken. At no point in the 90-minute interview did that person’s name cross Obama’s lips. The closest was O’Toole’s reference to “the T word.”\n\nBeyond that, it was all what wasn’t said. Obama spoke about authoritarian rule in “Hungary, Turkey and now it’s being mimicked in other places”. (And where might that be?) \n\nRecalling an oil spill during his presidency, he referenced “the Gulf of Mexico,” pausing for a beat to underline that he would not use T’s rebranded “Gulf of America.” He warned, “People who are oppressors will go after storytellers, comics and artists”. Another pause. Jimmy Kimmel anybody? And on it went in that vein.\n\nThe strategy nodded to the once-quaint tradition of former presidents avoiding criticism of incumbents, especially abroad. On another level, it worked perfectly — symbolically denying oxygen to a megalomaniac who can’t open his mouth without self-praise. Still, despite Obama’s stirring rhetoric, a heaviness from the outside world lingered over the arena.\n\nEleven months ago, a week before last November’s US presidential election, the Irish Examiner was in Philadelphia’s Temple University arena, where 10,000 adoring supporters practically sat at Obama’s feet during a rally for Kamala Harris.\n\nHe wore no jacket, his white shirt sleeves rolled up for work.\n\nThe audience was bulling the fight ahead, confident the approaching darkness could be pushed back. Obama lifted them to new heights. That night, he had no hesitation in plainly calling out Harris’ opponent.\n\n“Here’s a man, a 78-year-old billionaire, who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down that golden escalator nine years ago. He’s still tweeting at all times of night, all cats. When he’s not complaining he’s trying to sell you stuff. He wants to sell you a Swiss watch, $100,000, but they can’t find where exactly in Switzerland it is actually made. He wants to sell you a Trump bible.” \n\nThat was then. The battle was lost. The T word won, and now rules rather than governs. Could Obama, when he was First Citizen, have done more to ward off the storm? O’Toole asked.\n\n“I grapple with that, did I say enough,” he replied. “Maybe if I called it out more clearly some people and their politics, people might have been forewarned. It’s a tough balance and I haven’t figured it out yet.” \n\nIn the end, O’Toole invoked Martin Luther King’s dictum that “the long arc of history bends towards justice.” Does Obama still believe that?\n\n“I’d emphasise the long point,” he quipped, adding that everyone has a role in preserving and nourishing democracy.\n\n“It does not bend by itself,” he said of the long arc. “We grab it and pull it towards justice.” \n\nHe’s no Messiah, this former president who broke new ground but perhaps took his eye off the ball. Neither, unlike the current incumbent, would he claim to be. Still, he is a tonic in dangerous times, and for one evening, maybe that was enough.","summary":"At Dublin’s O2, Barack Obama offered a mix of caution, candour and hope as democracy’s fragility loomed large","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41713211.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9597/4798556_1_seoimage1x1_An_20Evening_20With_20President_20Barack_20Obama_20In_20Conversation_20with_20Fintan_20O_27Toole_20at_20the_203Arena_20Photo_20by_20Ray_20Keogh-7_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 09:25:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Mick Clifford Special Correspondent","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Mick Clifford Special Correspondent"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.136},{"id":363933818,"title":"Trump Demands Microsoft Fire Lisa Monaco","text":"President Donald Trump is demanding that Microsoft fire former Biden Justice Department official Lisa Monaco, who Trump has previously blamed for federal investigations into his mishandling of classified documents and alleged election interference, furthering his retribution campaign against his former antagonists.\n\nTrump urged the software giant to remove Monaco, who it recently appointed as its president of global affairs, and argued her tenure as former deputy Attorney General and connections to investigations he views as illegitimate discredit her.\n\n“Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information.

Several European state broadcasters have threatened to boycott the next Eurovision song contest if Israel were to participate.\nSports governing bodies like Europe’s Uefa are also under pressure from icons, including former France and Manchester United striker Eric Cantona, to expel the Jewish-majority state from international tournaments.\nBut none of this adds up to a “critical mass” that would persuade Israel’s most important allies, especially the United States, to abandon Israel because of its ruthless pursuit of Hamas, perpetrator of the October 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Kenneth Katzman, senior Middle East fellow of the Soufan Centre, a New York-based think tank.\n\nWhile public opinion in the West has turned against Israel because of revulsion at its killings of more than 65,000 Gazans so far, politicians remain reluctant to punish it by cutting off military supplies, curbing trade or executing war-crime arrest warrants for Israeli leaders issued last year by the International Court of Justice.\nDelegations staged a mass walkout before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at the UN General Assembly on Friday – which Hamas said showed Israel’s “isolation” as a result of the Gaza war.\n“Boycotting Netanyahu’s speech is one manifestation of Israel’s isolation and the consequences of the war of extermination,” Taher al-Nunu, the media adviser to the head of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement.\nIn his angry address, Netanyahu vowed to block a Palestinian state, accusing European leaders of pushing his country into “national suicide” and rewarding Hamas.\n“Israel will not allow you to shove a terrorist state down our throats,” said. “We will not commit national suicide because you don’t have the guts to face down the hostile media and anti-Semitic mobs demanding Israel’s blood.”\nThe message to Hamas, Netanyahu said, was that “murdering Jews pays off”.\n\nDespite the UN’s findings, the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada and France have declined to declare Israel’s killings of Gazans a genocide.\nThey have also been at pains to emphasise that their conditional recognition of Palestinians was not designed to punish Israel, but to encourage it to accept a peace deal to end the Gaza war and refrain from annexing the West Bank.\nThis was also true of the US Congress, where there had been increased questioning of support for Israel “pretty much on both sides of the aisle – more so on the Democratic side”, but no substantial action because of “much lingering sympathy” over Hamas’ October 7 assault, said Katzman, who previously worked as a Middle East specialist for the Congressional Research Service for 30 years.\n“There’s criticism and recriminations on Israel’s tactics in Gaza … but there is not a critical mass to somehow abandon Israel,” he told This Week in Asia.\n“They are not adding up to a game changer in terms of what Israel is going to be able to do” in the Middle East, Katzman said, pointing to Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\nThe belated recognition of Palestinian statehood by Western governments is largely aimed at placating their voters’ anger without triggering retaliation from the US, according to analysts.\n“Mustering agreement on symbolic recognition is easier for Canadian and European politicians than mustering agreement on sanctions against Israel, because it is less likely to provoke Trump’s ire or to hit hard interests in the pocketbook,” said Monica Marks, professor of Middle East politics at New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus.\nOne reason Western states recognised Palestinian statehood together as a group was to “protect themselves from punitive US backlash”, she added.\n\nStill, their symbolic recognition of Palestinian statehood has incurred US President Donald Trump’s anger.\nAddressing the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, he conflated the recognition with an encouragement of continued conflict.\n“The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities … even while they refuse to release the [Israeli] hostages or accept a ceasefire,” Trump raged.\n“Instead of giving in to Hamas’s ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.”\nNotably, Western countries that have recently recognised Palestinian statehood have made it conditional upon the release of Israeli hostages, the disarmament of Hamas and its exclusion from a future Palestinian administration of Gaza. They also want the Palestinian Authority to undergo significant internal reforms before it is allowed to replace Hamas as Gaza’s administrator.\nThe difference between the position adopted by Australia, Britain and France, and other Israeli allies like Italy and Japan, is that the latter group wants these conditions fulfilled as a precondition for recognition of Palestinian statehood.\nThese conditions “show little grasp of three basic facts”, UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese said in a social media post on Tuesday.\n“Colonialism is over; self-determination is unconditional; doing this amid genocide suggests contempt for human dignity.”\n\nModerate Palestinian politicians, while appreciating the growing recognition of Palestinian statehood, are not convinced it would yield results for their people.\nHanan Ashrawi, a minister of the Palestinian Authority administration which struck peace agreements with Israel in the 1990s, said the recognition of Palestinian statehood by many Western governments signalled “a sea change in the world that had hitherto granted and protected Israel’s impunity and ongoing genocide”.\nNow “many courses of action are open” to these states to “stop the genocide and take punitive measures against Israel”, Ashrawi said in a social media post. “The test lies in whether they will.”\nMustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, said the recognition was welcome, “but it is not enough as it must be associated with immediate sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide in Gaza and the settlers’ terror and annexation of the West Bank”.\nWithout that happening, Israel was “not really feeling an inordinate amount of pressure at this point that would contain or circumscribe what they feel they need to do in Gaza”, Katzman said. “They don’t feel constrained to change course.”\nNetanyahu and his coalition allies remained opposed to the rule of Gaza by the Palestinian Authority because “they feel that doing so would create the underpinnings of a Palestinian state”, he said.\nMarks agreed, saying Israel continued to think “short term, trying to effectuate as many of its goals to achieve absolute military dominance locally and regionally while it has an open runway to do so”.\n\nNetanyahu supported Trump’s election campaign over Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020 and 2024, respectively, “for precisely this reason: because he felt sure that Trump would give him even more unfettered ability to do whatever he wants”, she said.\nIf Israel’s leaders were prioritising Israel’s long-term stability, “they would dial down their present behaviour to better hedge against those risks”.\n“But they’re prioritising Israel’s domination and their own political careers in the present – gobbling up as many opportunities to achieve more domination, territorially and militarily, while they can,” Marks said.\nThey might wager that, in the long term, younger generations in the US “might forget their current feelings of disgust over Israel’s excesses, or that jihadist terrorist attacks might recentre their ire on Islamist extremists”.\nNetanyahu and his coalition partners might also gamble that Israel could – in the long term – manufacture more of its own weapons or source them from countries besides the US “after furthering the Israeli right’s territorial and military goals by leaps and bounds”, Marks said.\n“And they may be right.”\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse, Reuters","summary":"After two years of warfare with Hamas that the United Nations says has brought genocide and famine to Gaza, Israel finds itself more isolated than ever, as it remains intransigent in pursuing its goal of defeating the militant group and rejecting rising global support for Palestinian statehood.\nMany of its Western allies, including Australia, Britain, Canada and France, have recognised – albeit conditionally – the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority as the government of a non-existent...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3327045/us-backing-israels-rising-global-isolation-over-gaza-not-game-changer","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/26/fd2fd901-2b27-448d-9224-971607d4f41e_c9747563.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 08:00:15","author":"Tom Hussain","authors":["Tom Hussain"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.137},{"id":364079864,"title":"SNL returns next week. When the show debuted, it didn't shy away from assassination talk","text":"On Sept. 22, 1975, 45-year-old Sara Jane Moore dropped her son off at his San Francisco school, visited a private gun dealer and, in what she later told the Los Angeles Times was a \"a kind of ultimate protest against the system,\" drew a .38-calibre pistol outside a hotel later in the day, firing at then-president Gerald Ford.\n\nMoore, who had a history of mental illness but had become enmeshed in radical left-wing groups, didn't hit her target in two attempts. \n\nBizarrely, Moore's wasn't the only attempt on the president's life that month by a woman. Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, a one-time acolyte of murderous cult leader Charles Manson, had been tackled by a Secret Service agent 17 days earlier as she pointed a gun in Ford's direction in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nMoore — whose death at 95 was reported this week — insisted she wasn't influenced by Fromme. She pleaded guilty, while Fromme — not unlike Ryan Routh, convicted this week of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump — proved a somewhat unruly defendant. Both women spent decades in prison and were released in the late 2000s.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 1975, a new NBC late-night comedy show aired just its third episode. One sketch on the show piloted by young Canadian producer Lorne Michaels had Laraine Newman guesting on a talk show \"Dangerous But Inept\" as Fromme, calling the interviewer, played by Jane Curtin, a \"fawning fascist sycophant.\" The sketch ended with Curtin teasing the talk show's purported guest the following week, Moore.\n\nThe now-voluminous lore of the early years of Saturday Night Live, which includes several books and television profiles, contains tales of battles between the show's cast and writers with NBC censors, as well as accounts of affiliates baffled by the show's brand of humour. But if there was any great upset at the Fromme sketch, let alone comment from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair at the time, it never registered as a seminal moment.\n\nIt is, obviously, now a much different late-night landscape as SNL kicks off its 51st season on Oct. 4 — not just compared to the show's earliest days, but even since it last aired a new episode in mid-May. It has been announced that Stephen Colbert's weeknight CBS show is in its last months, while Jimmy Kimmel was suspended for a week following comments he made on his ABC show in the wake of the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, an influential but polarizing political organizer in the MAGA movement.\n\nFord 'good-natured' about jokes: Michaels\n\nPrevious FCC chairs have regulated in relative anonymity, but Brendan Carr has offered opinions on what he views as liberal bias, from standard political news shows to even entertainment offerings. As president again, meanwhile, Trump has openly hoped the Colbert and Kimmel troubles will precede the cancellation of NBC's weeknight shows which air after local news programs for most affiliates, hosted by SNL alum Jimmy Fallon and Seth Myers, and executive produced by Michaels.\n\nKimmel, in his return to the air carried on the ABC network but not by dozens of local affiliates, blasted Trump for cheering the potential unemployment of \"hundreds of people\" who work on those NBC offerings.\n\n\"Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods, because he can't take a joke,\" said Kimmel.\n\nWhile the media landscape of 1975 and 2025 can't be reasonably compared, the reactions of Trump and Ford to SNL, among the nine U.S. presidents it has satirized, provide a glaring contrast.\n\nSNL began to hit its stride with a boomer audience, then teens and young adults yearning for something new on television, by its fourth episode, Michaels later recounted to Tom Shales and James Miller, authors of a 2002 oral history of the show — and cast member Chevy Chase's portrayal of Ford was part of the winning formula.\n\nFord, despite a background as a college athlete, had more than one stumble while president. The show's writers revelled in putting Ford the character in various scenarios, with Chase indulging in elaborate pratfalls. \n\nRon Nessen, Ford's press secretary, later recounted just happening to catch a January 1976 SNL episode, and by March, Ford and Chase were gently ribbing each other at a pair of gala dinners. Ford was \"incredibly decent and good-natured\" about the sketches,\" Michaels said when the former president died in 2006.\n\n\"Luckily for me, Mr. Ford had a sense of humour,\" Chase reflected in an op-ed in early 2007, thanking the president and his wife, as the actor once sought help at the Betty Ford Center in the 1980s.\n\nNessen, in an election year where the Republican Party was still stinging from Richard Nixon's Watergate-fuelled resignation, saw a greater opportunity to connect with young voters. He hosted SNL in April 1976, with Ford pre-recording SNL's now-famous cold open.\n\nThe decision probably backfired, both Ford and especially Nessen — who died in March — wrote in respective memoirs. That's because some writers and cast members have since recounted wanting to be merciless on that episode and not treat the Ford administration with kid gloves.\n\n\"The comedian's job was to point out the defects of the establishment and revel in the anarchy,\" Matt Fotis writes in 2020's Satire & The State: Sketch Comedy and the Presidency. \"Ford and Nessen's miscalculation about hosting SNL lies in their misunderstanding of the changing comedic landscape.\"\n\nNational tragedies, changing sensibilities\n\nPresidential candidate portrayals have continued ever since, and the show was even referenced during a 2008 Democratic primary debate, after it had recently lampooned fawning coverage of Barack Obama in a sketch, featuring the fuzziest of softball questions for the candidate.\n\n\" … if anybody saw Saturday Night Live, you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow,\" Hillary Clinton said during the debate.\n\nClinton's barb evinced annoyance with her own media coverage. If Obama was annoyed, it didn't prevent him from nominating her for secretary of state in a matter of months.\n\nBrendar Carr, chairperson of the FCC, will likely take note of what SNL airs this season. When Democratic candidate Kamala Harris popped in for a cameo on the show, Carr complained Trump wasn't afforded \"equal time\" during the campaign. Trump hosted the show in 2004 when his reality show The Apprentice was a hit, and as a presidential candidate in 2015. In 2024, he made appearances on network-aired sporting events; Harris did not.\n\nCameos on the show in the last weeks of the 2008 campaign by Republican John McCain — who hosted in 2002 — and his vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin had no evident impact on their election, which they lost. Obama's lone cameo occurred in October 2007, long before he secured the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump, through tweets over the years, has rapped SNL in harsher terms than anything Ford mustered over the Nessen-hosted show. More applicable to current conditions, Trump complained in 2019 it was \"truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live … can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over &, over, without so much of a mention of 'the other side.'\"\n\nTrump's 2015 appearance, as well as Elon Musk's six years later, were said to have rankled some show members. Michaels admitted to Susan Morrison for her book, Lorne: The Man who Invented Saturday Night Live, that cast sensibilities have changed, telling her he tried to impress upon the cast \"the distinction between their own personal feelings and the script.\"\n\nMichaels was bemused at the time that a cast member was hesitant to portray Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 85 at the time.\n\n\"They care so deeply now,\" he told Morrison in the book. \"The women in particular feel so threatened.\"\n\nBy that point, Morrison reported, former longtime writer Jim Downey had complained to friends still with the show that SNL sometimes felt like the \"comedy division of the [Democratic National Committee].\"\n\nFormer cast member Kate McKinnon, on a new episode of Hot Ones, said she believes Michaels will meet the moment in polarizing times exacerbated by the Kirk killing.\n\n\"Every time there has been a national tragedy that has demanded a sincere cold open,\" she said on the podcast.\n\nSNL under Michaels's leadership has both sidestepped national tragedies — the Oklahoma City bombing was better fodder for a Weekend Update joke about the domestic terrorist from Canadian Norm Macdonald — but also been praised at other times, as with the first new show after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAfter a sombre opening on Sept. 29, 2001, with New York City first responders onstage, Michaels appeared with then-mayor Rudy Giuliani and asked, \"Can we be funny?\"\n\nGiuliani perfectly delivered the response: \"Why start now?\"","summary":"Donald Trump, who hosted Saturday Night Live twice before becoming president, has consistently complained about his treatment on the sketch comedy show. The show returns next week, and Trump's aggressive communications regulator will likely take notice.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/snl-politics-ford-trump-1.7644339?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7644382.1758889219!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/77th-primetime-emmy-awards-press-room.jpg?im=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 08:00:00","author":"Chris Iorfida","authors":["Chris Iorfida"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":363885736,"title":"'Friday Follies': Kamala has come back, but she's doing exactly what she did on the campaign, Raymond Arroyo says","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle September 27, 2025 06:40 \n\n 'Friday Follies': Kamala has come back, but she's doing exactly what she did on the campaign, Raymond Arroyo says \n Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo discusses former Vice President Kamala Harris' comeback tour, Cynthia Nixon walking back her Disney boycott and police dragging a drunk passenger off a plane on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE INGRAHAM ANGLEV-VIDEOPOLITICSENTERTAINMENT MEDIALATE NIGHTU.S.","summary":"Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo discusses former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; comeback tour, Cynthia Nixon walking back her Disney boycott and police dragging a drunk passenger off a plane on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380174492112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/7ac69884-6dda-4f2a-ac7c-abe2946ae1b9/76fdf8ef-2a6b-4fa4-a436-d4fee8bf236b/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 04:55:51","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.232},{"id":363849606,"title":"Vance Says Listening To Harris’ Campaign Left Him Feeling ‘Dumber’","text":"Vice President JD Vance said Friday on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” that listening to former Vice President Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential run left him feeling “dumber in the process.”\n\nSince releasing her new memoir, “107 Days,” Harris has gone on a media tour recalling her failed campaign and claiming one major reason for her loss was the limited time she had. Discussing Harris’ return to the spotlight, Fox’s Laura Ingraham asked Vance to respond to her claims about why she lost the 2024 election. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Claims Her Rally Crowds Would ‘Pass’ Babies Around In Bizarre Word Salad)\n\n“My reaction is if you look at the polling, both the public and the private polling, the problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short, it’s that it was too long,” Vance said. “That when people actually listened to what she had to say, her polling went down and down and down. I think that if we had had a 150-day campaign, we probably would have had three additional Republican senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide. Because the more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there’s no substance there.”\n\n“Agree or disagree with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate a viewpoint,” Vance added. “I listened to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds, and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes. That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s gonna continue to be her problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint, articulate it for the American people. Just say what you actually believe. Don’t do this word salad, talking around in circles. It doesn’t work, and it’s why she didn’t win.”\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC’s “The View” Tuesday, Harris falsely claimed that the 2024 presidential election was the “closest” of the 21st century. Despite the actual closest election being between former President George W. Bush and former Democratic nominee Al Gore, Harris blamed her loss on having only 107 days to launch her presidential campaign.\n\nSince the release of her book and media tour, some Democrats have expressed frustration with the former vice president’s comments, telling Politico that the book appears to be “unhelpful and divisive.”\n\nIn July 2024, former President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee. A little over two weeks later, Harris selected Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nReceiving almost immediate backlash for her lack of in-depth interviews, Harris’ on-camera responses were often criticized as word salads, with some explanations leaving viewers confused. In October 2024, during an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Harris’ answer to a question about the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas appeared to be quietly edited in the online footage released after the episode’s live airing.\n\nBy February, the Federal Communications Commission released the full video and transcript of Harris’ “60 Minutes” interview, which was over twice as long as the edited version that the network had published on Oct. 7, 2024.\n\nThroughout Harris‘ campaign, the former vice president struggled to connect with voters and their top concerns, which focused on the economy, inflation and immigration. Instead, Harris either pushed race-based policies, such as her appeal to black business owners or refused to distance herself from previously supported policies, like funding transgender surgeries for illegal migrants and cutting funding to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nPost-election polls showed Harris not only earned 7 million fewer votes than Biden in the 2020 race but also failed to match President Donald Trump’s gains, falling short in three of the seven key swing states and in 80% of counties nationwide, according to The New York Times.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy EMMA GUINNESS \n Published:01:13 BST, 27 September 2025 |Updated:01:30 BST, 27 September 2025 \n\nJennifer Lawrence turned heads as she accepted the Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award at San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain on Friday.\nThe Hunger Games star, 35, ensured all eyes were on her in a quirky cut out gown which showed off her trim waist and toned legs. \nBoasting dramatic shoulder pads and cinched with a leather belt she accessorised the look with boot and statement earrings. \nThe event also hosted the premiere of Jennifer's latest film, Die My Love, so the star had more than one reason to celebrate - with her role in the comedy-thriller as a mother battling psychosis already tipped for Oscars success. \nThe actress was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award in recognition of her prestigious film career. \nTaking to the stage a visibly emotional Jennifer said: 'Thank you to the San Sebastian Film Festival for thinking of me for this incredible honour.'\n\nJennifer Lawrence, 35, turned heads as she accepted the Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award at San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain on Friday \n\nThe Hunger Games star ensured all eyes were on her in a quirky cut out gown which showed off her trim waist and toned legs \n\nThe actress was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award in recognition of her prestigious film career \n\nJennifer spoke out in support of Palestine two years after the October 7 attacks, and said what is happening in Gaza 'is no less than a genocide' \n\nHer comments were slammed after she previously praised her friend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer, for choosing to speak up in support of Israel amid the conflict - pictured together 2021\nLawrence continued: 'I'm so happy to be here – not just for the food, which is reason enough to visit – but because there's something really special about being at a festival like this where people genuinely love cinema and storytelling and the art and soul of movies.'\nIt comes after the actress sparked uproar from fans as she publicly revealed her political stance amid the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian war this week.\n\n Cara Delevingne 'purchases pal Jennifer Lawrence's Beverly Hills mansion for $11M' \nShe spoke out in support of Palestine two years after the October 7 attacks, and said what is happening in Gaza 'is no less than a genocide'.\nAppearing at a Festival press conference on Friday to promote new movie, Die My Love, Lawrence said of Palestine: 'I’m terrified and it’s mortifying. \n'What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable, I’m terrified for my children, for all of our children.'\nLawrence also lashed out about the 'disrespect and discourse' in American politics, adding: 'I mean, the kids who are voting right now at 18, it’s going to be totally normal to them that politics has no integrity. \n'Politicians lie, there is no empathy. And everybody needs to remember that when you ignore what’s happening on one side of the world, it won’t be long until it’s on your side as well.\n'I wish that there was something I could say, something that I could do to fix this extremely complex and disgraceful situation. It breaks my heart.' \nLawrence, who publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election, said she feared 'speaking out too much' or 'answering too many of these questions' that 'my words will just be used to add more fire and rhetoric to something that is in the hands of our elected officials.\n'I just want people to stay focused on who is responsible and the things that they can do and when they need to show up and vote, and not let the actors and the artists who are trying to express freedom of art, freedom of speech take the heat for the individuals that are actually responsible.'\n\nThe chic outfit was the actress's second of the day and at an earlier photo call she wore a short-sleeve black top and matching oversized trousers\n\nJennifer's top featured a floor-length cloak, which graciously cascaded behind her\n\nThe No Hard Feelings star stunned as she promoted the film, in which she plays a lead role alongside Robert Pattinson\nLawrence's comments were slammed by fans online after she previously praised her friend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer, for choosing to speak up in support of Israel amid the conflict.\nSchumer was forced to disable her Instagram comments in November 2023 after posting in support of Israel following Hamas's deadly attack on October 7, after which Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, prompting protestors to call for a cease-fire.\nHer posts received a slew of harsh comments critiquing her views, her looks, and weight.\nAfter sharing a number of videos that explained what a ceasefire would mean for Israel, she turned off comments on the posts.\nShe later shared a note reading: 'Couple things. What I want is EVERY HOSTAGE BACK I want safety and freedom from Hamas for Palestinians and Israelis. I want safety for Jewish people and Muslims as well. Everyone. Just like you. I want peace.'\n'You will never see me wishing harm on anyone. Saying I'm Islamophobic or that I like genocide is crazy. So here you go by popular demand. Comments on.

Define Rubicon.”\n\nIn a statement released following news of his indictment, Comey said his heart “is broken” for the Justice Department and described Trump as a “tyrant.”\n\n“My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way,” Comey said. “We will not live on our knees and you shouldn’t either.”\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system and I am innocent, so let’s have a trial,” he added.","summary":"‘It’s frustrating, but more than that, it’s painful to see,’ Harris said, speaking to CNN Friday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-comey-indictment-reaction-b2834733.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/15/02/Kamala-Harris.jpeg?crop=2715,1810,x259.5,y0&trim=0,260,0,259&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vFaop588-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:13:53","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":363833206,"title":"Springsteen says Dems too far-left for America, but Trump still belongs in 'trash heap of history'","text":"Rock star Bruce Springsteen warned that the Democratic Party has alienated Americans with its far-left policies, even as he remains a staunch critic of President Trump. Springsteen, who remains an all-American icon known for anthems like \"Born to Run,\" \"Thunder Road\" and \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" has not been shy about sharing his political views over the past few decades. The rocker campaigned for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. In an interview with Time Magazine, Springsteen revealed that he is one of many left-leaning figures who believe the Democratic Party has lost touch with everyday Americans. EX-NBC NEWS HOST CHUCK TODD LAMENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY A 'COLLECTION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TRUMP' \"We’re desperately in need of an effective alternative party or for the Democratic Party to find someone who can speak to the majority of the nation. There is a problem with the language that they’re using and the way they’re trying to reach people,\" he said. Time magazine noted the irony in that left-leaning Springsteen appeals to working-class fans while being wealthy, particularly as many of his core audience have \"flocked to Trump.\" \"A lot of people bought into his lies,\" the rocker lamented to Time Magazine. \"He doesn’t care about the forgotten anybody but himself and the multibillionaires who stood behind him on Inauguration Day. \"You have to face the fact that a good number of Americans are simply comfortable with his politics of power and dominance. EX-NBC NEWS HOST CHUCK TODD LAMENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY A 'COLLECTION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TRUMP' \"He’s the living personification of what the 25th Amendment and impeachment were for. If Congress had any guts, he’d be consigned to the trash heap of history,\" he concluded. In 2020, Springsteen’s 2002 hit \"The Rising\" became something of an anthem for the Biden campaign during the Democratic National Convention that year, to the point an Esquire article warned about the risk of its potential parallels with Clinton’s campaign using a \"Glee\" version of Rachel Platten's \"Fight Song.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on Springsteen’s remarks and has not received an immediate response.

In the lawsuit, Giuffre accused Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.

Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,” she wrote. “And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness.”\n\nStewart and Martin argued that such inconsistencies — for example, Harris supporting LGBT causes yet passing over Buttigieg due to his sexuality — damaged the Democratic Party’s credibility.\n\nWhile speaking about the importance of authenticity in politics, “The Weekly Show” host noted that NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has been “able to identify the crux of the issue and very simply present some ideas that might be able to battle that.”\n\n“It’s simpler than authenticity, and the messenger and the metrics,” he added.\n\n“Well, I do think it’s simpler than that, because at the end of the day, right, we could have plenty of people who are saying the exact same thing, who aren’t believed by the voters.

The Herald’s requests for comment from the Board of Bar Overseers and Rollins were not returned on Friday.\n\nProceedings are generally triggered by allegations of misconduct against an attorney, which could lead to disbarment, resignation, or suspension by the court, public reprimand by the board, or admonition by the bar counsel, according to Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01 for Bar Discipline.\n\nRollins’ law license was suspended last spring for non-payment of registration fees. Her license was reinstated in April 2024. At that point in time, she was not listed as facing public discipline.\n\nWhile the circumstances of what alleged violation triggered the public disciplinary proceedings are unclear, the Board of Bar Overseers is listed as beginning to review the matter roughly two years after Rollins resigned in disgrace from her former position as Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.\n\nRollins stepped down in May 2023 after being scorched in two federal reports that found she abused her position, in part, by leaking false information to the media in an effort to influence the outcome of the Suffolk District Attorney’s race in favor of her preferred candidate, ex-Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who lost to DA Kevin Hayden.\n\nThe violation was “among other” instances of serious misconduct flagged by then-Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz in his scathing report to Congress.\n\nThe two Department of Justice reports stated that Rollins faced further discipline from the feds if she did not promptly quit.\n\nThe federal investigation was sparked by Rollins’ appearance at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser headlined by then-First Lady Jill Biden, in potential violation of the Hatch Act, after it was first reported by the Herald.\n\nThe Hatch Act, a federal law passed in 1939, limits certain political activities of — and serves as an ethical roadmap for — federal employees.\n\nSince her departure, the Herald has since reported on potential misconduct committed by Rollins during her tenure as Suffolk District Attorney. Rollins departed that role after she was appointed U.S. Attorney by former President Joe Biden, which was narrowly confirmed by the Senate in December 2021.\n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote after Republican senators hammered Rollins on her progressive policies and do-not-prosecute list, which has since been thrown out by her predecessor, Suffolk DA Hayden.\n\nThe Herald has reported, based on public records, that Rollins tore through her taxpayer-funded credit card during her first year as Suffolk District Attorney, for fine dining, jet-setting trips, and posh hotels, in what appears to be a blatant violation of state law.\n\nDuring her time in office as DA, Rollins spent $33,132 on her P-card — a taxpayer-paid procurement card with her name on the front.

The Independent answers your questions","text":"Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Ronald F. Kennedy Jr. pledged to find the ‘cause’ of autism. On Monday, September 22, 2025, the administration announced a link between autism and the use of the pain reliever acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\n“Don’t take Tylenol,” the president said at a press conference at the White House, claiming that “there is no downside.”\n\nThis claim follows Trump and RFK Jr. 's long espoused idea that an artificial external factor, such as vaccines or the environment, is responsible for increasing autism diagnoses. Researchers and medical evidence do not back these theories. \n\nThe Independent’s Washington Bureau Chief Eric Garcia, who was diagnosed with autism in the 1990s and has been travelling around the country for years interviewing autistic people about their experiences, held a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” forum to answer your questions about autism and the administration’s fear-mongering:\n\nQ: Simple question... I know I'm not the first to think of it… Did autism exist before tylenol? Just checking.\n\nEG: Yes. The first major study on autism in the US came out in 1944 by a researcher named Leo Kanner, years before Tylenol came out on the market. Autism has likely been with us as long as there have been human beings. Some people suspect that people like Lord Cavendish might have been. Others say Mozart or Jefferson. I’ve never been in the business of speculating who is autistic and who isn’t (though in my day job, I often suspect certain elected officials or members of presidential administrations are). But the point is, autism has always been with us.​\n\nQ: What are your thoughts about the fact that neurodivergent people are more often chronically in pain, therefore they take Tylenol more often, and then have children and pass on those genetics, through no fault of Tylenol.​\n\nEG: This is actually a great question. One of my close friends, who is autistic and is a mom, dealt with hypermobility, and she mentioned how Tylenol can be one of the few sources of pain relief. Hypermobility has a hormonal component, and stigmatizing acetaminophen might make matters worse.\n\nQ: As a journalist, what aspects of the job are hardest for you as an autistic person? Which aspects are naturally stronger for you?​\n\nEG: The hardest one is that I struggle with social cues and interactions. So I know I will probably never be good at talking to sources on deep background or anything. I also don’t drive because of sensory overload. However, I am a sucker for going down a document rabbit hole. I love going through campaign finance documents or court rulings. And I am also good at being a jerk in a press gaggle or press conference and asking a really blunt question and not caring about the social ramifications. \n\nQ: Hi. I’m an autistic woman and find this political climate very hostile. When Trump/RFK Jr talk about autism, do you think they are referring to the entire spectrum? Is their issue with the support needs of disabled people, the suffering of the people themselves, or the actual autistic traits?\n\nEG: A lot of it is a willful misreading of the data. Even the CDC, which is under Kennedy’s purview, released its biennial report saying improved screening and diagnoses led to increased cases. A lot of it generally goes to fearmongering and conspiracy theories. Trump came to it the same way he’s come to many of his other conspiracy theories. RFK Jr. came to it through his environmental activism. The problem is that they now have access to all of these incredible scientists and continue to disregard the facts. The unfortunate thing is that Trump and Kennedy both have incredible megaphones, and they have diehard followers who would be receptive to whatever they say. We’ve seen how Republicans changed their views on the economy and foreign policy to go with whatever Trump said. The same could be true if he followed the science on autism and vaccines. Ironically, by nominating Kennedy, Trump has undermined the biggest accomplishment during his first presidency: The rapid rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nQ: I wanted to get your perspective on whether or not autism will remain conceptualized in the DSM as a broad spectrum or if we will return to narrower diagnoses. \n\nEG: Great question. It’s important to remember that the government doesn’t create these labels but rather the American Psychiatric Association. There is a lot of push to relabel autistic people who were once known as having “classic autism” or “low-functioning autism” as having “profound autism” and returning the label of “Asperger’s syndrome” (despite Hans Asperger’s collaboration with the Nazi regime in Austria). I tend to worry about separating them because calling something “profound” tends to set low expectations or adds more stigma that autism is a disease or that they can never accomplish much. But autistic people with high support needs still have incredible value as human beings. In addition, many people we consider “profoundly autistic” can and have gone to college, write and publish poetry or make art. I fear calling them “profound” or “severely” autistic will automatically stick people with how we perceive them rather than what they need to thrive. And this is not to diminish their needs. To the contrary. Having those labels like “high support needs” or “autistic person with intellectual disabilities” helps us determine what supports would best help someone.\n\nQ: Genuine question: If Biden were the POTUS and had said the same thing about Tylenol and autism, would you have slammed him just as hard, or praised him?\n\nEG: No question! I wrote plenty of negative stories about the Biden administration and its mismanagement of Covid, such as when his CDC director Rochelle Walensky said that Covid-19 deaths among people who were vaccinated were “people who were unwell to begin with.” I gave the Biden team hell for saying inflation was “transitory” when it was clear prices were going up. I also wrote about how Biden’s age was going to be an issue in the 2024 election before the debate, and his campaign needed to be upfront about it and not cavalier. I criticized Biden in my book for not releasing a disability policy in the 2020 campaign until he won the Democratic nomination for president (fun fact: Kamala Harris released the first disability policy in that primary, and I criticized her too). \n\nQ: I have two young kids with ASD diagnoses, and I am deeply disturbed and scared, and trying to figure out how to navigate this environment. What are your thoughts on supporting children in this moment?​\n\nEG: I’ll say what I’ve always said, which is that autistic people need your love, especially now more than ever. That love will power you to build a better world and fight for accommodations, and make it easier for the next people who come after you. Love and acceptance are contagious, and they set an example. \n\nQ: How are you taking care of yourself as an autistic man covering all this nonsense?\n\nEG: Ha! I talked about this with my mom on Sunday before all this, and I said that covering this actually gives me a sense of purpose. When I am covering the normal politics of the day, I am chasing the same stories everyone else is. But when I cover autism, I have been writing about it for a decade and focused on including autistic voices, so it gives me a strong sense of direction I probably otherwise wouldn’t have amid the Trump chaos.","summary":"The Independent answered your questions about the Trump administration’s fear-mongering on autism during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ forum","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rfk-jr-autism-questions-tylenol-b2834631.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/12/19/33/GettyImages-2227086634.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XdfNqITd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-26 20:30:06","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":363799946,"title":"Fans turn on Jennifer Lawrence as she reveals stance on Palestine after praising Amy Schumer's Israel remarks","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 26th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Andrew 'flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet and had massages paid for by paedophile' while Elon Musk 'planned to visit island', according to bombshell documents\n\nLiverpool pay out Diogo Jota's £140,000-a-week contract to his widow and family: Manager Arne Slot reveals club's 'not normal' gesture\n\nDelegates storm out moments before Netanyahu begins UN assembly address, with the Israeli PM declaring western recognition of Palestine shows 'murdering Jews pays off'\n\nMy year from hell: RICHARD HAMMOND breaks his silence on the 'devastating' collapse of his marriage - as he reveals terrible impact of his father's death and how his new car business has lost half a million pounds\n\nI was terrified of driving, like so many women.

It breaks my heart.'\nLawrence, who publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election, said she feared 'speaking out too much' or 'answering too many of these questions' that 'my words will just be used to add more fire and rhetoric to something that is in the hands of our elected officials.\n'I just want people to stay focused on who is responsible and the things that they can do and when they need to show up and vote, and not let the actors and the artists who are trying to express freedom of art, freedom of speech take the heat for the individuals that are actually responsible.'\nLawrence's comments were slammed by fans online after she previously praised her friend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer, for choosing to speak up in support of Israel amid the conflict.\nSchumer was forced to disable her Instagram comments in November 2023 after posting in support of Israel following Hamas' deadly attack on October 7, after which Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, prompting protestors to call for a cease-fire.\nHer posts received a slew of harsh comments critiquing her views, her looks, and weight.\nAfter sharing a number of videos that explained what a ceasefire would mean for Israel, she turned off comments on the posts.\nShe later shared a note reading: ''Couple things. What I want is EVERY HOSTAGE BACK I want safety and freedom from Hamas for Palestinians and Israelis. I want safety for Jewish people and Muslims as well. Everyone. Just like you. I want peace.'\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentComments\n\nWhat's your take on Jennifer's revelation?Comment now\n\nSmoke rises from ongoing strikes as Palestinians, carrying their belongings by vehicle or on their backs, continue to flee toward southern Gaza via al-Rashid Street after intensified Israeli attacks and ground operation amid forced evacuation orders in Gaza City on September 26\n\nAppearing at the San Sebastian Film Festival press conference on Friday to promote new movie, Die My Love, Lawrence said of Palestine: 'I’m terrified and it’s mortifying. 'What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable, I’m terrified for my children'\n\nThe October 7 attack by Hamas left 1,400 Israelis murdered and over 200 kidnapped - pictured the Supernova Music Festival site where the attacks happened\n\nFans erupted on social media and claimed Lawrence had performed a 'back track' after supporting Schumer last year - as well as lambasting the star for taking years to comment on the conflict\n\nOthers defended the 'hero' star for publicly speaking out\n\nLawrence also lashed out about the 'disrespect and discourse' in American politics - she endorsed defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, who was beaten by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election\n'You will never see me wishing harm on anyone. Saying I'm Islamophobic or that I like genocide is crazy. So here you go by popular demand. Comments on. Please keep the below in mind.\nIn April 2024 Lawrence had high words of praise for Schumer, and her mettle in facing personal attacks for her activism.\n\n Amy Schumer turns Instagram comments back on after being schooled by MLK's daughter \n'Amy's choice to use her voice to speak for justice puts her under immense fire,' the Academy Award-winning actress told Variety as part of a profile on Schumer.\nLawrence continued: 'I wouldn't say she navigates it so much as she throws her middle fingers up and walks away from negative comments like a gas station fire in a Michael Bay movie.' \nFans erupted on social media and claimed Lawrence had performed a 'back track' after supporting Schumer last year - as well as lambasting the star for taking years to comment on the conflict. \nOne wrote: 'Hmmm looks like a bit of a back track! Wonder what changed? Definitely hasn’t done the right thing from the start, and we knew people would try to act like they have been on the right side of history once the tide turned.'\n\nSchumer faced huge backlash over her Israeli-Palestinian conflict remarks; seen in March 2023\n\nShe spoke about feeling 'ashamed' of her Jewish identity during her younger years and how she had to 'laugh along' with hurtful jokes to fit in\nOthers typed: 'Let’s hold off on deifying celebrities that have waited so long to come to reality. Stop putting these people on a pedestal. Has the last decade not shown us that these people are as brain dead as anyone else. Their celebrity means nothing. I’m glad they have a platform to speak about Gaza, but come on guys. Don’t fall back into old habits or celebrity worship.\n'Oh now she wants to change her tune? After two years?! What was she doing defending Amy Schumer when people were angry at her for defending the settler-colonialist genocidal entity? \n'Isn’t she best friends with Amy Schumer… I’m sure I remember her defending Amy schumer’s stance on Gaza\n'No, she is NOT a hero. She was defending Amy schumer and kept silence until now. If she is not being asked about Palestinians children in that interview, she won't utter this kind statement and kept silence in Genocide, which is complicity in it itself. \n'Hey remember when she was supporting Amy Schumer? Yeah, Jennifer, sit down. \nOthers defended the 'hero' Hunger Games actress for her comments, saying: 'Jennifer Lawrence spoke truth with courage, naming Gaza a genocide and exposing the moral collapse of U.S. politics. Her fear reflects millions: silence feeds oppression. She reminds us responsibility lies with leaders, not artists, and justice ignored abroad will reach home soon\n'She’s absolutely right and I would love to see other celebrities with big platforms to speak up about this issue too \n'THANK YOU JENNIFER YOU ARE A HERO!'\nLast year Schumer told Variety about an instance in March in which she was verbally abused, months after stating her support for Israel following Hamas' October 7 attack on a music festival, triggering the ongoing heightened conflict in the Middle East.\nSchumer said she was in Brooklyn near the subway, working on an upcoming film titled Kinda Pregnant, when a passerby yelled at her, 'F*** you, Amy Schumer! You're a Zionist! You love genocide!'\nThe Trainwreck actress, who has past turned off her social media comments amid vitriolic remarks, said that she's gotten used to it at this point.\n'It didn't even raise my heart rate,' Schumer said of the incident on the set. 'I didn't cry. Nothing.'\nSchumer said that she 'can't help' herself in making remarks that could generate controversy and a backlash against her.\n'A lot of people can help it, but I've never been able to,' she told the outlet. 'But I also want to be helpful. Do you know what I mean?'\n\n In a later post the comedian shared a note announcing she was opening up her comments section and 'accepting love and feedback'\n\nSchumer wrapped up the post writing, 'We are all in a lot of pain. What hurts the most is that we all actually love each other. You hate Jews. You don't know why. I still love you'\n\nIn the chat with Variety, Schumer said she found inconsistencies with the public's perception of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\n'The focus is so razor-sharp on Jewish people but not on Hamas,' she said. 'It's very strange.\n'So I'd recommend people read a book - Israel: A Simple Guide to the Most Misunderstood Country on Earth by Noa Tishby. Or anything - Jewish people wrote everything down.'\nHamasJennifer LawrenceIsraelPalestine\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFans turn on Jennifer Lawrence as she reveals stance on Palestine after praising Amy Schumer's Israel remarks\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 860\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

On Thursday, Evans entertained a guest with secret service stature. During her visit, Harris discusses her book “107 Days,” which entails her experience as a presidential candidate during the 2024 election. She revealed to Evans he was the first person she discussed the book with outside of her team. The housewarming vibes set the tone for a conversation that allowed Harris to speak with comfort and embrace emojis, a delicacy she had been without during her time in the White House. As they discussed her book, Evans and Harris shared a cheese and anchovies pizza. The host made the choice to commemorate the day she found out President Joe Biden was going to drop out of the race for the house on Pennsylvania Avenue. “The first day you found out that Joe Biden was not going to be running for reelection and that you got the go-ahead,” Evans said, “cheese pizza with anchovies is where you went.” Harris reveals she found out Biden was going to drop out of the presidential race while playing with her niece’s daughters. She was in her sweatpants, with her hair in a ponytail, when the unexpected call went through. “This is really happening and the only people staffing me are both under 4 feet tall,” Harris said. “My little baby nieces … firsthand witnesses to history.” She recalls her team coming together immediately and turning her dining table from a breakfast setting to business. Work for her campaign began and as the day elongated and dinner time passed, they ordered pizza, including one with cheese and anchovies. In her book, Harris calls the day she certified the election one of the hardest things she’s ever had to do. As vice president and president of the senate, it was her responsibility to confirm the election on Jan. 6, a date in infamy after the insurrection that took place on the same date in 2021. Evans asked her if there was ever a moment in which she didn't want to take the high road. “It was nonnegotiable in my mind that I would stand there and give it the process, the dignity that it deserves of showing what leadership should be about, which is a peaceful transfer of power,” Harris said. “I was not going to let them, in any way, compromise every reason that I ran for president, which is that I do believe in the importance of the rule of law,” she added. After conceding the election, Harris tells Evans she grieved and experienced emotions that resembled those she felt when her mother died. “I choose not to allow circumstances or individuals disempower my spirit,” she added as an emotional Evans added: “If you can say that, if you can really believe that, then there are so many others of us who can feel confident in that as well.”","summary":"Kamala Harris appeared on YouTube show 'House Guest' to discuss her memoir '107 Days' about the 2024 presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-09-26/kamala-harris-speaks-about-her-upcoming-book-on-house-guest","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/709810d/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2048x1365+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F9a%2F6c70ddf94dd780987eb41f694a66%2Fhouse-guest-lead-phot","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 18:57:48","author":"Anthony Solorzano","authors":["Anthony Solorzano"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.35},{"id":363775844,"title":"Meet the new Jimmy Carter, worse than the old one","text":"Former President Joe Biden is destined to inherit Carter’s ignominious legacy, becoming, in the modern era, the new avatar for presidential incompetence and impotence. That he has managed this despite enjoying the unqualified support of the news and entertainment industries is a testament to his preternatural ability to, as former President Barack Obama once said, “f*** things up.”\n\nThere are the little things that point to Biden’s destiny as the new Carter, a president for whom nothing nice can be said of his administration, for which everything he attempted ended in disaster, and for whose “leadership” neither the country nor the international community benefited.\n\nThere’s the fact that Biden’s dunce of a running mate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, is doing the rounds now on television, hawking a new book in which she explicitly criticizes her former boss. That Harris, whose years in D.C. politics before she was nominated as vice president could be counted on one hand, is publicly criticizing a man who has been in the nation’s capital since she was 8 years old, suggests a great deal about the former president’s current standing within his own party. Harris apparently fears no reprisal from Biden or leadership, and that says a lot.\n\nThat neither Democratic leadership nor anyone of real influence has mounted a defense for him says even more.\n\nThere are also these telling tidbits from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nBiden, 82 years old, is charting a postpresidency that is less lucrative than what he’d expected when he left office. Options for big jobs are limited by his advanced age, his unpopularity in Democratic circles and companies—concerned about retribution from President Trump—that aren’t offering speaking gigs. His own allies have grown critical of his presidency, most recently former Vice President Kamala Harris, who in a new book says the Democratic Party was reckless to allow Biden to run a second time. \n\nThe result for Biden is a leaner next chapter that lacks the well-funded foundations, plans for exquisite libraries and full calendar of paid speeches his peers enjoyed. \n\nInstead of private jets, Biden has been spotted with a book on his lap in the first-class cabin of American Airlines flights or (talking) aboard Amtrak’s quiet car. Paid speaking appearances can range from $300,000 to $500,000, people briefed on the matter said. Takers are limited, and at least one organization tried to negotiate below that range, some of the people said.\n\nEven former President George W. Bush, who enjoyed a modest “poll bounce” after leaving office in 2009, didn’t experience this sort of trouble following his final term. Then again, Bush is no Biden. Lucky him.\n\nIt gets worse for the man who promised to “restore the soul of the nation.”\n\nOf all the signs pointing to Biden’s future as the new Carter, perhaps none are so suggestive as the fact that voters prefer Biden’s predecessor and successor, President Donald Trump, on several key issues, despite having an even lower opinion of the Queens businessman.\n\nWhere voters are 41% and 57% approval/disapproval for Trump, they’re 43% and 54% approval/disapproval for Joe Biden, according to Gallup, which has current favorability data on both men.\n\nYet, when it comes to the issues that move voters to the polls, they prefer Trump to Biden. The most remarkable thing is that Trump does this while also being underwater with voters. This is hardly a reason for Trump to celebrate, but what does it say of Biden?\n\nOn the economy, voters are happier now with Trump (41%) than they were with Biden at the end of his term (38%), according to a RealClearPolitics polling average. Trump also polls higher now on foreign policy (42% to 35%), immigration (47% to 33.5%!), inflation (39% to 34%), and crime (47% to 38%) than Biden did in his last year as president. On the matter of crime specifically, CNN found voters overwhelmingly prefer Trump to Biden. Public support for Trump’s handling of crime went from -13 in March 2024, according to an assessment of his first term, to +1 in August, a fairly stunning rebuke of the “empathy” president. Along with CNN’s data on Trump’s net approval on crime, the network’s data also show that Biden’s favorables last year for his approach to crime hovered at around -26. That’s a wide gap.\n\nThere’s also the relevant matter that, though his numbers are less than stellar, Trump enjoys a slightly higher approval rating now than he did when he left office in 2021, amid a riot, shouts for former Vice President Mike Pence’s head, and an impeachment trial. It’s enough to make one suspect that Biden was such a massive flop as president that voters were almost happy to welcome back the “American carnage” candidate.\n\nFor every president between Carter and the present, there has typically been at least one issue or policy matter in which even a slim majority of voters had something positive to say. Biden appears to have no such luck — from his hands-off approach to crime to his head-in-the-sand approach to inflation, to his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration seems hard-pressed to find admirers. \n\nIn fact, when it comes to overall approval for job performance, 54% of voters believe Trump is doing a better job than Biden did as president, according to a new August Harvard CAPS-Harris survey. \n\nIn other words, voters view the Biden presidency as an unmitigated disaster, even if they hold a higher opinion of him than the current chief executive.\n\nVOTERS DON’T TRUST DEMOCRATS TO RUN A LEMONADE STAND\n\nA nice guy, sure, but a rotten president.\n\nThat sounds familiar.\n\nBecket Adams is a writer in Washington and program director for the National Journalism Center.","summary":"For nearly 50 years, one U.S. president has stood above all others as an unqualified failure.

All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.”\n\nWhile some of that language must be required by an exhausted legal team behind the scenes, the long-running satirical cartoon is known for pressing hot-button topics and rapidly churning out searing parodies. Season 27, which premiered in July, is no exception, focusing on President Donald Trump, his associates, policies and other current events. Some members of Trump’s Cabinet have been outspoken about their likeness appearing in “South Park,” but others have shrugged it off. Over the years, the animated series has depicted conservatives and liberals alike, leaving almost no public figure, politician or activist shielded from critique or crude depiction.\n\nThis season has had an unusual cadence of episodes, with the first two arriving on a weekly schedule, then biweekly before the arrival of Episode 5, which aired three weeks later on Wednesday. The delayed episode arrived after the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose debate style was depicted in the Episode 2. However, “South Park” creators Matt Parker and Trey Stone told the Denver Post the delay was unrelated to recent events, like Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, or the content: “No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true.” The pair had issued a statement on Sept. 17 saying the episode wasn’t finished in time. Future episodes will air every two weeks through Dec. 10.\n\nHere is a guide to every parody and reference so far on this season of “South Park.”\n\n‘Sermon on the ‘Mount,’ Episode 1\n\nCutting funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n\nCartman is dismayed to find out National Public Radio has lost its federal funding after he tunes in to hear static — an NPR program is his “favorite show,” he says, where “all the liberals b— and whine about stuff.” He rants to his friends about how the government “can’t cancel a show” and wonders what might be next on the chopping block.\n\nIn July, the Senate voted to approve the Trump White House’s proposal to claw back roughly $1 billion in federal funding previously allocated for public broadcasting. NPR and PBS are still operating despite the funding cuts, but layoffs and reduced programming are expected.\n\nChristianity in public schools\n\nHead of South Park Elementary PC Principal, whose name was a play on the initialism for politically correct, announces to the school that his name now stands for “Power Christian Principal.” He holds an assembly where he says that “our Lord and savior Jesus Christ” is the only thing that can bring back some normalcy to these “corrupt times.” He proceeds to welcome Jesus to the assembly as a guest speaker. When the students go back home, their parents and the people of South Park are alarmed to hear about the emphasis on Christianity — and the presence of Jesus — in the town’s public school.\n\nTrump has previously endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms amid a push to incorporate more Christianity into public schools.\n\n‘Woke is dead’\n\nThe phrase frequently used by Trump was inscribed on a T-shirt Cartman wears after he realizes the concept of “wokeness” is no longer prominent. “Everyone hates the Jews, everyone’s fine with using gay slurs,” he says, lamenting that he no longer feels purpose if there’s no wokeness to contest.\n\nKaroline Leavitt\n\nThe White House press secretary is depicted corralling the president, sporting a large cross necklace, as she often does during press briefings. Leavitt tells Trump a lot of his supporters are starting to turn against him and begs him to talk to them, adding that they’re “really riled up.” Trump’s base has expressed frustration over the administration’s approach to sharing information about the Jeffery Epstein case after he promised more transparency about the convicted sex offender, who died by suicide in 2019, and the sex trafficking investigation involving the late financier.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTrump appears this season with an image of his face over an animated body, frequently repeating the phrase “Relax, guy” and threatening lawsuits against anyone who’s in his way. He is shown berating a White House portrait painter for an unflattering depiction of him and there are references to the size of the president’s genitalia. He’s also depicted as being in an abusive relationship with Satan — in which Trump is the abuser. “South Park” has previously depicted Satan as being the victim in an abusive relationship with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Epstein list\n\nSatan laments the speculation that Trump’s name is on the “Epstein list,” a purported list of his alleged clients. In reality, the Justice Department has said no such list exists, walking back comments Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi made in a Fox News interview earlier this year that the list was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. When the list is brought up in the series, fictional Trump says, “Are we still talking about that?,” mirroring comments he made in real life.\n\nCBS’ ’60 Minutes’ and Paramount drama\n\nThe stopwatch featured in the introduction to “60 Minutes” is strapped to a bomb when it appears on “South Park.” The hosts of the show are visibly nervous and continue praising the president while covering his lawsuit against the town of South Park, adding that they don’t agree with Trump’s detractors.\n\nThe scene references the legal tussle between Trump and Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which airs “60 Minutes.” The president sued over edits to a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which led to Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July; shortly after, the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance.\n\nBetween the settlement and merger approval, CBS announced it is canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Colbert frequently skewers the president on his show, and Trump praised the cancellation. Paramount also recently bought the global streaming rights to “South Park” in a lucrative $1.5 billion deal for Parker and Stone.\n\nDuring the episode’s fictitious “60 Minutes” segment over Trump’s lawsuit against the town, Jesus comes to visit the townspeople. Through whispers, he tells them, “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.”\n\n“The president’s suing you?” a protester asks.\n\nJesus, through clenched teeth, explains: “The guy can do what he wants now that someone backed down. … You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys gotta stop being stupid. … If someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.”\n\n“All of you, shut the f— up or South Park is over!” Jesus says.\n\nThe people of South Park end up settling their lawsuit with the president for $3.5 million, saying it will be fine as long as they cut some funding for their schools, hospitals and roads. And as part of the settlement, they have to agree to “pro-Trump messaging.” Cut to a live-action deepfake video of Trump trekking through the desert in a show of loyalty to his supporters before he strips naked.\n\n‘Got a Nut,’ Episode 2\n\n[Note: This episode aired on Aug. 6, more than a month before political commentator Charlie Kirk, who is parodied throughout the episode, was shot and killed.]\n\nICE recruitment and immigration raids\n\nThis episode is focused on the ongoing raids carried out across the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials since earlier this year.\n\nWhen South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey is fired — the government is doing away with needless spending in schools, he’s told — he signs up for a job with ICE, enticed by a generous signing bonus and a higher salary. Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.”\n\nMackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior.\n\nShe’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.”\n\nAnd in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode.\n\nNoem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said.\n\nRight-wing debate podcasts\n\nWhile conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured.\n\nLoudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views.\n\nClyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.”\n\nClyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous.\n\n“I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.”\n\nHe also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events.\n\nHe’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out.\n\nThe vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.”\n\n‘Sickofancy,’ Episode 3\n\nImmigration raid at cannabis farm\n\nRandy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!”\n\nIn July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died.\n\nMicrodosing ketamine\n\nWith his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.”\n\nMusk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”\n\nMusk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook\n\nMeta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president.\n\n“Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset.\n\nLuxury jet from Qatar\n\nQatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhen Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia.\n\nIn August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons.\n\nReclassifying marijuana\n\nRandy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level. (The gift is Towelie himself.) Randy, in the form of a hologram, tells Trump he thinks they can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nTrump said in an August press conference that his administration was considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, which would be a significant change in policy but would not make the drug legal across the country.\n\n‘Wok is Dead,’ Episode 4\n\nTariffs and Labubus\n\nThe clerk at the City Pop-Up — rebranded from City Wok — the lone purveyor of Labubus in the area, says the popular dolls are hard to keep in stock, and they’re very expensive because of tariffs. The “mystery box” that Butters has to purchase for the chance of getting the exact Labubu his girlfriend wants sets him back $85, and later, the price shoots up to $120 to offset a rise in tariffs. (The real-life dolls often fetch much more than that on resale sites, especially if they are rare.) When Butters balks at the price, the store owner explains that the cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer.\n\nThis episode shows a clip from a Fox News segment where an anchor is overly complimentary of the president. The anchor says the president will take questions from a “diverse crowd of reporters” after returning to the U.S. from a historic tariff summit, only to reveal all of the reporters are from Fox.\n\nThe Fox News reporters also fixate on President Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania, and his increasingly frequent appearances with Satan. There’s a heavy use of wordplay that suggests the anchors could be asking about the affair between the president and Satan or about whether Trump is actually the devil himself.\n\nFox News reporters check in with Trump ally Kid Rock after breaking the news that — buckle up — Trump has impregnated Satan. A sobbing Kid Rock tells the reporters, “I’m just so happy.” The musician is a friend and ardent supporter of Trump, having performed at his inaugural rally in January and spoken many times publicly about his support of the president.\n\n‘Conflict of Interest,’ Episode 5\n\nIsrael and Gaza\n\nKyle becomes irate when his classmates place bets on a popular market prediction app that his mother would “strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital.”\n\nThis episode marks the first time this season that the show has touched on the current conflict in Gaza, and it referenced real-life Israeli strikes on hospitals in the area.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nTrump’s eldest son appears in this episode as someone with many roles — he’s a strategic adviser for predictive markets, he answers the phone for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also acts as a special adviser to Israel. Although he wears all those hats, the series doesn’t portray him as particularly bright — he has a complete conversation over the phone with himself.\n\nHe’s also animated to look as if he’s had extensive plastic surgery and he speaks with a strained voice, as if he can’t move his face.\n\nTrump Jr. holds several key roles in his family’s business and his father’s political sphere in real life, and he serves as an adviser to both Polymart and Kalshi, two prediction market apps that are named and spoofed in this episode.\n\nTrump’s stance on abortion\n\nLess keen on the baby he’s expecting with Satan, Trump looks for different ways to harm the pregnancy in hopes of terminating it. He asks Satan if he wants to smoke and hang out in a hot tub, holds up a wire hanger, tries to get him to trip down the stairs or fall under a pile of cat feces, and even makes Satan a soup full of emergency contraceptive pills.\n\nIn reality, Trump has repeatedly shifted his messaging on abortion but has most recently said he believes specific abortion policies and access should be decided not by federal law but by individual states.\n\nBrendan Carr\n\nThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission comes into the fold this episode when Kyle goes through several hoops to try to file a complaint over the bet involving his mom, which he finds offensive. The FCC is “dealing with all the offensive stuff now,” Kyle is told.\n\nCarr says he needs to speak with the president after learning about the offensive content, but he ends up falling victim to all of Trump’s antics in his attempt to terminate Satan’s pregnancy, which send him to the hospital. The doctors say they’re “afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.”\n\nVance later threatens Carr, who keeps interfering with Trump’s attempts to end Satan’s pregnancy (Vance doesn’t want anything to mess with his proximity to the presidency). “We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,” Vance says to Carr.\n\nThose words match the phrase Carr said in real life a week before this episode aired in reference to his call on ABC to act on comments late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made about Kirk’s suspected killer and his death. Carr has remained in the headlines since then as backlash grew against the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nFrustrated by the bet about her and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Kyle’s mom storms into the office of the Israeli prime minister. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” she says. “You’re making life for Jews miserable and life for American Jews impossible.” She continues to berate him and a group of officials while the credits roll. Netanyahu does not say anything in response.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.”\n\nMackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior.\n\nShe’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.”\n\nAnd in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode.\n\nNoem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said.\n\nRight-wing debate podcasts\n\nWhile conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured.\n\nLoudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views.\n\nClyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.”\n\nClyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous.\n\n“I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.”\n\nHe also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events.\n\nHe’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out.\n\nThe vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.”\n\n‘Sickofancy,’ Episode 3\n\nImmigration raid at cannabis farm\n\nRandy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!”\n\nIn July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died.\n\nMicrodosing ketamine\n\nWith his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.”\n\nMusk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”\n\nMusk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook\n\nMeta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president.\n\n“Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset.\n\nLuxury jet from Qatar\n\nQatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhen Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia.\n\nIn August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons.\n\nReclassifying marijuana\n\nRandy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level. (The gift is Towelie himself.) Randy, in the form of a hologram, tells Trump he thinks they can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nTrump said in an August press conference that his administration was considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, which would be a significant change in policy but would not make the drug legal across the country.\n\n‘Wok is Dead,’ Episode 4\n\nTariffs and Labubus\n\nThe clerk at the City Pop-Up — rebranded from City Wok — the lone purveyor of Labubus in the area, says the popular dolls are hard to keep in stock, and they’re very expensive because of tariffs. The “mystery box” that Butters has to purchase for the chance of getting the exact Labubu his girlfriend wants sets him back $85, and later, the price shoots up to $120 to offset a rise in tariffs. (The real-life dolls often fetch much more than that on resale sites, especially if they are rare.) When Butters balks at the price, the store owner explains that the cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer.\n\nThis episode shows a clip from a Fox News segment where an anchor is overly complimentary of the president. The anchor says the president will take questions from a “diverse crowd of reporters” after returning to the U.S. from a historic tariff summit, only to reveal all of the reporters are from Fox.\n\nThe Fox News reporters also fixate on President Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania, and his increasingly frequent appearances with Satan. There’s a heavy use of wordplay that suggests the anchors could be asking about the affair between the president and Satan or about whether Trump is actually the devil himself.\n\nFox News reporters check in with Trump ally Kid Rock after breaking the news that — buckle up — Trump has impregnated Satan. A sobbing Kid Rock tells the reporters, “I’m just so happy.” The musician is a friend and ardent supporter of Trump, having performed at his inaugural rally in January and spoken many times publicly about his support of the president.\n\n‘Conflict of Interest,’ Episode 5\n\nIsrael and Gaza\n\nKyle becomes irate when his classmates place bets on a popular market prediction app that his mother would “strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital.”\n\nThis episode marks the first time this season that the show has touched on the current conflict in Gaza, and it referenced real-life Israeli strikes on hospitals in the area.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nTrump’s eldest son appears in this episode as someone with many roles — he’s a strategic adviser for predictive markets, he answers the phone for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also acts as a special adviser to Israel. Although he wears all those hats, the series doesn’t portray him as particularly bright — he has a complete conversation over the phone with himself.\n\nHe’s also animated to look as if he’s had extensive plastic surgery and he speaks with a strained voice, as if he can’t move his face.\n\nTrump Jr. holds several key roles in his family’s business and his father’s political sphere in real life, and he serves as an adviser to both Polymart and Kalshi, two prediction market apps that are named and spoofed in this episode.\n\nTrump’s stance on abortion\n\nLess keen on the baby he’s expecting with Satan, Trump looks for different ways to harm the pregnancy in hopes of terminating it. He asks Satan if he wants to smoke and hang out in a hot tub, holds up a wire hanger, tries to get him to trip down the stairs or fall under a pile of cat feces, and even makes Satan a soup full of emergency contraceptive pills.\n\nIn reality, Trump has repeatedly shifted his messaging on abortion but has most recently said he believes specific abortion policies and access should be decided not by federal law but by individual states.\n\nBrendan Carr\n\nThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission comes into the fold this episode when Kyle goes through several hoops to try to file a complaint over the bet involving his mom, which he finds offensive. The FCC is “dealing with all the offensive stuff now,” Kyle is told.\n\nCarr says he needs to speak with the president after learning about the offensive content, but he ends up falling victim to all of Trump’s antics in his attempt to terminate Satan’s pregnancy, which send him to the hospital. The doctors say they’re “afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.”\n\nVance later threatens Carr, who keeps interfering with Trump’s attempts to end Satan’s pregnancy (Vance doesn’t want anything to mess with his proximity to the presidency). “We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,” Vance says to Carr.\n\nThose words match the phrase Carr said in real life a week before this episode aired in reference to his call on ABC to act on comments late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made about Kirk’s suspected killer and his death. Carr has remained in the headlines since then as backlash grew against the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nFrustrated by the bet about her and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Kyle’s mom storms into the office of the Israeli prime minister. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” she says. “You’re making life for Jews miserable and life for American Jews impossible.” She continues to berate him and a group of officials while the credits roll. Netanyahu does not say anything in response.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

After graduating from U.C.L.A., in 2005, he started working as a blogger, and then as a writer for The American Prospect. At the Washington Post, his “Wonkblog” made him one of the first self-branded digital-era journalists. In 2013, he was considered for a gig at MSNBC that ended up going to Chris Hayes—a turn of events that he has called “the best thing that ever happened to me.” After co-founding the digital-media company Vox, Klein migrated, in 2021, to the Times.\nEarlier in his career, Klein was known, despite lousy grades in math, as a coolly analytical voice on health-care policy and other technocratic arguments. Occasionally, he would lash out, as he did, in 2009, at then Senator Joe Lieberman’s opposition to health-care legislation and his willingness “to cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people to settle an old electoral score.” But such moments were anomalous. At the Times, his reputation has deepened, and he now wields a great deal of influence among Democrats in Washington. It made a difference when he insisted, earlier than most, that Joe Biden was too old to run for a second term.\nKlein is the author of “Why We Are Polarized” and the co-author, with Derek Thompson, of the recent best-selling manifesto “Abundance,” which addresses issues such as affordable housing, climate change, and infrastructure. The reformist ideology of “Abundance,” which remains a hotly debated topic in Democratic Party circles, opposes both a progressivism that fears economic growth and a conservatism that is repelled by government intervention.\nAs a speaker and an interviewer, Klein is exceedingly intelligent, fluid, and, if not conflict-averse, exactly, then polite. He does not go for the throat, preferring a style of argument that invites in a wide circle of views. This is not universally appreciated. Lately, Klein has caught some criticism for a piece, titled “Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way,” which, in the wake of the assassination in Utah, set to the side Kirk’s more disturbing rhetoric and beliefs. In a conversation for The New Yorker Radio Hour, we began our discussion with the Kirk assassination and went on to talk about the Democrats, media, and where Klein sees American politics going. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nLet’s start with what happened after Charlie Kirk was killed. You pretty immediately published an essay in the Times which, of course, condemned political violence, comparing it to the danger of a contagion. And you praised Kirk for his willingness to debate—you called it “practicing politics the right way.” That phrase resonated everywhere. Since that terrible event, we’ve seen how Trump and some in the MAGA movement have at times planned to use his death in a serious crackdown on the opposition. How do you look back on that column?\nI think I have to separate a couple of things here. My view is that, in the twelve hours or so after somebody is publicly murdered, it is a good time to sit with people in their grief. I believe very deeply that, when you commit an act of political violence like that, it is an act of political violence against everybody who participates in politics. I said in that piece, and I believe, that on that stage that day, Charlie Kirk was practicing politics. He was up there arguing with people. I’ve heard people say, Well, he’s not really debating to find the truth. And, of course not. He was a very, very effective practitioner of politics. He’s trying to persuade people. He’s trying to create content that will work in our attentional sphere. Something that we liberals have to reckon with is that he, and the people like him, had been winning. They had begun to win on college campuses, and there’s a big Gen Z swing toward Donald Trump. They were certainly winning on social media. Kirk’s willingness to go into places where people disagreed with him was very effective. You can disagree—I disagree with him profoundly.\nThe critique of it was that you were for sure engaging with his practice of politics—of meeting people where they are—but maybe underselling what Charlie Kirk represented in terms of his positions: about race, about “Jewish money” funding an “anti-whiteness agenda,” about his views about L.G.B.T.Q. people—about all kinds of things. What is your sense of his particular politics?\nI think this is a weird critique. Genuinely. You know human beings, David. In the moments after a murder or death, do you go to people and tell them exactly what you thought of the person they just lost? Is your relationship to people who you’re in community with—and I do believe myself to be in a political community with people who cared about and loved Charlie Kirk even as much as I’m very much on the other side from them—would you go to people like that when they’ve just watched somebody be killed?\nTa-Nehisi Coates, for example, wrote a piece in Vanity Fair, setting out a collection of statements from Charlie Kirk, that was quite representative. Did you think that was unfair?\nNo. I agree with Ta-Nehisi on virtually every view he has on things that Charlie Kirk had said. As I wrote in my second piece, I have poured virtually every ounce of myself into preventing everything that Kirk poured himself into creating. For more people than I had understood, the sense that we are in any way in community together—the sense that we are still in a place where we are all practicing and doing politics—has already eroded. Something that’s very alive for me is a feeling that we are not that far from national rupture. So many things that we like to say “can’t happen here” have already been happening here.\nAnd who do you blame for that?\nI mean, I blame Donald Trump quite specifically for that. I think that the way he has acted in the aftermath of Kirk’s murder has been an exhibition of virtually everything that is wrong—\nI’m in a hundred-per-cent agreement with you there. I watched a lot of that memorial service and—\nWhat did you think of it?\nI saw two remarkable things. I saw the widow of Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk, get up and do an extraordinary thing. Here is a woman whose world has been shattered, whose family has been shattered, who’s lost the husband she adored, and she forgave the person who killed him. I don’t know that I could ever be capable of that. And then who spoke later? Donald Trump. He got up and he said, “I hate my opponent; I can’t be like that.” And it wasn’t just rhetoric, it wasn’t a tossed-off comment. It was true. And that—that really struck me.\nThere is some part of him, I think, that would thrill to the possibility of an excuse to crack down [on his opponents]. They’re already trying it in many ways.\nThe other thing I saw, to be honest, was a political opportunity. A politics of hatred is a weak politics. A lot of people desire something different. I found myself thinking a lot recently about the speech through which Barack Obama rose to power—the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech in Boston. I think a lot of people now have almost given up on that type of politics.\nBut you remember what Obama said about it? That it was an aspirational speech.\nOf course. Aspiration is very powerful in politics. And—because I am genuinely worried about rupture, but also because I’m genuinely determined to try to be useful in making our politics better and having people whom I trust more holding power—I think we should not engage in oppositional mirroring, where whatever the other side does, we do. You hate me? Oh, well you know what? I hate you.\nDo you see a lot of mirroring on the liberal side?\nOne huge strategic mistake we have made on the liberal side, for at least a decade now, is, yes, oppositional mirroring.\nHow would you illustrate that?\nLet me give you an example. Obama’s a very, very effective politician because he’s very good at containing opposites inside of him. You wrote a biography of him. You know this about him better than just about anybody. He was very good at having a sense that, if you’re going to push the country, you also need to create space in yourself—in your political movement, in your rhetoric—for the disagreement, for the concern, for the pushback. He was this generationally capable political balancer, holding both our liberalism and our illiberalism inside himself. After him, I think, this began to break down. Trump rises and you have, say, the Hillary Clinton “deplorables” speech, which is—\nWhich was a deplorable speech.\nThe worst word in that speech is “irredeemable.” She says that people voting for Trump are “irredeemable.” When you begin to talk like that, it’s a severing of political community.\nWhat happens is Trump then wins, which is taken as truly shocking, and the Democratic Party begins to take on the opposite positions of Trump in many ways. Trump is the most anti-immigrant President of our lifetime—not just in his desire to build a wall but emotionally anti-immigrant. The Democratic Party becomes much more pro-immigrant. If you’re going to build a wall, we’re going to debate legalizing, decriminalizing, illegal border crossing.\nBut that wasn’t true across the board. There were a lot of differing positions on immigration—and not expressed with a similar, much less equivalent, hatred.\nI agree that Donald Trump is unique in the way he radiates hatred. And I think you know this, even as you’re pushing me on this: If you talk to people on the right—and, I’m not talking about Donald Trump or people at the top of politics, I’m talking about the people in my life who ended up voting for Trump—they felt, in these years, profoundly rejected. I do think this politics of “deplorables” was very real.\nI covered the Affordable Care Act very closely. When that passed, Democrats held Senate seats in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and West Virginia. I think competing in these states has become, in many ways, unimaginable to Democrats. They are just written off largely. Pete Buttigieg is considered one of the brightest political lights in the Democratic Party. He might be President, but nobody thinks he could be governor of Indiana, right?\nCertainly people who don’t agree with the things I believe in the world began to feel that the Democratic Party genuinely didn’t like them. And one of my most strongly held views about politics is that the most important question for voters is not whether they like the politician, but whether the politician likes them. If voters are going to trust you with power, the first thing they’re concerned about is not whether they agree with you. The first thing is whether or not they feel you like them, and will take them into consideration.\nBut do you think any of that was centered on Obama himself?\nOh, there’s no doubt.\nWhy? Because of his character?\nBecause he was Black and foreign to people.\nThere you go.\nAnd I’ll ask you this question: Do you think Obama would’ve won in 2016 if he could have run again?\n\nSo there you go. Politics is about power. And I think people have missed this. Politics is not about self-expression—there’s room for that. It’s not just about a dispassionate analysis of ideas—there’s room for that. It’s a lot of what I do, a lot of what you do. But politics is about building coalitions capable of winning power and about making the decisions you need to to be able to do that.\nI said recently, in a podcast with my colleague Ross Douthat, that I feel that there’s been a lot of fatalism among Democrats. They’ve just accepted that there are places where they cannot compete. And I said that I want to see real decisions being made to try to compete in Kansas and Missouri and Ohio and then in red states—meaning, redder than that. I’d like to see us running pro-life Democrats again. When Obamacare passed, about forty House Democrats were pro-life. People got very upset about that. I get why, but I think it’s worth thinking about this.\nHas it been bad for the Republican Party that Susan Collins, who is nominally pro-choice, wins in Maine? Has it been bad for the Republican Party that Donald Trump welcomed R.F.K., Jr., and all of his voters—from Joe Rogan all the way down—into their coalition? No, it has expanded their power. Trump built coalitions when he thought it would serve him. He is, among many other things, a ruthlessly political animal. I think there are things to take seriously in that, which we have begun to demean.\nI hear you. The difficulty is juggling these plates all at once.\n\nRight now, you’re speaking the language of conciliation and broadening the scope and the tent—temperamentally and politically—of the Democratic Party. I hear you on that. At the same time, you have—and I think we agree on this, too—a President who is, in fact, uniquely authoritarian in his instincts and, it would seem, in his policies as well. And to do those things at the same time—to fight that battle at the same time—is hard to do. It seems almost irreconcilable, temperamentally, within the Democratic Party.\nI think some of this reflects the absence right now of a leader in the Democratic Party who can sort of make decisions on behalf of it. But to me these two things are the same. If you are facing Mitt Romney, you have a margin for loss. If you lose, it’s a shame. But it’s Mitt Romney. Nothing that bad is going to happen. If you keep losing to maga, then at least the way I look at the world, terrible things are going to happen—truly terrible things. And the risk of catastrophic things happening—the risk of what we understand to be the American political system cracking into something else—becomes very real.\nBut you’re asking for a certain kind of equanimity within the Democratic Party.\nNo, I’m asking for strategic discipline.\nWhat’s the difference?\nI’m saying that we should take on an approach to politics that we think will expand our coalition such that we are not always within two points of losing to Donald Trump or the people around him. And if that means doing things that are uncomfortable. . . . When people get terrible diseases, they don’t take the medicines because they enjoy the side effects—they do it because it might work.\nWho exemplifies this temperament of leadership, and of the way he or she looks at the world?\nI’m not sure I have the person right now. I mean in some ways I think I am saying we should rediscover the politics of Barack Obama.\nTell me more about that.\nI don’t think it’s an accident that the last two Democrats to win nationally, and serve two terms, had this very open-palmed approach to politics and were very good at balancing these different forces and dynamics in them. That doesn’t mean, by the way, that their Presidencies did not drive many people on the other side crazy. Bill Clinton, in ways that in retrospect look ridiculous, drove the right crazy. I mean, you remember the conspiracy theories about Vince Foster and all the rest of it. And Obama, by virtue of who he is—no matter how conciliatory he was—by virtue of his identity, by virtue of his skin color, by virtue of his name, drove the right nuts.\nAre you happy with how present or not Barack Obama is in the national conversation and debate?\nNo. I think we could use more of his leadership and voice right now. I’ve said this on my show, and I’ll say it on yours: I wish he were more out there. But I think that he’s still playing by the rules, wherein it would be unseemly for a former President to take a very public role. I also think he believes that if he does that he will choke off oxygen for the next generation of Democratic leaders to rise. But I would like to see Barack Obama on “Joe Rogan.”\nAnd I think we both know that he would do it in a second.\nI can’t speak for him, but I think so. I think it would be good for him to be in places talking to people who don’t often hear from us—people who might be persuadable. Not going to Fox News and going on Jesse Watters’s show. But I think having the best communicator in modern liberalism out there trying to describe what is wrong with this moment, in ways that are not like clips from a thing with Steve Scully, would be good. You have to win in the attentional sphere, right now. And there are very few people who can do it as well as he can.\nObama, who was a hero of liberalism at a certain point in time, now takes a lot of criticism from the left, or the left-left, depending on how you see it. I wonder how you look at that phenomenon now.\nI’ve been thinking a ton about this. How does Obama go, in a pretty compressed number of years, from nearly an impossibility—the very act of his election seeming like a pivotal moment in the country to many people—to this by the end of his term? He is still the most popular national-level politician in America today. It’s very easy, I think, to overstate the Obama backlash. He’s doing better than any other figure, which is why I’d like to see him out there more.\nBut I think it reflects a couple of things. The hopes that his campaign aroused in people were not capable of being delivered upon by the prose of actual governing—through Congress, and the filibuster, and all these blockages. He did a lot, but it wasn’t enough. And so there was a letdown. Then he’s followed by Trump, and I think the Obama legacy looks different to people because it seems to have ended not in this arc bending toward justice. Instead, it’s followed by very rapid regression.\nOne of the ways I view politics is that the communication mediums upon which it happens are very determinative of what then becomes powerful and popular and energetic. The move to social media and algorithmic media was really a move toward a style of political communication that is somewhat hostile to the liberal project and the deliberative, open-minded, thoughtful, on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand mode of discourse that Obama is good at. He’s bad at Twitter. You ever read Obama on Twitter? It’s not his thing. Trump is good at Twitter.\nIt actually is a remarkable experiment, what we’re doing here. The idea that a country as big and diverse, with as much political argumentation and division as we have, was actually doing the work of democracy, doing the work of politics—that’s actually amazing. And I think Obama wasn’t able to keep that story going, and nobody kept it going after him. But I do think there is a lot of power in actually reconnecting people at this moment when I think they feel—I certainly feel it—that this could break. We could just break this. Somebody like Trump could just break this.\nDo you feel we’re on the verge of being broken? Do you despair?\nI don’t despair, but I take seriously the possibilities of calamity.\nWhat does broken look like?\nI think broken looks like, among other possible things, state-sponsored political violence at a mass scale. I think broken looks like more violence coming out and the political party in power using that to deploy the National Guard, using that to deploy, what ice might be functionally now, a paramilitary. I think that it looks like Hungary, right? You already see the way Trump is using the power of the state to try to alter where power lies: the redistricting in Texas, the intimidation of network news. We have seen democratic backsliding in other countries and the use of the state to fundamentally change the playing field of elections. Elections still happen, but they’re not really fair. I think you can imagine a lot of ways it breaks.\nBy the way, the country has broken before. We’ve had periods of rupture before. It’s not an unknown thing. The worst set of outcomes are very bad, and I think that the probability set of them has gotten larger, and it’s going to take luck and leadership to keep the worst from happening, and to get us into somewhere better, where we’re not just endlessly on the precipice of this kind of collapse.\nThere’s a lot I disagree with Trump on, but one thing I really find offensive about him, and I would say this about J. D. Vance now, too, is that I don’t think either of them believe in this project anymore. J. D. Vance at one point did. But I think what Trump said is how he feels. He hates his enemies.\nAnd hatred rather than ideology is the animating force?\nI think for Vance, there’s a more kind of scarily ideological structure. I think he’s very influenced by people who believe that America was lost at some point in the past fifty years. They differ on exactly when it was, and you need some kind of counter-revolution to restore it to the heritage Americans who are really supposed to have ownership over this. There’s a profound contempt and anger that radiates from both Trump and Vance. And I think that they both intend—Trump in his intuitive way, Vance in his more systematic way—to instantiate that into policy and power. And things can get really bad when you attempt to do that.\nHow do you defeat that? In other words, we began our conversation with an endorsement of the ability to sit down with people who you disagree with ferociously—not just over tax policy but ferociously on fundamental things. But how is this rupture to be prevented?\nThis is the work of politics. And one thing I believe is that we’ve begun to demean the work of politics. One of the things I am worried about is—I actually think a little bit on both sides, but it’s particularly true in the Democratic Party—that the work of building political coalitions around disagreement has often become seen as something akin to betrayal.\nSo I am interested to see the Democrats run in 2026, and I would like to see, in places where it’s become very hard for Democrats to win, very unusual candidates. I would like to see them trying more things. Graham Platner, in Maine, is an interesting way to try to do that from an economic, populist perspective. But Maine is not a red state, so that’s not what’s going to win you in Texas. You see James Talarico, in Texas—he’s kind of an interesting candidate. Who are the Democrats going to run in Kansas? Who are they going to run in Missouri? Sherrod Brown, in Ohio, is a very strong candidate.\nI think that over a four-, eight-, twelve-year period, we need to repolarize this country in a safer way than we have. Not this sort of system, anti-system polarization. And that means mixing up the parties a little bit again. This sense that you will need to build bridges right now to survive, that maybe are not the ones you most prefer building—I think that’s very real. And I think that requires us to see the work of politics as honorable work, even when it includes a lot of compromise and a lot of working with people who we have very, very deep disagreements with. But you’re trying to build power, and you’re trying to do good things with that power. And that is the point of politics.\nI grew up in Irvine, California. The district I lived in did not elect a Democrat to Congress until Katie Porter, in 2018. My father was a professor at U.C.I., and is now retired.\nHe taught what?\nMathematics, which I’m not good at. I used to joke that I’m good at math for a journalist.\nThat’s not saying much.\nIt’s not. So my dad’s a mathematician. My mother worked with children and was an artist. They’re both, thankfully, alive and healthy. My house was mostly Democratic. But it wasn’t a highly political house. We did not receive The New Yorker or The New Republic. We got the L.A. Times, watched nightly newscasts, and there was some talk radio. It wasn’t a highly political house.\nYou had some political enthusiasms early on. You worked for Howard Dean.\nYes, when I was in college. My older brother worked in environmental law, and used to take me to protests in L.A., where he lived.\nWhat kind of protests?\nFarm workers’ marches. But I primarily got into politics through blogging. I became a blogger back when nobody knew what that was. This is when I was a freshman in college, in 2003. And I just loved writing about politics, reading about politics, thinking about politics, debating it with people.\nWhen I began to read you, in little venues early on, you were the first self-branded journalist that I knew of—when you were doing “Wonkblog,” at the Washington Post.\nSimpler time.\nWell, but you were an innovative person, and had an analytic cast of mind when it came to politics, which a lot of journalists just don’t have. How did that develop, and do you accept the premise?\nSomebody told me recently that they think of my work as a cerebral Trojan horse for emotional ideas. Which I don’t think is wrong, actually.\nWhat are they getting at that you think is true?\nI would say—I don’t think this is my reputation anymore, in the way it was in the “Wonkblog” days—but the idea that I was this cool, detached calculator of a reporter or journalist. . . . I mean, the reason I care about these things is that I feel incredibly emotionally compelled by the stakes of politics—whether or not people get health care, whether or not we go to war, what kinds of people are in power. That these things are shaping our lives, whether we want them to or not, is a central, almost physical reality we all have to face. And understanding them is one of the few ways to try to face it.\nBut, kind of like a Marxist or a certain kind of conservative of a different sort, there is this systemic look at the way things work. When you were twenty-eight, still at the Washington Post, you used to give a talk that was called “Why Washington Is Horrible (in Charts),” with the main point being that we focus way too much on individuals and maybe not enough on Washington as a system. Tell me what that was about, and how much is it carried over to your thinking today?\nWe have this functionally false idea of how our political system works, based on the founder’s intentions, which is that we’re a system of checks and balances. We have three coequal branches that will jealously guard their power and prerogatives from one another. Well, that was the intention of our system. In fact, what we have is two political parties that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution because they were not predicted or anticipated or hoped for. They compete across those branches.\nSo, right now, we have a Republican-controlled Congress coöperating with a Republican-controlled executive branch, and, I would say, coöperating with a Republican-controlled Supreme Court. Unless you have, built into the way you are looking at politics, the influence and fundamental centrality of parties—which our system does not do in any rigorous way—you will not understand either how it works or how it doesn’t work.\nIn the Senate, maybe less so now, it was certainly a mainstay of political reporting to treat everything as, The President should be able to get this done. And, if it’s not getting done, it was, Well, what’s the President doing wrong? But the filibuster was being used constantly. And unless you realized, Oh, it’s actually very hard to get to sixty votes in the Senate, and in this time of polarization it’s hard to get bipartisan coöperation. . . . I think it’s important, I think it is part of our duty—our, on some level, sacred duty—to give people a true account of why things are happening. And that requires understanding the systems in which people operate. Because most of us, for better and for worse, reflect the systems which structure the logics of our lives.\nI want to go back to the question that I raised before, about your influence in the Democratic Party. How do you feel it and not feel it?\nPeople really began seeing me this way around when Biden left the ticket. In early 2024, around the time of the Super Bowl and the Robert Hur [testimony], I did a series of pieces basically saying, It’s going to be catastrophic for this then eighty-one-year-old to run again. The big problem to me in the Party, at that point, was fatalism.\nSo were you getting feedback from the Biden people? Did anyone mail you a dead fish?\nNo, but I got people telling me that they thought I was wrong. People icing me out. I got much more aggressive feedback in public in some ways than I did in private. In private, the feedback I got, let me put it this way, was more measured, but it was more, I think, destructive. It was, Well, we have no choice but to run; there’s nobody but Biden, because otherwise it’ll be Kamala Harris and she’ll lose. That was the quiet whisper response to anybody who thought Biden shouldn’t run.\nFrom Biden’s people?\nFrom that world of people, yes. And I, one, thought Harris would be a better bet. I think she would’ve been a much better bet if Biden had left the ticket much earlier. I also believed we should have had an open convention.\nEven with only a hundred and seven days left on the clock?\nHe could’ve left before that.\nWithout question, and should have.\nBy the time he left, there wasn’t time for it.\nIt was too late.\nIt was too late. He had waited too long. But when I did that series of pieces about Biden being too old to run, I would say that they were not influential at all. Biden gave a good State of the Union, and everybody thought I was an idiot. And that’s just where the situation sat.\nWhat changed the situation was reality. It was Joe Biden getting up in that debate and falling apart. And so I don’t see this as some remarkable campaign of influence I ran. I think I was seeing reality a little bit . . . I was seeing it clearly, but voters had seen this long before I said anything about it. The super-majority of the public had said for a long time that Biden was too old to run again. I helped create a little bit of permission structure for people to admit that when reality interceded and it was no longer something that could be denied.\nDo you ever get Democratic senators, congressmen calling you on the phone asking for counsel or private conversations in which you’re not acting in a kind of journalist-interview atmosphere?\nI have always—and I’m sure you do, too—\nNo, I don’t.\n—had a lot of conversations that are—I would describe them as, like, exchanging thoughts. I don’t believe that you don’t, David. I don’t think that’s true.\nNo, it is true.\nLike, not everything is an interview for publication in a column. You have lunches, you do all that. I do that, too.\nBut it’s not in the spirit of giving counsel. I’m not saying you do it—\nNo, I take that point. I don’t see myself in those conversations as a counsellor.\nBecause, you know, there is a tradition of this—Walter Lippmann giving counsel to this one or that one.\nAnd doing secret diplomatic missions. The lines were blurry back then.\nSo you keep it pretty on the up and up.\n\nWould you ever go into politics?\n\nAbsolutely not? You’re making a Sherman statement.\nI’m making a Sherman statement. I think you have to know what you’re good at doing. I think I’m good at doing this.\nWhat is your sense of your mission as a podcaster, as a writer?\nMy sense of mission is simple: I have values and beliefs about how the world should work and what would make the world better, and I try to persuade people of them, but I also try to explore them in an honest way. I do this because I care about where things are going. I’m not dispassionately observing from the sidelines. I am emotionally, intellectually, spiritually involved.\nBut what I’m doing, and the way I’m doing it, has changed a lot over the years. In ways that I can follow more through intuition than through some framework. The version of me that was writing “Wonkblog,” and telling everybody about health care and aging in one chart, is not what I’m doing on my podcast now. My podcast is a forum in which I’m not primarily trying to be persuasive. Over time I think it has persuasive elements, but it’s mostly other people talking. I have a lot of people on the show whom I disagree with. And I think it acts as a space in which certain kinds of conversations can be had and then can be put into conversation with each other. And that matters.\nIn my column, I’m more prescriptive. What goes into, eventually, the book “Abundance,” comes more from the column, and that’s me trying to understand the world and trying to find ways to confront things in it that I find puzzling or unnerving. I try to take seriously questions that I don’t love. I don’t try to insist the world works the way I want it to work. I try to be honest with myself about the way it is working.\nYou are an important figure at what I think is still, today, the most important news-gathering organization on earth, the New York Times, but it’s also one that everybody has opinions about. And recently Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote a book about the summer of 2020, which was dramatic in a lot of quarters, including the Times. James Bennett fired. Bari Weiss left and created The Free Press. What’s your opinion about Bari Weiss’s increasing influence? It looks like she’s about to be a very important figure at CBS News.\nYeah, it seems like she’s about to take over CBS.\nWhat do you think?\nMy thing about Bari—and I’ve been on her show—I have a lot of admiration for how good she is at what she does. My disagreements with Bari are that I think she’s asymmetric in sympathy and generosity.\nTell me what that means.\nI’ve thought The Free Press’ work on, say, starvation in Gaza has been really bad.\nSpell it out.\nIt’s done this whole thing, like, Well, a lot of the kids who have died and have been reported on, well, they had secondary conditions. And, yes, when you starve a population the people who die first will be the most vulnerable. But that’s not exculpatory. There was overwhelming evidence of how bad things were in Gaza. I felt that they were trying to whitewash it.\nI think Bari, though, is an insane talent spotter. If you look at what she’s built at The Free Press, she’s very, very good at finding people, at pulling them in, at networking with them. She’s sort of an impresario. Bringing in Tyler Cowen to be a columnist was a very good idea for them.\nThe economist.\nI’m somebody who’s edited a site, Vox, right? I know how hard this is to do. And Bari has an incredibly sensitive feel for the political moment. It is not my feel for the moment, and her politics are not mine.\nWhat are her politics? How would you describe them?\nWhat I see her trying to do is something that used to be somewhat more common, which is to self-consciously be what she would define as the center. And I see The Free Press tacking back and forth around that. It was much more sort of pro-Trump, I would say, when he was running and the Democrats were in power. But now that he’s in it’s, like, Oh, no, they’re the vandals. The publication is a little bit, to me, like the old New Republic, doing things they used to do. . . . Actually, it’s funny. When I was a blogger, this was something we all used to complain about all the time. All of these organizations that we felt were using this concept, this amorphous concept of the center as a positioning device—\nThat it was a dodge.\nNo, it wasn’t a dodge—it was navigational. They weren’t dodging. They were just kind of . . . there were a lot of politicians and a lot of players who had felt like their politics were hewing to some idea of the center, as opposed to a very consistent set of views and principles. And, as media has become polarized, many fewer places are doing that. I think Bari saw a market opportunity in that. Is her center what I think is the center? No. But I recognize a lot of editorial skill there.\nSo how do you look at the Washington Post now?\nMy sense, in a way that is quite tragic . . . I’ve not spoken to Jeff Bezos about any of this, I don’t know him—but I don’t think he has found it fun to own the Washington Post. Maybe he did right at the beginning.\nHe did for the first term of Trump.\nHe did for the first term. And then it became a headache, a liability. The staff is always mad at him.\nAnd it’s no fun at all.\nAnd it’s no fun at all. And—\nAnd he seems to want to have a lot of fun.\nAnd I think he wants to have a lot of fun. And I think he’s somewhat punishing the institution, making clear that you can’t do this to him, he’s in charge. And I think that—I mean, I don’t think this, this is just obvious—the turns in leadership since Marty Baron have just been sort of disastrous. They just have not worked. And it’s a shame. I mean, the Post is in a tough position, because their specialty is politics. And what they should be—\n—is the best in politics.\n—is the absolute best political newspaper or reporting organization. But they face so much competition at the national political level—not just the Times but Politico, Axios, The Atlantic—to be the best at politics. The Wall Street Journal, actually, I think has been doing very, very good political work. To be the best at politics is really hard. And I don’t think it would’ve been possible for the Post to do, but I think it would’ve required really focussing on politics. And then Bezos—he doesn’t want to be the best at reporting on politics. He wants to be occupying a certain political space himself. The Post has become a danger and a liability to him in that. And that’s become a danger and a liability to the Post.\nWhat do you see as the most important and interesting media enterprises that are emerging in this new universe?\nI think that the media has developed this barbell shape. You have some behemoth-level players: the New York Times, Condé Nast, the Murdoch operations, some of the networks, and so on. You’ve got a couple really big players, and it’s been hard for them, but there are ways to succeed at that. It has a not winner-take-all but a winner-take-more dynamic. And then it is much easier to be an individual or near-individual proprietor. When I started blogging, you couldn’t monetize that. Now Substack makes it very monetizable. And so you have some interesting publications that have begun there. The Free Press is one of them. But you could also look at things like The Dispatch and The Bulwark. The Argument, edited by Jerusalem Demsas, which is a sort of new liberal publication, is something that I think is exciting and I’m watching closely.\nWhat has been decimated is the middle. And the middle is really important. I don’t just mean local newspapers, like the Baltimore Sun, though I mean that, too. I also mean the middle of magazines. What GQ and Esquire were in the seventies is not what they are today. The L.A. Times, the Boston Globe—when these things stop being what they were, you’re training a lot less talent, you have a lot less diversity in what is being reported, and the local-news need is being very badly underserved. I think magazines are the form of media I love most. You’d be shocked at how many of them I subscribe to.\nWhy is it important for you to be at the Times as opposed to out on your own?\nI believe in journalistic institutions. When I went out and did Vox, I was trying to build an institution, not just go out on my own and capture the most revenue that I could. I think that the mix of the news is exciting, and I’m committed to the news as an industry. If you carve out all the national politics, et cetera, then it’s much harder to also have the foreign reporting, the local reporting, the cultural reporting—all the things that make up the bundle. And those are the things I often care about. And I think I’m just—it goes to the way I look at the world, but also just me—an institutionalist. I like being at an institution. I admire institutions when they’re doing good, and I want them to succeed because I think we need them.\nLet me ask you about an institution that we were talking about earlier: the Democratic Party. You talk a lot to people within the Democratic Party, leaders of the Democratic Party. It looks like a mess at this point. You have some promising people in—\n[Laughs.] What makes you say that, David?\nI just conjured it out of thin air. In New York City, it looks like Zohran Mamdani is going to be the next mayor of New York City. If I read you right, you have ambivalence about Mamdani. Or have you come around in some way?\nI wrote a piece during the mayoral primary where I said that I thought Brad Lander was the best choice. But I think Mamdani is an amazing political talent. I agree with him on many issues. My concerns about Mamdani really just have to do with: can he first get the revenue he needs for a very pricey agenda? He’s talked a bunch about “Abundance” and has done interviews with my co-author, Derek Thompson. Can he actually rebuild the government such that he can achieve the kinds of things he wants to achieve? And what is going to happen when the Trump Administration moves into a confrontational mode with him? Because I think it will, right? They’re going to want to break him: escalate ICE raids, send in the National Guard here, occupy New York City. He’s inexperienced as an executive. New York City is a very hard thing to run at the best of times. He has not run much. But I don’t think of those as terrible demerits to somebody. You could have said some of the same things about Barack Obama on one level. And we’re just going to have to see how it plays out.\nI think it is genuinely strange the way the leadership of the Democratic Party has treated him. At this point, I have not heard an account that makes sense. If they’re trying to keep him at arm’s length, it will not work. He is going to be the mayor of New York as a Democrat. Saying that they’re friendly to him but not endorsing him is not going to save them from being painted by what he does. On the other hand, to all the people who are inspired by him and like him, they look feckless. I’ve said this on other shows: if they don’t want to endorse him, if they think he’d be a bad choice, then they should say that. But this weird ambivalence dance they’re doing is, I just think, much more bizarre.\nWell, the ambivalence, I assume, comes from a kind of fear of his popularity and his talent.\nI don’t think it comes from there.\nWhere do you think that comes from?\nI think they are afraid that he will open up gigantic surfaces that they will have to defend and they will have trouble doing it. You’ve been on my show, we’ve talked about this—I am truly horrified at Israel’s conduct in Gaza at this point. I think it’s a—\n\nI think we’re well past war crimes. I think we’re into something generational. But Mamdani’s promise to, say, direct the New York City police to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu the moment he steps foot in New York City, say, to attend a U.N. meeting. . . . I think Netanyahu would probably love this confrontation.\nAs would Trump.\nAs would Trump. But I can understand why the Democratic Party’s leadership is afraid of what might combust. Israel’s a very hard issue for them. It splits their base very badly. So I can see—if I, like, squint. But I don’t think what the Democrats are afraid of is talent. I think they’re afraid of something that goes off the rails that they’re then trying to defend. But I just don’t think what they’re doing makes sense. One thing I’ve been saying about the big tent of the Democratic Party is: the theory of having a big tent doesn’t just mean moving to the right—it also means accepting the left. And Mamdani is going to be one of the left’s standard bearers.\nIn the last two weeks, there have been stories about A.O.C., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and what the future might hold for her: either running for Senate or even President. When you think about her? Do you see her as a potential President?\nI don’t know. We’d have to see how she performed in a primary—what her agenda was, what her campaign looked like, how she performed under that kind of scrutiny. But I think you have to see her as one of the people who is a serious contender for that role. She would naturally inherit Bernie Sanders’s lane and most of his supporters. He doesn’t have full control over those supporters, of course; some people might’ve liked him who wouldn’t like her. But I think the anti-oligarchy tour they were doing was in certain ways the passing of the torch from him to her. And Bernie has been incredibly powerful in Democratic primaries and came very near winning, in 2016 and 2020. I think that you have to assume that she would just start with a more solid base of support than all but a couple other people. When I’ve seen the early polling—and you should be extraordinarily skeptical of 2025 polling for a 2028 primary, but—\nI’d be skeptical of it even in 2027.\nFair enough. But she is polling behind only Pete Buttigieg and Gavin Newsom. This is in polls where Kamala Harris is not included. And so you’re looking at somebody who starts out with one of the clearest lanes, because so many other candidates are going to be competing in the non-Bernie lane. And so it would be pretty straightforward how you would imagine her winning the primary.\nYou were describing Obama before and his talents, but also his more capacious ideology. Who’s in that lane?\nI don’t know that we know yet. Probably the closest person in the way he thinks about politics is Buttigieg, but whether or not Buttigieg can do what Obama was able to do. . . . Part of what made Obama such an extraordinary force in the Democratic Party was his support among Black voters, which Buttigieg really struggles with.\nAnd Kamala Harris just admitted, in her new book, that the reason she’d didn’t select Pete Buttigieg as her Vice-President was that he’s gay. And that would’ve been, I don’t know—\nReally? She says that in the book?\n—too much identity in one ticket. That was her. . . yes. That she would have gone for Buttigieg.\nHuh. I’ve not read it yet, but that is interesting.\nHow do you mean interesting?\nIt’s just interesting. I’m surprised she said that.\nWe are at the close of our conversation, but I have to ask you a crucial question. You go to Burning Man?\nI’ve been known to go to Burning Man.\nWould I enjoy it?\nNo, you would not.\nYou sleep on the ground, that sort of thing?\nI mean, you could do it in different ways. You could take an R.V., you could go to what’s called a “plug and play” camp. I think it’s an amazing thing for anybody to see once—\nOnce a philosopher, twice a pervert, as they say.\nThat applies probably better to Burning Man than most places.\nNo doubt.

McMaster said on the GoodFellows podcast this week. McMaster said he turned down the invitation immediately. \"I don’t know if it was a producer or Colbert himself, but there’s been an orthodoxy that’s taken hold of late-night television. So many of these monologues, honestly, are just diatribes. They’re not funny. Which might explain why the ratings are dropping.\" McMaster is unlikely the only guest to have faced such conditions. A recent NewsBusters study found that since the start of 2025, 99% of late-night guests were \"left-leaning\". Among partisan officials, the tally was 30 Democrats and zero Republicans. Imagine if a conservative host demanded that a liberal guest bash Joe Biden or Kamala Harris before coming on. Media figures like Brian Stelter would demand accountability. Yet McMaster’s story will likely go ignored — just as many outlets ignored news that Google admitted that they received pressure from the Biden administration to censor content. This is all such a rigged carnival. The past week, following Jimmy Kimmel's short-lived suspension, proves that. But ultimately, Colbert and Kimmel have hurt themselves the most by engaging in petty partisan politics. While both decided to wave goodbye to half the country, moderate and right-leaning viewers waved right back. Each has lost nearly half its audience since the pandemic. CBS says Colbert’s show, ending in May 2026, loses around $40 million a year. Kimmel averaged 30% fewer viewers than Colbert and likely loses just as much. No one expects Colbert or Kimmel to echo the late Rush Limbaugh. However, blacklisting conservative guests – unless they’re willing to denounce Trump – is bad business. It’s why, aside from headlines about cancellations or suspensions, Colbert and Kimmel are close to irrelevant. They dug their own graves.","summary":"The National Security Advisor during President Donald Trump’s first term was invited on “The Late Show &quot;with Stephen Colbert in 2024, but on one condition: he had to tell the audience not to vote for Trump.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/former-white-house-official-says-colbert-would-only-book-him-he-denounced-trump","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/colbert-late-show-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 17:55:43","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.761},{"id":363774730,"title":"Douglas Schoen: Desperate to pass Prop. 50, Newsom risks enlisting the far-left","text":"After multiple steps to move towards the center, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a decided lurch to the left, enlisting progressive Rep.

2028 run for either the White House or the Senate.\n\nWhile California’s deep-blue electorate is probably more receptive to AOC than most other states, Newsom’s strategy of courting the far-left

winning the special election. \n\nAnd, having staked his reputation – and leadership role within the Democratic party – on passing the ballot measure, polling data reinforces that Newsom is left with

is highest among young, college educated Democrats – the core of the progressive wing.\n\nSimilarly, the UC Berkeley poll shows that three-quarters (76%) of voters who identify as “strongly liberal” back Newsom’s effort, more than 30-points higher than moderates (42%).\n\nTaken together, Newsom’s steps to enlist AOC reflect the growing importance and power of the progressive faction of a

Wanting Her “Girl Crush” Cardi B To Run For U.S. President On ‘The View’: “Cardi B 2028!”","text":"Ana Navarro (jokingly) teased an idea for who she’s backing for the 2028 presidential election.\n\nOn the subject of Gavin Newsom‘s face-offs with and trolling of President Donald Trump, Alyssa Farah Griffin lauded his employment of media, telling Navarro, Joy Behar, and Sara Haines on Friday’s episode of The View that she thinks “he gets where the country is going [and] gets where media is going.”\n\nNavarro chimed in to assert that “some of the left-wing Democratic podcasts are doing much better now” than some right-wing podcasts, citing the MeidasTouch podcast.\n\n“And I do like what Gavin Newsom says about—and Kamala [Harris] said it when she was here—about fighting fire with fire and meeting them where they are,” she added. “Because this idea that Michelle Obama said, ‘When they go low, we go high,’ is a little dated. In fact, my girl crush, Cardi B, answered that this week.”\n\nViewers were treated to a clip from Cardi B’s recent interview with Gayle King on CBS Mornings, in which the rapper was asked if she agrees with the former First Lady’s philosophy.\n\n“No,” Cardi B replied. “When they go low, I take it to Hell where the lava is at. The volcano erupted. That’s where I take it. I don’t take it high, I take it low.”\n\nAfter the clip concluded, Navarro exclaimed, “Cardi B 2028!”\n\nGriffin and Haines both immediately thought of their fellow View panelist Sunny Hostin after hearing Cardi B’s take on Michelle Obama’s mantra.\n\nHaines explained, “Sunny Hostin says ‘to the Earth’s crust’ every time she says ‘if they go low, I’m going lower.'”\n\nWhile Haines said she doesn’t think “everyone’s cut out for that” mentality” because “it’s not just a technique you choose,” Navarro felt differently.\n\n“I’m cut out for that. I’m happy with it,” she claimed. “20,000 leagues under the ocean.”\n\nBehar quipped, “When they go low, I get high.”\n\nThe View airs on weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.","summary":"Navarro resonated with some of the rapper's recent comments on 'CBS Mornings.'","url":"https://decider.com/2025/09/26/ana-navarro-jokes-wanting-cardi-b-run-for-u-s-president-the-view/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CB-AN-TV-pic.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DpwF2Efd-QVS3bn7S.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-26 16:49:01","author":"Alex Vena,mliss1578","authors":["Alex Vena","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.158}]}
