Guy Reschenthaler split from wife — now dating Fox News reporter Brooke Singman","text":"Pennsylvania Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, 41, has split from his wife — and has moved on with Fox News Digital correspondent Brooke Singman, 32, multiple sources tell Page Six.\n\nThe new couple are not hiding, and have been making the rounds in Washington, DC, we hear.\n\nTwo sources tell us they spotted Reschenthaler, the House of Representatives Chief Deputy Whip, and the journalist having dinner during an event at the Library of Congress last week. \n\n“The dynamic looked romantic in nature,” said one spy. \n\nAccording to sources, Singman met Reschenthaler in October while covering a Donald Trump campaign stop in the swing state, when the candidate famously manned a fry station at a local McDonald’s. \n\nSingman had interviewed the GOP pol for the article, “Kamala Harris ‘has become toxic’ for Pennsylvania, top Keystone State lawmaker says.”\n\nHowever, a source tells us the pair did not start dating until January. \n\nReschenthaler — a former district judge — and his estranged wife, Jennifer, married in Virginia in 2021. A source tells us they separated in November.\n\nWe hear that Fox News is aware of Singman’s relationship with the politician, and that it’s not a conflict of interest since Singman does not cover Congress. \n\nThe digital reporter is a rising star at the network: She began as Fox News president and executive editor Jay Wallace’s assistant, and now frequently appears on air.\n\nThe standout digital reporter is a favorite of President Trump, having landed an exclusive interview with him as recently as Mar. 6.\n\nSome speculated in a 2023 Daily Beast piece that the reporter, “could be angling for a job in a prospective second Trump administration.”\n\nReschenthaler got a shout out from Trump during a St. Patrick’s day reception at the White House last week.\n\n“You know Reschenthaler, he’s … That’s actually the way you pronounce it, you know,” Trump quipped.\n\n“Nobody else gets it right. I got it right. But it’s a hell of a name. And despite that, he’s very successful at what he does, which is politics, and he is a great guy.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania pol previously served in the Navy Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps and defended a SEAL who had been accused of covering up an assault on Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi, known as the “Butcher of Fallujah,” while he was in custody.\n\nReps for the politician and Fox News did not comment.","summary":"Two sources tell us they spotted the House of Representatives Chief Deputy Whip and the journalist having dinner at the Library of Congress.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/03/18/society/rep-guy-reschenthaler-dating-fox-news-reporter-brooke-singman/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/100683981.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 00:24:45","author":"Mara Siegler","authors":["Mara Siegler"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":301651866,"title":"Kamala Harris Is 'Done at the Top of Ticket' Supporters Claim as Democratic Party Sinking — All While Politician Remains Out of the Spotlight Following Demoralizing Loss to Trump","text":"Kamala Harris has pushed herself out of the top of the Democratic ticket, at least according to some of her supporters.\n\nThe failed presidential candidate has remained out of the spotlight since losing badly to Donald Trump last November, RadarOnline.com can reveal.The 60-year-old is not looked at as the leading candidate to right the ship for Democrats when the 2028 presidential election kicks off, especially as she has steered clear of any public appearances all while Trump makes bizarre – and threatening – decisions from the White House.\n\nOne top donor told ABC News: \"I think she's done at the top of the ticket, I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic fundraiser Michael Kempner admitted: \"I don't know if I would get involved at this point even if God were running. ... I think it's going to be tough for any Democrat to raise any money. There is little enthusiasm.\"However, Harris has some support, as lawyer and Democratic donor Judith Barnett said: \"My opinion and my dedication to her hasn't changed one iota.

Gavin Newsom on Tuesday refused to chalk up the MAGA movement to just “racism and misogyny” — while hailing conservative kingpin Steve Bannon.\n\nNewsom, appearing on his podcast with former Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, listened as the Minnesota governor pondered whether MAGA figures are motivated by racism and sexism.\n\n“How do we put some of those guys back under a rock?” Walz asked during an episode of “This Is Gavin Newsom” while boasting about how “I could kick most of their ass.”\n\nThe Democrat from California argued that it’s important “to first understand what their motivations are” and figure out “what they’re actually doing.”\n\n“You don’t think it’s racism and misogyny?” Walz shot back.\n\nThe Golden State gov contended that the movement is also interested in working-class issues — and praised Bannon as a reminder of what Democrats used to sound like on economics.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of that, but I don’t think it’s exclusively that,” Newsom said in response to Walz’s “racism and misogyny” comment. “When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks, and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country.”\n\nBannon, who was last week’s guest on the California governor’s podcast, called for “dramatic action” in the political domain because the “system isn’t working for the working and middle class.”\n\nWalz protested that Bannon “denies the [2020] election,” something that Newsom had refrained from dwelling on during his exchange with the MAGA star last week. But Newsom argued that Bannon’s perspective on other issues shouldn’t be dismissed outright.\n\n“We can dismiss the notion of election denialism,” Newsom contended. “We could completely dismiss what he did on Jan. 6, [2021, during the Capitol riot]. But I don’t think you can dismiss what he’s saying, reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”\n\nNewsom’s first three major guests on his podcast were all MAGA stars: Bannon, Charlie Kirk and Michael Savage. \n\nThe interview with Bannon, who had taken a slew of digs at California, drew progressive ire including from Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D).\n\nThe term-limited California governor, who is speculated to have 2028 presidential aspirations, has billed his podcast as a space to explore both progressive and conservative viewpoints.\n\nDuring his exchange with Walz, Newsom gently suggested that the Minnesota governor’s indignant reaction to MAGA and touting that “I could kick most of their ass” is off-putting to a lot of men that have drifted more conservative.\n\n“It’s a natural reaction,” Newsom said. “I think it’s one of the reasons we’re losing so many men. And again, it’s multi-ethnic. It’s not just white men. We’re losing them. We’re losing them to these guys online.”\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, Walz had toned down the antipathy toward MAGA figures that he conveyed on Newsom’s podcast.\n\nHis ex-presidential running mate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, also has carefully refrained from insulting conservatives at times, leery about having a repeat of Hillary Clinton’s disastrous “basket of deplorables” moment.\n\n“Oh, God, I would never say that about the American people,” Harris said during an interview with Fox News’ Brett Baier in October when asked if she believed President Trump’s supporters were “stupid.”\n\nHarris, who has largely stayed out of the political spotlight since departing the White House in January, is rumored to be eying a run for Newsom’s seat during the 2026 cycle.","summary":"\"I don’t think you can dismiss what [Steve Bannon is] saying, reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago,'' Newsom told Walz.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/18/us-news/lefty-gavin-newsom-schools-tim-walz-on-maga-denies-its-just-racism-and-misogyny-while-praising-bannon/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100689362.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Fc3pesFF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-18 22:34:22","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.47},{"id":301627364,"title":"If AOC is its future, the Democratic Party is hopelessly lost","text":"Even Will Rogers might be hard pressed to come up with an appropriately harsh jibe about the current state of the Democrats. \n\n“I am not a member of any organized political party,” the 20th-century humorist famously said. \n\n“I am a Democrat.” \n\nNow, the problem isn’t a lack of organization per se, but the hangover of their dogged, dishonest support for a comprehensively failed presidency, joined to an irrational commitment to outlandish positions on cultural issues. \n\nThe Democrats shouldn’t be shocked that after insisting that Joe Biden was hale and hearty and fit to serve as commander-in-chief until January, 2029, the public has a dim view of their party.\n\nThe Democrats attempted to perpetrate one of the worst frauds on the American public in recent history, and then followed it up with another lie — that Biden’s overmatched emergency replacement, Kamala Harris, was joyful and impressive. \n\nIn a new CNN poll, the Democratic Party’s favorable rating is 29% — a record low going back to 1992.\n\nIn a new NBC poll, the Democratic Party’s favorable rating is 27% — a record low going back to 1990.\n\nDetect a pattern? \n\nPart of the reason for the dismal rating is that Democrats themselves want their party to be more confrontational with Trump and are dissatisfied.\n\nBut the party has taken a broader hit — in the NBC poll, only 11% of independents have a favorable view of it, and 56% unfavorable. \n\nThe agonized state of the party was encapsulated by its psychodrama over the so-called continuing resolution that 10 Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted to pass last week.\n\nProgressives consider Schumer’s support a rank betrayal, and he’s had to postpone a book tour amid “security concerns.” \n\nThe New York senator, who warned conservative Supreme Court justices a few years ago, “You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,” is now paying one himself. \n\nSchumer made the right tactical call. If Senate Democrats had successfully filibustered the spending bill, they would have been blamed for the resulting shutdown, further tanking the party’s image with the middle of the electorate. \n\nIn the fierce backlash against Schumer for saving his party another embarrassment, the left-wing congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is getting promoted as a potential primary challenger to Schumer, and even a national leader for Democrats.\n\nIn the CNN poll, Democrats were asked which political figure best represents the “core values” of their party, and AOC narrowly led. \n\nShe has as good a claim to this title as anyone — and that’s the problem. \n\nAOC is Kamala Harris, if the California Democrat hadn’t flipped-flopped away from all the fringy things she said in 2019.\n\nShe’s Bernie Sanders, if the Vermont socialist were about 50 years younger and could plausibly appear on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing the latest fashion.\n\nShe’s Mahmoud Khalil, if the Columbia University activist that the Trump administration wants to deport somehow managed to get himself elected to Congress. \n\nAOC rejects the term “woke,” but there is no woke policy that she doesn’t support.\n\nShe loved the neologism Latinx (“gender is fluid, language is fluid”), and still supports biological males competing in female sports (“trans girls are girls”). \n\nShe’s never met an immigration restriction that she likes. \n\nThe reason Joe Biden won in 2020 is he didn’t seem like a progressive, and one reason his party lost in 2024 is that he governed like one.\n\nAOC’s brand is the 2024 Biden rather than the 2020 Biden, except even more so.\n\nShe’s charismatic and adept at social media, which easily could bring her greater fame and influence, but she’s a cartoonish version of the Democratic Party that the GOP hopes to run against. \n\nWill Rogers also once commented, “You’ve got to admit that each party is worse than the other. The one that’s out always looks the best.”\n\nIf their fervor to oppose Trump throws Democrats into the arms of AOC, they will test the accuracy of this proposition. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a cartoon version of the Democratic Party that the GOP would love to run against — and Democrats say she embodies their philosophy.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/18/opinion/if-aoc-is-their-future-the-democrats-are-hopelessly-lost/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/081924_Democratic-Convention_068RS-e1742333754998.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 22:11:20","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.53},{"id":301628942,"title":"Democrats are cratering and waiting for Godot","text":"“What is our message?” he asks in frustration, adding, “I am not just talking about what was happening in last year’s election cycle. I mean right now. What are we doing to win over voters who left us? You know, the working class we used to champion.”\n\nA lawyer by trade, he says sending elected officials out on the cable news networks to channel a message like Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) or Govs. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Tim Walz (D-MN) isn’t the answer.\n\n“Murphy, Sanders, Walz, Pritzker, Crockett, and Ocasio-Cortez all represent states or districts where you don’t really need to win over many Republicans or conservative Democrats to win elections, or any at all. So their messages on social media or on the Sunday shows are all off if you want to win our state or Wisconsin or Michigan,” he said in exasperation, adding, “And you have to win those states to win not just presidential elections but also the majorities in the Senate, House, and governors’ offices.”\n\nConnecticut, Illinois, Vermont, and Minnesota are all states where Democrats are heavily favored in statewide elections. Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s (D-TX) district in Dallas is rated by the Cook Political Report a plus D+27, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) district is rated a D+28.\n\n“These are not the right messengers because their message is one of constant resistance and leaning in on ridiculous positions that don’t appeal to the average voter who used to be gettable for my party,” he says in frustration.\n\n“Right now we are waiting for Godot, and I don’t see that emerging anytime soon,” he said, referencing the Samuel Beckett play about two men debating under a tree while they wait for someone named Godot. Neither man was certain they were even at the right tree.\n\nRotimi Adeoye said the Godot reference was pretty on point. That’s because his party has engaged in often absurd arguments among itself in the public arena with no one emerging to shine a light on what its purposefulness is for voters.\n\nAdeoye, whose Democrat pedigree includes stints as a communication strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union, special assistant to former Sen. Bob Casey and statewide volunteer here for former President Barack Obama in 2012, is out front with his frustration with his party. \n\nAdeoye said his perspectives come from his family of immigrants. His parents migrated to Doylestown in Bucks County in the 1980s from Nigeria and as a whole are very diverse politically.\n\n“So the way that I think about politics sometimes is sitting at my Thanksgiving table. I have my aunt and uncle who voted for Trump, but I have my mom who is this diehard liberal, and I’m always kind of feeling like I am, how do I get my aunt and uncle to agree with me on an issue,” Adeoye explained.\n\n“And I think that’s something that Democrats have forgotten is how do we talk to people that disagree with us in a way that makes them still feel like they can be a part of our party?” he said. \n\nBoth Rotimi and Gino agree on why their party is at best stuck right now and at worst cratering. Two new polls released this past Sunday showed Democrats reaching historic lows in approval ratings nationwide — with NBC News numbers showing that only 27% of people say they like the job Democrats are doing. CNN’s numbers released the same day showed Democrats favorability at 29%, the lowest favorability rating in the 33-year history of the survey.\n\nAdeoye, who is a contributor at MSNBC and is now attending law school, said his party lost on the things it was always very good at: connecting with people on the cost of living, safety, and security, all while conveying a love of country.\n\n“While my family’s heritage is so important to me, our family has always had this kind of enduring faith and love for this country. And I think it’s really the job of Democrats to kind of figure out how can they build a party that speaks to the possibilities of America,” he said, adding, “I think some Democrats have this view of America that I don’t think resonates, which is just a sad and gloomy story and attacking kind of who we are.”\n\nAdeoye said he does not think that approach is the best way to build a party for the future. That is why he is working with a group of Pennsylvania Democrats on a report looking at not just why Harris lost but also a long look at the future of the party.\n\n“One of the biggest issues I see with the Democratic Party right now is they’re very just reactive to Trump. It is really all about what did Trump do today? How did we respond? How do we respond to what Trump is doing?” he explained.\n\nSomething he said he has yet to see is a Democrat put out their own vision from the country that isn’t just what Trump did or responding to it. \n\n“I think that gets us to the Waiting for Godot reference,” he said. “We are really waiting for something or someone to show up instead of just saying here’s our purpose, here is what we believe. We have a vision on economics. This is what we believe in. We want to talk about it. Instead of just saying this is what Trump did today. We’re so angry about it and responding.”\n\nAdeoye said he watched in exasperation his party’s inability to connect with the working class, and that’s not just the white working class.\n\n“I think that’s my biggest frustration with the party right now. We always want to say we are the party of the working class, and if this election showed anything, it shows that we’ve really lost that ability. And so we need to think about how we actually reach the working class if we’re truly going to say we represent them.” he said.\n\nHe also believes when both his party and journalists default is to make everything about race, you lose people. “I think that doesn’t move the party forward because the No. 1 issue that every single American says is cost of living and making sure that they can take care of their family and their kids. And I think the more that we don’t talk about that and talk about other issues, we’re distracting from our core message,” he said.\n\nAdeoye said he wasn’t all that surprised by the data released today by the Democratic firm Blue Rose Research looking at what happened in November. If all registered voters had turned out last year, it showed, Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points instead of 1.7 points. \n\nPOLLS? TRUMP IS IN A BETTER PLACE THAN DEMOCRATS\n\n“I think Kamala Harris’s message really missed out on telling a story of how people’s economic situation has been suffering for a while and how she was going to make it better, something that Trump did very effectively and ultimately let him win,” he said.\n\nIt’s something his party is still getting wrong.","summary":"PITTSBURGH — Gino has been a registered Democrat all of his life.

But is it also smart?","text":"Gavin Newsom's new podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom,\" has Democrats in a tizzy. Republicans too. It has been nearly universally panned (or celebrated, depending on your political stripes) for being fawning toward his far-right guests — Charlie Kirk, Michael Savage and Steve Bannon — leaving pundits asking, why is Gavin Newsom handing Steve Bannon a megaphone? and who is Gavin Newsom's podcast for? Let me answer both of those. Like everything any politician does, the podcast is for the man himself. And to be fair, no one is handing Steven Bannon a microphone because he already has one bigger than any Democrat's. If anything, by appearing on the show, Bannon is letting Newsom ride his wake — that episode has helped boost Newsom onto top 10 lists for listeners. Put those two truths together and, no matter how cringe or even appalling these first episodes have been (and oh, have they been appalling), the endeavor is undeniably smart. Newsom has long been a student of the right, both its message and its mediums. He may be one of the few Democrats who regularly listens to outlets such as Fox News, or even the Kirks of the world. He is also six years into a job that may be the end of elected office for him, unless he can find a way to make himself viable for a presidential run — no easy task. He understands there is a new political order, and it's not about rising through the ranks of the party or appeasing a base. It's about audience, politics aside, and Newsom is savvy enough to chase it. If he pulls it off, he could make himself an attractive presidential candidate in a field crowded with likable white guys on one side (Tim Walz, Pete Buttigieg, JB Pritzker and Andy Beshear to name a few) and everyone else on the other (Gretchen Whitmer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, even Kamala Harris). But even if this media venture doesn't open a path to the Oval Office, it could offer the Democratic Party a vision for how to win back a slice of disinterested and disillusioned voters who handed Donald Trump his slim victory. Democrats are in shambles. They have no center and no consensus. And certainly no discernible path toward wins in 2026 or 2028. As much as there is disarray, there is also a divide within the party. There's the Ocasio-Cortez-Bernie Sanders crowd that wants to double down on progressive values. And there's the big tent folks who are running for the middle ground like rats from fire, undone by the scorched earth policies of our president. Newsom may be forging his own path, politically and personally, trying to capture an audience that doesn't really know left from right, and loves to dismiss fact in favor of \"common sense.\" Those voters may be frustrating, but they are also key to wins. In his first episode with Kirk, Newsom threw transgender athletes under the bus, agreeing with Kirk that, \"it's deeply unfair\" for them to compete against women. That's a safe political position — almost 80% of Americans share it — but Newsom let Kirk gloss by with only minimal pushback about the way MAGA has demonized and weaponized transgender people in general, leaving a community already subject to high levels of violence in an even more precarious position. In his interview with Bannon, he agreed Deep State-style that \"there's a clay layer of bureaucracy, and you're right, unaccountable folks making a lot of decisions,\" and offered no dissent when Bannon claimed, \"this is part of the process to unwind you from being a globalist, to make you a populist nationalist. ... It's a long journey, but I think you'll get there.\" Newsom expressed disdain for meetings where people identify their pronouns, didn't argue with Bannon when he forcefully claimed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and spent a long time telling Kirk how much his teenage son was a fan. Yuck. The danger, of course, with cuddling up to extremists is getting covered in their scent. Newsom claims he wants to have respectful conversations with people who disagree, but MAGA doesn't respect Newsom. One-way respect makes you a doormat, and unless Newsom calls out his guests with more force, he risks being the punchline instead of the provocateur. Voting data expert Paul Mitchell surveyed California voters before and after Newsom's debut, and found his overall favorability rating fell by more than 10 points after people watched some of these clips. He also found that, \"the Democrats feltsuper double-crossed and the Republicans were like ... I agree with what he is saying but he is a liar.\" After being shown three bits from the Kirk podcast, Mitchell found that 26% of voters said it \"harmed their perception\" of Newsom, while 37% of self-identified liberals said the clips \"harmed their perception of the Governor.\" But to a certain extent, what Democrats think of Newsom right now may not matter that much. Democrats will, mostly, still be Democrats when we all go to the polls again. It's the disengaged voters that matter, and that had the final say in the last election — the so-called \"low information\" voters who don't follow politics all that much and get their often-questionable information from nontraditional sources. Democrats, Mitchell warns, \"are going to have to figure out a way to bring the low information voters back to them.\" For young men, whose well-being we are all angsting about right now, world views are being shaped by the voices of the manosphere, such as Bannon and Kirk, who have polished their grievance rhetoric until it shines like the civil rights speeches of old. Once, it was Democrats who owned talk of working people and their struggles. Now, Bannon's got that nailed. \"We believe in bringing power back to the grassroots level,\" he told Newsom. \"One of the reasons is we think the elites in this country, you know, the highly educated elites, the political class, the Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, all of it, have really forgotten the underlying kind of principles of the country and kind of left working-class people, regardless of their race, gender, ethnicity, sexual preference. You know, you pick it, they've kind of forgotten.\" That's a seductive and powerful message, and one Democrats used to own. Newsom might be one of the only Democrats who truly understands just how much of this working-class space has been lost to MAGA. If he can peel just a portion of that audience off and give them a Democratic take that resonates enough to carry into 2026 and beyond, he will have accomplished both an impressive feat for himself and his party. For himself, he will have established a power outside the traditional confines of politics — a kind of influence that has been shown to be a new path to the top by Republicans. It might not clear the way to the presidency, but it could open other options. Need proof? Conservative former podcaster Dan Bongino was sworn in Tuesday as deputy director of the FBI. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth used to work for Fox. Bannon has kept himself close to the White House in no small part because of the popularity of his \"War Room\" show, giving him enough clout to challenge even the king of social media power, Elon Musk. (Bannon has called Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant.\") Also Tuesday, Newsom dropped his first interview with a Democrat, Walz, and the two mused about how to fight MAGA. \"These are bad guys,\" Walz warned. \"But they exist,\" countered Newsom. \"We cannot continue to be on the defense.\" Even if the offense makes all of us cringe.","summary":"California Gov.

That’s a number that for decades has trended downward as the country’s population has diversified, but it’s still more than six times larger than the share of Black and Hispanic voters (11% each) and nearly 25 times that of Asian voters (3%). In other words, as a group, white voters continue to hold enormous sway and that will persist for the foreseeable future. Typically, the white vote is understood as being Republican-friendly (President Donald Trump carried it by 15 points), with pronounced gender and education gaps. White men sided with Trump in 2024, while white women went with Kamala Harris; white voters who don’t have college degrees strongly backed Trump, while those with at least a bachelor’s degree backed Harris. But there is a more useful — and revealing — way to understand the politics of white voters, something that is evident in the new NBC News poll. Call this the gap within the gap. It represents a layering of the education gap (which has exploded during the Trump-era) on top of the more established gender gap. When these are combined, a gaping chasm emerges — and two specific groups come into focus. On one end are white men without four-year college degrees. This is a generally blue-collar demographic that is now deeply aligned with Trump and opposed to progressive politics. On the other end are white women with at least a four-year college degree. This is a more affluent demographic that has been racing leftward, particularly on cultural issues, and is squarely opposed to Trump. Both groups pack a formidable punch. Eighteen percent of all voters last year were noncollege white men and 17% were college-educated white women. And they have come to exist in polar opposite political and cultural universes, each one unrelatable and probably unrecognizable to the other. This is captured vividly in the NBC News poll. Take a very basic question: Do voters have a positive or negative view of Trump? Among all voters — regardless of race, gender or class — 46% have a positive view and 49% a negative one. Among white voters only, Trump is a bit more popular: 52% have a positive opinion compared to 45% who have a negative opinion. Meanwhile, 69% of white men without a degree view Trump positively and just 28% see him negatively — a 41-point net-positive rating. And among white women with a degree, it’s 29% positive and 67% negative — for a net-negative of 38 points. That adds up to a whopping 79-point net rating gap between these two groups when it comes to their perception of Trump. When it comes to the various aspects of Trump’s job performance, the splits are just as massive. This rift extends far beyond Trump himself. The NBC News poll asked voters about a variety of political figures and topics. In every case, the verdict from each end of the gender/education spectrum among white voters couldn’t have been more different. Of course, there are plenty of white voters who don’t fall into either of these categories. As groups, college-educated white men and non-college white women lack similarly sharp political definition and cohesion. But bringing them into the mix adds another wrinkle. Here, for example, is the question of how Trump and other figures are viewed. This underscores just how politically distinct non-college white men and college-educated white women are. But it also sets college-educated women apart — they are significantly to the left of all other white voters (and, for that matter, the broader electorate too). This is especially noticeable when it comes to progressive cultural politics, which women with degrees are alone in embracing among white voters. Take an NBC poll question about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Voters were read two different statements about DEI and asked which one came closer to their own opinion. Statement A: We should continue DEI programs because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity, and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.Statement B: We should eliminate DEI programs because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills, and experience. Three of the four groups selected Statement B — all by double-digit margins. But college-educated white women sided with Statement A by nearly 40 points. What this all means is that white college-educated women have become not just a core Democratic constituency but also a force that has helped to propel the party to the left and magnify its emphasis on cultural issues. Meanwhile, white men without college degrees have become just as much a core Republican constituency, pushing the party toward cultural positioning and political priorities (like Trump’s tariffs) it had previously shied away from embracing. It also raises the question of whether these are mutually reinforcing trends — that a GOP fueled by blue-collar men will simply turn off more and more white-collar women, just as a Democratic Party fueled by white collar women will continue to lose more ground among blue-collar men.","summary":"College-educated white women and white men without college degrees have come to exist in polar opposite political and cultural universes, each one unrelatable and probably unrecognizable to the other.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/steve-kornacki-white-men-white-women-gap-gender-gap-rcna196791","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250222-trump-noble-prize-wm-1224a-1edcd9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 21:08:36","author":"Steve Kornacki","authors":["Steve Kornacki"],"language":"en","source_country":"na","sentiment":0.027},{"id":301613244,"title":"Trump Says He Was a 'Bit Sarcastic' When He Promised to End Ukraine War Within 24 Hours of Taking Office","text":"Ahead of President Donald Trump’s scheduled call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, he admitted to not being entirely truthful in his repeated campaign promises to have the Russia-Ukraine conflict solved in 24 hours of taking office.\n\n “Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that,” Trump said in a clip from his upcoming Full Measure interview, which airs Sunday. “What I really mean is I’d like to get it settled and I’ll... I think I’ll be successful.”\n\n Prior to taking office for his second term in January 2025, Trump made multiple claims that he could easily resolve the conflict, which officially began when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\n In a May 2023 town hall, he boasted that he could have the conflict solved in “one day” if he was re-elected. \n\n \"I'll meet with Putin, I'll meet with Zelenskyy, they both have weaknesses and they both have strengths, and within 24 hours, that war would be settled,\" he said at the time.\n\n He had made similar remarks in a March 2023 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, saying he would \"have it solved in 24 hours with Zelenskyy and with Putin.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n Then, in his only presidential debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in September 2024, Trump boasted that the Russian occupation of Ukraine was \"a war that’s dying to be settled.\"\n\n \"I will get it settled before I even become president,” he said. \"If I win, when I’m president-elect... what I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together.”\n\n Despite his remarks about brokering peace, Trump has often expressed his admiration for Putin – who was elected to his fifth term as president of Russia in March 2024.\n\n In fact, just before Russia's official invasion of Ukraine, Trump praised Putin's actions in the country as \"genius,\" while also maintaining that they wouldn't have happened on his watch.\n\n \"By the way, this never would have happened with us,\" he told conservative radio hosts Clay & Buckin February 2022. \"Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened.\"\n\n \"But here’s a guy that says, you know, 'I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,' he used the word 'independent,' 'and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say that’s pretty savvy,\" Trump added.\n\n Trump’s latest dialogue with Putin comes just a few weeks after his disastrous Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n Zelenskyy met with Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance on Feb. 28, with the intent to finalize a natural resources agreement between the two countries and discuss the next steps towards a peace deal with Russia.\n\n However, the meeting turned hostile when Zelenskyy expressed doubt in front of American reporters that Putin could be trusted to honor a peace agreement. Trump and Vance began shouting at Zelenskyy, calling him \"disrespectful\" and suggesting that he was ungrateful for the United States' involvement in negotiations.\n\n Trump then abruptly called off the meeting, sending the Ukranian delegation home. Zelenskyy cancelled the rest of his Washington, D.C. schedule and flew to meet with European leaders – many of whom immediately made public statements sharing their continued support of Ukraine.\n\n Days later, after Zelenskyy commented that he end to Ukraine's war with Russia is still \"very, very far away,\" Trump temporarily suspended all military aid to Ukraine. He also took to Truth Social to blast the foreign president’s latest comments.\n\n \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Trump began, citing an article by The Associated Press, an outlet he banned from White House events about two weeks prior.\n\n \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S.,\" he continued. \"Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia.

Campaign finance reports revealed Democracy PAC II, primarily funded by Soros, gave $2.5 million to Senate Majority PAC in 2024, Fox News confirmed. Democracy PAC II gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a combined $6 million, records show. SUNNY HOSTIN SCOLDS SCHUMER THAT HE 'CAVED' ON SHUTDOWN FIGHT A 2023 Fox News Digital review of Alex's Instagram found dozens of pictures with top Democrats in the House and the Senate between 2018 and 2022, including at least nine meetings with Schumer. SOROS, OTHER LEFT-WING BILLIONAIRES POUR TENS OF MILLIONS INTO SCHUMER PAC IN BID FOR DEMS TO HOLD THE SENATE \"Good to see majority leader [Schumer] earlier this week! Energized to elect at least two more Democratic senators so we can secure voting rights and a woman's right to chose!\" Soros posted on his Instagram in July 2022 along with a picture of the pair. In a December 2021 Instagram post, Alex called Schumer his \"good friend\" and said he had a \"great meeting\" with him at the Capitol. A few months earlier, Alex took a selfie with Schumer wearing a bicycle helmet and said it was \"good to see our senate majority leader [Schumer] the other day, biking and in good shape, and so focused on [voting rights] legislation.\" A Fox News Digital review of visitor logs found Alex visited the White House six times from October 2021 to December 2022, during former President Joe Biden's administration. A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital that two of the visits were with Ron Klain, Biden's chief of staff. Alex's social media presence has consistently showcased his relationship with leading Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and candidates from the most contested down-ballot races of 2024, such as Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. Biden awarded George Soros with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January, which Alex accepted in his honor. \"His inspiring generosity reminds us all of our capacity and our obligation to stand up to the abuse of power and to be guardians of democracy and all people yearning to be free,\" Biden said during the ceremony. GEORGE SOROS' SON BECOMES KINGMAKER WITH TOP DEMS AS HE MAKES MULTIPLE BIDEN WH VISITS, MEETS WITH LAWMAKERS \"A travesty that Biden is giving Soros the Medal of Freedom,\" Elon Musk, who has been at the center of Democrats' accusations of rising oligarchy, posted on X in response to Soros accepting the nation’s highest civilian honor. MoveOn.org, a group that has accepted millions from Soros and his Open Society Policy Center in recent years, led the \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative that shut down town halls and Republican offices across the country. National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), a national organization on the forefront of the pro-Palestine Columbia University protests, accepted fiscal sponsorship from the Westchester Peace Action Committee Foundation (WESPAC). Fox News Digital reported last year that WESPAC received a six-figure donation from a nonprofit funded by Soros' network. The Democratic Party also leaned on wealthy surrogates on the campaign trail in 2024. Former Vice President Kamala Harris hosted events with celebrities, including Beyoncé, Eminem, Bruce Springsteen and Mark Cuban. FEC filings show the Harris campaign made two $500,000 payments to Oprah Winfrey’s production company on Oct. 15, a month after Winfrey appeared with Harris at a town hall event and weeks before Oprah was on stage with Harris at a Philadelphia rally before election day. '$1 BILLION DISASTER': HERE'S WHAT FEC FILINGS SHOW ABOUT HARRIS CAMPAIGN'S 3-MONTH SPENDING SPREE Despite the Democrats' own recorded ties to billionaire donors, the term \"oligarchy\" has been used by Democrats to describe President Donald Trump's second term. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has drawn thousands of supporters to his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rallies across the country, with stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this past weekend. The events are billed as an opportunity to \"discuss how we take on the greed of the billionaire class and create a government that works for all and not just the few.\" Democrats were outraged by Trump inviting billionaires like Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to his inauguration, and Biden used the term \"oligarchy\" in his farewell address to the nation. \"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden told Americans on Jan. 13. Schumer defended his leadership on \"The View\" following his decision to vote for a Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown and subsequently canceling stops on his book tour over \"security concerns.\" \"We are fighting them tooth and nail in every way we can, but you've got to fight them smart and if you led yourself into a shutdown, which, by the way, Musk, DOGE, Vought, they wanted a shutdown. They said they wanted a shutdown, and they thought we'd play into their hands,\" Schumer continued to \"The View\" on Tuesday. Schumer said \"MAGA right-wing Republicans,\" including Musk and Director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Russell Vought, wanted to shut down the government to deliver \"tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\" \"The MAGA right-wing Republicans dream of decimating the government. You know why they do it? They want tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. They want to destroy government, give it all to the wealthy and get rid of any regulations they might have, so I felt an obligation to stop it.\" Schumer said \"a small group of wealthy, greedy\" Republicans are seizing power from the people and mocked Republicans who want to protect their hard-earned money from increased taxes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Republican Party is a different kettle of fish than it used to be, and that's why we're fighting them so hard. They are controlled by a small group of wealthy, greedy people. You know what their attitude is? ‘I made my money all by myself. How dare your government take my money from me? I don't want to pay taxes. I built my company with my own bare hands. How dare your government tell me how I should treat my customers, the land and water that I own, or my employees?' They hate government. Government is a barrier to people, a barrier to stop them from doing things. They want to destroy it. We are not letting them do it. And we are united,\" Schumer said. Schumer's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the hosts of &quot;The View&quot; on Tuesday morning that &quot;oligarchs&quot; running the United States keep him up at night, despite his ties to the billionaire Soros family.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schumer-says-oligarchs-keep-him-up-night-despite-his-own-billionaire-ties","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/musk-schumer.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 20:49:42","author":"Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.437},{"id":301595560,"title":"Maybe Democrats should try listening to men","text":"Among his most shocking findings is not only did Trump win a majority of all male 18-year-olds in 2024, but he also won a majority of nonwhite 18-year-olds. “That has never happened in Democratic politics,” Shor told Vox.\n\nShor does not offer a strong explanation for this, other than to downplay anything the Democratic Party may have done to make it happen since this is a global phenomenon that Shor seems to believe is much to blame on cellphones and “gender-segregated” online communities.\n\nBut while both of those factors do play a role, I wonder how much it helps Democrats among young men when Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) issues a statement like the one she did last week that called on male senators to “Listen to the women, For The People.”\n\nOr when former first lady Michelle Obama issues a major stump speech for then-Vice President Kamala Harris telling women that “we have every right to demand that the men in our lives do better by us.” \n\n“We have to use our voices to make these choices clear to the men,” Obama said, “that we love — our lives are worth more than their anger and disappointment.”\n\nDo Democrats even realize how dismissive and patronizing this sounds?\n\nI understand that a woman has not been elected president and that women are underrepresented among CEOs, but collectively, women are doing much better than men these days.\n\nWomen make up 60% of college students and 66% of college graduates. Women are far less likely to be the victim of a violent crime or to go to jail. Women are far less likely to die on the job and are far less likely to commit suicide. \n\nYes, there are fabulously wealthy and powerful men, but most men are neither. The entire ethos of the modern Democratic Party is that all men are part of an evil patriarchy that has been keeping women down for centuries and that, at most, men can be silent allies who should “listen to the women” when decisions are to be made, according to Pelosi. And then Obama comes along and tells them “their anger and disappointment” are worthless in the face of the pain women are supposedly suffering. On their absolute best day, all Democrats have to offer young men are the hollow pursuits of pornography, gambling, and video games. \n\nThe real mystery is why young men haven’t abandoned the Democratic Party completely.\n\nFortunately, there is one institution that still brings men and women together: marriage. \n\nAccording to survey data from Echelon Insights, while there is a substantial partisan gap between young single men and women (D+28), the gap between young married men and women is zero.\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, married men and married women between the ages of 18 and 34 favor Republicans by 8 points.\n\nMaybe if Democrats embraced a positive vision for young men, one that helped them become husbands who provide and protect for their wives and children, young men wouldn’t be deserting the party in droves.","summary":"The Democratic Party is still trying to process why it lost the 2024 presidential election.

He added, \"I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"\n\nThe donor was one of the over 20 donors that ABC News spoke with from Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who supported Harris as a junior senator, during the most crowded Democratic presidential race in history, and remained unified during her 2024 bid.\n\nThe support Harris spent years cultivating faces deep fissures.\n\nAnother donor, Areva Martin, who has known Harris since college, said Harris has a history of quieting the doubters.\n\n\"She's proven she has staying power. When people think she can't recover she's proven her ability to do so,\" Martin told ABC News.\n\nOthers were noncommittal, feeling it was too early to consider anyone running for president.\n\n\"I don't know if I would get involved at this point even if God were running. ... I think it's going to be tough for any Democrat to raise any money. There is little enthusiasm,\" Democratic fundraiser Michael Kempner told ABC News.\n\nCase for Harris running for governor\n\nNearly every member of Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who spoke with ABC News backed her for a gubernatorial run.\n\nHarris' aides previously told ABC News she will make a decision by the end of summer. Some supporters see a successful Harris bid for governor in 2026 as a dealbreaker to run for president in 2028, because of the short window between a gubernatorial inauguration and a potential presidential launch.\n\nBakari Sellers, former co-chair of Harris' 2020 campaign, said, \"If she wants to run for governor, I don't think the Katie Porter's of the world are formidable. I think if she wants to run for president, she has to ask: is the country ready for her? I don't know the answer to that. … a lot of things are going to change in the next three and a half years.\"\n\nOthers avoided commenting about a potential 2028 run, citing timing, but expressed confidence in a Harris gubernatorial run.\n\n\"My opinion and my dedication to her hasn't changed one iota. I believe she's one of the most talented, brilliant, kind, empathic people that I have met in all my time in politics,\" lawyer Judith Barnett told ABC News.\n\nThe lifetime Democratic donor who said she has known Harris for nearly a decade added, \"I would think running for governor, running the 5th largest economy in the world, would be a good move. It's not my decision … it's all hers. But I think it's a wonderful step,\" Barnett said.\n\nAsif Mahmood, who led Asian outreach for Harris' 2019 campaign, said Harris could follow in another Californian's footsteps.\n\n\"Reagan ran for president. He lost, came back to California, served his state as governor, went back and ran for president and won twice,\" said Mahmood, who was also Hillary Clinton's deputy national finance chair.\n\nMultiple donors pointed out that if Harris were to win a gubernatorial race, she'd make history. She'd be the first Asian American woman and the first Black woman to be governor of any state.\n\nOnly one donor who spoke with ABC News said he was not enthusiastic about supporting Harris for governor.\n\n\"If she even thinks of running for president, it will be very bad. If she even puts feelers out it will be embarrassing,\" he said, adding, he would need to be convinced to write big checks for her for any race.\n\nHe claimed donors struggled after Harris' presidential loss to get answers from staffers, \"I don't want to deal with her campaign apparatus.\"\n\nDemocrats vs Democrats\n\nSome donors who spoke with ABC News believe the lack of consensus over Harris says more about Democrats than it does about her.\n\n\"The Democratic party is well known for killing their losers and finding someone else,\" said one donor.\n\n\"I think losing to Donald Trump is the cardinal sin of the Democratic party. The left and people that supported her don't appear to be trying to articulate that this loss was narrow and her ideas were popular,\" said one loyalist.\n\n\"It's tough for anyone to come back from a loss and run again. Trump is, of course, an exception. In my opinion, I don't think she would get significant support as a presidential nominee.\" Dr. Manan Trivedi, a donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, told ABC News.\n\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Trump were all presidential nominees who lost before winning a general election. Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat to accomplish the feat.\n\nSome donors were skeptical of Harris joining that list.\n\n\"If Kamala wanted to be president of the United States, she needed to position herself as the leader of the resistance. Not only has she not done that but no other leader has pushed themselves forward,\" said one donor.\n\nMontgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija met Harris during her 2010 attorney general run and said he believes Democrats have time to better position themselves for a successful presidential run.\n\n\"I think she has the luxury of not having to dive into the political fray during this time. By focusing on the human impact of what this administration is doing. It could draw on her strength as an empathetic leader. It could make a difference in these interim years,\" Makhija told ABC News.\n\nAnother donor said Democrats need to be strategic.\n\n\"I want to win. I am not supporting a woman, a Black person, or a gay person. I am supporting the non-threatening white dude. Even if a woman were the best candidate, I would have a hard time until it became really clear that there is a real pathway,\" said one female donor.\n\nDemocratic bundler Alex Heckler said he has remained a big fan of Harris' but fears Democrats are playing a defensive game.\n\nWhile he says he's happy with the new party chair, he says, \"Democrats over-correct. Three white men led the votes for party chair - it's ridiculous. We can't help ourselves. I struggle being a Democrat these days.\"\n\n\"Democrats are reactionary - they think two women lost - we can't put a woman up again,\" Heckler said.\n\nActivist Tina Duryea said she's also frustrated with the party.\n\n\"She [Harris] could run on: 'look how miserable everything is now you could have had me' that could be a very powerful message. I don't have a lot of tolerance for people living in fear. Democrats overthink things,\" Duryea told ABC News. She said she's \"100% behind\" any decision Harris makes.\n\nRapidly changing political landscape\n\nLike any voter, donors change their minds about politics. Multiple did during the course of this reporting.\n\nTwo weeks ago, one prominent donor said, \"I don't think she has it in her,\" adding he believed the next democratic nominee \"will be one of the governors.\"\n\nBut the donor changed his mind after Harris' recent appearances. \"Putting your heart and soul into an election is devastating. Watching her [Harris] over the last few weeks, she seems to be getting her legs back. She's been out there speaking,\" the donor said.\n\nHe added, \"If the world is falling apart economically and geopolitically and she gets a head start on fundraising, with her name recognition and leadership, she could easily become the frontrunner and win.\"\n\nOthers acknowledged their positions could change.\n\nCalifornia donor Mark Buell said he is watching how California's gubernatorial and the presidential races unfold before he publicly endorses anyone.\n\n\"I've learned my lesson, you have to wait to be able to see the full landscape. …We have many issues in this country. If I have to hold my nose to vote for a Democratic who I don't like but think would win - I would. It's not who my favorite is or who I love.\"\n\nAnother donor cited a possible fundamental change in American democracy, led by Trump's actions.\n\n\"I am very reluctant to back a horse. Because I'm not even sure we're horse racing anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"Are we going to have an election in 2028? When he [Trump] jokes about it, I don't know if he's joking. But I think she would be great.

Gavin Newsom got into a spirited conversation Tuesday with Minnesota Gov. (and Kamala Harris’ chosen Vice Presidential candidate) Tim Walz on the latest episode of his podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom.”\n\nDuring their chat, Newsom shared his opinion about how Democrats should combat the growing popularity of the Right in America.\n\n“The bottom line is … we cannot continue to be on the defense,” he said. “We’ve got to go on the offense. We’ve got to meet people where they are. But I also think, and this is part of the conversation I’m trying to have, is you’ve got to respect people you disagree with and you can’t just dismiss people.”\n\nNewsom’s comments come less than a week after CNN released a poll that revealed the Democratic Party currently holds an all-time low 29% favorability score among American voters. At the start of the 2-minute podcast clip that Newsom shared on his X account, Walz pointedly asked if Republicans have simply deduced “that the identity piece of this is more important than the actual substance behind it?”\n\n“They’ve been doing it for decades,” Newsom responded, citing well-known right-wing political messaging strategies of the past. “I mean, we saw the welfare queens. They’ve seen the Southern Strategy. We’ve seen it over and over. It’s an old playbook, and we’re as dumb as we want to be that we allow them to do this with CRT [critical race theory] and ESG [environmental, social and governance] and DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion].”\n\n“[They] demonize and they weaponize grievance. They other people. They talk down to people, past people,” he continued. “They humiliate people. They weaponize difficult issues.” You can watch the full clip, below.\n\nWhen Walz confessed that he doesn’t know if the proper response to the Right’s current surge is to challenge his political rivals to a “WWE fight,” Newsom countered, “It’s a natural reaction, and I think it’s one of the reasons we’re losing so many men. And again, it’s multi-ethnic. It’s not just white men. We’re losing them to these guys online. We’re losing them to people that I’m bringing on this podcast as well.”\n\nNewsom’s first wave of podcast episodes have featured interviews with notable right-wing figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, whom Walz didn’t hesitate to label as “bad guys.” The host replied, “But they exist, and we could deny they exist. Not only do they exist, they persist, and they’re actually influencing young kids every single day.”\n\nResponding to Walz’s question about pushing figures like Bannon and Kirk “back under a rock,” Newsom further dove into his opinion on the matter, saying, “I think we have to first understand what their motivations are. I think we have to understand what they’re actually doing.”\n\n“You don’t think it’s racism and misogyny?” Walz asked. “I think there’s a lot of that, but I don’t think it’s exclusively that,” Newsom admitted. “When you talk to a guy like Steve Bannon, he talks about working folks and he talks about how we hollowed out the industrial core of this country.”\n\n“So we can dismiss the notion of election denialism. We could completely dismiss what he did on Jan. 6. But I don’t think you can dismiss what he’s saying,” the politician concluded, adding, “[It] reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying. Reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.”","summary":"\"You've got to respect people you disagree with and you can't just dismiss people,\" the Governor of California tells Minnesota Gov.

With U.S. federal policies, programs, and agencies on the chopping block, policy conversations focus on immediate and visible subjects. Yet, institutional chaos provides an opportunity to reflect on deeper issues that caused the turmoil in the first place. How did we get into this mess and what is a realistic approach to fixing it?\n\nConsider climate policies. In 2024, the Paris Agreement’s aspirational target of limiting the temperature increases to 1.5C was breached, and even the 2.0C goal seems to be slipping away. Instead of redoubling decarbonization efforts, the U.S. and the European Union are rolling back climate laws, Canada is axing the consumer carbon tax, China and India are continuing to build coal plants, and corporations are exiting net zero climate commitments.\n\nSeveral explanations are offered for the sorry state of climate policy. First is the political power of energy-producing and energy-dependent sectors. Historically, the climate movement blamed fossil fuel companies for policy tardiness. It was a story of a decaying industry using politics to delay its demise. Now, climate policy is being tested by a rising industry, artificial intelligence (AI), a technology loved by liberal and conservative governors alike. As a result, U.S. electricity consumption, which was flat for the last 20 years, is on the rise: between 2024 and 2028, electricity demand is expected to grow by about 16%. Ironically, AI’s energy appetite is reviving the fortune of the coal industry as utilities extend the life of coal plants.\n\nSecond, the Ukraine war has propelled energy security and energy inflation to the top of the policy agenda. With rising energy prices, governments are not willing to bear the short-term domestic political costs of decarbonization to corner long-term global benefits. In the recent U.S. Presidential elections, Kamala Harris took credit for the largest increase in oil production in the U.S. history. Oil super-majors are refocusing on oil and gas exploration and production along with divesting from renewable energy, as exemplified by the U-turn by BP on this subject.\n\nThird, climate action is increasingly embroiled in cultural wars. Conservatives label it “woke”. Climate concerns seem to be stronger among the educated elites, Piketty’s Brahmin left. Not surprisingly, in the “science versus populism” conflict, climate policy is a causality.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users—Do Not Use These Websites\n\n‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be Bad\n\nTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company’s ‘Sales Woes’\n\nOn the face of it, technological change, global political turmoil, and cultural wars are derailing climate policy. But we suggest that there is a deeper story here: the climate crisis reflects the confluence of market, government, and individual failures, which tend to reinforce each other.\n\nThe Three Failures Framework\n\nStudents taking an introductory public policy course will learn that when the market fails, the government intervenes to correct it. The assumption is that governments have the capacity and the willingness to do so.\n\nBut are governments always endowed with such qualities? Starting in the 1950s, many complained that governments were captured by business elites. Instead of correcting market failures, regulatory agencies institutionalized them. With the end of the Cold War and the delegitimization of statist models, government failure became the dominant policy concern – ironically to be corrected by introducing market-based policies.\n\nWhat if both markets and governments fail at the same time – perhaps due to the same underlying cause? This is the story of climate policy.\n\nMight these dual failures create space for individual-level action? This would involve individuals confronting the root cause of climate policy failure — overconsumption and the addiction to carbon-intensive lifestyles.\n\nThe effectiveness of individual action faces several hurdles. Some believe that individuals are unlikely to bring about systemic changes required for decarbonization. Moreover, an emphasis on individual action could allow big corporations to absolve themselves of the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions; scholars call it soft climate denial.\n\nThe core debates on individual action have political, philosophical, sociological, and psychological dimensions. Could individuals bring about systemic changes? Would individuals be willing to try to do so, while recognizing that such actions will impose costs on them?\n\nWe suggest that individual action can lead to climate progress. Moreover, it is a practical response to the current crisis, although not a perfect one. The challenge is to persuade individuals to start believing in their agency and motivate them to incur the costs of exercising it.\n\nThe Role of Individual Action\n\nClimate change is a reflection of our addiction to fossil fuel-dependent lifestyles. Our climate impact goes beyond flying in planes, driving cars, and eating meat. For example, many like updating their wardrobes every season, not recognizing that fast fashion contributes to about 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe implication is that individuals need to examine their consumption choices while recognizing that some choices are more malleable (Dietz et al. call it the behavioral wedge) while others are not.\n\nIn addition to reducing their carbon footprint, individuals can influence climate politics (and correct market and government failures) through peaceful and legal boycotts and buycotts. This is voting with dollars.\n\nTake the case of Tesla. Unhappiness with Elon Musk’s politics has led individuals to participate in the “boycott Tesla” movement. Compared to last February, Tesla’s monthly sales are down by 76% in Germany, 26% in France, 48% in Denmark, and 42% in Sweden. Since President Trump’s inauguration, Tesla’s share price has declined by about 33% and its market capitalization by $386 billion.\n\nThe bottom line is that government and market climate failures are unlikely to self-correct in the short term. At a deeper level, both reflect our addiction to a carbon intensive lifestyle. This also means that as consumers, individuals could have an impact on climate progress, but this requires rethinking our mundane, daily choices as well as the more dramatic ones such as buying a car.\n\nConsumption switches and behavioral changes will impose costs and disrupt our lifestyles. And we may not be able to detect an immediate impact on say national-level climate policy. But the hope is that carbon-frugal lifestyles will become a community norm, as opposed to a performative statement.\n\nEventually, new consumption choices could have a substantive impact on both governments and firms. The reason is that companies spend billions of dollars to understand our preferences based on our Google searches and social media activities. We should deploy this leverage with companies – tell them exactly what we think and what we want. We have leverage over elected officials as well, a critical issue because the planning for the 2026 U.S. Congressional elections is already underway. We can participate in townhalls, join peaceful protests, and make our voices heard.\n\nAs climate concerned individuals, we have a choice to make. Are we ready to take on the challenge of confronting our own overconsumption? Or, would we continue to blame firms and governments for the climate crisis, justify our inaction, and reinforce market and government failures?\n\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Climate crisis reflects market, government, and individual failures, which tend to reinforce each other.

However, his ex-wife, California psychiatrist Karla Jurvetson, 58, doled out more than $500,000 to Indivisible Action, a political action group linked to a non-profit directing the protests against Musk, according to public records.\n\nIndivisible, a Washington-based advocacy group, is sponsoring “Musk or Us” demonstrations across the country this week. The group proves a “toolkit” on their website featuring graphics and anti-Tesla protest signs as well as information about how to conduct town halls.\n\nTheir website states: “Support the massive organizing effort it’s going to take to defend our democracy and one another against Trump’s authoritarian agenda.”\n\nThe group stands against Musk and protest against his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative to streamline the federal bureaucracy.\n\n“Republicans are enabling Musk to make decisions and push policies that directly hurt working families while enriching billionaires like himself,” the group said on its website.\n\n“We cannot allow Republicans to abandon their responsibility to uphold our constitution and serve their constituents in order to curry favor with Musk.”\n\nSome protestors have vandalized Tesla vehicles and showrooms across the country, with fires set and showrooms spray painted.\n\nKarla Jurvetson is known in Northern California as something of a Democratic mega-donor. In addition to Indivisible she gave more than $9.5 million to Democratic progressive candidates, including former New York Congressman Jamaal Bowman, who lost his re-election bid last year, and Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar.

This is the last I will say on this subject for the foreseeable future.” Jurvetson remarried at the end of 2018, the same year he founded his new firm, Future Ventures.\n\nAlthough both Jurvetsons supported the Democratic Party, Karla Jurvetson emerged as one of the most prolific donors to Democratic women in politics during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nShe donated nearly $15 million to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, and in 2018 she doled out $30 million to the Emily’s List PAC, which supports pro-abortion candidates.\n\nSteve Jurvetson has his own left-leaning charity alongside his new wife, The Jurvetson foundation.\n\nHe also continues to support Musk.\n\n“The best investment I ever made — buying a Tesla for everyone in my family and at Future Ventures,” Jurvetson posted on X last week.\n\n “Too precious to trust to anything but the safest car… especially for my co-founder who finally abandoned her motorcycle!”\n\nJurvetson has held important roles with Musk, helping to bail the billionaire out in 2008 when he was running out of cash to support Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n“He’s really an American hero, more than anyone I’ve ever met,” Steve Jurvetson told Business Insider in 2012. “I was a believer all along.”\n\nNeither Karla nor Steve Jurvetson returned The Post’s calls for comment.","summary":"Karla Jurvetson, a Democratic mega donor and ex-wife of an Elon Musk confidant and investor, gave more than $500,000 to group organizing anti-Tesla demonstrations","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/18/us-news/ex-wife-of-tesla-spacex-investor-fueling-anti-elon-musk-protests/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-o1x37j27c-1742318333279.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1742303984&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/p7sxjPxd-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-18 17:26:24","author":"Isabel Vincent","authors":["Isabel Vincent"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.072},{"id":301562130,"title":"Daughter of NASA stranded astronaut Butch Wilmore reveals first thing she's going to do when her dad gets home","text":"EXCLUSIVEDaughter of NASA stranded astronaut Butch Wilmore reveals first thing she's going to do when her dad gets home\n\n READ MORE: Stranded NASA astronauts return home: Live updates\n\nBy STACY LIBERATORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 17:13 GMT, 18 March 2025 | Updated: 17:22 GMT, 18 March 2025\n\nThe teen daughter of stranded NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore has revealed the first thing she plans to do when he returns to Earth on Tuesday.\n\nDaryn, 19, told DailyMail.com that not only is she giving her dad 'a big ole hug,' but they are going to eat a pecan pie she baked, saying: 'It's his favorite dessert.' \n\nWillmore and Sunita Williams are currently traveling back to Earth after leaving the International Space Station (ISS) where they were stuck for more than nine months.\n\nThey are set to splash down in the Atlantic off the coast of Florida at roughly 5:57pm ET today.\n\nWilmore's wife, Deanna, and his two daughters, Daryn and Logan, live in Houston, Texas, where they have been patiently awaiting his return since June of last year.\n\n'I’m truly elated and thankful that he’s coming back today, Daryn said.\n\n'The Lord has blessed us in this time, and we know he’s in control of it.'\n\nShe also revealed that she, her mother and sister will be reunited with Wilmore 'a few hours after' he emerges from the capsule. \n\nButch Wilmore's daughter, Daryn (left), told DailyMail.com that she baked a pecan pie for her dad to eat as soon as he gets home\n\nWilmore left behind his wife Deanna (left) and two daughters Daryin (center left) and Logan (center right) when he launched into space on June 5. Pictured: the Wilmore family attend the New York premier of 'A Beautiful Planet' in New York City in August, 2016. \n\nDaryn previously said that her father being away has 'been hard,' noting that it was 'less the fact that he's up there' and 'more the fact of why.' \n\n'There's a lot of politics, there's a lot of things that I'm not at liberty to say, and that I don't know fully about,' she said in a TikTok video last month.\n\nThe video came just weeks before Elon Musk said said the Biden administration left them in space for 'political reasons.'\n\nDuring a February appearance the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk claimed he offered to bring the pair home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would have made Trump 'look good' in the presidential race against Kamala Harris.\n\nDaryn did not provide details about specific politics in her video, but said: 'There's been issues. There's been negligence. \n\n'And that's the reason why this has just kept getting delayed. There's just been issue after issue after issue.'\n\nBut now her father and Williams are on their way home, following their over nine-month stay that was originally scheduled for just eights days. \n\nThe pair, along with NASA's Nick Hague and Russia 's Aleksandr Gorbunov, are in the middle of the 17-hour descent back to Earth.\n\n'Crew nine is going home,' Hague, the commander of departing Crew Dragon, said from the spacecraft moments after they began their journey on Monday.\n\nWilmore (left) and Williams (right) along with NASA's Nick Hague (second right) and Russia 's Aleksandr Gorbunov (second left), are in the middle of the 17-hour descent back to Earth.\n\n'On behalf of crew nine, it was a privilege to call space home... to live and work... in cooperation for the benefit of humanity. \n\n'To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station, we know the station is in great hands. We're excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish and we'll be waiting for ya [sic].'\n\nDaryn said in February that her father 'has been bummed but he's chillen' amid his delayed return.\n\n'I talk to my dad all the time,' she said, adding that she calls him every day or every couple of days. 'That makes things really nice.'\n\nStranded NASA astronauts' 'secret' message to the public, revealed by body language expert JUDI JAMES\n\nDaryn added that she misses her dad 'so much' and is looking forward to him seeing her take the stage in an upcoming theater performance and see Logan graduate high school this spring. \n\n While stuck in space, Wilmore also missed most of his 16-year-old daughter Logan's senior year of high school and Daryn's college theater performances.\n\nLogan has been open about missing her dad as well.\n\nIn a video posted in August, she shared a clip of her father getting ready to board Starliner followed by another of her hugging him, with the caption: 'Not dead, just stuck in space. I'm not worried at all, just miss him!'\n\nAnother video in October served as a heartwarming tribute to her dad, featuring a slideshow of photos of the two of them together.\n\nBut the sisters have been able to keep in touch with their dad through regular video calls.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDaughter of NASA stranded astronaut Butch Wilmore reveals first thing she's going to do when her dad gets home\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The teen daughter of NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore told DailyMail.com the first thing she plans on doing when her father returns home Tuesday, following his over nine-month mission in space.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14511861/nasa-astronaut-butch-wilmore-daughter-reveals-dad-gets-home.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/18/16/96318577-0-image-m-16_1742316303317.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/18/1199322265367787346/1024x576_MP4_1199322265367787346.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-18 17:22:09","author":"Editor,Stacy Liberatore","authors":["Editor","Stacy Liberatore"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":301553106,"title":"Even James Carville is giving up on Democrats: ‘Beat a Republican, and then I will have respect for you’","text":"Former senior Bill Clinton adviser James Carville appeared on NewsNation on Monday night, seemingly giving up on the current iteration of the Democratic Party after some senators buckled and voted with Republicans to avoid a government shutdown. \n\nCarville said political parties “exist for one reason, and that is to win elections.”\n\n“When they lose elections, people lose faith in them,” said the strategist. \n\n“The Democratic Party should be about … We’re the party for the people that are trying to make it, and (they’re) the party for the people that have it made,” he added. “When you have that dichotomy, everything flows from that.”\n\nThe strategist slammed the “identity left” wing party, arguing that their way of doing things has led to Democratic losses, and he challenged his progressive critics to prove that they can win elections before arguing that they’re the future of the party. \n\n“I would give anything if one of these people ever beat a Republican,” said Carville, 80. “When anybody on the identity left, or anybody that’s coming in with all of these grand [ideas] — do me a favor — beat a Republican, and then I will have respect for you.”\n\nHe went on to argue that the image of the Democratic Party would get better following some election wins, such as in Wisconsin and Virginia, before arguing that the party has to turn into “an effective and smart opposition party, not a bunch of hoo-ha screaming and yelling.”\n\nCarville’s comments come as Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has faced calls to step down after he voted to support a Republican spending bill that cut back on a number of non-defense programs. \n\nBut Schumer has remained defiant in the face of an avalanche of criticism for advancing the bill drafted by the House Republicans. Several senators have complained that while Schumer isn’t going anywhere, there hasn’t been a clear direction for the party. \n\nSchumer, meanwhile, told The New York Times that the party has “a real direction now.”\n\n“I don’t think we have an authenticity problem,” the Senate Democratic leader told the paper amid polling suggesting most Americans have an unfavorable view of the party. \n\n“We have a real direction now. I feel good about it,” he added. \n\n“First, you gotta look at who the Democratic Party is and who the Republican Party is,” said the 74-year-old. “We are the party of working people. We feel that very, very strongly. That’s who we have always been.”\n\nConnecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy appeared on Meet the Press on NBC on Sunday, saying that Schumer “can lead the caucus” but that “we need to have a conversation inside the caucus about whether we are willing to stand up to Republicans.”\n\nDemocrats face the risk of becoming “irrelevant if we don’t use our power on cloture to demand that we have a seat at the table,” he told The Hill. \n\n“We obviously have to make sure that we aren’t cut out of negotiations in the future,” he added. \n\nAs the Senate Democrats continue to soul-search, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, argued on MSNBC on Sunday that the House Democrats will win back the majority in the 2026 midterms. \n\n“We have 13 Democrats who won in districts that President Trump also won in,” said DelBene regarding the election in November. “So, we were strong; we will continue to be strong. Another big reason why we’ll take back the majority in 2026.”\n\nThree Republicans clinched seats also won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nA recent NBC News poll found that only 27 percent of voters say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party — the lowest rating since the start of NBC polling in 1990.","summary":"Strategist says Democrats have to become ‘an effective and smart opposition party, not a bunch of hoo-ha screaming and yelling’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/james-carville-democrats-republicans-trump-b2717265.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/18/14/29/GettyImages-2183198137-(1).jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JzecNbK0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-18 16:24:10","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":301535136,"title":"Fox News Digital crushes CNN, NY Times in key metrics during February to finish as top news brand","text":"Fox News Digital continued to dominate CNN and other news brands in key metrics during the month of February, finishing as the No. 1 news brand in multiplatform views, minutes and on YouTube.

Senator Bernie Sanders seems to think so. He is leading a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour that has drawn thousands of people in several Midwestern cities. Railing against the influence of the wealthy is not new for Sanders, but he has found new targets in the coterie of wealthy individuals surrounding Donald Trump and especially Elon Musk.\n\nTracking public attitudes on the gap between rich and poor has interested pollsters since they began asking Americans about Senator Huey Long’s “Share the Wealth” campaign in 1934. Since 1966, the Harris Poll has asked people if they feel “the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.” For decades, agreement has been in the 60% to 70% range. Around 60% in Gallup’s 40-year trend agree that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed, although in scattered Gallup polls, it has not been a high priority for Congress or administrations. On and off since 1973, the National Opinion Research Center’s General Social Survey has asked whether government should reduce income differences between the rich and the poor or whether government should not concern itself with this. A strong plurality has consistently planted themselves in the middle on NORC’s 7-point scale.\n\nSeveral pollsters have recently added to our collection of polls on inequality. In a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, 51% said the gap between the rich and poor was a very big problem in the US and another 32% a moderately big one. When asked about what might lead to inequality, 89% said that rich people with too much influence contributed a great deal or fair amount, followed by 86% who said that about problems with our education system, and 74% because some people are born with more opportunity. Two-thirds (66%) said that some people working harder than others contributes a great deal or a fair amount and 62% said racial or ethnic discrimination did.\n\nA 2025 Ipsos/Reuters poll release looked at the issue and suggested that inequality was a significant issue in the 2024 campaign. I’m skeptical. Six percent of registered voters in their October 2024 poll indicated that the gap between wealthy and average Americans was their most important issue, “the only issue I really care about” in the question’s wording, and another 43% said it was very important. In the poll, Kamala Harris led Donald Trump by 7 points among registered voters on having the best approach to the gap. More registered voters (70%) said the economy was their only issue (11%) or a very important one (59%), and Trump led her by 7 points on having the best approach to it. In almost all the polls I saw in 2024, inflation, the economy, or immigration were the public’s top concerns.\n\nIn a new 2025 Reuters/Ipsos question that did not include inflation or the economy as areas President Trump should focus on in his first 100 days, immigration ranked first at 27%. Half as many mentioned inequality (14%).\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users—Do Not Use These Websites\n\n‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be Bad\n\nTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company’s ‘Sales Woes’\n\nInequality isn’t back as a political issue. It never left the stage. It’s not top of mind or a high priority for most Americans because it’s complicated. Americans don’t resent the rich, but most don’t admire them a lot either. They have long felt the wealthy have too much influence on government and the White House. Two-thirds in a recent Economist/YouGov survey believe Musk has a lot of influence on this administration. In another question, 44% wanted him to have no influence, 27% a little, and 17% a lot. In the new NBC News poll, 39% of registered voters had a positive feeling about him and 51% negative.\n\nAmericans don’t believe the rich pay their fair share of taxes, and they are content to tax them. While they agree the wealth gap is a problem, they are skeptical about government efforts to address it. In four Bloomberg questions from the past decade that asked if it was better for the government to implement policies to shrink the gap or better for government to stand aside and let the market operate freely even if the gap gets wider, people split evenly.\n\nWe’ll hear a lot more about inequality during Sanders’ tour and the debate to extend Trump’s tax cuts. Throughout the campaign, Trump led Harris as better able to handle taxes, and his sweeteners (such as no tax on tips or Social Security benefits) may dilute Democrats’ traditional lead on tax fairness. It is striking, however, how little our complicated views on inequality have changed over the last half century.\n\n Check out my website.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Is inequality back as a political issue?

Let's do a whip around the world, because things are moving fast and seemingly all at once.The president is scheduled to speak with Putin today—a significant milestone in what is hopefully the beginning of the end in the Ukraine war. Trump, impolitic as ever, said discussions are now focused on \"dividing up certain assets\"... which means the parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian troops. Yesterday there were reports that the White House is considering formally recognizing Crimea as part of Russia in a bid to end the war. I would not be surprised if this ends up being part of the deal. Putin took Crimea exactly 11 years ago this week, while Obama looked on and did nothing.I believe strongly that Trump's relationship to Obama is far more important to understanding how he thinks than most people realize, and can often explain better than anything how and why Trump does what he does. Remember, Trump kicked off his political career by claiming Obama wasn't born here, and reportedly decided to run for president only after Obama humiliated him to his face at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011. Now that Trump will be an era-defining, two-term POTUS like Obama, what is the one thing Obama has that Trump doesn't? A Nobel Peace Prize. If Trump can acquire one of those by putting an end to the war in Ukraine, while giving Putin what Obama let him take, that's a pretty potent narrative if you're one Donald J. Trump.The president's goal of being a global peacemaker, however, is facing new tests in the Middle East. If there's one thing certain in politics, it's that no matter who the U.S. president is or what they want to do with their presidency, the Mideast will be ready to drag them into a quagmire no matter what. Israel appears to have broken the ceasefire in Gaza overnight, launching new strikes on Hamas targets in the Strip. This after Trump launched airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen over the weekend, taking a much more aggressive position against that Iran-backed group which has been disrupting global shipping routes in the Red Sea for more than a year.If you're trying to understand the \"Trump Doctrine\" of geopolitics, my generous read is that it is essentially this: hardcore realpolitik. Wrap up these wars (Ukraine, Gaza) that arguably do not present a strategic interest for the U.S., get Europe to do more for its own defense and free up resources to reorient ourselves against the only other superpower that actually threatens our way of life (China), while cultivating stronger relationships with leaders closer to home, even the more unsavory ones in Latin America, who can help us with domestic issues like migration and drug trafficking. I say this is a generous reading because it does not take into account the antagonizing of our allies, which seems to be a big part of the strategy in practice.But if Trump quit bullying our friends in Canada, Mexico and Europe and just played out the above, I believe (contra to most people, I know) the Trump Doctrine might actually work.But that's a big if.Trump's USAID Cuts Help China and Russia, Former Officials Argue in CourtPresident Donald Trump's decision to put a halt to most foreign-aid funding has caused \"irreparable\" damage to America's standing abroad and strengthened adversaries including China and Russia, former senior Republican and Democratic officials wrote in a new court filing.

Newsom’s podcasts with Trump loyalists anger Democrats","text":"By MICHAEL R. BLOOD | Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — As a wounded Democratic Party struggles to regroup, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is holding mostly chummy conversations with prominent conservatives on a new podcast he’s touting as a way for the party to grapple with the MAGA movement’s popularity.\n\nIn doing so, he appears intent on showing he is more than a progressive warrior. But he has stunned some members of his own party by agreeing with his guests on issues such as restricting transgender women and girls in sports. Newsom called dismantling police departments “lunacy” and remained silent when Steve Bannon, an architect of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, falsely said Trump won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nREALTED: Two Bay Area U.S. representatives express shock over Senate Democrats’ support for GOP budget bill\n\nThe programs provide a fresh lens on a liberal governor and potential 2028 presidential candidate who not long ago was enlisted as a chief surrogate for President Joe Biden’s campaign. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, he chastised national Democrats for being too passive in defending abortion rights and same-sex marriage, an issue he championed two decades ago as mayor of San Francisco.\n\nNewsom said his choice of podcast guests reflects his interest in knowing more about how Republicans organized in the last election, when Trump swept every battleground state and Republicans locked up majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n“I think we all agreed after the last election that it’s important for Democrats to explore new and unique ways of talking to people,” he added in an email to supporters.\n\nNewsom’s party criticizes his guests\n\nAfter spotlighting Bannon, conservative radio personality Michael Savage and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Newsom will quickly diversify his lineup: His next guest is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last year’s Democratic vice presidential nominee. But some Democrats say the governor, who is widely viewed as having presidential ambitions, is selling out Democratic values in favor of his own political aspirations.\n\nAimee Allison, the founder and president of She the People, a national organizing hub for electing women of color, said Newsom is betraying California and “showing his weakness and naked ambition.” Allison was among Democrats who helped Newsom defeat a 2021 recall attempt.\n\n“We need a governor that will defend California’s values, support vulnerable children, LGBTQ+ people, Black people, women, and everyone else who’s in the line (of) fire of the Trump administration. Instead he is making the worst moves possible in a time of rising fascism. He’s trying to remake himself to be acceptable to MAGA,” Allison wrote in an email, referring to supporters of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\nCalifornia Assembly member Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ+ legislative caucus, said they were “profoundly sickened” by Newsom’s statement on transgender athletes. And Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, another potential 2028 candidate, said of Bannon, “I don’t think we should give him oxygen on any platform — ever, anywhere.”\n\nFinding a new audience\n\nPodcasts have become an increasingly important venue in politics, and as Newsom considers a national campaign he has been praised by some for venturing into unfamiliar territory.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, credited Newsom with trying to reach voters who might not engage with traditional media.\n\n“I think there are going to be a lot of people this alienates in the short term,” Burton said. But, he added, Democrats “have to take a lot of big swings.”\n\nThe governor — who called Trump a threat to American democracy throughout last year’s campaign — has been trying to navigate a tenuous relationship with the White House as the state recovers from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January. He’s requested $40 billion in federal aid.\n\nNewsom, while progressive, has never been locked into one ideological position: He’s broken at times with more liberal factions in the Legislature. His shift this time may be to head off the kind of criticism Republicans have aimed at former Vice President Kamala Harris, also of California, or edge toward positions more closely in line with public opinion. According to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters nationwide in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.\n\nDuring the podcast episodes released so far, Newsom has been mostly affable and agreeable, though he’s challenged his guests at times. This is not the tart-tongued Newsom who appeared in a 2023 televised debate with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom he described as weak and pathetic, or who called the state legislature into special session last year to attempt to safeguard the state’s progressive policies under a Trump administration.\n\nIn an age of rigid partisanship, talking with the other side is “so rarely a part of public discourse it seems like either bravery or lunacy,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “While there are clear risks, he is trying to align his national reputation … in a slightly unpredictable middle.”","summary":"As a wounded Democratic Party struggles to regroup, Newsom is holding mostly chummy conversations with prominent conservatives on a new podcast he’s touting as a way for the party to grapple with the MAGA movement’s popularity.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/18/amid-2028-speculation-california-governors-podcasts-with-trump-loyalists-anger-democrats/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/US_California_Governor_Podcast_11059.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 14:38:26","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.065},{"id":301502148,"title":"Bootsy Collins on How ‘Funk Is Making Something Out of Nothing’","text":"t’s impossible to overstate Bootsy Collins’ influence. Since joining James Brown’s band 55 years ago this month, Collins has made sturdy, buoyant bass lines, which stretch out all over the place before returning to the one, the bedrock of funk. The recordings he cut with Brown, Parliament, Funkadelic, and his own group, the Rubber Band, have fueled decades of hip-hop samples, sparked a Nineties disco revival with Deee-Lite and Fatboy Slim, and resonated in the elastic rock of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Machine. Collins’ ingenious playing on Brown’s “Sex Machine,” Parliament’s “Flash Light,” and his own “I’d Rather Be With You” are crucial nucleotides in the double helix of pop, and it secured his place among the Greatest Bassists of All Time.\n\n Although Collins pared back his touring schedule around 2017, he has continued releasing star-studded albums he has recorded in his “Bootcave.” Recent albums have found him collaborating with artists he has inspired, like Snoop Dogg and Chuck D, bass peers like Victor Wooten and Stanley Clarke, and his former bandmates like the late, great Bernie Worrell. His upcoming album, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, due out April 11 — which he’s teased with the title track — even features an as-yet-unreleased collaboration with his P-Funk foil George Clinton. “It’s going to be the bomb,” Collins promises.\n\n In a career-spanning conversation for Rolling Stone’s Last Word column, Collins, 73, reflects on more than half a century’s worth of funk making and how he became “Bootzilla.”\n\n What’s the best part of success?Experimenting. When you are out there with your instrument, being your instrument, and music comes to you freely, it’s like gifts and then you give them away. But getting two or three dollars helps, too.\n\n What about the worst?Once Frankenstein has built that monster, you can’t control it. You want to spend time with your family, but everything moves so fast when you start to succeed, and this monster just comes in and eats everybody up.\n\n That, and the business. James Brown told me one time that it’s 75 percent business, 25 percent music, and I wasn’t trying to hear that, because I’m in love with the music so much. I was sad I had to do that, but at the same time, you have to do it. James said one time, “Man got to eat. If you don’t work, you don’t eat.”\n\n James Brown used to fine musicians who messed up while playing. Was that the right thing to do?I think for him, yeah. I couldn’t fine nobody. But he had such a big band. And us as musicians, we act a fool here and there and might miss a note. It’s rare, but it did happen. Fining made us want to practice more.\n\n James felt the fines would make you work harder. He was using that reverse psychology on us, and we didn’t understand at the time. “Why was he saying we wasn’t happening? Why would he have to fine us?” And so I learned from that experience with him. When we got there, he just stopped fining us.\n\n Also, he realized that taking money from us didn’t matter, ’cause we didn’t have nothing no way. We came in off the streets. We wasn’t used to getting paid. I thought I had to pay you. When we got with James Brown, that was like, “Oh, man, we really going to have some fun now. And he going to pay us, too?”\n\n James used to ask people to call him “Mr. Brown.” Did you ever ask people to call you Mr. Collins?Oh, heck no. To me, that was so dated. When people say, “Mr. Collins,” I’m like, “No. Bootsy.” I want to always maintain that “kid” frame of mind. I don’t ever want to grow up like that. I respect everybody, and if you don’t respect me, that’s cool, but to be going around making somebody call you “mister,” that’s pretty deep.\n\n At the same time, I understood where he was coming from because he couldn’t trust nobody, with his background, the way he came up. So he called himself “Mr. Brown,” protecting his own interests. “Even if you don’t know me, you’re going to respect me, ’cause you’re going to have to call me mister.” So all of that was in his mind, and it was great for him.\n\n Did you think that then?It took some time for me to realize a lot of things that he was doing. I didn’t have a father in the house, so I didn’t know how to be a son. And he treated us like his sons. I wasn’t used to that, but I thank God that I got a chance to experience it because it learned me a lot of things.\n\n You and your brother, Phelps “Catfish” Collins, were playing house parties in Cincinnati when James hired the two of you. How did the city shape you?Growing up here, I got a chance to vibe with a lot of different communities. My mother worked two or three jobs, scrubbing floors, and she would take us to where she worked. Once we got out of school, we would have to watch her doing this work. And all the time she’s doing this work, me and my sister are acting a fool, but I saw what was happening. I said to myself early on, “If I ever get anything happening, we’re going to move out of the community and I’m going to get you a house. I’m going to get you a car.” So I was talking all that stuff, and I wasn’t even playing yet. I didn’t even know how to play. And she reminded me of that.\n\n So Cincinnati for me was a spot where, every two months, we had to move because the rent was due, and Mama didn’t have the rent money. We kept our boxes always packed and ready to go. So I got a chance to go all the way around Cincinnati and make friends. I started playing guitar and the gangs started loving me because I drew all the chicks so they would come hang around me like I was some big deal. I don’t think I would’ve got treated like I do in Cincinnati anywhere else. I think because they know who and what I am, and that if I say it, that’s my bond.\n\n How did playing with your brother inspire you as a bass player?As a kid, I used to deliver papers because my brother delivered papers when he was young. He had his red wagon, so I wanted to be just like that. He played guitar and had a band. They would all come over and rehearse, and I would be standing in the window, ’cause he didn’t want to let me in. It was like, “Get out of here, boy. You bother me.” It’s like, “I’m just watching.” But all the band cats loved to see me hanging around. They were eight to 15 years older than me; I was nine, and they were 22.\n\n Because my brother was so rejective of me, I was like, “Well, I’ll show him. When he goes to the paper route, I’m going to sneak his guitar and practice. And all of sudden, he going to find out I’m a ‘bad mother … shut your mouth.'” And that’s really what happened. I went on the gig with him. Our mother said, “If you want the gig, you got to take your little brother.” That was the night of my life. That did it.\n\n Listening to James Brown’s live album, Love, Power, Peace: Live at the Olympia, Paris, 1971, Catfish plays some incredible lead guitar — especially on “Sex Machine.”People never really got a chance to actually experience all the stuff he could do. I got tapes, I got recordings of stuff that people haven’t heard, and I want to try to get the Catfish album out. I got videos that will blow people’s mind.\n\n After you worked with James Brown, you and Catfish joined George Clinton in Parliament and Funkadelic. Was that a culture shock?George was more like a brother than a father. So we would get chicks, and we’d do what we do. I couldn’t do that with Mr. Brown. With George, I got a chance to experiment with the business, too. I got to explain to [the record labels] the sound I wanted, what I wanted to wear, my image. I got a chance to convince them that we crazy, but not that crazy. “Dude, this is just a look.” It’s like Superman: He does the Clark Kent thing, and when he’s ready to be Superman, he’s Superman.\n\n What’s your advice for creating a good image?For me, it just fell into place. When I was going to school, I would sit at the desk and draw stick men. “Why do I keep drawing this star man with the star glasses?” Once I got with George, I knew that I was going to have to come up with an image. So what I used to draw in school came back to me.\n\n What was the purpose of the mirrored star sunglasses you wore?[My fans] were goo-goo about me, which was cool and great, but I wanted them to realize that they’re stars, too. So without telling each person that, I just wore the glasses, and they kind of spoke for themselves.\n\n Was it easy getting a star-shaped bass made for you?We just found the actual drawing that I did a couple of weeks ago. What happened is I found the guy to make the “Space Bass” in 1974 in Warren, Michigan, and his name was Larry Pless, and he worked in an accordion shop. I had been going all the way up and down 48th Street in New York, and nobody would say yes to making it. Everybody had all of these things that wasn’t going to work: “The wood is not shaped right. It ain’t going to sound right.”\n\n When I asked the guy who owned the accordion shop if he could build the bass, he said, “Well, why would you come into an accordion shop?” To me, it was just a music store, and you just never know what’s going to be happening. And sure enough, he said, “Oh, wait a minute, there’s a guitar player in the back room that works on the accordions, but he also makes guitars.” And I said, “Well, can I meet him?” He introduced me to him, and then it was on from there. 1975 is when he actually finished it.\n\n What’s the secret to creating a great catchphrase like, “Wiiind me up,” when you were “Bootzilla”?George seen me one time with the glasses on, the new glasses with the star in the middle and all the rhinestones. He said, “Oh, man, you look like a monster.” I said, “Bootzilla.” It wasn’t something I planned; things like that just happened. That’s what I love about the funk: Things just happen, and you have to grab them.\n\n Does it bother you when people steal your look or borrow your swagger?I thought it was cool, because it’s like that was a motivational thing for me to not stop it. If you grab what I got on today, then I got to go somewhere else.\n\n You titled your new record, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer. How do you know when you’ve made the album of the year?All the time I spent with P-Funk and James Brown, I always seen everybody else get awards and accolades and we never did. And so that made me be like, “Well, if y’all are not going to say it, then I’m going to say it.” It’s just like [Collins’ 1978 album] Player of the Year; that wasn’t no award show until I made it one. So it’s that time again rolling around like, “Oh, y’all don’t notice me, huh? All right, well check this out.” So I’m going to call my own album, Album of the Year. Funk is making something out of nothing.\n\n You’ve always talked about “funk” like a religion. How important is the funk?Funk is the word, and the word became flesh. If you don’t got no funk, then you don’t got no physical thing going on around here. We get two things: We get funk, and we get spirit. Man took whatever he find — made tools, made this, that, and the other — and made something out of what was nothing. But man wasn’t the first: Funk was the first thing. Funk is making something out of nothing.\n\n On your 1977 song “The Pinocchio Theory,” you sang, “Don’t fake the funk.” Have you ever worried that you were faking the funk?I promised myself before I even made the song that when it got down to a point where I felt like I had to fake the funk, I would have to step down. I can never fake the funk. So when it came down to deciding to come off the road, the very thought that came to me was, “You can’t keep carrying that bass like you’ve been doing onstage with those heavy clothes, day in and day out.” From 2006 to about 2017, I started to realize that I couldn’t keep that up no more. I can’t fake that.\n\n I was going to have to figure out another way. My other way now is making “Albums of the Year.” So I do more production work now, and it makes me happy that I don’t have to go out there and fake the funk, ’cause a lot of people would.\n\n You and George Clinton were famous in the Seventies for dropping acid. Why did you stop?The last time I took acid was in 1981. I told myself I’d stop if I ever had a bad trip. Every time I tripped, it would be so good, so much better than the last time. The last time I took it, I had the worst trip. I can’t even remember what actually happened. People had to tell me what I was doing. We would go driving, taking acid, and I remember the lines on the street would come, looked like they would come in the car.\n\n What’s the most indulgent purchase you’ve ever made?It would probably be seven motorcycles — different ones, different styles, trail bikes, the “Bootcycle.” Other than making music, my go-to thing was riding bikes. I was riding up to gigs on the Bootcycle. That’s the one you see on the cover of [1976’s] Stretchin’ Out album. It wasn’t just a prop; it was actually a motorcycle. I used to ride it around in L.A. I had the black leather suit with studs and rhinestones on it. That was my freedom. That was my wind in the hair, in the face, no helmet. To have two or three chicks in the back, it was the best. I was so blitzed out [on drugs]. That was the best time, other than being onstage.\n\n You stopped riding in 1983 when you had a motorcycle accident. How did that change your life?The doctor told me I would never use my right arm again. He was saying, “You would never be able to play your bass again,” and I was like, “No.” He said, “All you got to do is rehab, rehab, and rehab.” I was so scared ’cause all I knew how to do was music, play bass and write to the music that I do. That’s all I knew. Nothing else ever worked for me. It took about a year before I realized I could use my arm again.\n\n Cocaine was the cause of my motorcycle accident, ’cause that’s what I changed over to from LSD. It kept you fired up. George loved it. They used to call him “Chief Cokehead.” We used to go fishing in Miami out on the yachts, and he’d have his whole ounce of cocaine. I’d have my guitar I’d play, he’d be humming songs. Poles be in the water, we’d be fishing. And the next thing you know, “Oh, you got one, you got one.” Those were truly the fun days.\n\n You keep a Mothership in your backyard. Why?We got it in 2018 because we wanted to do these stage shows. For this one gig at this big outdoor place that had a lake in it, I came out of the spaceship, I walked down, got to the water, and they had a ramp that was underwater that when you walk on it looks like you walking on the water. And the people went crazy. So we got it in the backyard now. We’re going to probably use it for props in videos.\n\n You spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s playing with Clinton in P-Funk. Now you’re collaborating with him again. What’s the secret to healing that friendship?The business just tore us up, and I lost track of what was going on with him. But now things are feeling good, we’re easing ourselves back in. What happened was I seen Kamala [Harris] on TV saying, “I found a George Clinton doll. And I love Bootsy Collins.” For some reason, that touched me. Like, “He’s still your friend. No matter what happened, you got to be the one to take the high road.” So I called him up and said, “Let’s do this track together.” And he was all over it. So we’re going to carry on and see where we go, because when you’re dealing with the funk, you never know what the funk’s going to happen.","summary":"The legendary bassist on what he learned from James Brown, the perils of faking the funk, and how Kamala Harris helped reunite him with George Clinton","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bootsy-collins-james-brown-george-clinton-album-of-the-year-1235297617/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bootsy-collins-last-word-illo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 14:26:25","author":"Kory Grow","authors":["Kory Grow"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.079},{"id":301504012,"title":"‘You Knew’: Stephen A. Smith Hammers Democrats For Losing Americans’ ‘Trust’ Through Biden Cover-Up","text":"ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith accused Democrats on Monday of destroying their credibility by misleading Americans about former President Joe Biden’s mental acuity.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s favorability has plummeted to an all-time low of 29% after former Vice President Kamala Harris’ resounding loss to President Donald Trump in November following the party’s jettisoning of Biden from the presidential ticket. While discussing the poll on “The Stephen A. Smith Show,” Smith argued that Democrats must cater their messaging to Americans’ priorities rather than lecturing them due to losing voters’ faith by insisting Biden was fit for another term after exhibiting signs that he was not. (RELATED: ‘Bunch Of Losers’: Dems’ Emerging 2028 Field May Not Bode Well For Liberals)\n\n“You got to be about preaching about what’s important to the American people and what they care about instead of telling them what they should care about. You know why you can’t make that argument anymore? Because you had your chance,” Smith said. “You had President Biden up in that office. You knew he wasn’t the same. You knew there was shrinkage that kicked in mentally. You knew that people were talking about him being incapacitated. This was before the debate on June 27th. You knew it. You knew it. You knew it.”\n\nJournalist Bob Woodward wrote in his Oct. 2024 book “War” that concerns over Biden’s cognitive abilities began surfacing among Democratic donors during fundraising events as early as June 2023, a year before the former president’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Yet Democrats chanted, “Four more years!” during Biden’s March 2024 state of the union address.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor George Clooney also called for Democrats to replace Biden as their presidential nominee in a New York Times op-ed published on July 10. He had hosted a fundraiser for the president just three weeks prior and wrote that the Biden he witnessed at event was identical to what he observed during the debate.\n\n“And they got you on camera chanting for four more years for a dude that was approaching 82 years of age, that would have been in office until he was 86, assuming he got there,” he continued. “You didn’t even think he was going to make it, and God bless him, I hope he does. But what you did was say, ‘Let’s just get him through the election because the rest of us is running the government anyway.’ The trust of the American people were compromised.”\n\nBiden himself acknowledged in a USA Today interview in January that he was uncertain whether he could have completed another term in office.\n\n“I also wasn’t looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton,” Biden said in the interview. “But I don’t know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I’m going to be when I’m 86 years old?”\n\nEven after replacing Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in July, Harris denied Biden exhibited any cognitive issues.\n\nIn addition to the CNN poll, only 27% of registered voters had a positive perception of the Democratic Party, according to an NBC News poll published on Sunday, a record low in the outlet’s polling since 1990, it reported. Moreover, 55% of registered voters held a negative perception of the Democratic Party.\n\nUnlike Smith, former MSNBC host Chris Matthews and “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski asserted Monday that unchecked falsehoods from Trump and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk were to blame for Democrats falling out of favor with Americans.\n\n“Nobody checks the facts anymore,” Matthews claimed. “And the lies are getting through to the American people.”\n\nBrzezinski agreed, adding, “I do think there should be a war room, a central command and a person, a voice, a figure who can call out the disinformation.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Kamala Harris, the current vice president and presidential candidate, is campaigning with her family, including her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nDuring his October 1 appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show, Emhoff talked about his experiences as the second gentleman of the United States and couldn’t help but brag about Harris.\n\n.@jrpsaki: “You’re called a ‘wife guy,’ a proud ‘wife guy.’ How do you feel about that?”@DouglasEmhoff: “Well, if I do something annoying to Kamala and she gets upset, I’ll just show her that article. ‘I’m trying!’” pic.twitter.com/fRvsDM1KoF\n— Inside with Jen Psaki (@InsideWithPsaki) September 29, 2024\n\n“What is your favorite thing about your wife,” Hudson asked Emhoff, to which he replied “how much time do we have?,” before diving int-o his answer. “The fact that she’s still able to be my wife in the midst of all this,” he said, sharing a story about a day where they were “both in DC, and we don’t really get to see each other that much. So she came into my office, I heard all this shuffling around. She came in, she gave me the biggest hug, and she said ‘I love you.’ And then, OK, back on the road.”\n\n“The fact that she still is present in our relationship, is still present for the kids and her nieces and all that, it’s really remarkable,” Emhoff said.\n\nFans quickly voiced their opinions when the talk show shared a video of the exchange on Instagram. One person wrote “I love that for them. Most people forget to be present, to make time even for the smallest acts of love. ♥️🥹.”\n\nAnother commenter said “Awwww how sweet! That’s true love! I admire how they publicly acknowledged their love for each other in a decent and respectful manner. 💙💙💙💙💙.”\n\nA blind date arranged by Chrisette Hudlin, a mutual friend, in 2013 permanently altered the lives of Douglas Emhoff and himself. Los Angeles-based lawyer Emhoff recalled the tense argument over how to resolve a difficult client encounter, which unexpectedly led to him discovering a new love. How? After the matter was resolved, a satisfied client volunteered to put him in touch with Harris and gave him her phone number so they could go on a date.\n\nDouglas’s initial call to Kamala ended with an embarrassing voicemail left at 8:30 AM, which is not a good time to call. In his own words, “I just started rambling.” However, Kamala saw that his genuineness was what made him appealing. She plays that voicemail for him every anniversary as a fun reminder of their unusual start.\n\n🔥🚨DEVELOPING: Kamala Harris husband Doug Emhoff ‘came to his wife’s defense’ and accused: Donald Trump of mispronouncing Kamala’s name.\nEmhoff: “Mr. Trump, I know you have so much trouble pronouncing Kamala Harris’ name.

Douglas humorously recalled their first date, during which he picked Kamala up and said, “Buckle up— I’m a really bad driver.” They discovered they both had a weakness for humor through these kinds of light-hearted conversations, which helped them connect and set the tone for their relationship.\n\nDouglas proposed in an unusual way in March 2014, following a brief romance. Kamala was unaware that he was going to pop the question as he was busy packing for a trip. His initial intention to pop the question in Florence, Italy, evolved into an unplanned event that resulted in a passionate “yes” and an August 22, 2014, wedding that combined Jewish and Indian customs.","summary":"Doug Emhoff’s deep admiration for Kamala Harris shines through as he shares heartfelt moments from their marriage","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/doug-emhoffs-favorite-thing-about-kamala-harris-its-not-what-you-think","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Doug-Emhoff-EXPOSES-on-What-He-Loves-Most-About-Wife-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 13:02:02","author":"Shrobana Rakshit","authors":["Shrobana Rakshit"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.391},{"id":301457366,"title":"House Republicans Zero in on 26 ‘Vulnerable’ Democrat Incumbents","text":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Twenty-six House Democrats have been deemed “vulnerable” in the 2026 midterm elections by the National Republican Congressional Committee, posing a prime opportunity for Republicans to expand their razor thin margin over Democrats in the House.\n\nFive months after Republicans won a government trifecta in 2024, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee both released lists of at-risk Democrat seats. The lists are extremely similar, showing a growing consensus between parties that many Democrats might be in hot water in 2026.\n\nThe lists identify nine freshman lawmakers and 13 representing districts that President Donald Trump carried in the November election.\n\nCalifornia hosts the most vulnerable Democrats, with Reps. Josh Harder, Adam Gray, George Whitesides, Derek Tran and Dave Min all viewed to be in danger of losing their seats, according to both the Republican and Democrat campaign committees. Gray, Whitesides and Tran all unseated GOP incumbents in November.\n\nNew York also has freshman Democrat lawmakers who flipped Republican seats in 2024, including Reps. Tom Suozzi—who won his seat in a Trump district—Laura Gillen and Josh Riley, who are all predicted to be at risk of losing their positions, the lists say.\n\nIn Nevada, where Democrats spent more than 100 times as much as Republicans in ad space, Democrat Reps. Dina Titus, Steven Horsford and Susie Lee, who won in a Trump district, were also included on the Republican and Democrat campaign committees list. Trump notably won the swing state 50.6% to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 47.5%.\n\nStates with large hispanic populations are also epicenters for shaky Democrat-held seats due to Republican gains with Latino voters, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Democrat Reps. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas as well as Nellie Pou of New Jersey are all a part of the GOP’s expanding offensive map for 2026. Each of the representatives won their seats in red Trump districts.\n\n“House Republicans are in the majority and on offense,” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson in the committee’s press release. “Meanwhile, vulnerable House Democrats have been hard at work demonstrating they are painfully out of touch with hardworking Americans. Republicans are taking the fight straight to these House Democrats in their districts, and we will unseat them next fall.”\n\nA recent poll by the Democrat group Navigator Research shows an alarming stance Independent voters have taken against Democrats, with just 27% believing Democrat leaders are focused on helping Americans, and only 37% believing party leaders have the right priorities. A majority of 56% think that Democrats are not looking out for working people, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll also found that 69% of Independent voters view the Democratic Party as “too focused on being politically correct,” while 51% of voters generally considered the party to be “elitist.”\n\nKen Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, addressed these sentiments in a memo dated Feb. 18, in which he shared that Americans are increasingly perceiving the Democratic Party as “the party of elites.”\n\n“For the first time in modern history, Americans now see the Republicans as the party of the working class and Democrats as the party of the elites,” Martin said in his memo. “I fundamentally believe that our party is grounded in the values, principles, and aspirations of the working class. As Chair of the DNC, that belief will guide my decisions and approach in the years ahead.”\n\nDespite polling that suggests voters view the Democratic Party as of out-of-touch, Democrat Washington Rep. Suzan DelBene, the leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, projected optimism for Democrats in 2026, arguing in a statement that her party should shift its focus to issues such as the cost of living, and straying from the “hyper partisan rhetoric.”\n\n“House Democrats overperformed across the country in 2024, powered by our battle-tested candidates who won despite the NRCC’s false bravado and these Frontliners will win again in the midterms,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The truth is House Republicans are running scared and refusing to hold town halls because they don’t want to get yelled at for their failure to lower prices, bungling the economy, and cutting Medicaid in order to pay for tax breaks for billionaires like Elon Musk.”\n\nDemocrats have recently struggled to establish a clear party leader as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both representing New York, were at odds over how to respond to the GOP-backed government funding bill. As multiple Democrat politicians ponder whether to run for president in 2028, Democrats appear to be staring down multiple vulnerable seats in the House, with no leader to push the party forward into midterms.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Twenty-six House Democrats have been deemed “vulnerable” in the 2026 midterm elections by the National Republican Congressional Committee, posing a prime opportunity...

Trump)\n\nConor McGregor’s summit with Donald Trump was the latest example of UFC and its stars sharing a cosy relationship with the President of the United States.\n\nMcGregor, 36, visited the White House on St Patrick’s Day with the intention of voicing concerns over immigration issues in Ireland.\n\nThe former world champion and Trump took turns praising the other’s ‘inspiring’ work rate with anti-immigration comments made by the Dubliner quickly denounced by Irish political leaders.\n\nWhile his comments have sparked outcry back home, McGregor’s presence in the Oval Office seems in-fitting with the close dynamic between Trump and the world of UFC.\n\nMcGregor has not fought in almost five years – losing his last fight against Dustin Poirier after breaking his leg in the first round.\n\nLast year, a woman who accused McGregor of raping her in a Dublin hotel won a claim against him for damages in a civil case.\n\nA jury found that he had assaulted her and was ordered him to pay more than €248,000 (£206,000).\n\n McGregor spoke from the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House (Picture: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOnce the undisputed star of mixed martial arts, his star is fading with ‘Notorious’ seemingly set on rebranding himself as a political figure. Despite that, he remains synonymous with the UFC brand.\n\nHe will not be the first fighter from the promotion to praise the Trump administration. The entire fight roster is perhaps the most conservative leaning in all of sport with its most prominent names standing by Trump over the last decade.\n\nNo fighters under the UFC flagship have publicly questioned McGregor’s meeting with Tump and none are likely to either. UFC stars have gravitated towards Trump, regardless of their background with Colby Covington, Jorge Masvidal, Justin Gaethje and Henry Cejudo among his biggest supporters.\n\nJon Jones, perhaps the best fighter in the promotion’s history, is also among that contingent. Two weeks after his election victory over Kamala Harris, Trump, flanked by Elon Musk and Robert Kennedy Jr, attended UFC 309 to watch Jones defend his heavyweight title against Stipe Miocic.\n\n Trump regularly attends UFC events in New York (Picture: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC)\n\nJones celebrated by breaking out the Trump dance in the centre of the Octagon, handing his belt to the beaming president before thanking the 78-year-old for attending.\n\nTrump is a regular attendee when UFC comes to the east coast with chants of ‘F**k you Biden’ heard during his ringside appearance at UFC 302 in Newark last June.\n\nThe love-in among a sizeable portion of UFC fighters and fans comes from the very top. UFC president Dana White has long been one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters in a friendship that dates back to 2001. \n\n Dana White speaking at President-elect Donald Trump’s Victory Rally earlier this year (Picture: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nHe is firmly part of his inner circle, appearing at the Republican National Convention three times in support. While he has often been happy to mix business with politics, the 55-year-old has since sought to distance himself from the ‘disgusting’ world of the latter, insisting he wants no role to play in political affairs going forward.\n\nWhite owes plenty to Trump. MMA’s place in sport was very different 24 years ago, labelled ‘human cockfighting’ by then US Senator John McCain and shunned by the mainstream sporting establishment. \n\nStill an illegal sport in some US states, New Jersey legalised it with Trump inviting White and his promotion to set up shop at this Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City for UFC 30 and UFC 31.\n\nSince then, UFC has grown into the largest MMA organisation in the world, valued at over $12billion and the ties between it and Trump are stronger than ever.\n\n‘I’m in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I’ve ever met in my life,’ White said last November.\n\nGiven how healthy the relationship between UFC and Trump is, McGregor’s brief presence in Washington should come as no surprise.","summary":"McGregor sat down with the President inside the Oval Office on St Patrick's Day.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/03/18/no-ufc-stars-daring-call-conor-mcgregor-donald-trump-meeting-22747026/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SEI_244247333-2a7c.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 12:01:05","author":"Tony Mogan","authors":["Tony Mogan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.372},{"id":301409378,"title":"SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, saves NASA astronauts stranded on the ISS for nine months and sends them home.","text":"NASA’s stranded astronauts are finally on their way home after a brutal nine months in space.\n\nAfter months of tense anticipation, Sunita Williams and Barry ‘Butch’ Wilmore undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) at 1.05am ET (5.05am GMT) on the Dragon spacecraft made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\n\nThe pair, along with NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Aleksandr Gorbunov, will now make the 17 hour descent back to Earth and, if all goes according to plan, should splash down off the coast of Florida at 5.57pm ET (9.57pm GMT).\n\n‘Crew nine is going home,’ Hague, the commander of departing Crew Dragon, said from the spacecraft moments after they began their journey.\n\n‘On behalf of crew nine, it was a privilege to call space home… to live and work… in cooperation for the benefit of humanity. To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station, we know the station is in great hands. We’re excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish and we’ll be waiting for ya [sic].’\n\nNASA livestreamed the extraordinary mission, documenting every key development from the moment the duo were secured in the spacecraft and the hatch door was closed – which took place two hours prior to departure.\n\nWilmore was strapped in on the far left of the hatch with Williams secured on the far right, both blowing kisses at the screen as the reality set in that they were finally returning home.\n\nThere was a slight mishap as Takuya Onishi, one of four new astronauts replacing Williams and Wilmore, reported finding specks of dust on the hatch seals between the craft and the space station before takeoff. \n\nThose specks needed to be entirely removed – which Onishi did – before takeoff to ensure the seal remained air tight. \n\nBeyond that, all systems were reported working smoothly and the space suits had passed the required leak test, with forecast clear skies and ‘pristine weather’ ahead of splashdown on Tuesday.\n\nThe duo are unlikely to be able to walk on their own and will almost certainly be stretchered to the hospital, making for dramatic scenes.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were only supposed to spend eight days on the floating laboratory when they launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5.\n\nBut numerous technical issues with their ship, including thruster failures and helium leaks, drove NASA to send Starliner home without its crew in September.\n\nTheir unexpectedly long space mission became a political flashpoint following comments from President Donald Trump and Musk, who both said the Biden administration ‘abandoned’ the Starliner crew in space for ‘political reasons.’\n\nDuring a February appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Musk claimed he offered to bring the pair home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would have made Trump ‘look good’ in the presidential race against Kamala Harris. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore are en route back to Earth in SpaceX’s Crew-9 Dragon capsule, which docked to the ISS late last week. \n\nThe pair are joined by NASA’s Hague and Russia’s Gorbunov, who flew to the space station in the Crew-9 Dragon in September. \n\nFour new astronauts have taken their place after arriving on the ISS over the weekend. The incoming Crew-10 is composed of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan‘s Takuya Onishi, and Russia‘s Kirill Pesko.\n\nTypically, a departing ISS crew shares the space station with the incoming crew for about five days in what’s known as a ‘handover period.’\n\nThis allows them to get the new crew up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between teams.\n\nBut this time, NASA decided to shorten the handover period to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Starliner crew in case the weather interferes with their targeted return date.\n\nWhen they splash down on Tuesday, the frail duo will be placed on stretchers and immediately taken for medical evaluations. \n\nNASA is due to give a press conference at 7.30pm ET (11.30pm GMT) and it is highly unlikely the astronauts will attend.\n\nDr Vinay Gupta, a pulmonologist and Air Force veteran told DailyMail.com the crew will begin their rehabilitation program the very same day they return to Earth, with the first phase focusing on walking, flexibility and muscle strengthening. \n\nThe astronauts could need up to six weeks of rehabilitation to regain their strength, which will include guided exercise and a nutritional plan, he added.\n\nThe duo have been praised for their work under less-than-ideal conditions in the space station.\n\nThey completed 4,500 orbits while stranded for 286 days.\n\nRob Navias, from the NASA communications department, said: ‘For the statistical freaks out there, we can tell you that Williams and Wilmore… they will come home with 286 days in space… just to put it into context, not the longest in space history.’\n\n‘It’s not a record-breaking mission.’ \n\nNASA had moved up the return mission by two weeks after after President Trump told Musk to ‘go get’ Williams and Wilmore, saying Biden had ‘abandoned’ them in space.\n\nBefore the president’s request, the astronauts were not coming back earlier than March 26. \n\nMusk claimed the Biden Administration shot down his earlier offer to collect the astronauts due to his links to Trump.\n\nThe billionaire SpaceX founder backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies\n\nNASA officials have not directly addressed these claims, but during a press briefing earlier this month, one of its senior administrators shed light on the situation.\n\nKen Bowersox, associate administrator of the agency’s Space Operation Mission Directorate, said SpaceX has been working with NASA to develop a backup return plan for the Starliner mission since last July.\n\n‘The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,’ Bowersox said.\n\nHe also admitted that there ‘may have been conversations’ in the White House about delaying the return for political reasons, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nThe mission was only meant to take eight days, but the Boeing Starliner capsule which delivered them to the ISS encountered so many problems that NASA insisted it come back empty, leaving its test pilots behind to wait for a SpaceX lift.\n\nThe new crew from the SpaceX capsule will spend the next six months at the space station, which is considered the normal stint.\n\nTheir arrival comes after several setbacks for the relief mission, the most recent of which saw the flight scrapped at the eleventh hour on Wednesday, due to a hydraulic system issue with the Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThe Dragon capsule docked at the ISS just after 12:04am ET after a more than 28 hour journey.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNASA&#8217;s stranded astronauts are

Worse Off Than We Think","text":"Even Will Rogers might be hard pressed to come up with an appropriately harsh jibe about the current state of the Democrats.\n\n“I am not a member of any organized political party,” the 20th-century humorist famously said. “I am a Democrat.”\n\nNow, the problem isn’t a lack of organization per se, but the hangover of their dogged, dishonest support for a comprehensively failed presidency, joined to an irrational commitment to outlandish positions on cultural issues.\n\nThe Democrats shouldn’t be shocked that after insisting that Joe Biden was hale and hearty and fit to serve as commander in chief until January 2029, the public has a dim view of their party. The Democrats attempted to perpetrate one of the worst frauds on the American public in recent history, and then followed it up with another lie — that Biden’s overmatched emergency replacement, Kamala Harris, was joyful and impressive.\n\nIn a new CNN poll, the Democratic Party’s favorable rating is 29 percent — a record low going back to 1992.\n\nIn a new NBC poll, the Democratic Party’s favorable rating is 27 percent — a record low going back to 1990.\n\nDetect a pattern?\n\nPart of the reason for the dismal rating is that Democrats themselves want their party to be more confrontational with Trump and are dissatisfied. But the Democrats have taken a broader hit — in the NBC poll, only 11 percent of independents have a favorable view of them, and 56 percent unfavorable.\n\nThe agonized state of the party was encapsulated by its psychodrama over the so-called continuing resolution that ten Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted to pass last week. Progressives consider Schumer’s support a rank betrayal, and he’s had to postpone a book tour amid “security concerns.”\n\nThe New Yorker, who warned conservative Supreme Court justices a few years ago, “You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,” is now paying one himself.\n\nSchumer made the right tactical call. If Senate Democrats had successfully filibustered the spending bill, they would have been blamed for the resulting shutdown, further tanking the party’s image with the middle of the electorate.\n\nIn the fierce backlash against Schumer for saving his party another embarrassment, the left-wing congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is getting promoted as a potential primary challenger to Schumer, and even a national leader for Democrats. In the CNN poll, Democrats were asked which political figure best represents the “core values” of their party, and AOC narrowly led.\n\nShe has as good a claim to this title as anyone — and that’s the problem.\n\nAOC is Kamala Harris, if the California Democratic hadn’t flipped-flopped away from all the fringy things she said in 2019. She’s Bernie Sanders, if the Vermont socialist were about 50 years younger and could plausibly appear on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing the latest fashion. She’s Mahmoud Khalil, if the Columbia University activist that the Trump administration wants to deport somehow managed to get himself elected to Congress.\n\nAOC rejects the term “woke,” but there is no woke policy that she doesn’t support. She loved the neologism Latinx (“gender is fluid, language is fluid”) and still supports males competing in female sports (“trans girls are girls”). She’s never met an immigration restriction that she likes.\n\nThe reason Joe Biden won in 2020 is he didn’t seem like a progressive, and one reason that his party lost in 2024 is that he governed like one. AOC’s brand is the 2024 Biden rather than the 2020 Biden, except even more so. She’s charismatic and adept at social media, which easily could bring her greater fame and influence, but she’s a cartoonish version of the Democratic Party that the GOP hopes to run against.\n\nWill Rogers once commented, “You’ve got to admit that each party is worse than the other. The one that’s out always looks the best.” If their fervor to oppose Trump throws Democrats into the arms of AOC, they will test the accuracy of this proposition.\n\n© 2025 by King Features Syndicate","summary":"There is no woke policy she doesn’t support.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/03/if-aoc-is-the-democratic-future-the-party-is-even-worse-off-than-we-think/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aoc-dnc-2024.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 10:30:35","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.503},{"id":301572040,"title":"The Washington Post Canceled Me for Currygate. Jeff Bezos Was My Unlikely Savior.","text":"When Jeffrey Bezos came for the journalists in the Washington Post‘s Opinions section a few weeks ago, their colleagues in the paper’s news sections didn’t protest too loudly, because they were not in the Opinions section.\n\nThen Bezos came for the newsies. \n\nPost people wondered: What’s next, face-eating leopards?\n\nThe recent pattern of Chernobylic meltdowns at the Washington Post has been stupefying, a display of serial journalistic malpractice by a senior management beholden to the whims and ruthlessness of its billionaire owner—the man who turned Amazon into a retail behemoth while pushing his prole workers so hard that the drivers began peeing into bottles to meet draconian delivery quotas. \n\nI’ve had an interesting vantage point from which to view all of this—close up and bone-deep—but also at a felicitous remove. I no longer work for the Post, but I did for 30 years, to significant acclaim, until I violated a sacrosanct stricture: I embarrassed the newspaper and subjected it to the ire of a ravening, cancel-crazed global Internet.\n\nAnd so I was gone.\n\nThe timing proved fortuitous for me. I had an indigenous institutional knowledge of the place, and many loyal friends within it, but since I no longer worked for the Post when all this happened, I was free to report exactly what I found out and say exactly what I thought about it, lobbing grenades at my old employer from safe in my bunker, a Substack newsletter called The Gene Pool. \n\nThe Gene Pool can be nasty. And it turns out people like nasty in these deeply polarized, paranoid times because they are so angry at, and scared of, the Trump-Musk-Bezos troika that they are willing to part with their hard-earned ducats to see these people spanked ruthlessly in indelible digital print by someone who writes with insider authenticity. \n\nThe same Internet that chased me from the Post has now rescued my wallet, my career, and (so far) my reputation. \n\nI’m the guy who infamously doesn’t like Indian food. \n\nIn late 2021, I wrote exactly that in a humor column that was mostly at my expense, reflecting on my own infantile understanding of cuisine. I wrote that drowning a hot dog in a wet heap of a half dozen dressings was as big a crime as drowning a puppy in a toilet. I said that Old Bay Seasoning tasted like dandruff from a corpse. I claimed that balsamic vinegar broke up the Beatles, and that sweet pickles made as much gustatorial sense as chicken-flavored jelly beans. Readers laughed. Then, in the same column, I wrote that Indian curry—which I incorrectly described as a single spice, instead of a varying mixture of different spices—was pungent enough to “knock a vulture off a meat wagon.” Readers stopped laughing. \n\nBecause I had casually insulted an entire subcontinent and its diaspora, the wrath on Twitter was overpowering and relentless. My bosses at the Post were similarly, and understandably, unamused. They decided my food column had been, ironically, tasteless. Also culturally insensitive, which it was. And that, as they say, was that. \n\nExcept it wasn’t that, as it turns out. \n\nI started my Substack roughly a year later because, even at 71, I did not want to have to dip into my retirement savings. For about two years, The Gene Pool was a modest success. Then Jeff Bezos started perpetrating grandiose, self-serving malfeasances, mauling the integrity of the paper I loved, infuriating the staff, and prompting a hemorrhage of canceled subscriptions (more than 300,000 as of this writing.)\n\nBezos’ first, and most dramatic, move came late in October, shortly before the presidential election, when he learned that the Post planned to endorse Kamala Harris. His response was to order his Opinions staff not to endorse any presidential candidate, and he then evidently ordered the Post‘s publisher to lie about why—the obvious truth being that he wanted to ingratiate himself with a new, vindictive, spiteful president notorious for punishing his perceived enemies. (Bezos’ financial empire relies on federal contracts.) \n\nWith that, The Gene Pool, previously a versatile, thrice-weekly general interest column, became much more voluble, focused, and occasionally embittered. I began writing five or six days a week.\n\nI created a snarky new masthead for the Post, for whenever I write unpleasant things about its managers and express rage at their spinelessness:\n\nMy response to Bezos’ order was a post titled, “Courage and Cowardice,” a lengthy diatribe unflatteringly comparing him to a famous previous owner of the newspaper, Katharine Graham. You can guess which of the two represented courage. \n\nIt included these paragraphs: \n\nIn his statement, publisher William Lewis, a Rupert Murdoch protégé, lied nakedly about what had happened, and why. He said the newspaper made its choice in order to “return to their roots,” to reset itself to a prior, better, more genteel time when the Post declined to endorse presidential candidates.If you think that’s even remotely true, you are the idiot he takes you for.\n\nElsewhere in the piece, I wrote: \n\nOn July 17, 2001, when Mrs. Graham died after a fall on the street, her employees walked the halls of the Washington Post building, tearful.Jeff Bezos has earned billions in his life, but he will never earn that. \n\nAnd finally: \n\nThere is such a thing as moral authority. It may be intangible, but it is there, and it can be powerful. It is essential to newspaper opinion writing. The Washington Post owner flushed it down the toilet yesterday. What is left is invertebrate.\n\nThis action has damaged everyone, not the least of whom are the dedicated, talented employees of the Post, whose careers are likely now diminished because, well, do they work for a great newspaper anymore? They are like homeowners whose neighborhood suddenly gets a pig slaughterhouse. All the home values are diminished.In the one or two days before the election, expect to read a banal, obligatory piece in the Post—most newspapers do it—urging everyone to vote, for the sake of civic responsibility. Why should you believe it from the Post, now? The hypocrisy is thick and gooey. This is a newspaper that looked at the stark, existential choice facing the country, with the people in fear, and decided to sit this one out. They’re not voting. Why should you?\n\nThis post went semi-viral—almost as viral as my initial foray into apparent anti-Indian colonialism. Over the next four months, the number of Gene Pool subscribers, the ones I had managed to amass in the first two years, more than tripled.\n\nThere would be more mile markers to come. After each new depredation by the Bezos team, readers searched for reliably dissenting voices and found my Substack. The leaps in subscribership inevitably accompanied Post executives’ leaps in lickspittlery: \n\nNovember: Bezos, the owner of the newspaper of record for the nation’s capital, a role demanding political impartiality and restraint, writes Trump an obsequious tweet applauding his, er, historic achievement.\n\nBig congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 6, 2024\n\nDecember: Bezos, via Amazon, decides to gift the Trump administration $1 million for its inaugural festivities and stream the events on Prime Video, which is worth another $1 million.\n\nJanuary: Amazon announces it has agreed to produce a documentary about Melania Trump for which the First Lady will receive at least $28 million. Melania—who’d written a largely insipid memoir the year before—gives the following explanation to a TV interviewer. It seems right out of the Broadway musical Sunset Boulevard: “I get so many messages and letters how they enjoyed the book and they would love, my fans and people, would love to hear more from me.” \n\nThe deal smelled a lot like a bribe—I implied that.\n\nBut February and March were my most fecund months for new subscribers because Bezos continued to act like a member of the Trump administration in his handling of the Post. His behavior coincided with my decision to discard the word “administration” and just start calling it the “Trump regime.”\n\nThen Bezos did something really stupid, and characteristically arrogant. He instructed the Opinions staff that henceforth, they would only write stories “in defense of personal liberties and free markets.” He was instructing some of the nation’s most distinguished journalists to only write opinions that agreed with his own. Opinions editor David Shipley resigned immediately. \n\nAnd so, my next post consisted of two op-ed ideas that ostensibly aligned with the new rules: \n\nTo the Washington Post:Please accept this submission for your op-ed pages. I have included illustrations for your exclusive use. I believe my piece conforms to your new strictures, requiring only opinions defending free markets and personal liberties:I’m mad as hell about all the threats to the existence of free markets, particularly tariffs. Instead of leveling the playing field, tariffs distort it. For example, imagine you are a Mexican boxer fighting against an American boxer in Altoona, Pa. And your bucktoothed American hosts make you, and not your opponent, drag around one of these balls and chains.\n\n(Here I placed an illustration of a faceless character wearing the classic ball and chain.)\n\nYou’re gonna get your ass kicked! Is that free? Is that fair? So then, when an American goes to fight a Mexican guy in, say, Guadalajara, they’re gonna get back at us. They’re gonna make the American wear a chastity cage!\n\n(Here was a racier illustration of an actual product—a stainless steel cage designed to fit very, very tightly over a man’s penis.)\n\nSo, no. I, like all wise Americans, am in favor of no restrictive or punitive tariffs. Let’s compete as usual on the basis of product quality and bribes where necessary.And don’t get me started on personal liberties!Too late. I’m going to start. I’m all for extending personal liberties by reducing Deep State control over our lives. And by “our,” I include corporations, which, according to the Supreme Court, are people except for not being able to have sex and defecate.For example, this whole patent and trademark thing. Why should the government regulate our personal business decisions like that? Why shouldn’t I be able to manufacture a line of bidets under the name “Trump® Ass Washers”? Or the “Amazon®” line of airline vomit bags?And why should the government be able to tell me what sex I am? We have freedom of expression! If I want to identify as a schnizzle, which I declare to be a sterile, twelve-breasted egg-laying fish with gonads the size of mature gophers, why should the jackbooted government stop me?We should not be subject to the whims of the politicized, left-leaning justice system. Shouldn’t we all have the freedom, without fear of prosecution, to continue the recent practice of depositing warm dog poop bags on Teslas parked in the street? Should I not also be free, if it is my desire, or if it is my parents’ desire, for me to die of measles, like that kid just did in Texas, the anti-vaxx state?\n\nThe Post‘s writers helped me out out in this crusade by being outraged, but also silenced because they still needed to take home a paycheck. Fortunately, they had someone to vent to on background: the proprietor of that alternative news source, the Washington Pist!\n\nI learned, for instance, that the newspaper’s media critic, Erik Wemple, had submitted an essay about his disappointment in the new edicts. Then I found out that the piece had been spiked, and wrote about that. \n\nOne of Bezos’ dumbest moves was yet to come. His promise—or implied promise—always had been for everyone not to worry, because he would keep his hands off the news side of the paper. \n\nThat’s the default: Most reputable news organizations maintain a strict ethical firewall between the business side—owners, publishers, advertising reps—and the news operations.\n\nBut then it was reported that the Post’s publisher—whom Bezos had hand-picked—had met privately with the editor of the Washington Free Beacon, a muckraking hard-right news organization of squishy ethics, to ask how he could recruit more conservative journalists. \n\nThe initial report of the meeting did not specify that the Post was seeking news reporters—as opposed to staff opinion writers, who serve at the publisher’s pleasure—but that’s how it was widely reported. The Free Beacon, after all, prides itself on its “combat journalism.” \n\nBezos’ hands were now all over the news side, apparently. It felt like a groping incident. \n\nAll along, writers and editors were leaving the paper in daunting numbers. The Post lost its gifted political cartoonist Ann Telnaes, who quit after one of her cartoons was spiked. The cartoon in question depicted Bezos and other media moguls as Trump suckups. Matea Gold, the Post‘s widely admired managing editor, and its White House reporter Tyler Pager went to the New York Times. Political reporters Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker jumped ship for The Atlantic. Political columnist and blogger Jennifer Rubin quit the Post and started her own Substack, The Contrarian. (Slogan: “Not owned by anybody.”) \n\nThe most recent notable departure was Ruth Marcus, a universally respected Opinions columnist and associate editor. She quit after the Post spiked one of her columns about the lamentable state of affairs at the newspaper. I believe I was the first to break that story. But I couldn’t get access to her spiked column. \n\nMarcus published it herself a few days later in The New Yorker. You should read it. It’s elegant from start to finish, and heartbreaking in places.\n\nShe writes: “We have lost so much talent in the newsroom in the past few months as reporters and editors have defected to competitors—and we’re still publishing remarkable work. (I’ll never stop saying ‘we’.)”\n\nMarcus summarizes her reason for leaving in one grandly efficient line: “My job is supposed to be to tell you what I think, not what Jeff Bezos thinks I should think.”\n\nFor once, I had nothing to add. The Washington Pist was silent that day.\n\nGene Weingarten, a former Washington Post staff writer, syndicated humor columnist, and author of a nonfiction collection, The Fiddler in the Subway, has won two Pulitzer prizes for feature writing.

He’s Simply Insane.","text":"Adding the most fuel to the fire, perhaps, is Trump’s right-hand man—yet another angry megalomaniac who suffers delusions of grandeur (and grand delusions). Elon Musk’s rage toward Democrats may stem in part from a perceived snub by the White House under the Biden administration, when Musk wasn’t invited to an electric vehicle event (though he had also, of course, grown tired of what he saw as interference from federal regulators in his businesses). These days, Musk competes with Trump on a near-daily basis for the title of Most Batshit Social Media Post. Last month, he tweeted that the journalists at 60 Minutes “deserve a long prison sentence” for the crime of editing an interview with Kamala Harris. The other day, he retweeted a post blaming “public sector workers” for millions of deaths under Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. (As it happens, Musk’s own policies as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency are causing people to die around the world.)\n\nSome of you might argue that Trump isn’t mad, but just a psychopath feigning madness for his own ends. Or perhaps his ludicrous assertions began as convenient foils and have morphed into true delusions. After all, he’s had plenty of people telling him he’s right. Perhaps there’s a more accurate Shakespearean comparison, then. King Lear has a deep hole in him that constantly has to be filled: He insists that his three daughters publicly fawn over him to gain his graces and dismisses his most beloved daughter, Cordelia, when she refuses to engage in the practice. He cannot accept the errors of his ways. Yet Lear somehow retains his hold on power even as his hold on reality slips away, until ultimately he meets his demise and causes the death of all who are dear to him.\n\nWe are in a Shakespearean moment right now. Journalists are trying to understand Trump’s irrational behavior, and are generally unwilling to consider the possibility that it is not some grand strategy but just a sign of a madman with increasingly diminished mental faculties. Perhaps he’s not quite yet burying steaks to grow meat trees, like George III, but Trump’s delusions cause considerably more damage than that. Are we going to wait until he’s ranting about “drainage” like Daniel Plainview and beating someone to death with a bowling pin? Are we going to continue to bend over backward to pretend that this emperor isn’t naked?","summary":"“They say an old man is twice a child,” Rosencrantz remarks in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as he and the prince of Denmark observe Polonius. It’s a borrowed line, dating back to antiquity: Sophocles wrote, “For the aged man is once again a child.” We all recognize that old age can cause senility and fragility. And when a person is already inclined toward delusion, that trait can become more entrenched and grandiose over time. The irony in Rosencrantz’s comment is that he is speaking with a character who is both feigning madness and possibly descending into it. Polonius, in fact, is the one to note that Hamlet’s act may produce certain benefits, declaring, “Though this be madness, yet there is method in ’t.”\n\nWe’ve seen this strategy throughout modern political history.

And I’ll say that in some years I’ve been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shaw. David Shaw is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he’s gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shaw recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He’s walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don’t necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there’s then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shaw. Welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you’re about to show us here. I’m glad. I’m glad you asked. I’m the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we’ve done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There’s a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you’re doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There’s two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That’s just impossible in today’s day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we’ve ever surveyed. We can’t be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn’t back yet, but I think that there’s enough data to tell a coherent story. There’s the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There’s precinct and County level election results. We’re also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I’ll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They’re more likely to run for office. They’re more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They’re more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they’re really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn’t really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I’m just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That’s only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we’ve seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there’s this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I’m about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we’ve seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people’s analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There’s no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They’re winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They’re winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it’s always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we’re seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That’s exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn’t be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let’s move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You’re good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times’ data from Nate Cohen’s upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn’t vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn’t vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that’s really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don’t follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It’s interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times’ to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don’t. That’s what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times’ headlines, you’re not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don’t really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that’s 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn’t exist four years ago. And it’s not just that New York Times’ readers are more liberal than the overall population. That’s definitely true. It’s that they’re more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there’s this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don’t. And so, as a result of these changes, we’re really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it’s been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can’t win. That’s exactly right. I’m the problem. But it’s basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn’t true four years ago. So here here’s something that I’ve heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn’t lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It’s just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn’t feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they’re generally low education. They’re fairly politically disengaged. They’re much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn’t vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It’s true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they’re not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they’re pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that’s a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there’s a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I’m not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they’ll tell you inflation. I’ll get to this later. But that’s what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don’t think it’s necessarily true that it’s impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I’ll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it’s worth talking to the next chart, too, because it’s getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there’s a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There’s a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That’s exactly right. Our estimates, and it’s really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there’s some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn’t efficient for him. It’s one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn’t very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he’ll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump’s appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We’re talking mass deportations. We’re talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It’s just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there’s some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that’s happening. It’s hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what’s happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It’s at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That’s exactly right. That’s a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I’m very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it’s been in American politics. For voters over 75, it’s even lower. That’s right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that’s changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it’s been stable since then. But what’s crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it’s too early to say exactly what the cause is. What’s interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I’ve seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there’s a lot of research to do here. But it’s still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it’s still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it’s not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I’ll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what’s interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it’s not just inflation. It’s not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I’m sure that’s part of the story, too. I feel like the story you’re implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men’s political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don’t want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I’ll say is I just think that we’re in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don’t have slides on this, but there’s just a lot of really interesting ways that they’re very different in the data. They’re much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it’s very plausible to me. And I’ve heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it’s a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you’re being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You’re actually entering the opposite world. You’re seeing brené Brown, right. You’re seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that’s true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people’s social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That’s right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn’t run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I’m sure that they’ll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don’t do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it’s just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here’s Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn’t have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that’s their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that’s why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don’t think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration’s handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what’s interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That’s right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don’t see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I’m just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what’s more important right now preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people’s lives. And I’m just going to scroll up. But I think what’s really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I’m going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don’t want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn’t do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they’re going to improve people’s lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it’s just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there’s actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that’s what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn’t be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they’ll nominate somebody who’s just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don’t, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we’ll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That’s right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it’s an untilled bit of farmland up there. That’s right. So there’s mental health, which voters don’t rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That’s right. That’s kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it’s just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn’t trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn’t care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it’s also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn’t look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that’s basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It’s going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what’s going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it’s probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don’t. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they’re voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I’d say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here’s what we’re going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I’m Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I’ll make that my top priority. Obviously, there’s a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump’s tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don’t like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn’t just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it’s very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what’s really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shaw strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn’t work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn’t work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn’t work, then maybe it just didn’t work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it’s just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don’t. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I’m not telling you to. I’m not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren’t running the optimal strategy, why. I know it’s hard to get media attention for things, and that’s fair enough. But it’s also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it’s very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there’s a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn’t work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn’t even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn’t going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I’ll say, in terms of why I’m sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they’ll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn’t work. People want to hear about eggs. And it’s easy for me to say that, because I don’t really I’m not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you’re in the moment. It’s just it’s very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald’s. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald’s. Sure, but she wasn’t the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald’s. And there’s a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there’s a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump’s going to end by showing up at a McDonald’s. Like, it just wouldn’t have been surprising, I think. And so it’s just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what’s needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it’s 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It’s not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There’s an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That’s right. I think that’s exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they’re pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we’re pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It’s like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who’s just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They’re liberal on some issues. They’re very conservative on other issues. And I think that that’s just like a much closer fit. For And that’s when you think of that, it’s maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it’s called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he’s not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he’d be extremely far right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn’t like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there’s a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It’s not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it’s that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it’s like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That’s exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I’m sorry. It’s all right. But I’m glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn’t a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it’s also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you’re saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I’m really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you’re a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don’t you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there’s a good argument that given that, it’s amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it’s that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump’s higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you’re running through this. I’m not saying you’re saying DEI programs are popular, but I’m not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I’m curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that’s playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there’s definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there’s this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that’s wrong, that a lot of what’s happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn’t cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it’s possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they’re less politically engaged. It’s not surprising that we dropped among this group. You’d expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don’t care very much about politics, this is a group that’s eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that’s a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn’t want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It’s not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I’ve seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok’s audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don’t know the answer to that. It’s totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I’ll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I’m sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it’s not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok’s a lot more random, and there’s very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don’t care that much about politics. And, I don’t could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don’t really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it’s just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you’re near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they’re going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it’s not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you’re trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there’s a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it’s just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you’ve talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump’s flood the zone strategy, where he’s just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we’ve done here is we’ve pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he’s campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we’ve pulled. And what you can see is that there’s a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he’s actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they’re going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we’re preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they’re going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn’t that big of a deal. They’re doing mass firings around critical functions. They’re destroying USAID. They’re aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It’s on the one hand, I suspect they’re not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that muc","summary":"The Democratic pollster David Shor walks through what voter data reveals about the 2024 election — and how the American electorate is shifting.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-david-shor.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/18/opinion/18eks-shor-image/18eks-shor-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 09:02:13","author":"Ezra Klein","authors":["Ezra Klein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":301380858,"title":"Democrats 'resist' Trump but go nowhere","text":"Democrats are like hamsters on a wheel, running furiously and going nowhere. The more they \"resist,\" the farther they slide from retaking political power. The party of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton has never been more unpopular. A new NBC poll shows the party earning its worst marks of all time. While 46% of respondents said they are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" positive on Donald Trump, only 27% said the same about Democrats – the lowest score ever recorded and down from 39% last September. By comparison, some 39% in the survey said they were positive on Republicans. Asked recently by NBC’s Kristen Welker why he thinks Democrats are failing to connect with voters, the Connecticut senator and progressive hotshot Chris Murphy, said Democrats aren’t doing enough to oppose President Donald Trump. \"The broad middle of the public… wants to see our party fighting in exceptional ways.\" Really? Murphy, like other Leftist Democrats, is resisting everything the president proposes, and wanted to shut down the government rather than sign onto the spending bill proposed by House Republicans. That was supposed to be an \"exceptional way\" to fight Trump. Never mind that government shutdowns have typically hurt the party engineering the closure of federal agencies and services, as well as the country. Murphy, and others like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wanted to do it anyway. The country be damned. DOUG SCHOEN: I'M A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT. MY PARTY IS FAILING AND NEEDS TO LEARN FROM A WINNER Other recent exceptional \"resistance\" acts by Democrats include firebombing Cybertrucks, doing interpretive dancing (seriously), rallying for a Hamas-sympathizer who led a mob to break laws and spew hate on Columbia University’s campus, voting against the Laken Riley Act, which allows criminals to be deported, suing to stop vicious Tren de Aragua gang members being sent to El Salvador, voting against allowing continued pursuit of criminals who stole hundreds of billions of dollars in COVID relief aid, and conjuring up a whole new Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. How mortifying. Adding to Democrat angst, the party has no credible leadership. Open warfare has broken out, with progressives furious at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for helping to pass a continuing resolution that kept the government open; some are calling for progressive darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to challenge Schumer in a primary. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who sits on only one committee in the House, has sponsored few bills since she was first elected in 2018, garnered few co-sponsors and passed but one – having to do with geothermal energy. That's not exactly what you might call a powerhouse leader. JAMES CARVILLE: TOO MANY DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER TRUMP. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY Otherwise, the leading contenders to run for president in 2028 include Gavin Newsom and Jay Pritzker, governors of California and Illinois, respectively, two of the worst-managed and most troubled states in the country. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has all but disappeared from view; after burning through more than $1billion in campaign cash, she is not likely to get another run at the Oval Office. And then there’s Pete Buttigieg, known mainly for taking paternity leave while the country suffered a supply chain crisis and for proving incapable of building out the country’s network of EV chargers. Some Democrats are beginning to see the light. Democrat think tank the Third Way recently launched a project aiming, according to Axios reporting, to craft a \"singular narrative that is simple, memorable, and resonant\" and that addresses voter concerns (at long last). Third Way acknowledges that anything \"that seems performative will be tuned out or backfire.\" So much for interpretive dance. But Democrats have yet to acknowledge that they are on the wrong side of many popular issues, like banning biological men from competing in women’s sports, ridding the federal government of waste and fraud, and cutting taxes, all of which they oppose. In the NBC poll, over two-thirds of those surveyed thought Trump was bringing \"real change\" to the nation; 46% thought he was engineering the \"right kind of change\" while 30% disagreed. Sizeable pluralities specifically applauded the changes he was making to immigration, cutting down the size of the federal government, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, trade policy and inflation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION More impressive, the same survey showed that 44% of Americans think the country is heading in the right direction, indicating the highest optimism level since January 2004. This is a huge jump from the 27% scored last November and reflects a meaningful shift in public sentiment. The improvement is in marked contrast to other readings, like the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which shows the country increasingly worried about inflation. The NBC poll was conducted March 7-11, which coincided with some of the worst days in the stock market, and likely reflects Trump supporters’ confidence in his long-term agenda. The NBC poll and others have sensible Democrats reassessing their positions on many issues, including tariffs. Axios reports that some Democrats are beginning to take a softer line on tariffs, acknowledging that middle-class voters who defected to Donald Trump like his economic plan to bring manufacturing and other businesses back to the U.S. and that they need a similar message. Unions are prodding the change of heart, with the UAW (which endorsed President Joe Biden last fall) saying last month, \"We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.\" Pennsylvania Rep.

To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station, we know the station is in great hands. We're excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish and we'll be waiting for ya [sic].'\n\nNASA livestreamed the extraordinary mission, documenting every key development from the moment the duo were secured in the spacecraft and the hatch door was closed - which took place two hours prior to departure.\n\nWilmore was strapped in on the far left of the hatch with Williams secured on the far right, both blowing kisses at the screen as the reality set in that they were finally returning home.\n\nThere was a slight mishap as Takuya Onishi, one of four new astronauts replacing Williams and Wilmore, reported finding specks of dust on the hatch seals between the craft and the space station before takeoff. \n\nThose specks needed to be entirely removed - which Onishi did - before takeoff to ensure the seal remained air tight. \n\nBeyond that, all systems were reported working smoothly and the space suits had passed the required leak test, with forecast clear skies and 'pristine weather' ahead of splashdown on Tuesday.\n\nThe duo are unlikely to be able to walk on their own and will almost certainly be stretchered to the hospital, making for dramatic scenes.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were only supposed to spend eight days on the floating laboratory when they launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5.\n\nBut numerous technical issues with their ship, including thruster failures and helium leaks, drove NASA to send Starliner home without its crew in September.\n\nTheir unexpectedly long space mission became a political flashpoint following comments from President Donald Trump and Musk, who both said the Biden administration 'abandoned' the Starliner crew in space for 'political reasons.'\n\nDuring a February appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Musk claimed he offered to bring the pair home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would have made Trump 'look good' in the presidential race against Kamala Harris. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore are en route back to Earth in SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon capsule, which docked to the ISS late last week. \n\nThe pair are joined by NASA's Hague and Russia's Gorbunov, who flew to the space station in the Crew-9 Dragon in September. \n\nFour new astronauts have taken their place after arriving on the ISS over the weekend. The incoming Crew-10 is composed of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Pesko.\n\nTypically, a departing ISS crew shares the space station with the incoming crew for about five days in what's known as a 'handover period.'\n\nThis allows them to get the new crew up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between teams.\n\nBut this time, NASA decided to shorten the handover period to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Starliner crew in case the weather interferes with their targeted return date.\n\nWhen they splash down on Tuesday, the frail duo will be placed on stretchers and immediately taken for medical evaluations. \n\nNASA is due to give a press conference at 7.30pm ET (11.30pm GMT) and it is highly unlikely the astronauts will attend.\n\nDr Vinay Gupta, a pulmonologist and Air Force veteran told DailyMail.com the crew will begin their rehabilitation program the very same day they return to Earth, with the first phase focusing on walking, flexibility and muscle strengthening. \n\nThe astronauts could need up to six weeks of rehabilitation to regain their strength, which will include guided exercise and a nutritional plan, he added.\n\nThe duo have been praised for their work under less-than-ideal conditions in the space station.\n\nThey completed 4,500 orbits while stranded for 286 days.\n\nRob Navias, from the NASA communications department, said: 'For the statistical freaks out there, we can tell you that Williams and Wilmore... they will come home with 286 days in space... just to put it into context, not the longest in space history.'\n\n'It's not a record-breaking mission.' \n\nNASA had moved up the return mission by two weeks after after President Trump told Musk to 'go get' Williams and Wilmore, saying Biden had 'abandoned' them in space.\n\nBefore the president's request, the astronauts were not coming back earlier than March 26. \n\nMusk claimed the Biden Administration shot down his earlier offer to collect the astronauts due to his links to Trump.\n\nThe billionaire SpaceX founder backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies\n\nNASA officials have not directly addressed these claims, but during a press briefing earlier this month, one of its senior administrators shed light on the situation.\n\nKen Bowersox, associate administrator of the agency's Space Operation Mission Directorate, said SpaceX has been working with NASA to develop a backup return plan for the Starliner mission since last July.\n\n'The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,' Bowersox said.\n\nHe also admitted that there 'may have been conversations' in the White House about delaying the return for political reasons, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nThe mission was only meant to take eight days, but the Boeing Starliner capsule which delivered them to the ISS encountered so many problems that NASA insisted it come back empty, leaving its test pilots behind to wait for a SpaceX lift.\n\nThe new crew from the SpaceX capsule will spend the next six months at the space station, which is considered the normal stint.\n\nTheir arrival comes after several setbacks for the relief mission, the most recent of which saw the flight scrapped at the eleventh hour on Wednesday, due to a hydraulic system issue with the Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThe Dragon capsule docked at the ISS just after 12:04am ET after a more than 28 hour journey.","summary":"Sunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) at 1.05am ET (5.05am GMT) on a craft made by Elon Musk 's SpaceX .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14508869/NASAs-stranded-astronauts-home-nine-months.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/18/04/96298695-0-image-m-22_1742270747642.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/18/2554086395524563654/1024x576_MP4_2554086395524563654.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-18 06:14:45","author":"Brittany Chain,Connor Boyd,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Connor Boyd","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":301292112,"title":"Otter chaos!

Meanwhile, during her appearance on “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” Roginsky commented on Trump’s mental state, prompting a rebuttal from Morgan.\n\n“I don’t think Donald Trump is particularly mentally well. You may agree with me or disagree with me on that,” Roginsky said. Morgan intercepted and said, “I couldn’t disagree more. Trump to me is exactly the same. He’s exactly the same. You may not like it. He’s exactly the same Donald Trump I’ve known for 20 years. Honestly, it’s like the same guy I met on day one.”\n\nMorgan then challenged the basis of Roginsky’s claim.\n\n“Because he is. He just is. Tell me. Because he’s not with it the way he used to be. He’s not with it the way he used to be,” Roginsky said when Morgan asked how and why Trump is different.\n\nMorgan, not satisfied with vague responses, countered, “You’re the one making the allegations. I’ve seen no evidence he’s not with it at all.”\n\nThe conversation then shifted to a broader political perspective, as the strategist attempted to pivot the discussion towards former President Joe Biden. Morgan, however, redirected the focus back to Trump.\n\n“You just said Donald Trump is mentally unwell. I’m just saying what’s the evidence? The guy is 78 years old,” Morgan told Roginsky. “He still does two-hour press conferences. He does two-hour rallies. He does endless off the cuff media encounters way more than any of his predecessors. For a guy who’s [supposedly] got mental problems, that’s pretty bold.” (RELATED: James Carville Floats Wild Theory On What He Thinks Links The Two Attacks)\n\nThe Dem strategist stood her ground and said that the ability to sustain lengthy public engagements does not necessarily correlate with mental wellness.\n\n“Just because he’s able to have the stamina to do that does not mean that he comports himself as somebody who is mentally well. You and I can agree or disagree on that,” Roginsky said.\n\nDespite Roginsky’s claims about Trump’s mental state, it was Biden who captured attention for his mental struggles. Bob Woodward said in his book “War” how concerns over Biden’s mental acuity began surfacing among affluent donors during fundraising events as early as June 2023.\n\nThis was nearly a year before Biden displayed difficulties in forming coherent sentences at a nationally-televised debate against Trump. Following this debate, Biden was replaced as the presidential candidate by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has consistently evaded questions about what she knew of Biden’s cognitive problems.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The retired Colonel released a statement saying, “I am grateful to the president for his trust and confidence,” and understandably jumped at the opportunity to lead the service branch he served for 30 years.\n\nDemocratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker is also stepping down after a decade of leadership that saw the party take control of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly. She said in her announcement to the party: “I believe the time is right to pass the torch to a new leader who can continue to build on our successes and further strengthen our party.”\n\nBoth parties have a short window of time before they have to choose their next leader. The Democrats will vote on March 22, and the Republicans are looking to vote on April 12.\n\nSo far, four people have declared their candidacies: state Sen. Lamont Bagby, a Democrat from Henrico County, will face Democratic Party 10th Congressional District Chair Zach Pruckowski and community organizer Josh Stanfield to lead the Democrats, while Republican state Sen. Mark Peake is the only candidate thus far for the GOP. Both Peake and Bagby have indicated that they will remain in the Virginia Senate if they become party chair.\n\nPeake, whose candidacy has already been endorsed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin as well as the front-runner for this year’s Republican gubernatorial nomination, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, told The Daily Signal that a unified party is his main goal. He said he has a plan to achieve that by the time voting begins in September for the November elections: “It’s availability, accessibility, transparency, and fairness.” \n\nThat is the task for both parties this year. The main job of the party chair is making sure the local units have all the tools they will need to turn out their voters. “You’ve got to have the mailing list, walk list [for door-to-door campaigning],” Peake said.\n\nBeyond that, the tools would mean little without the knowledge of how to best use them. “We have to have training sessions so that [the unit chairs] can train their volunteers,” he added.\n\nStanfield, the Democrat community organizer, seemed to indicate that there is some friction within the Democrat’s state committee in an interview with the Virginia Mercury when he said that his goal as chair would be “this sort of idea of actually empowering members of the central committee to have a say, which means more regular voting on a larger range of issues.”\n\nThe party chairs will inherit organizations in better positions than their predecessors had. The Virginia Democrats had two major victories in November—reelecting Sen. Tim Kaine and delivering the state’s 13 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris. And the GOP can point to Youngkin’s victory in 2021 and several seat-flips from Democrat to Republican in 2023’s General Assembly election.\n\nHowever, the biggest wild card may be how they manage the tumult among Virginia’s federal government workforce as Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts and layoffs are hitting Virginia particularly hard.\n\nPeake added that, as always, fundraising will be key: “We’ve got to fundraise at the national level. We’ve got to get the [Republican National Committee] involved. We have got to get President Trump involved.”","summary":"With Virginia’s governor’s mansion and control of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs in less than eight months, both the Republican...

Polls show it might be cracking","text":"A series of polls released over the weekend revealed that approval of the Democratic Party is at a historic low. One poll conducted by CNN showed that Democrats are at their lowest approval rating since 1992, with only a dismal 29 percent of those suveyed approving of the party. Another poll from NBC News found that only 27 percent of voters approve of the Democratic Party. \n\nThat should not surprise many people. Not only did the party lose the White House and the Senate due to dissatisfaction with Joe Biden, voters didn’t believe Kamala Harris would bring down prices or control immigration. \n\nThe NBC poll also showed that Trump’s approval rating is at the highest it has ever been, at 47 percent — but it also revealed that he’s underwater, with 51 percent of voters disapproving of the job he’s doing. The main cause of his weakness is fairly clear: The economy.\n\nDespite Trump hitting some high marks, the NBC poll showed that 54 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy and another 55 percent disapprove of his handling of inflation and the cost of living. \n\nIt’s not hard to see why stocks took a massive hit last week as the market reacted overwhelmingly negatively to Trump’s threats of tariffs against Canada, China and Mexico, and the erratic nature of his threats.

Polls show it might be cracking","text":"A series of polls released over the weekend revealed that approval of the Democratic Party is at a historic low. One poll conducted by CNN showed that Democrats are at their lowest approval rating since 1992, with only a dismal 29 percent of those suveyed approving of the party. Another poll from NBC News found that only 27 percent of voters approve of the Democratic Party.\n\nThat should not surprise many people. Not only did the party lose the White House and the Senate due to dissatisfaction with Joe Biden, voters didn’t believe Kamala Harris would bring down prices or control immigration.\n\nThe NBC poll also showed that Trump’s approval rating is at the highest it has ever been, at 47 percent — but it also revealed that he’s underwater, with 51 percent of voters disapproving of the job he’s doing. The main cause of his weakness is fairly clear: The economy.\n\nDespite Trump hitting some high marks, the NBC poll showed that 54 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy and another 55 percent disapprove of his handling of inflation and the cost of living.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why stocks took a massive hit last week as the market reacted overwhelmingly negatively to Trump’s threats of tariffs against Canada, China and Mexico, and the erratic nature of his threats.

If you are still appalled by an American-based legal media brand shilling for Soviet-style censorship in the West, you are not alone. This week, the program returned with an editorial griping about the \"collateral damage\" caused by Donald Trump's executive order to end DEI initiatives at the federal level. \"60 Minutes\" profiled the cancelation of a collaboration between the U.S. Marine Band and a group of minority students after the order. \"The United States Marine Band was founded in 1798. Thomas Jefferson gave it its nickname, 'The President's Own.' Today, 135 Marines still perform the score of the White House from parties to inaugurations. So, there was excitement, last year, when the Marines judged a contest for teenage musicians. The winners would perform with the band. Thirty students were chosen. The concert was scheduled. But, last month, it was canceled,\" the segment begins. \"President Trump had issued his executive order against diversity programs, and the young musicians were Black, Hispanic, Indian and Asian. Because they were silenced, many wanted to hear them including veterans of military bands who gathered in an improvised orchestra of equity that you might call America's own.\" The band ended up performing this past Sunday at the Strathmore Music Center instead, which CBS says it paid for, including plane tickets. \"Any questions were answered this past week. The students gathered in Washington for rehearsals and the performance. 60 Minutes did what we often do, covered the costs of plane tickets and travel to bring all of our interviewees to one place. Equity Arc decided to book the rehearsal space and the concert hall and try to replace the absent marine band—which turned out to be easy,\" anchor Scott Pelley narrated. You can watch the full segment below: CBS concluded that the band \"looks like America.\" Well, that's simply not true. There was not a single white student in the band. White people exist in America, too. Moreover, the episode fails to explain why students of color need DEI initiatives to succeed at playing music. The show cites a study claiming that 80% of American orchestras today are white. And? Around 72% of the U.S. population is white. That 8% difference is hardly justification for DEI, a concept that is inherently designed to punish and reward Americans on the basis of their skin color. Further, CBS did not highlight a nationwide trend following the Trump DEI order. Rather, the episode focused on one isolated group of students and presented their case as proof that DEI is a net positive and Trump is wrong for limiting it. The episode's thesis is painfully flawed. DEI is not a net positive. Americans are not stronger when they are judged based on their skin color. They are strongest when they are judged by their strengths, which DEI initiatives specifically seek to diminish. At its core, DEI has made us weaker and more fixated on characteristics we cannot control, like our race and our gender. Just take this formerly planned collaboration between the students and the U.S. Marine Band, for example. White students were excluded. Why? Because of the sins of their ancestors whom they never met? Because of the supposed advantages of strangers who looked like them years ago? It's all so foolish. DEI is foolish. And to see a once serious news program stoop to this argument is utterly shameful. \"60 Minutes\" used to be one of the premier news shows in all the American media, a show where objective journalism was heard. Today, \"60 Minutes\" is a joke. In the past 12 months, the program has run a deceptively edited interview with Kamala Harris, an MSNBC-style monologue calling Trump cabinet members Russian assets and perverts, and a celebration of Germany's crackdown on the free speech of Western Christians. \"60 Minutes\" is a shell of itself and the show's executives ought to be held accountable for inflicting irreparable damage to its storied history.","summary":"Latest on CBS&apos;s &apos;60 Minutes&apos; and DEI.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/60-minutes-continues-down-propagandistic-path-simping-dei","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/03/screenshot-2025-03-17-at-5.17.28-pm.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 21:41:00","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":301229384,"title":"‘This is just absolute projection’: State poised to disbar Trump 2020 lawyer","text":"The irony is striking for John Eastman, a constitutional attorney and one of President Donald Trump’s lawyers in the litigated post-2020 election.\n\nOne week before a California panel is set to hear an appeal regarding Eastman’s disbarment, a group of Democrat attorneys general claim a Trump executive order runs “roughshod over the First Amendment” and sends “a menacing message to attorneys nationwide: unless they advance positions or represent clients favorable to the current administration, their livelihood may be at risk.”\n\n“The shoe is on the other foot and they are complaining about things they have been doing for years,” Eastman told The Daily Signal. “This is just absolute projection.”\n\nEastman’s hearing is set for Wednesday in Los Angeles before a panel of judges with the Review Department at the California Bar, which is the appellate level for the bar. The process stems from complaints by leftwing legal group, The 65 Project, which targeted 111 Trump-associated lawyers–including Eastman–for discipline in contesting Joe Biden’s 2020 election win.\n\nEastman is targeted for his legal argument that then-Vice President Mike Pence could delay counting Electoral College votes from states deemed contested during the certification of Joe Biden win on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nRegarding the other matter, Trump signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose work with the Democrat-aligned law firm Perkins Coie. The firm is known for promoting the discredited Steele dossier that alleged Trump was a Russian agent. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, a Barack Obama appointee, temporarily blocked the Trump order in response to a Perkins Coie lawsuit.\n\nEastman, former dean of the Chapman University School of Law, said he planned to bring up the arguments by Perkins Coie and Democrat attorneys general in his hearing next week, calling the proximity of the two cases almost like a script.\n\nEastman stressed the lawfare against lawyers for Trump violates the First Amendment and will have an obvious chilling effect on lawyers in future politically-charged cases.\n\n“I am hopeful that judges can apply the law in an impartial way separate and apart from their personal or political prejudices,” said Eastman, the founding director of the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence.\n\nThe 65 Project’s targeting of 111 Trump-aligned lawyers across the country who challenged the 2020 election outcome had mixed success.\n\n“It was a concerted effort from lawfare groups, a nationwide conspiracy to deprive lawyers for Donald Trump of their constitutional rights,” Eastman said. “That makes it federally actionable.”\n\nHe added, “I hope the new FBI director is investigating.” Trump appointed Kash Patel as the new FBI director.\n\nThe first bar hearing for Eastman began on June 20, 2023, almost a year before the initial ruling on March 27, 2024 by State Bar Court Judge Yvette Roland, who recommended Eastman’s disbarment. Roland had been a Democrat donor.\n\n“I’m not aware of any that are longer or expensive. Most bar hearings are a few days,” Eastman said.\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics, Roland as a California lawyer contributed $500 to the Obama 2008 presidential campaign, $1,250 to Obama’s 2012 campaign, and $450 to the 2010 Kamala Harris attorney general campaign. In 2022, as a judge, Roland contributed $250 to the gubernatorial campaign of Gavin Newsom, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nEastman said he spent about $1 million defending his law license.\n\nAfter the appeal division decides, the matter can go to the California Supreme Court.\n\n“If we win the appeal, that should be the end of it. But I expect the hyper partisan bar prosecutors to appeal it,” Eastman said.\n\nEastman maintains that a vice president’s role in the certification process of a president was not settled law.\n\n“Case law in California is clear that even if you think an argument is likely to lose, you are ethically obligated to make a plausible, tenable argument for your client,” Eastman said.\n\nCongress passed a bipartisan Electoral Reform Act of 2022 that included a provision specifically stating the vice president only has a ceremonial role when votes are counted. Trump said passing of the law meant the vice president previously had a role in the count.\n\n“The Constitution is not clear here. I was making a plausible argument. I think it was right,” Eastman said. “But even if it was wrong, it was tenable. To disbar someone for advancing a tenable argument is outrageous.”\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.]","summary":"Scheme by 'lawfare groups' was 'conspiracy to deprive lawyers of their constitutional rights'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/this-is-just-absolute-projection-state-poised-to-disbar-trump-2020-lawyer/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/donald-trump-flag-cpac-20250222.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 21:29:41","author":"The Daily Signal","authors":["The Daily Signal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":301226962,"title":"Amid 2028 speculation, California governor’s podcasts with Trump loyalists anger Democrats","text":"By MICHAEL R.

Ron DeSantis, whom he described as weak and pathetic, or who called the state legislature into special session last year to attempt to safeguard the state’s progressive policies under a Trump administration.\n\nIn an age of rigid partisanship, talking with the other side is “so rarely a part of public discourse it seems like either bravery or lunacy,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “While there are clear risks, he is trying to align his national reputation … in a slightly unpredictable middle.”","summary":"Podcasts have become an increasingly important venue in politics.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/03/17/california-governor-podcast/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/US_California_Governor_Podcast_11059.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 21:27:27","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.097},{"id":301223706,"title":"What to expect from the Trump-Putin call on Ukraine war","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he will likely be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, and the White House have since confirmed the call. Trump is eager to fulfill his campaign promise by making a deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine, which he has called a \"bloodbath.\" Here's what to expect and what not to expect from their conversation. Both Trump and Putin will likely remain cordial and respectful to each other, continuing to showcase their skills and talents in diplomacy. Unlike former President Biden and his VP Kamala Harris, who frequently got exasperated by Putin’s recalcitrance, calling him a \"killer,\" Trump does not insult Putin. The master of the Art of the Deal knows how to dance the waltz of diplomacy. PUTIN IN NO RUSH TO FOLLOW 'TRUMP TIME' CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL Underneath the facade, neither Trump nor Putin trust each other. Smiles and positive gestures notwithstanding, in his first term, Trump pursued the most forceful anti-Russia policy since Ronald Reagan. He authorized lethal aid to Ukraine, sanctioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, booted out Russian spies who operated out of its embassy posing as diplomats, and shut down three Russian facilities in the U.S. that effectively served as espionage operating bases targeting the homeland. Trump also took several measures to mitigate Russia’s ability to exploit vulnerabilities in America’s way of war, which is highly reliant on technology. In turn, Putin views Trump as an extremely difficult and worthy opponent, someone who is unpredictable and hard to manipulate the way the Russian dictator played previous presidents: Bush, Obama and Biden. In 2017, when asked by a journalist if he was disappointed in Trump after the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities in New York, Washington and San Francisco, Putin called the question \"naïve.\" The former KGB operative said Trump is \"not my bride, and I’m not his groom.\" In 2018, after the summit in Helsinki, Putin mocked the idea that Trump trusted him: \"You can’t trust anyone. Where did you get the idea that Trump trusts me and I fully trust him?\" Putin told journalists. \"He [Trump] defends the interests of the USA, and I of Russia.\" Indeed, feelings and emotions are simply not part of the statecraft that serious and strong heads of state use when dealing with each other, especially when it comes to Russia and the United States, both of which consider themselves exceptional great powers. When it comes to the substantive side of the Trump-Putin deal on Ukraine, there will be no breakthrough on Tuesday. But both sides will likely report positive progress with no specific details.

Putin is highly unlikely to be compelled to accept a ceasefire because he is prepared to fight until the bitter end. As President Trump recently admitted, Putin \"holds all the cards.\" Washington could and likely will apply even more severe economic pressure on Moscow, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett recently suggested. Hassett claimed that there’s \"a heck of a lot of things\" that Trump is ready to use as part of his \"carrots or sticks\" strategy to pressure Putin. But the Russians believe Team Trump are bluffing, suggesting that it’s too risky to play the cards involving global economic ramifications. The Russians think more aggressive sanctions against Russia’s energy sector would backfire, resulting in even higher prices here. Regardless, Moscow believes it can weather sanctions, as it has done thus far. Indeed, no economic sanctions have changed Putin’s behavior in the past decade. President Trump likely senses that a deal with Putin is harder to make than he thought. By making it his campaign promise, Trump might have boxed himself into an unachievable timeframe, giving Putin leverage. Trump’s Russia advisers should have laid out clearly for the commander in chief the complexity of the Russia-Ukraine issue that Washington had stepped into by pushing Ukraine into NATO in the first place. The Russian media is praising Putin’s \"six words\" message to an \"impatient\" Trump (My za mir, no est’ nyuansy, in the Russian language), referring to Putin’s recent televised statement in which he claimed that Russia is for peace, but \"there are nuances.\" On Sunday, Trump claimed that he was \"being a little bit sarcastic\" when he promised on the campaign trail to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Sunday night, speaking with journalists on Air Force One, Trump sounded more realistic and clear-eyed. \"We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,\" he said. \"Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\" If the commander in chief realizes that Putin is stringing him along, he will cancel the call and walk away. Letting Putin stew might soften him up, prompting a comeback if the Russians really want peace. The mess that President Trump inherited from Biden and the Europeans will almost certainly not be resolved in a phone call, if at all.
