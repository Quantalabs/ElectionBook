Opening your event by replacing Jesus and the disciples at the The Last Supper with men in drag,” Clint Russel, the host of the Liberty Lockdown podcast, fumed on X. “There are 2.4 billion Christians on earth and apparently the Olympics wanted to declare loudly to all of them, right out of the gate NOT WELCOME,” said Russel. During the show, a group of 18 performers struck poses behind a long table with the Seine River and Eiffel Tower poignantly placed in the background. At the center was an ornately dressed woman with a large silver headdress that resembled a halo as depicted in paintings of Jesus. She smiled and made a heart shape with her hands as her peers stared down the camera, some slowly dancing. To add to the “absurdity,” a massive serving tray was lowered onto the table — revealing a scantily dressed man, painted head to toe in sparkling blue, curled up inside. The Olympics said the performance was an “interpretation of the Greek God [of wine and festivity] Dionysus” to make “us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.” But social media users felt that the group was making fun of Christianity and even French politicians denounced the show. Practicing Catholic Marion Maréchal took to X, saying: “To all the Christians of the world who are watching the #Paris2024 ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking but a left-wing minority ready for any provocation.” Plenty of other social media users applauded the performance as historic, especially after it followed three drag queens carrying Olympic torches for the first time. Artists Minima Gesté, Miss Martini and Nicky Doll participated in the ritual as the flame passed through France in May, with each saying the moment symbolized unity and peace. Doll — the host of Drag Race France — and two other queens also appeared in the opening ceremony’s fashion/runway segment Friday. The Olympic drag performance comes just one day after Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris became the first sitting vice president to appear on an episode of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”","summary":"A massive serving tray was lowered onto the table -- revealing a scantily dressed man painted head to toe in sparkling blue curled up inside.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/sports/drag-performers-seemingly-emulate-last-supper-at-olympic-opening-ceremony/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/86091354-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F7iOH7Wk-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:53:08","author":"Katherine Donlevy","authors":["Katherine Donlevy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.115},{"id":252728694,"title":"Kamala Harris gains momentum in key states in latest poll against Donald Trump","text":"Kamala Harris has tightened the presidential race against Donald Trump in key battleground states that Joe Biden was on track to lose, new polls show. The vice president is tied with Trump in Michigan and Pennsylvania, up by six per cent in Minnesota, and down by one per cent in Wisconsin. Harris has erased the lead Trump was building in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin before Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. Voters said their top issue was the economy – by a big margin – with immigration and abortion about even as second and third, and other topics well below them. The poll by Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research conducted on July 22 to 24 for Fox News added to other polls showing the race tightening. Harris and Trump had 49 per cent of the vote each in Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Trump had 50 per cent to Harris’ 49 per cent in Wisconsin. Minnesota, a usually blue state that was increasingly in play, is back to looking out of Trump’s reach as he has 46 per cent to Harris’ 52 per cent. However, the races were head-to-head and did not take into account the effect of third-party candidates like independent Robert F Kennedy Jr. When the additional candidates are included, Harris is up by two per cent (45 to 43) in Pennsylvania and six per cent in Minnesota (47 to 41). Trump is ahead by two per cent in Michigan (45 to 43) and Wisconsin is tied at 46 per cent each. Polls before Biden dropped out had the president down between two and nine per cent in Pennsylvania, one to seven in Michigan, and about three in Wisconsin. The Fox News poll did not survey voters nationally, but others by the New York Times and a few more pollsters had Harris or Trump up by only one per cent. Harris must win Pennsylvania to have a chance of beating Trump, and likely needs Michigan and Wisconsin as well. Losing Minnesota would be a shock and mean the Democrats were in danger of suffering a landslide defeat. Twice as many voters said they cared more about the economy than any other issue, with immigration and abortion the other two key topics. Thirty-seven per cent of Wisconsin voters had the economy on top, with 15 per cent each for immigration and abortion, and in Michigan it was 35 per cent economy, 17 per cent immigration, and 16 per cent abortion. Economy was top issue for 39 per cent of Pennsylvanian voters with immigration at 16 per cent and abortion at 15 per cent. Other notable issues included healthcare, election integrity, climate change, foreign policy, crime, and guns – but all were in the mid to low single digits. Trump polls better among voters caring the most about the economy and immigration, and Harris is far better on abortion. Economy and immigration voters in Pennsylvania back Trump by 31 and 86 points respectively, while abortion voters back Harris by 67 points. Answers for Michigan were roughly the same. In Wisconsin, those prioritizing the economy and immigration backed Trump by 38 and 81 points respectively, while those putting abortion as their top issue prefer Harris by 78 points. About as many voters said they were ‘falling behind’ or ‘holding steady’ financially, both in the low 40s, and about 15 per cent were ‘getting ahead’. About three-quarters of Democrats want Harris to be the nominee with Biden gone, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro the next most popular but only getting 14 per cent of his own state to favor him. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer got 20 per cent in her home state, but her support was far lower elsewhere. Voters overwhelmingly approve of Biden’s decision to drop out and about two-thirds want him to remain president until his term ends in January. More to come.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris has tightened the presidential race against Donald Trump in key&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris gains momentum in key states in latest poll against Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-gains-momentum-in-key-states-in-latest-poll-against-donald-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-continues-incredible-surge-in-battleground.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:51:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":252729560,"title":"Autopsy shows Sonya Massey was killed by a gunshot under her eye","text":"An autopsy report released Friday by Sangamon County officials shows Springfield resident Sonya Massey was killed by a gunshot wound just under her left eye. Massey, 36, had called law enforcement to her home to report a possible intruder. Then-Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson, one of the responding officers, shot her in the head, saying he feared Massey would throw a pot of boiling water at him. Body camera footage, however, shows Massey ducking for cover behind her kitchen counter with her hands in the air before Grayson fired at her. Massey was pronounced dead just an hour after she made the 911 call. “The autopsy confirms what everybody already knows from the video,” civil rights attorney Ben Crump said at a press conference Friday. “This was just a senseless, unnecessary excessive use of force. Completely unnecessary, certainly not justified.” Crump is representing Massey’s family. Previously he represented the families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Crump said the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the shooting. A spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Justice told WBEZ the agency is “aware of and assessing the circumstances surrounding the tragic officer-involved death” and extended “condolences to her family and loved ones.” The spokesman said the DOJ will continue to track the criminal case opened by the Sangamon County State’s Attorney. Crump said he told the DOJ that they should look into Grayson’s employment history. Before joining law enforcement, Grayson had been arrested twice for driving under the influence and once for driving on a suspended license. Sangamon County was his sixth law enforcement agency in four years. Before joining the sheriff’s office, Grayson had worked for smaller, rural jurisdictions. Crump said he so far knows of two allegations of misconduct lodged against Grayson before he got a job in Springfield. Meanwhile, the Massey family said they spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris who offered her condolences. In a statement Tuesday, Harris called the killing “senseless” and footage of the shooting “disturbing.” The autopsy report released Friday shows that Massey had traces of gabapentin – a medication used to treat seizures and nerve pain – in her system, but was otherwise in good physical health. Massey’s family members said she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and was dealing with mental health issues up to her death. Her teenage son, Malachi Hill, said during Friday’s press conference he and his younger sister were living with their respective fathers while their mom sought treatment. Hill said his mom had visited St. John Hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit in Springfield for a consultation on July 5. She was shot and killed shortly after midnight on July 6. Hill, who was wearing a purple button with his mom’s name and picture on it, said he still hasn’t watched the body camera footage of the night his mother was shot. “The first night I don’t go to my mother’s house, this happens. How? Why?” Hill said. “I wonder if I was there, if he would have did anything to me. I don’t know.” Massey’s cousin, Shadia, said Massey’s daughter is having trouble sleeping. “For her to go to the bathroom, she has to be on FaceTime with me,” Massey said. “For her to get a drink of water she has to call us before she gets into her bed. No, this is the hardest thing that we have ever been through as a Massey. It just breaks my heart that our family has to go through this.” Grayson has since been fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Department, and has been arrested on three counts of first degree murder. He is being held in jail until trial, which will be set on August 26th. On Friday evening in Chicago, about a dozen people gathered in the South Shore neighborhood to protest Massey’s death. Chants of “Say her name” and “Sonya Massey” rung out across 71st Street near Bennett Avenue. Wiping away tears, Gloria Pinex said Massey’s killing brought back painful memories of her son Darius Pinex’s 2011 death at the hands of Chicago police. “It’s a shame that we out here once again,” Pinex said addressing the crowd. “It just hurts, brings tears to my eyes thinking about what she was going through, what she was thinking. I’m angry and I’m hurt all at the same time all over again.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/07/26/autopsy-shows-sonya-massey-was-killed-by-a-gunshot-under-her-eye","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09e7b31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F60%2F98%2F67aaee704343b6a32801c0b0147f%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:47:08","author":"Mary Norkol,Mawa Iqbal","authors":["Mary Norkol","Mawa Iqbal"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":252728482,"title":"How Dems staged coup after coup — skirting democracy to hold power","text":"In March 2020, all the major Democratic primary candidates abruptly, mysteriously and in near unison withdrew from the presidential race, ceding the nomination to Joe Biden. Yet Biden had lost the first three races in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada — and only won his first victory in South Carolina. Suddenly, on the eve of the Super Tuesday mega-primaries, the candidacies of front-runner Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and others simply evaporated. The fear of a frontrunner Sanders’ socialist victory and nomination — and thus an enviable landslide loss to incumbent Donald Trump in the general election — had prompted the donor class and shadowy political insiders to act. And they did so by choosing a perceived moderate, old Joe Biden from Scranton. That required the coerced departures of all his far-left rivals, who had hitherto performed much better than Biden in the primaries. Biden still displayed obvious symptoms of serious cognitive decline that had only seemed to mount through the 2020 campaign. And his dementia continued to accelerate during his first three years as president. Biden had deceitfully promised to conduct a healing campaign and a unifying presidency. But once in the White House, his extreme agendas proved the most divisive and far-left in nearly a century. Rumors of that prior March 2020 Faustian bargain emerged. The Bidens got to serve as useful moderate veneers. So, they enjoyed the ceremonial functions of the presidency while outsourcing the real operations to former Obama officials, consultants and advisers. Indeed, Barack Obama did not, as most ex-presidents do, exit Washington upon leaving the White House. Instead, he bought a mansion and stayed close by. Democrats demonized anyone critical of Biden’s obvious mental decline. Their smearing crested during Biden’s now-aborted 2024 reelection bid, even as Biden could no longer display even a veneer of mental and physical engagement. Polls revealed an impending Trump landslide victory in November — and a massive Democratic loss of Congress. So suddenly on a Sunday, July 21 — on the eve of the Democratic convention — party bosses, mega-donors and Obama puppeteers went into action for yet a third time. They reportedly threatened candidate Biden with a complete loss of any further campaign funding and raised the specter of invoking the 25th Amendment to end his presidency — should he not suddenly withdraw from the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as his surrogate on the ticket. In one moment, the choices of nearly 15 million Biden primary voters were vitiated. No delegates were consulted. No other alternative Democrat candidates were even considered. Biden was dethroned; Harris was coronated — without much public input or even knowledge of how or why. Democratic grandees stopped smearing Biden’s conservative critics, who had worried over his dementia. Instead, they now trumped opposition criticism of Biden’s decline. Yet Biden most certainly did not resign his presidency. Instead, he promised to serve out his remaining six months in office. So Democratic insiders not only removed their leading candidate, who in the prior six months had won all the 2024 primaries and almost all the delegates, but insisted that Biden keep Democrats and himself in power — but only if he agreed to quit the race. In sum, at the 11th hour of a two-year reelection effort, a cabal arbitrarily decided that Biden might well lose the Democrats the White House and the Congress. So they reversed course, now claiming his dementia was so acute as to destroy their November prospects. But, mysteriously, his decline was not severe enough to imperil the American people, whom Biden must continue to lead until January 20, 2025. Furthermore, the bosses’ replacement choice, Harris, had entered no primary. She never won a single delegate. Harris also never captured a single delegate in her first and only presidential run back in 2020. She dropped out of the race even before the first Iowa and New Hampshire balloting. We have now witnessed three left-wing veritable coups. In 2020, covert actors decided to ossify the Democratic primary races. Next, they conferred the nomination on a clearly cognitively challenged Biden. He was now tasked with serving as a useful moderate vessel for a virtual, even more radical, Obama third term. The same operators next assumed virtual control of Biden’s presidential agenda, given his accelerating cognitive decline. When that charade could no longer be sustained, for a third time, they circumvented the normal transparent democratic process. So, they removed the once-useful, but now a liability, Biden — while insisting that he was still fit enough to keep the left in power — until the anticipated Harris victory in November. And all of this was the shadowwork of those who sanctimoniously lectured America that “democracy dies in darkness.”","summary":"In March 2020, all the major Democratic primary candidates abruptly, mysteriously and in near unison withdrew from the presidential race, ceding the nomination to Joe Biden.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/opinion/how-dems-staged-coup-after-coup-skirting-democracy-to-hold-power/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-7g8bbsak4-1722034375001.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722020023&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:46:35","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":252728480,"title":"Sexist social media posts from Kamala Harris’ new senior campaign adviser resurface: ‘Know her place’","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly hired senior campaign adviser has a long history of online posts mocking women and gay people. Kamau Marshall, who was hired by the Harris campaign earlier this week, issued an apology in 2020 for his offensive posts and in has reportedly undertaken a digital purge in recent days. “Even though I like a power woman…I need her to know her place…Meaning I where [sic] the #pants…ight,” Marshall tweeted on Dec. 24, 2011. In another 2011 post on what is now known as X, he wrote, “As long as my woman looks good & turns me on..she pretty much can have whatever she wants from me.” “Are all women crazy???? Lol no offense ijs [I’m just saying],” Marshall tweeted in 2012. Later that year, he argued that “Nice guys finish last because they make sure their girl comes first.” Then, in August of 2013, Marshall tweeted that it was “unattractive when a girl doesn’t act classy & does not know how to control her feelings.” That post followed this 2012 Twitter declaration: “I only look & talk to CLASSY Women.” Fox News first reported on Marshall’s questionable tweets back in 2020, noting that he subsequently deleted many of the offensive posts. The social media analytics website Social Blade shows that Marshall has deleted more than 2,200 tweets since Tuesday. Fox News noted that Marshall also frequently used a gay slur in social media posts. “Wood wakes everybody up…no homo but to many memories #hazing is bad smdh lmao,” he wrote in 2010. The Harris campaign adviser also suggested that men who spend a lot of time around women want to be female. “Bro if u see a guy around women all day more than likely he wants to be 1 or he is very fem #Imjustsaying,” Marshall tweeted. His new boss also seemingly drew his ire back in 2019, after a Democratic primary debate, leading Marshall to tweet, “Dear Black people: Don’t be black when it’s convenient. Be black 3365/24-7. Period. Sincerely, a black man.” The post was highlighted by a reporter from The Atlantic at the time and then deleted by Marshall. The career communications strategist previously served as Joe Biden’s strategic communications director in 2020 and as a senior adviser to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “As someone who values and respects women, it has never been or will ever be my intent to disrespect women. Period,” Marshall said in an apology issued in 2020, according to Fox News. “However, I sincerely apologize to those who could have misread it or don’t know me personally and who it may have offended.” The Post has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.","summary":"Kamau Marshall, who was hired by the Harris campaign earlier this week, issued an apology in 2020 for his offensive posts and in recent days has undertaken a digital purge. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/us-news/sexist-posts-from-kamala-harris-new-senior-campaign-adviser-kamau-marshall-resurface/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/sexist-social-media-posts-kamala-86088193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F7iOH7Wk-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:46:34","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.589},{"id":252729244,"title":"Silent No More, Harris Seeks Her Own Voice Without Breaking With Biden","text":"After meeting with Israel’s prime minister this week, Vice President Kamala Harris said she “will not be silent.” She was referring to her concerns about Palestinian suffering in the Gaza war, but in a way it was a larger declaration of independence.

Now she has suddenly been thrust to the fore as the new presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and neither silence nor agreeable head nods are sufficient any more. The challenge for her over the next 100 days will be to find her own voice without overtly breaking with Mr. Biden, a delicate political high-wire act without a reliable net. Every statement she makes, every sentence she utters, will be scrutinized to determine whether it is consistent with the president she serves. Yet even as she wants to demonstrate loyalty to Mr. Biden, she also hopes to show the public who she is. She is fortunate in that she and Mr. Biden do not diverge all that much, according to people who have worked with them. While friction between presidents and their vice presidents is common, there have been few notable instances where Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have been reported to be at odds.

The DFL raised over $200,000 in the two days after Harris threw her hat in the ring when President Joe Biden withdrew from the race earlier this month. The Harris campaign raised $126 million nationally in three days. The increased cash was also accompanied by a record-breaking 600 new volunteers, something that is directly tied to Harris’ name on the ticket, according to DFL Chair Ken Martin. “The energy not only is palpable, it’s just off the charts,” Martin said. The fresh batch of volunteers is largely comprised of people new to campaigning who want to elect the first woman president, Martin said. “With just 100 days left (until the election), it’s just a remarkable difference, to be honest with you, on where we were just a week ago,” he said. The excitement Democrats have over Harris as their nominee is especially intensified in Minnesota, where speculation over Gov. Tim Walz as a potential vice presidential candidate has been the talk of the town. While Walz has largely acted as a surrogate for a Harris presidency run, he did tell Minnesota Public Radio News that he is open to the idea of being her running mate. However, a spokesperson for the Walz administration said that his focus is on his current job. “The governor is excited that Minnesota is receiving national attention for passing a historic legislative agenda. While he plans to do everything he can to defeat Donald Trump in November, he remains focused on his job as governor,” the spokesperson said. Walz has garnered some support for a potential run as vice president, most notably from U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, who endorsed him on the social media site X on Wednesday. A Harris-Walz ticket would draw a good comparison to the Republican ticket, Martin said, adding that this year is an existential election and Harris represents “the future of not only the Democratic Party, but the future of America.” Former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, became the Republican nominees just before Biden decided to drop out of the race. While the Harris campaign has requested vetting material from Walz, they have also asked for material from several other possible picks who either have a higher national presence, like Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, or from governors in states considered more at risk to flip Republican, like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. At this point, who Harris will pick to join her ticket is speculation, but Democrats are likely to hold a virtual call to select a presidential nominee next week, which would likely follow with an endorsement for vice president. The fact that polls in Minnesota have shown a tight race means that Harris will have to find a way to shore up those votes in a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972, says Paul Gazelka, a longtime Republican legislator who was the Senate majority leader from 2017 to 2021. “You have a lot of folks in Minnesota in the middle,” he said. “They’re just common folks that want their government to work and they don’t like extremes. Not extreme left, not extreme right.” Some of the decisions Walz has made as governor, like how he handled the George Floyd uprising in 2020, or the millions of dollars in fraud with government programs under his watch, may be liabilities for him as a national candidate, Gazelka said. “I would definitely be somebody to point out some of his weaknesses, but from Harris’ vantage point, I’m not so sure she would consider some of those (to be) weaknesses,” he said. Martin listed marks in Walz’s favor as a VP running mate, including Walz’s prior military service and work as a teacher, coach, 12-year congressional member and two-term governor. “Most importantly … is the fact that he has gotten a lot done for Minnesota in his time as governor, and I think he’s got a great record of success to share with the American people of how he’s governed the state,” Martin said. Walz has received praise from supporters, both in the state and nationally, for more progressive legislation passed in the state, which includes free breakfast and lunches for school children and solidifying the right to an abortion in the state. “I think (Walz) can talk about these things in a very folksy way in terms of his populist agenda,” Martin said.","summary":"The DFL raised over $200,000 in the two days after Harris threw her hat in the ring when President Joe Biden withdrew from the race.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/07/26/minnesota-dfl-sees-surge-of-volunteers-and-cash-after-kamala-harris-announces-presidential-run/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/US-NEWS-TRUMP-HARRIS-FEC-COMPLAINT-GET.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:42:05","author":"Mark Wasson","authors":["Mark Wasson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":252728176,"title":"Why Trump VP pick J.D. Vance is dogged by couch sex memes – and struggling in general","text":"Nearly two weeks after former US president Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance to be his running mate, it is safe to say the Ohio senator is struggling. His polling is the worst of any non-incumbent vice presidential nominee in decades. His years-old comments about “childless cat ladies” have drawn widespread disgust. Some in Trump’s orbit worry they have made the wrong choice. In recent days, he has been the target of a baseless rumour that he once had sex with a couch. It was always clear that Vance brought little to the table, strictly electorally speaking. He does not represent a swing state, he does not diversify the ticket, and the selection of a MAGA true believer does not reassure more Trump-sceptic voters. He was the choice of a campaign that was brimming with confidence. US President Joe Biden had not yet dropped out of the race, and Trump’s team probably made the choice with the idea that they did not need the boost that other vice-presidential contenders could have brought to the ticket, choosing instead to select an heir to the Make America Great Again movement. What was less predictable was the significant headwinds that Vance is now encountering as the Republican Party’s vice-presidential candidate, which have been driven by the way he has talked about certain policies and enabled by the simple fact that most Americans are just now learning who he is. Did the Associated Press retract its fact-check article denying JD Vance had sex with a couch? pic.twitter.com/P4nI6mqd4o — Jacob Shamsian ⚖️ (@JayShams) July 25, 2024 According to an AP-NORC poll conducted in the days before Vance was selected, 60 per cent of Americans said they did not know enough about the Ohio senator to have an opinion about him. Twenty-two per cent had an unfavourable opinion, while just 17 per cent had a favourable opinion. That lack of familiarity is a key reason that the memes about Vance having sex with a couch have taken off. To be clear, there is no evidence that ever happened. The meme began with a single X user joking that the Ohio senator wrote about it on pages 179 to 181 of his 2016 autobiography Hillbilly Elegy, which is patently and verifiably false. But then, Associated Press decided to fact-check the claim before deleting their story, amplifying it further. By Thursday, social media was awash with memes riffing on the notion that Trump’s vice-presidential nominee had once fornicated with a couch. One Democratic congressman even referenced it during a CNN interview that evening. When voters don’t know much about a candidate, stories like this initially appear plausible. Even after they are debunked, they can persist. In Vance’s case, the meme seems to be an ironic stand-in for other issues that voters may have with the Ohio senator, even if they know he probably did not have sex with a couch. A lesser-known candidate is also an easier target for their political opponents, especially if they come armed with all of the most controversial things that the candidate said in the past. In a way, Vance is running into the same problem that Blake Masters – a former US Senate candidate who is ideologically aligned with the Ohio senator – encountered in his 2022 race in Arizona: people are being alienated by what he has to say. This week, it’s his comments about childless people. Next week, it could be something else: Trump’s VP has an extensive online footprint. In this instance, Vance is taking aim at childlessness because he subscribes to a more idiosyncratic, nationalist vision of conservatism than most other Republican politicians, and he is interested in ways to encourage the growth of families. He has suggested incentivising that growth by allocating additional votes to parents based on the number of children they have, or by taxing childless adults at a higher rate than parents – a policy that is somewhat similar to a child tax credit. But those ideas, and that framing, are somewhat alien to the broader public. Then, you throw in the disparaging way that he talked about certain Democratic politicians – including US Vice-President Kamala Harris – as “childless cat ladies” in a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson. JD Vance responds to the backlash to his “childless cat ladies” comment by apologizing to cats and then doubling down on attacking women: “I’m sorry, it’s true” pic.twitter.com/JZjqZJOp5y — Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) July 26, 2024 Vance made that comment shortly after he launched his Senate campaign, where he was working to distinguish himself in a crowded field of Republicans. In short, his audience was not the general public, but Republican primary voters. Yet that sort of flippant comment makes an already unknown candidate really easy to define in the context of a national campaign. During an interview on Megyn Kelly’s radio show on Friday, Vance insisted that he was referring solely to those politicians, not to Americans who are unable to have children. But the damage had already been done. “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats, I’ve got nothing against dogs,” Vance said. “People are focusing so much on the sarcasm, and not on the substance of what I actually said. And the substance of what I said Megyn, I’m sorry, it’s true.” Originally published on Business Insider","summary":"The Ohio senator and Hillbilly Elegy author faces the worst polling of any non-incumbent US vice-presidential nominee in decades.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272102/why-trump-vp-pick-jd-vance-dogged-couch-sex-memes-and-struggling-general","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/27/a0b2bf9b-bdbf-49bd-b4e9-6eea5ed08a4f_7cd83134.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/18/web%20video2.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:30:31","author":"Business Insider","authors":["Business Insider"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.443},{"id":252727808,"title":"Ben Shapiro Bets Donald Trump Regrets Picking J.D.

Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) indicated he doesn’t hold a high opinion of former President Donald Trump’s choice of a running mate during an interview with a top Democratic strategist. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) has faced a chorus of criticism since he was tapped to be Trump’s running mate. During an interview with David Axelrod released Thursday, Crenshaw voiced his own rebuke to the vice presidential candidate. Crenshaw questioned whether someone who once called Trump Hitler should be the GOP leader’s vice president. The comment was in reference to a 2016 text Vance sent to a friend that read, “I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a**hole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s America’s Hitler.” Vance has since clarified that he’s changed his mind. “It’s an interesting choice,” Crenshaw began before he referenced Vance’s controversial comment. “You know, Trump almost got assassinated recently, as we all know. I think it’s logical to say that rhetoric can lead to making crazy people even crazier. And calling Trump Hitler? What do you do with Hitler? You should kill him,” the Texan said on the Axe Files with David Axelrod. “Wait a second; J.D. Vance calls him that,” Axelrod interrupted. “That’s my point,” Crenshaw retorted. “I don’t understand it because I think he meant it at the time. So I think that’s concerning.” After the former president survived an assassination attempt, some Republicans speculated that Trump-Hitler comparisons from public figures such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), comedian Kathy Griffin, and actor Robert DeNiro fueled the political violence. “Democrats and liberals in the media have called Trump a fascist. They’ve compared him to Hitler,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said in a post to X following the assassination attempt. “This isn’t some unfortunate incident. This was an assassination attempt by a madman inspired by the rhetoric of the radical left.” Some Republicans have also voiced concerns over Trump’s selection of Vance since he doesn’t provide much electoral benefit or balance to the ticket. “He was the worst choice of all the options. It was so bad I didn’t even think it was possible,” one House Republican told the Hill. “Anti-Ukraine, more of a populist. He adds nothing to the Trump ticket. He energizes the same people that love Trump.” Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren also called the pick a “bad move,” warning that his past comments, particularly calling some in the Democratic Party “childless cat ladies,” will alienate suburban women. Trump and other Republicans, however, have remained steadfast in their support of Vance on the ticket. When asked if he would pick Vance again now that Harris has become the likely Democratic nominee, Trump said “No, I would do the same thing. He’s doing really well. He’s really caught on.”","summary":"Rep.

Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, defended his 2021 comments accusing Democratic leaders - including Vice President Kamala Harris - of being “childless cat ladies” who “want to make the rest of the country miserable.” Vance, 39, made the comments in a July 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. It resurfaced on social media after Trump chose the Ohio Republican as his vice presidential running mate. On Friday, July 26, Vance told Megyn Kelly he stands by the comments he made while he was running to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. “Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats,” Vance said on The Megyn Kelly Show on Sirius XM. “I know the media wants to attack me and wants me to back down, Megyn, but the simple point that I made is that having children — becoming a father, becoming a mother — I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way.” Vance went on to claim that Democrats have “become anti-family” over the past five to 10 years. “It’s built into their policies, it’s built into the way they talk about parents and children, and it’s time that we called that out,” Vance told Kelly, 53. “It’s not a criticism of people who don’t have children. I explicitly said in my remarks,” Vance continued. “This is not about criticizing people who for various reasons don’t have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.” \"What I was basically saying is that we're effectively run in this country — via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs — by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives in the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance told Carlson in 2021, referencing a speech he made earlier in that year. \"It's just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance continued. \"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Pritzker, an earlier Joe Biden exit could have been just the ticket","text":"Sneed on Sunday … It would makes quite a political movie script. “A Clear and Present Danger” drama. Sneed is told an aging President Joe Biden was actually warned a year and a half ago by a top top Dem pollster that his re-election was in the doghouse with young voters. His age was going to be a killer. The handwriting was on the wall. Stunning in-house Dem polling was raising alarms within the party hierarchy. “Joe” was old and in trouble with Gen Z; the Millennials; and ostensibly those approaching voting age. The only American president produced during the “Silent Generation: 1941-1945,” (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were born in 1946) Joe Biden was listening, but resisting this Clarion call. And powerful Dem kingpins were praying he’d pull out in advance of the primaries to allow the selection of someone new to showcase, said a top Dem Sneed source. Enter popular Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a major Biden backer well aware of Biden’s falling polling numbers, a powerful pol with megabucks who long harbored a desire to seek the presidency himself. And he was being urged by powerful supporters to run in a primary in case the elderly Biden pulled the plug. Ka-ching: Pritzker knew he would have an advantage over most opponents because he had the $3.5 billion fortune to fund a major primary campaign in the blink of an eye. But Biden did not pull out until it was this/close — and too late. And when Biden finally pulled out of the 2024 presidential sweepstakes last Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris suddenly stoked such powerful political thunder it was akin to the wind of a Zephyr on the Dakota prairie. Instrumental last year in snagging Chicago as the site of Democratic National Convention, Pritzker saw his POTUS podium gone with the wind. Still a Dem powerhouse, Pritzker is now on board big time to support Harris — and is a member of the veep sweepstakes hoping to make the cut as her running mate. If Harris, 59, loses her POTUS bid, Pritzker, 59. has four years to wait to run for president. If Harris wins in November, Pritzker could have an eight-year wait to run for the nation’s top job. Patience. The Tangerine Man Cometh … It’s no secret Donald “I’m not going to be nice” Trump has vowed to prosecute and/or persecute his “enemies” to the hilt if he wins back the White House. So I pose this question.

It’s no secret Trump pardoned pals and political allies when he had the chance. Will Joe?

His words, captured on video, have recently resurfaced due to their eerie similarity to current events. Ford was speaking to students at a conference in Iowa about the role of former presidents. A young student asked him what advice he'd give a girl who wanted to become president. Ford's response was both surprising and specific. \"I hope we do have a young lady at some point become President of the United States,\" Ford began. He then outlined how he thought it would happen: \"Either the Republican or Democrat political party will nominate a man for President and a woman for Vice President, and the woman and man will win. So you'll end up with a President, a male, and a Vice President, a female,\" as per The News. This part of Ford's prediction came true in 2021 as Joe Biden became president and Kamala Harris became the first female vice president. But Ford didn't stop there. He continued: \"And in that term of office of the President, the President will die. And the woman will become President under the law or Constitution.\" President Biden didn't die but he recently dropped out of the 2024 presidential race. He said it was because of health concerns and the need for fresh younger voices. This surprise move might mean Vice President Harris could be the next Democratic nominee. Ford's prediction gets even more intriguing. He added, \"And once that barrier is broken, from then on, men better be careful, because they'll have a hard, hard time ever even getting a nomination in the future,\" as per The Boing Boing. Ford’s path to the presidency was kind of unique too. He never actually won a general election for president or vice president. He became vice president in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned. Then when President Richard Nixon resigned, Ford stepped up and became president. Ford's prediction didn't come true as quickly as he thought. He told the students it would happen \"in the next four or eight years.\" It's been 35 years, and America still hasn't had a female president. The old video of Ford predicting the future has got people talking about how American politics has changed. He might have gotten the timing wrong, but his idea about the path to America's first female president could still come true. Vice President Harris is now set to possibly become the first woman president but unlike Ford's prediction, she has to win an election for it. Harris has got enough Democratic delegates to win her party's nomination but it still needs to be made official. She's going to face Republican nominee Donald Trump in the November election.","summary":"&#34;I hope we do have a young lady at some point become President of the United States,&#34; Ford began.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is emerging as an asset who could help counter one of Harris’s biggest weaknesses: the administration’s handling of the border crisis. Sources have confirmed Kelly is being vetted by Harris’s team. A former Navy pilot and NASA astronaut from a working-class family in New Jersey, the Arizona senator already has a strong resume made even more impactful by his powerful advocacy against gun violence after his wife, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, survived an assassination attempt during a mass shooting in 2011. However, it’s his expertise on the politics of the U.S.-Mexico border as the senator of a battleground state that shares several border crossings with Mexico that could be one of his largest strengths. “Having someone who understands how important it is for us to get technology and hire more Border Patrol officers and do better, quicker vetting — all of those things Sen. Kelly understands at the most personal levels. This is his community,” Stacy Pearson, an Arizona Democratic strategist based in Phoenix, said. Republicans are already putting a plan in motion to remind voters that Biden tapped Harris to lead the administration’s response to the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S. border in March 2021. The border crossings eventually became a major political liability for the Biden administration once they reached historic levels. The House voted to condemn Harris on Thursday for her role as the “border czar” over the Biden administration’s “failure to secure the southern border” during record-high illegal immigration. Lawmakers voted 220-196 in favor of a resolution, as GOP lawmakers work to tie the vice president to some of the Biden administration’s most unpopular policies as she seeks the presidency. Republicans are also resurfacing comments Harris made last cycle when she said that an illegal immigrant is not a criminal offense, a point she echoed during a 2019 primary debate when she raised her hand to support decriminalizing illegal border crossings to a civil infraction. However, Kelly could provide a perspective on the border that the other Democratic candidates being considered for the vice presidential slot could not — a fact that even some of the state’s Republicans acknowledge. “He’s been very very engaged with the sheriffs out here and with me on the issue of the border,” said David Rhodes, the sheriff of Yavapai County, who is a Republican. “I would say he has advocated for more border security, more resources — he’s been a supporter of public safety. He and I are in different parties, but he’s done very well as far as I can tell.” While Yavapai County encompasses an area in the center of the Grand Canyon State that is not directly on the border, Rhodes emphasizes that his community is directly affected by the high levels of unauthorized migration. “Half of the fentanyl seized in the entire nation for the last three years has been seized right here in the state of Arizona, and it’s a major problem for all these Northern Arizona counties,” he explained. Kelly has spoken out against some of the Biden administration’s border policies, particularly during his 2022 Senate campaign. The Arizona senator slammed Biden’s decision to end Title 42, a pandemic-era policy instituted during the Trump administration that allowed officials to turn away immigrants in the name of public health. The move had curtailed immigrants’ ability to seek asylum at the southern border. “The administration has at times made some decisions that are not helpful to Arizona. I call the president out on it,” Kelly said in an interview with the Washington Examiner in October 2022 ahead of a campaign stop in Yuma, a city near the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly, who resides in Tucson, a town that is only 60 miles away from the international border, has not been as critical of Biden’s border policies since his re-election campaign. Kelly came out in support of Biden’s plan in June when the administration rolled out asylum restrictions at the border, and ever since arrests for illegal crossings have decreased. “Senator Kelly is a big voice in Washington, and he’s well known here in Arizona, and he certainly could be influential the more that he spoke out about it,” Rhodes said. “To be fair, he has worked behind the scenes. I know because we’ve had conversations; he’s had a lot of conversations with law enforcement about what was needed and whatnot, but he probably could be more helpful.” Since Biden made his exit and endorsed Harris, the vice president has not spoken out about the crisis on the southern border and her role on immigration policy, which is now in the spotlight. Speaking with the Washington Examiner on Thursday, Kelly said he’d encourage Harris to remind voters of a bipartisan compromise bill that Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and officials from the White House out together in February, but ultimately died under political pressure from Trump. “I’ve spoken with the administration, about the border, a number of times and helped develop the legislation,” Kelly said. “We put forward the bipartisan legislation that would go a good ways to try and fix this border crisis. Unfortunately, you know, what happened was our Republican colleagues walked away from it and it had so many good things in there.” “When Kamala Harris is the next president of the United States, you know, we are going to take a look at passing legislation again and we’re not going to have the issue of the former President trying to kill it in the United States Senate ahead of time,” Kelly added. Arizona Democrats are firmly behind Kelly. The state party’s executive board on Wednesday endorsed Kelly to be the vice presidential nominee. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), who is running for Arizona’s other Senate seat, which is being vacated by Sinema also made the case for Kelly, saying he would add a “jolt” to the ticket. “I think it would be great for Democrats across the country to have someone who is a border state senator, understands border issues, is an astronaut married to Gabby Giffords, it’s all a good combination right there,” Gallego said, speaking to CNN on Wednesday. A new YouGov poll published on Monday showed voters viewed Trump as better than Harris at handling immigration and was ahead by 15 points. The poll was completed in the days ahead of Biden’s announcement to step down. Immigration also topped polling consistently as a top problem facing the country. “Republicans should only be talking about the border and the economy — those are the two weakest issues for Democrats,” Barrett Marson, a longtime Republican strategist in Arizona, said. “The images of immigrants crossing the border not that long ago, these are going to be used a lot over the next three or four months.” “The border is a deep vulnerability for the Democratic ticket, whether Mark Kelly is in it or not,” Marson added. “Mark Kelly can speak a bit more intelligently and with some experience of being a senator of a border state, but I’m not sure that he’s been a hawk on the border. So this issue isn’t going away. Kelly has long had an appeal with Republicans and has been seen as more centrist in a state where the Republican Party is still divided between those who align behind the legacy of the late Sen. John McCain and Trump loyalists. His seat once belonged to the iconic senator and he brought it up often when campaigning last cycle. “It has been the honor of my life to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate, and by the way, in John McCain’s senate seat. That’s a big deal for me. Here’s a guy I looked up to when I was first in the Navy. To be able to sit at his desk every day in Washington is a big deal for me,” Kelly said to voters at a campaign stop in October 2022. Kelly has already gone up a candidate cut in the same mold as GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) in his previous Senate challenger, Blake Masters. Both Vance and Masters won their primary elections in 2022 with the backing of billionaire Peter Thiel, who put tens of millions of dollars into super PACs for each candidate. Vance is a former employee of Thiel’s Mithril Capital, and Masters also ran the Thiel Foundation and served as the COO at Thiel Capital. “A benefit of Kelly is he has within the last couple years has defeated a Vance-like MAGA candidate. Masters and Vance are kind of the same,” Marson said. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Kelly’s wife, Giffords, is already getting a head start going on offense against Vance who has recently been at the center of a firestorm over his resurfaced remarks that the country was being run by “childless cat ladies.” Giffords spoke out on social media, slamming his comments. Giffords and Kelly have previously opened up about their heartbreak at not having children after the 2011 shooting where she almost lost her life. “Vice President @KamalaHarris is a proud mom of two remarkable stepchildren—and so am I,” Giffords wrote on X. “@CaptMarkKelly and I were trying to have a baby through IVF before I was shot and that dream was stolen from us.

Kerstin, who shares son, Cole, 29, and daughter Ella, 25, with Doug, released a statement slamming Vance’s 2021 comments branding Harris and several other female public figures as, “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin fired back in a statement to CNN. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it,” she said. “Friends” star, Jennifer Aniston, 55, also weighed in on the comment, telling Vance, “I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Vance addressed his cat lady comment in an interview with Megyn Kelly on Friday. He told the conservative host the message was for the “childless left.” “I know the media wants to attack me and wants me to back down on this, Megyn, but the simple point I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother… I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way,” he said. A “White Women for Harris” call this week that brought in 100,000 people — including Maria Shriver, Pink and Connie Britton — crashed Zoom. An earlier “Black Women for Harris” Zoom session inspired the subsequent calls, which also included “A Black Men for Harris” virtual fundraiser. Don Lemon attended, and he also spoke at the Black Gay and Queer Men for Harris call, which was organized by Emil Wilbekin, Alphonso David, and Rashad Robinson. The calls have raised millions for Harris’ campaign, and Michael Skolnik is organizing a “White Dudes for Harris” call on Monday. “We up next,” he wrote on X. Meanwhile, Doug wants Harris to get some rest. He ended his call by telling the men, “I’m going to go upstairs, give her a big hug, and say, ‘Go get some rest honey, because we got about 102-ish days left to save our country!”","summary":"The second gentleman was a guest of honor at a \"Black Gay and Queer Men for Harris\" virtual meeting.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/07/26/gossip/doug-emhoffs-ex-wife-kerstin-is-in-the-fight-with-kamala-harris-he-says/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/86071490.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 23:08:32","author":"Carlos Greer","authors":["Carlos Greer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08},{"id":252726966,"title":"Ben Shapiro Bets Donald Trump Regrets Picking J.D.

Walz is being vetted as a possible vice presidential candidate for the Democratic ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris is a credit to him, as head of the national group of Democratic governors, and the state. But he’s the wrong Minnesotan. It ought to be Dean Phillips. The Third District member of Congress, retiring after three terms, had the courage to run a lonely campaign against President Biden in the primaries. While quite unsuccessful, he had the prescience to question the mental acuity and physical fitness of President Biden while nearly everyone else in the administration, media and outside of MAGA world were saying “nothing to see here,” denying or ignoring the warning signs that ultimately surfaced in the debate and led to his withdrawal from the race. The prescience of Phillips, in addition to his fortitude, warrants consideration for second spot on the Democratic ticket. Phillips would also bring some solid credentials to the race. As one of the 62 members of the bipartisan Congressional “problem solvers,” he has a moderate streak that may appeal to that sliver of Republicans and larger number of independents who might be inclined to vote for a Harris-Phillips ticket. He has shown he can attract those segments of the electorate by flipping a red district that had not elected a Democrat for more than 50 years and resoundingly winning there two more times. His business background also helps tamper down actual and perceived liberalism at the top of the ticket and could help in the key battleground states in the Midwest, including Minnesota, which now has been catapulted into that category. Phillips has not been mentioned as a veep candidate and, unfortunately, probably will not be favored by the elites who run the party. But he ought to be given serious consideration if the Democrats can continue to get and keep their act together. Marshall H. Tanick, Minneapolis Just the way it is If the last couple of years have taught us anything, it is that as Americans (politicians in particular), it is our God-given right to disparage, trash talk, bad mouth, belittle and discredit our opponents. This will last as long as they are rivals. The minute they become the victor, they are now our hero, better than sliced bread. They are no longer the pond scum they were just a day ago. Now they are your best friend (you hope). That’s just the way it is. Teresa Hafele, Forest Lake They hid the truth I find it hypocritical and abhorrent that the Democratic Party with the media’s help covered up Biden’s cognitive ability to perform and lead for at least the past two years. They were running a candidate who they knew was not able to serve the country. Only since Trump and Biden’s public debate, when Biden showed he was not able to lead, did the Democrats leak the truth through the media that they had been hiding, and pressured him to step down, as they felt he could not win. They did not do this for the good of the country; they thought they might lose their majority in the Senate, and ultimately their seats in the future and ultimately their power. They were elected to represent the best interest of the citizens that elected them. If they loved and cared about the United States they would not have lied for the past several years, putting the United States in jeopardy, here and abroad. Their behavior has been reckless, dangerous, and shameful. Think about this in the voting booth. Also, think about who has actually been running this country during Biden’s term. It certainly has not been Biden on his own. Vicky Moore, North Saint Paul Make your vote count I was shocked and energized at the same time to learn that President Joe Biden had decided to not seek reelection. Shocked in the sense that, I didn’t see this coming just three months before election. And shocked because he’s a great leader and I felt like he was being pushed out by those calling him to step down. I am grateful that the president is a selfless leader who has shown his commitment, courage, integrity and sacrifice to do the right thing for the people. As much as I was shocked, I was also encouraged and energized. I have been secretly hoping, praying and wishing for someone younger to step up, someone between ages 35 and 60. There’s been some obsession of some older men wanting to control women’s bodies and some wanting to be president for a while now. I’ve had enough of it. I don’t have anything against those over 60, or men for that matter, I believe times have changed, we need to adhere to the changing times as well as know that women know their bodies better. It’s time for the younger generation to take responsibility to lead in all aspects of government and beyond. This is our chance to fight for democracy, and make sure we do everything possible to protect our democracy because if we lose it, we will not see it again in our lifetime. Like many voters I wasn’t too excited for a rematch of 2020 but I was going to vote for President Biden. With this new shift, the little time we have, I am once again excited and eager to talk politics, because we have a clear choice. I encourage everyone to take this opportunity, mobilize and make your vote count as there’s so much at stake in this election. I am hoping that the Vice President gets the nomination. She has my support. Carren LaBrasseur, St. Paul","summary":"\"Rumors are Gov. Walz is being vetted.

Speaking of Wisconsin, Harris had her first rally there on Tuesday, and the response from attendees was so huge, it had to be moved to a larger venue. Voter registrations spiked 700% on Vote.org in the first 48 hours of the campaign, led by a massive surge in young voters. Harris got three more big endorsements, from Democratic congressional leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer on Tuesday, and the week was capped off by the most exciting endorsement (after President Joe Biden’s) from former president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama. More national labor groups pledged their support to Harris, including “educators, construction workers, health care professionals, farmworkers, postal workers, service and public employees, as well as workers in communications, hospitality, nursing, transportation, utility and manufacturing,” a campaign press release said.

Here’s a photo montage of Senator Mark Kelly and yearbook photos from Mark Kelly’s Merchant Marine Academy days. Senator Mark Kelly began claiming he did not dress as Hitler after National File’s Patrick Howley broke the exclusive yearbook photos of a man who looks virtually identical to Mark Kelly dressed as Hitler just ahead of the November 3, 2020, election, infamously won by the now retiring Joe Biden. Within minutes of breaking the exclusive, the Democrat Party scribes at Gannett-owned AZ Central had four — FOUR — of Kelly’s classmates lined up claiming that it definitely was not Mark Kelly who dressed as Hitler in that photograph from the Merchant Marine Academy. Within days, however, National File’s reporting smoked out one of the classmates — a highly paid Defense Department contractor who went to school with Senator Mark Kelly. Huntington Ingalls executive Jenifer Boykin, who is paid more than $4 million a year to oversee a Dept. of Defense shipyard, admitted that she did indeed pose for a photo next to a classmate dressed as Hitler. Mark Kelly and Perkins Coie quickly sued National File, claiming that Kelly did not dress as Hitler. After nearly a year of legal wrangling, and a scrappy defense mounted by Patrick Howley and publisher Noel Fritsch at National File, Mark Kelly and Perkins Coie filed their own motion to dismiss the claim that Kelly did not dress as Hitler. Kelly, it seemed, preferred to focus on his campaign going into 2022 against Peter Thiel conntected GOP Senate candidate Blake Masters. Kelly ultimately defeated Masters. Fast forward three years, and Senator Mark Kelly — the same Mark Kelly who stopped claiming he didn’t dress as Hitler — and who had before claimed that he did not dress as Hitler — is being mentioned as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris. Barack and Michelle Obama endorsed Kamala on Friday morning nearly a week after her ascension to the top slot on the Democrat ticket.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLast Updated on July 26, 2024 It has been three years since&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Mark Kelly Withdraws Lawsuit Denying Allegations of Dressing as Hitler first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/mark-kelly-withdraws-lawsuit-denying-allegations-of-dressing-as-hitler/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-FLASHBACK-Mark-Kelly-Dismissed-Own-Lawsuit-Claiming.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:56:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.509},{"id":252726742,"title":"Top Democratic super PAC launches massive $50M ad spend for Harris leading up to DNC","text":"A top Democratic super PAC has launched a massive ad buy across several battleground states to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential candidacy leading up to the Democratic Party’s convention in Chicago next month. Future Forward, the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC, announced this week it will spend $50 million supporting Harris in six states in the next three weeks ahead of the convention in Chicago, The Washington Post reported. Additionally, the outlet reported that the second-largest independent supporter of Democrats, American Bridge 21st Century, will start placing ads Friday in the key swing state of Michigan.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response. A new survey compiled after Biden dropped out of the race reveals Trump and Harris are tied in the crucial swing state of Michigan despite the former president's previous lead by nearly double digits. National polls have sent mixed signals, with some showing a tie and some showing a slight lead for either candidate. The New York Times/Siena College released a new survey this week that found Trump leads Harris by only one percentage point among likely voters, 48% to 47%. Among registered voters, Trump led Harris by two percentage points.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Chloe Louise For Mailonline Published:23:30 BST, 26 July 2024 |Updated:23:48 BST, 26 July 2024 e-mail 24 shares View comments Strictly Come Dancing's Giovanni Pernice has reportedly been given a huge boost in his BBC bulling case. The professional dancer, 33, has been at the center of a complaint feud in recent weeks after Amanda Abbington lodged a complaint with the BBC over Giovanni's behaviour. And following Amanda's complaints, other stars, such as Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh, are set to step forward and join her. But according to the Mirror, sources have said that the only formal allegations put to Giovanni after the BBC investigation involved Amanda. This reportedly suggested the BBC have ruled that the star doesn't have a case to answer for in relation to the other celebs, or that they didn't lodge a formal complaint in the first place. Strictly Come Dancing's Giovanni Pernice has reportedly been given a huge boost in his BBC bulling case (pictured in 2023) The professional dancer, 33, has been at the center of a complaint feud in recent weeks after Amanda Abbington (pictured) lodged a complaint with the BBC over Giovanni's behaviour But Amanda has previously suggested there are 'five or six' people affected by Giovanni's behaviour. A BBC source told the publication: 'The narrative - certainly from Amanda - is that there has been a tsunami of complainants to the BBC. 'But the truth of the matter is that Giovanni has only been asked for his response to Amanda's claims. 'This would suggest two things. One they haven't made a formal complaint in the first place or, two, the BBC felt it wasn't serious enough to warrant inclusion in their evidence dossier to put to Giovanni for response.' MailOnline has contacted Giovanni's representatives for a comment. The report comes just days after Strictly Come was plunged into further crisis on Wednesday after Amanda claimed that Giovanni was trying to block the release of up to 50 hours of 'toxic' footage'. In an emotionally charged interview, the actress, 50, compared the dance show to 'the trenches' telling Channel 4 News that BBC producers had been left 'horrified' by clips that also allegedly exhibited 'humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature'. The Sherlock star sensationally quit the dance competition last year citing 'personal reasons' before reports surfaced that she had demanded footage of her rehearsals after the experience with the show and her dance partner left her with PTSD. But, according the Mirror, sources have said that the only formal allegations put to Giovanni after the BBC investigation involved Amanda This reportedly suggested the BBC have ruled that the star doesn't have a case to answer for in relation to the other celebs or that they didn't lodge a formal complaint in the first place But Amanda has previously suggested there are 'five or six' people affected by Giovanni's behaviour Giovanni, who has strongly denied any threatening or abusive behaviour, was later suspended, with the BBC later launching a probe over claims of off-camera misconduct made by Amanda as well as other celebrities. Yet in a dramatic twist in the Strictly saga, the actress has claimed Giovanni tried to stop her legal team from accessing the video 'evidence' after producers were forced to put cameras in the dance studio after Amanda raised concerns. 'There's 50 hours of footage that's being blocked. You know, 50 hours is a lot of footage, and a lot of time spent in a room that was toxic,' she told presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Read More Strictly's Amanda Abbington sends thinly-veiled message to Giovanni Pernice following 'mad woman' 'It's out there. There is evidence out there of what happened in that room and I'm not the one who's blocking it. I've said anyone can watch it, but he (Giovanni) doesn't want anyone to see it, which is quite telling if he's got nothing to hide.' A spokesperson for Giovanni told MailOnline at the time: 'We would urge people to wait for the review's conclusion and not to pay heed to these very serious and defamatory allegations that have no evidence in support of them.' The actress said that cameras were installed into her and Giovanni's rehearsal studio after she raised concerns after the first week of practice with producers wanting to review the footage each week to assess what was 'going on' between the pair. Giovanni had claimed he had asked for the cameras, which Amanda says is untrue. 'So in the first week, I raised my concerns to the producers,' the actress explained, as she fought back tears. 'Giovanni said that he asked for the cameras, he didn't ask for the cameras, I know that he didn't ask for the cameras, because the producers came to me and said, 'we're going to put in cameras so we can view the footage at the end of the week and make an assessment and see what's going on'. Read More Strictly cover-up hell for Amanda Abbington as she claims there is up to 50 HOURS of 'toxic' footage 'And then every Friday, after the next sort of five weeks, I would get the producer saying, on the Friday, 'we just watched the footage back, we are shocked and horrified, we're so sorry'. 'That was to my face on the Friday when we would go in and do the camera rehearsal.' Throughout the interview, Guru-Murthy, who also starred on the 2023 series, asked whether it was correct that Amanda had experienced 'humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature', with the actress holding back tears as she nodded in agreement. 'Yeah. I mean, you know, one of the many things,' she said, clarifying it was not harassment. Ever since the claims first emerged Giovanni has denied all of the allegations, claiming to have provided a dossier of evidence to the Beeb investigators and 'remains fully confident in clearing his name'. Disputing Amanda's claims once again following tonight's interview, a spokesperson for the Italian dancer said: 'The BBC has shared the allegations they have been able to substantiate with us. The report comes just days after Strictly Come was plunged into further crisis on Wednesday after Amanda claimed that Giovanni was trying to block the release of up to 50 hours of 'toxic' footage' In an emotionally charged interview, the actress, 50, compared the dance show to 'the trenches' telling Channel 4 News that BBC producers had been left 'horrified' by clips that also allegedly exhibited 'humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature' Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy, who interview Amanda, also starred on the 2023 series of Strictly Come Dancing Amanda and Krishnan Guru-Murthy pictured following her interview 'They do not resemble Amanda's latest allegations, given to Channel 4, in any shape or form. Giovanni refutes any claim of threatening or abusive behaviour.' After the fallout, Amanda said she did not hear from any one at the BBC again, claiming: 'I haven't spoken to anyone from the BBC since Strictly. 'No one from the BBC has reached out to me since Strictly, either through me or my lawyer.' In a message to those in charge of the BBC show that has been running since 2004 she added: 'Just be aware of what's going on and when you know it's going on, nip it in the bud. Don't allow it to continue.' Amanda went on to claim that she has faced a number of violent threats from both Strictly fans and 'Giovanni fans' who have asked her 'how can you destroy something like Strictly'. She revealed the extent of the alleged harassment she has received in recent months from trolls, telling Channel 4 that 'It has been brutal and relentless and unforgiving'. 'The aftermath has been something I was not expecting. The death threats and the rape threats not only to myself but to my daughter. The threats of death to my son,' she added. 'When you get one or two of the those you can [shrug it off],' she added. 'But when it's dozens of people saying 'just go kill yourself', 'go die of cancer', 'just kill yourself, your kids will be better off without you as a mother'. Amanda detailed other horrific messages she allegedly received. Others included 'I hope your daughter gets raped, I hope your son is stabbed', 'you don't deserve any good things you have done', 'you're a snowflake, you're stupid, you're an idiot'. The bombshell interview comes as the flagship BBC One show continues to be rocked by a string of allegations, which saw Giovanni as well as professional dancer Graziano Di Prima step down. Giovanni was accused of bullying by Amanda as well as two other, unnamed contestants. Graziano was axed from the show last week after allegations emerged that he kicked, hit and spat at reality TV star Zasra McDermott during rehearsals last year. And earlier this week, Paralympian Will Bayley became the latest star to speak about his time on the show. The 36-year-old, who was paired with Janette Manrara in 2019, said he was left with life-changing injuries after being made to redo a jump in a routine as he criticised the show's duty of care. Amanda and Giovanni pictured during the show last year 'If the BBC are brilliant enough to get people with disabilities in, they have to really support those people and make them safe,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'And it's not like I've brought this up now... I've brought this up many times. It's just because the other stories have come out that mine has actually got listened to. Read More EXCLUSIVE Amanda Abbington is 'encouraging others to rake up dirt on Strictly', BBC insiders claim 'If someone gets an injury like mine, it will affect them for the rest of their life. I'll never get over this knee injury, I have to deal with that.' Amanda echoed Will's calls in the interview with Channel 4 calling for a more open environment where celebrity contestants can voice concerns without fear of retribution. The BBC said: 'We have longstanding protocols for dealing with injuries if they occur and that includes contestants receiving all necessary treatment and support as required.' When talking about what could be improved on the show she said: 'Allowing people to go and complain that's the other thing. Being able to voice your concerns if you feel like you are being bullied. 'If the situation you are in feels toxic or unsafe, having the courage to go and say something is important and we are not cultivating that environment. 'We are making out that women that voice their concerns about a situations, are trolled through the press, sent rape threats, death threats and are not taken seriously.' Amanda has not publicly given any examples of Giovanni's behaviour during rehearsals, however, branded him 'abusive, cruel and mean'. Throughout the interview she also claimed that former partners of Giovanni's contacted her once it was revealed they would be paired together on the phone. The actress said she received messages that said 'I am so sorry, it's going to be quite tough'. Amanda quit the BBC series last year due to 'personal reasons' before reports surfaced saying she had demanded footage of her rehearsals after the experience left her with PTSD (pictured on the show with Giovanni) Abbington was pictured emotionally struggling with the rehearsals during the show Giovanni has constantly refuted the allegations and denied any accusations of threatening or abusive behaviour. A spokesperson for the dancer said he had provided a dossier of evidence to the investigators and 'remains fully confident in clearing his name'. Read More Celebrity agent Melanie Blake claims Strictly pro dancer 'put her hand on his crotch' But hitting back at those who questioned Amanda's alleged experience, the actress said in her latest interview: 'What happened in that room happened because it happened to me. 'I am not a sensational person, I am not hysterical, I do not make things out to be bigger than they are. I know what happened in that room was not acceptable. 'I complained about it and have not been taken seriously.; She explained that 'three other women' had also made complaints with 'more potentially coming forward'. 'We have to cultivate an environment when women or men - because it happens to men as well - can come forward and say I'm finding this uncomfortable and something needs to be done about it. And then something be done about it - that's all. 'We need to be brave and I want to stand up for any woman who does not have a voice. I will be there for her championing her.' Amanda insisted throughout the interview that she did not want to 'bring down' the show and 'envies' those who spoke highly of their experiences. 'I love Strictly, I would love to have had a beautiful experience on it. I really would,' she said. I'm envious of the people who had a wonderful experience on that show, I'm so glad they did, and I feel really sad that I didn't get to fulfil my journey.' The Channel 4 interview came as BBC chiefs are said to be furious about the Strictly investigation Amanda's initial complaint triggered. One BBC insider told MailOnline: 'Amanda seems to be stopping at nothing to make sure that a dark cloud is left over Strictly. 'She seems to have a real issue with the show. She has been open about not enjoying her time, but why spoil it for everyone else? 'It's not looking like there is a smoking gun in her complaint about Giovanni, so now she is getting others to come forward and then later it appears in the Press so the row keeps going and going.' On Tuesday, the BBC's director-general Tim Davie warned that the 'line should never be crossed' said: 'I'm very sorry that anyone has had an experience on Strictly that hasn't been wholly positive. 'I think that is something we do reflect on, and I'm sorry about that. If someone feels there was something wrong or they wanted to talk about their experience, then, of course, we want them to raise that with us and be in no doubt, we will take it seriously.' Mr Davie added: 'Of course, alongside the fun and entertainment, there will be a degree of competitiveness, hard work, and a will to do well. That's part of what makes this show. 'But there are limits and the line should never be crossed. We will never tolerate unacceptable behaviour of any kind.' Amanda said she was 'glad' that Mr Davie had apologised to celebrities but added that no producers had been in touch since she made a complaint. She told Channel 4: 'I got several messages afterwards from some of the producers, just checking in to see how I was. 'But then when all the fallout happened, and then everybody started piling on and the death threats came in, and they were reported in the press - and all the misinformation went out there - I didn't really hear from anybody again.' Asked if there was any aftercare provided, she replied: 'No, it would have been nice I suppose.' Rehearsals for the new series began on Monday, and today professionals including Johannes Radebe, Amy Dowden and Dianne Buswell were all smiles as they arrived to practise at a London dance studio. Fellow Italian dancer Graziano Di Prima was suspended from the programme after he was accused of kicking and spitting at former Love Island star Zara McDermott (pictured together during last year's competition) Addressing his exit from the show, a 'devastated' Di Prima wrote on Instagram: 'I deeply regret the events that led to my departure from Strictly' In response to Amanda's latest interview, a spokesperson for the BBC said: 'Anyone involved in a complaint has a right to confidentiality and fair process and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further on individuals.' 'As we have said before, we would urge people not to indulge in speculation. More generally, the BBC and BBC Studios takes duty of care extremely seriously. 'Our processes on Strictly Come Dancing are updated every year, they are kept under constant review and last week we announced additional steps to further strengthen welfare and support on the show. The BBC continued: 'The BBC and BBC Studios takes duty of care extremely seriously…last week we announced additional steps to further strengthen welfare and support on the show.'

Josh Shapiro of covering up sexual harassment, endorses NC Gov. Roy Cooper for VP","text":"BETHLEHEM, Pa. — A Democrat running for statewide office issued a scathing critique of her party mate and governor, potential vice-presidential nominee Josh Shapiro, leading to a war of words with the Pennsylvania party chief — which she’s continuing in The Post. Treasurer nominee Erin McClelland appeared to accuse Shapiro of sexism and covering up sexual harassment and imply he wouldn’t be satisfied playing second fiddle in a Tuesday night tweet. “I want a VP pick that’s secure enough to be second under a woman, is content to be VP & won’t undermine the President to maneuver his own election & doesn’t sweep sexual harassment under the rug,” wrote McClelland, who is running against GOP incumbent Treasurer Stacy Garrity. “I want someone that can speak to rural voters. That is @RoyCooperNC,” McClelland’s post continued. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is another much-talked-about potential veep pick for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. McClelland noted she did not mention Shapiro’s name directly in her tweet but told The Post her concerns about the extent of the governor’s presidential ambitions should he be added to the ticket. “If I were in [Harris’] situation, I would think very strongly about the difficulties that some women experience being in a top-level position, and having men around them that have to be satisfied with being second, third or answering to a woman,” she said. While McClelland did not offer details on her accusation Shapiro “swept sexual harassment under the rug,” The Philadelphia Inquirer said she “was likely referring to a sexual harassment scandal in Shapiro’s office last year.” The scandal involved a woman who accused her boss, Shapiro legislative liaison Mike Vereb, of sexual harassment. The governor’s office quietly reached a $295,000 settlement with her. Vereb, who’s been close to Shapiro for decades, did not resign from his Cabinet-level position until months after an internal complaint was filed, the Inquirer reported. McClelland’s tweet put her at odds with other Pennsylvania Democrats who have supported Shapiro for VP — and even raised the ire of state Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street. “Look, everybody’s entitled to their opinion,” Street said at a Wednesday event promoting Harris. “But I’ll tell you, I’m offended by the post,” he continued. “I’m personally offended, and I’ll have conversations with our nominee for treasurer separately.” Speaking to The Post, McClelland said she hasn’t spoke to Street since criticizing Shapiro but believes their relationship will be “fine.” “Someone is offended by a woman with a strong opinion. Color me thunderstruck,” she declared. McClelland said she will support the Democratic ticket no matter whom Harris picks but was compelled to praise Cooper because of the North Carolina governor’s record and ability to attract young voters — especially as compared with Shapiro. Cooper “seems very comfortable in his own skin and does not seem to have very strong ambitions to be president,” McClelland said. “I don’t think that he would undercut” Harris, she added. “He’s good on public education, which is an issue that’s important to me.” McClelland is not alone on the left, though. She joins 28 anti-school-choice organizations that oppose Shapiro’s candidacy. The organizations penned a letter to Harris urging her to pick one of three other Democratic governors as her running mate — and Cooper was on that list. The gov, who served as Keystone State attorney general from 2017 to 2023, was handily elected to the position over hard-right GOP candidate Doug Mastriano in 2022. Shapiro received acclaim last year for his leadership during the repair of a collapsed Interstate 95 bridge in Philadelphia but has been criticized on both sides of the aisle for his work on school choice — albeit for very different reasons. Republicans are disappointed he caved last summer on the state Senate’s school-choice bill, which he’d backed before that. Dems have hit him because they oppose school choice overall.","summary":"A Democrat running for statewide office in Pennsylvania has issued a scathing critique of her governor, potential vice presidential nominee Josh Shapiro.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/us-news/pennsylvania-democrat-accuses-gov-josh-shapiro-of-covering-up-sexual-harassment-endorses-nc-gov-roy-cooper-for-vp/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85988129.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:30:58","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":252726506,"title":"How significant is the Obamas' endorsement of Harris?","text":"How significant is the Obamas' endorsement of Harris?

You never know who will benefit from our fickle hit parade. A vice president turned presidential candidate gets a meme boost from a British pop star named Charli XCX. An album by a pair of rappers ignites a beef that takes down Drake and gives Kendrick Lamar a comeback. A white ex-“rapper” with face tattoos reboots his career by duetting with Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen. Or, atop the charts this week, a Black country singer benefits more from Beyoncé’s country album than Bey herself did. Remember Cowboy Carter? Nearly six months ago, when Mrs. Knowles-Carter “broke the internet” by dropping new music during the Super Bowl—and not just new music, but straight-up country music—the biggest mystery was whether any actual country fans would care. Within two weeks, “Texas Hold ’Em,” the leadoff single from Bey’s Cowboy Carter LP, topped both the Hot 100 pop chart and Hot Country Songs. But as I explained at the time, this No. 1 Country status, while certainly a milestone for a Black woman, was also something of a mirage, a technicality driven by the way Billboard tallies its genre charts; it did not indicate widespread acceptance by the Nashville establishment or country radio listeners. By the spring, on the Country Airplay chart, which isolates airplay on country radio stations, “Texas Hold ’Em” peaked at a respectable but hardly world-beating No. 33. Beyoncé got Nashville’s attention and was cleared through the gates, but she was not destined to be a Grand Ole Opry headliner. It turns out Cowboy Carter’s greatest contribution to the Black-country narrative was the boost it gave one of its least hyped guests. Buried amid the album’s cameos by Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Post Malone, and a quartet of Black women singing a Beatles cover were two deep cuts featuring vocals by a Virginia-born singer who goes by the name Shaboozey. Taking advantage of the Bey bump, Shaboozey accelerated the release of a new single, a twangy saloon jam that blends guitars and fiddles with lyrics borrowed from a 20-year-old rap hit. The result: Shaboozey has not only reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 and outlasted “Texas Hold ’Em,” but has been embraced at multiple radio formats—including country—to an extent Beyoncé could only dream of. He might even pull off an upset win for 2024’s Song of the Summer. Want to feel hopeful about something this July and August besides Kamala Harris’ electoral chances? Join me in rooting for “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” I know—you’re probably rooting for Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” and it’s still a jam. But as I explained for this Slate series a few weeks ago, the red-hot Carpenter is splitting her Song of Summer votes between two smash singles, “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” both still lodged in the Top 10. Whereas Shaboozey’s hit, now in its second week at No. 1, could actually win the whole thing. To outlast Malone and Wallen’s roadhouse barnburner “I Had Some Help,” the current Songs of the Summer title holder, “A Bar Song” needs a few more weeks at or near the top of the Hot 100. It’s funny that for the second summer in a row, two country songs are duking it out. But unlike 2023’s duel between white format stalwarts Morgan Wallen (with “Last Night”) and Luke Combs (with his cover of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car”), Shaboozey’s 2024 hit sounds more like the future of country—and maybe also pop. In a decade that has already seen so much promiscuous genre-crossing atop the charts—from hip-hop with alt-rock guitars to rock songs with trap beats—Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” may be the apotheosis. The hybridization of hip-hop and country, America’s two biggest musical cultures, feels like the final frontier. As I chronicle in my book Old Town Road, rap and country have been eyeing each other warily and smashing together for decades, long before Lil Nas X’s country-trap megasmash that gives my book its title. “Old Town Road” was a clear inspiration for Shaboozey: In interviews, he says that it validated his cross-genre tastes and his desire to blend them. But where Lil Nas X hit a ceiling with country listeners five years ago, Shaboozey seems to have unlocked a new strategy for making hip-hop palatable to them: a dose of nostalgia. The reason “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” has that parenthetical subtitle is that it interpolates “Tipsy,” a 2004 No. 2 hit by St. Louis rapper J-Kwon. At a mid-aughts moment when hip-hop was at an absolute zenith of pop crossover—“Tipsy” peaked in the Hot 100’s runner-up slot, sandwiched between hits by Usher, Diddy, and Chingy—J-Kwon’s hit offered rap as crunching, stadium-ready pop, shamelessly piling hooks upon hooks. Its catchiest bit may have been not even its dead-simple chorus (“Errebody in the club gettin’ tipsy!”) but rather the verses, in which J-Kwon, who was only 17 when he recorded the song, counted up like a sloshed Sesame Street Muppet: “One! Here comes the two, to the three, to the four/ Everybody drunk out on the dance floor.” It was crunk music for teenyboppers. Or maybe younger: Shaboozey was 8 going on 8 when J-Kwon’s underage drinking anthem crashed the charts. On “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the kid born Collins Obinna Chibueze (his music moniker is a playful misspelling of his last name), now a grown-ass man of 29, invokes J-Kwon’s best hooks—the chorus about errebody in the club, the count-up verses—but Shaboozey refashions them into a hoedown for folks of legal drinking age. “One! Here comes the two, to the three, to the four/ Tell ’em bring another out, we need plenty more,” he sings over strumming guitars, a keening fiddle, claps, and stomps. “Two! Steppin’ on the table, she don’t need a dance floor/ Oh my, good Lord.” Besides the beautiful, oddly poignant melody, which already seems to anticipate a morning-after hangover, the song’s genius lies in its connection of rap decadence with country hedonism, and the party-till-we-die fatalism underlying both. It’s like that classic Saturday Night Live “Black Jeopardy” sketch with Tom Hanks, in which his MAGA hat–wearing contestant commiserates with his Black compatriots, except turned into a honky-tonk sing-along. Shaboozey may as well have been created in a lab to blend cultures. Raised in the northern Virginia town of Woodbridge by Nigerian-American parents, he consumed both contemporary hip-hop and his dad’s preferred Kenny Rogers albums and started recording his own hard-to-pigeonhole music as a teenager in the early ’10s. He nearly completed a country album but didn’t release it, convinced that the world wasn’t ready for a Black kid invoking twang and trap beats—which, half a decade before “Old Town Road,” was probably correct. So instead, he released a straight-up rap joint that, with a wink, was named after NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon. After he signed to major label Republic Records, ostensibly as a rapper, country tropes began gradually infecting his music—2018’s Lady Wrangler, mostly a trap-style rap LP beyond that cornpone title, led off with the high-lonesome guitar-based “Dream.” And Shaboozey’s 2022 LP Cowboys Live Forever, Outlaws Never Die, though still rooted in hip-hop, featured tracks titled “Rodeo World Champion” and “The Ballad of Belt Buckle Bill” and closed with “Why Can’t Cowboys Cry?” with mournful slide guitar and some of the same emo energy Shaboozey would later bring to “A Bar Song.” As intriguing as all this was, Shaboozey scored only industry buzz but no hits until Beyoncé called. On Cowboy Carter, Shaboozey was featured on “Spaghettii” alongside veteran Black country singer Linda Martell, who leads off the track with her much-quoted spoken-word plaint: “Genres are a funny little concept, aren’t they? Yes, they are. In theory, they have a simple definition that’s easy to understand. But in practice, well … some may feel confined.” Confoundingly, the song isn’t country at all but a thumping trap jam, with Shaboozey cropping up near the end to deliver some frontier-justice lyrics: “Outlaws with me, they gon’ shoot/ Keep the code, break the rules.” Then he pops up again, to duet with Bey on “Sweet Honey Buckiin’,” which is closer to the twangy hip-hop sound Shaboozey was exploring on his next album. Fortuitously, that 2024 LP was all but complete and ready to deploy just weeks after Cowboy Carter dropped. The aptly titled Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going moves Shaboozey away from the rap-first production styles of his prior work—it’s his first to be tagged on streaming services as a straight-up country album and has been allowed onto Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart, where it debuted at No. 2, right behind Morgan Wallen. It’s still in the Country Albums Top Five a couple of months later. The album’s out-of-the-box explosion was due largely to “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which, thanks to Shaboozey’s higher profile post-Beyoncé, debuted within the Top 40 on the Hot 100, then hurtled into the Top 10 in just its third week. It has since remained locked in the Top 10 (mostly the Top Five, including two weeks at No. 1) for a dozen weeks and counting. That’s better than “Texas Hold ’Em,” which managed only about two months in the Top 10. Not since Kanye West’s 2016 album The Life of Pablo gave Ye no major hits but gave sampled rapper Desiigner a left-field No. 1 smash has a superstar album done so much more for a guest than it did for the headliner. Shaboozey’s breakthrough track has performed well in all three metrics that make up the Hot 100: streaming, sales, and airplay. Like both “Old Town Road” and “Texas Hold ’Em,” “A Bar Song” was fueled at first largely by digital consumption. Since mid-May, it’s consistently been among the five most streamed songs at Spotify, YouTube, and other digital service providers. In fact, by early July, it was the most streamed song, period, briefly toppling Kendrick Lamar’s streaming smash “Not Like Us.” And on buck-a-song download services, “A Bar Song” has been something of a juggernaut. It’s been the top-selling song for nine of the past 14 weeks, only briefly ceding the download top spot to songs like Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight” or Eminem’s “Houdini.” Generally, when a song sells well, that means that it’s catching on with an older fan base who would rather own a track than stream it (like, say, country listeners, who bought piles of Jason Aldean and Oliver Anthony downloads last year). To date, “A Bar Song” has sold nearly 280,000 downloads, more than any single released in 2024. But it’s the third Hot 100 metric, radio, in which “A Bar Song” has made the most improbable inroads. Among all broadcast formats, it currently ranks second in radio audience (behind only “I Had Some Help”). That’s already impressive, and at first glance, that makes “A Bar Song” a match for “Old Town Road,” which also peaked at No. 2 at radio in 2019. But back then, Lil Nas X scored the overwhelming bulk of his airplay from Top 40 pop stations and R&B/hip-hop stations. Country radio never regarded it as much more than a novelty: “Road” peaked at No. 50 on the Country Airplay chart. And again, this year, Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ’Em,” for all its positive word-of-mouth from country radio programmers, couldn’t crack the Country Airplay Top 30. So what about “A Bar Song”? It currently ranks an amazing No. 3 at country radio, behind only a pair of songs by (natch) Morgan Wallen. This is gobsmacking: Over the years, there have been Black artists who’ve done as well or better at country radio, from Darius Rucker to Kane Brown, but these are performers nurtured in the Nashville system, not ones who cross over from hip-hop. Back in May, when “A Bar Song” leaped into the pop Top 10, it automatically went to No. 1 on Hot Country Songs, replacing Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ’Em”—the first time Black artists had the top country hit back-to-back. That was historic, sure—but again, as with Beyoncé back in February, it’s less than meets the eye. Billboard’s genre-charts methodology, which uses the Hot 100 pop chart as the basis for Hot Country Songs, meant Shaboozey’s ascension was not really an indication of his country acceptance. Two months later, “A Bar Song” ranking third in airplay exclusively at country stations is a much, much bigger deal. Shaboozey, a country arriviste who built his career in hip-hop first, has officially gone someplace Lil Nas X and Queen Bey never did. Indeed, “A Bar Song” is setting a lot of crossover firsts this year. Billboard reports that it’s the first song to reach the Top 10 on the following four radio charts: Country Airplay, as noted above; Pop Airplay (the chart that tracks Top 40–style pop stations), Adult Pop Airplay (which tracks stations that play current hits for an older demo), and even Rhythmic Airplay (stations, largely in urban areas, that play a mix of rap and dance music). In the past five years, we’ve seen No. 1 hits that have combined pop, R&B/hip-hop, and rock airplay, like 24kGoldn and Iann Dior’s “Mood” or Steve Lacy’s “Bad Habit.” But pop, hip-hop, and country airplay, all in power rotation? “A Bar Song” is literally exceptional in that regard. As I have said in this series before, I feel that genre as a musical concept—even with all the racial essentialism and segregation that has been baked into it for at least the past century or more—is still useful, a celebration of cultural difference and a reflection of humans’ natural tendency to categorize our art. That said, what I value even more is when new artists like Shaboozey take a blowtorch to genre walls. “Genre is always a blending of both formal structure and cultural context,” Oregon State University professor Ehren Pflugfelder told the New Yorker’s Amanda Petrusich, in a story about the rumored end of genre. “This may be the most frustrating thing about genre for those who want it to be stable over time.” In short, genres are valuable because they adapt—yes, even country, the category that polices its borders most zealously. If country fans are falling in love with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” as much as pop and hip-hop fans—and if Billboard’s data is any indication, they are—then that’s the kind of thing that makes me feel as if (not to be too grand about it) there might still be hope for the American experiment. When Shaboozey sings about “everybody in the bar” getting drunk on his summer banger, apparently he really means everybody.","summary":"A Black rapper is atop the country charts—and for once, even country listeners are embracing him.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2024/07/shaboozey-bar-song-tipsy-beyonce-billboard-hot-100.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/1de88a6d-b490-4102-88ea-f298d29f3922.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:28:25","author":"Chris Molanphy","authors":["Chris Molanphy"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.045},{"id":252725788,"title":"Park Police union says officers ‘did everything they could’ during DC anti-Israel riot","text":"Following the protests at Union Station by anti-Israel agitators defacing federal property in protest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, a Park Police union is pushing back against criticism that only a few arrests were made.

The poll results come despite several big Democratic names putting their support behind Harris, including former president Barack Obama.Newsweek reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaigns by email for comment.Polling company Redfield and Wilton Strategies released their results from a recent poll of 6,927 swing state voters on Friday. The poll was conducted between July 22 and 24, shortly after Biden dropped out of the race.

Harris leads Trump 44 percent to 41 percent in Minnesota. The two candidates are tied at 44 percent in Wisconsin.Emerson College Polling/The Hill polled five swing states from July 22 to 23 and found similar results.

The call comes after 164,000 White women broke the world record for largest Zoom call on Thursday, all hopping on a meeting to show support for Vice President Harris’ presidential campaign. The massive remote meeting – advertised as \"White Women: Answer the Call\" – featured multiple celebrity guests like U.S. Women’s Soccer star Megan Rapinoe, musician Pink, and actress Connie Britton, some of whom spoke to a horde of specifically White women, hoping to shore up support for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. DEM WHO CRITICIZED VP HARRIS' HANDLING OF SOUTHERN BORDER ENDORSES HER FOR PRESIDENT Britton, who also spoke during the virtual event, jokingly called the meeting, \"Karens for Kamala.\" The Thursday online gathering was inspired by a previous Zoom call directed at Black women last Sunday that was organized by activist group \"Win With Black Women\" only hours after President Joe Biden announced his decision to withdraw from his re-election campaign, endorsing Harris. That event had around 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, The Guardian reported. On Monday, more than 50,000 Black men also held a call in support of Harris. Shannon Watts, the founder of gun-control advocacy group \"Moms Demand Action\" organized Thursday’s record-breaking meeting.

In a speech to the virtual participants, Britton declared, \"we've got a f------ job to do, y'all.\" The actress added that a future President Harris will \"listen\" as well as \"lead with empathy, integrity, and the power of the truth.\" She then gushed about the moment that Biden stepped down and the vice president assumed the mantle of presumptive presidential nominee. \"It was seismic. Cosmic, even. And since then—have you seen it? Have you seen Kamala glisten in the brilliance and shine of her true power and leadership? And what does that feel like? Feels like self-love.\" Watts, who also spoke on the call, called out White women for their previous voting patterns, stating, \"The bad news is that a majority of White women vote for Republicans, because too many of us believe, subconsciously, that it is in our best interest to use our privilege and our support systems of White supremacy and the patriarchy to benefit us.\" BERNIE SANDERS SAYS TRUMP'S ‘LYING’ WHEN HE CLAIMS KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE LIBERAL THAN THE VERMONT SENATOR She urged them to break the mold and unite behind Harris. \"White women, we have 100 days to help save the world!\" she said. Author and liberal activist Glennon Doyle also spoke to the 160,000 virtual attendees, telling them they need to \"step up and out and into the gap between democracy and fascism,\" adding that when the election is won, they can say \"we were among the women who finally united, and…we saved the goddamn world.\" Ahead of Monday's meeting, the White Dudes for Harris sign-up vowed they wouldn't be bullied by the \"MAGA crowd.\" \"Together, we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology because we understand that under MAGA everyone loses.

But with Vice President Kamala Harris likely to be the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden exited the race, the Democratic National Convention next month is sure to be one of the hottest places to spot several A-listers. The excitement of a possible Harris presidency, which would make her the nation’s first woman president, has inspired Democrats of the highest caliber to fundraise millions of dollars and, in one case, even lend the vice president a song to feature in her first campaign ad. “It’s great to have celebrity endorsers,” said Louis Perron, political scientist and consultant. “It’s always a question of how you use them strategically, what you want to try to accomplish with them. How do they fit into the overall campaign plan?” Beyonce appears to have given support to Harris by allowing her to use the song “Freedom,” from her 2016 Lemonade album, in the first campaign ad Harris made reintroducing herself to the public as a 2024 presidential candidate. Before that, Beyonce gave Harris tickets to her Renaissance tour last summer, as was revealed on financial disclosure reports, in another example of the friendship between the two women. It would not be surprising if Beyonce performed or appeared at the DNC in Chicago next month. During Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, the megacelebrity performed a campaign concert in Cleveland, Ohio. Beyonce’s publicist did not respond to a Washington Examiner request for comment. “I think the Democratic convention, this time, is going to be the party of the year,” said Eugene Robinson, a Washington Post columnist, on Friday’s Morning Joe. “They’ll do a whole lot better than Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock let me put it that way. I can imagine the stars who will come out.” Robinson was referencing last week’s Republican National Convention, which featured a performance from Kid Rock and speeches from professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White. In contrast to the RNC, celebrities popular with Gen Z, such as Charli XCX, who said Harris is “brat,” have embraced the vice president’s nascent campaign. The Harris campaign used Charli XCX’s signature “brat” green color as the background inspiration for its X account. Soccer celebrity and Olympic gold medalist Megan Rapinoe, actress Connie Britton, and musician Pink joined the “White Women Answer the Call 2024” Zoom call in support of Harris on Thursday. The meeting raised $8.5 million, in another indication of the wide-array of stars that the campaign could tap for the convention. As a California native, Harris has ties to some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including actor George Clooney, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, and screenwriter Shonda Rhimes. Chicago is also the political home for former President Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, who will likely play a role at the convention after endorsing Harris on Friday. DNC organizers have less than a month to switch from an event where Biden would have been the headliner to a more energized convention now that a Harris campaign has rejuvenated a party beset by a previous lackluster enthusiasm over Biden, 81, and his poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump in late June. Celebrity publicists said they’re being inundated with requests from clients to help out the White House now that Biden stepped aside. “Usually I’m asking my clients,” one publicist told CNN. “Nobody had to ask. People were like, ‘What do I do, and how do I help?’” “Joe Biden’s selfless act, combined with the kind of change and optimism and turning of the page that Kamala represents has reengaged so many people I know in this election,” producer Greg Berlanti told CNN. “And they are ready to fight for so many of the values that VP Harris has been fighting for her whole career.” The Harris campaign pointed the Washington Examiner to the DNC team when asked about what celebrities would perform at the national gathering. The DNC declined to reveal the celebrity lineup, but Emily Soong, a spokeswoman, said, “Democrats will offer a positive, forward-looking vision for our country that will stand in stark contrast to the backward-looking extremism that defined Donald Trump’s convention.” Perron cautioned that while celebrities will be a major part of the DNC it shouldn’t be the main theme. “At a convention, you have the unique attention, so you want to use this to score political points and to communicate your message to swing voters,” he said. “Because I think swing voters will ultimately decide the election. I think the youth (vote) is fine and celebrities are fine, but ultimately I think the election will be decided by swing voters. So I would orchestrate the convention to please swing voters and communicate to swing voters.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER If past conventions are any indication, celebrities are sure to descend on Chicago for the convention on Aug. 19-22. During the 2020 virtual convention, actresses such as Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus addressed viewers. The 2016 convention, which was held in person, featured performances from Boyz II Men, Demi Lovato, and Alicia Keys. In 2008, during Barack Obama’s history-making run as the nation’s first black president, actresses Jennifer Lopez, Angela Bassett, and Anne Hathaway, as well as actor Spike Lee and singers John Legend, Dave Matthews, and Sheryl Crow, were all spotted at the convention and related events.","summary":"Hollywood celebrities have long flocked to the Democratic Party&#8216;s top campaign events in modern history.

And I think they're actually hurting us.\" Ramaswamy spoke to Fox News Digital about a viral comment he posted Thursday on X that was seen by over 3 million people that addressed issues and concerns he has seen with the way Republicans are talking about the matchup between Harris and former President Trump. Ramswamy’s first point and concern is that Republicans are calling for Biden to step down or be removed from office, using the argument that if he is not capable of running for president, he isn’t capable of serving as president. VIVEK RAMASWAMY 'WOULD CONSIDER' TAKING JD VANCE'S SENATE SEAT IF ASKED \"I think this makes absolutely zero sense and here's why,\" Ramaswamy explained. \"Kamala Harris is unproven as a political leader, let alone as the U.S. president. Why put her in a position as the U.S. president with all the benefits of incumbency? Oval Office addresses, God forbid, to even change policy or foreign policy, to be able to create circumstances that make her look better. That's one of the advantages that many incumbent presidents, the sad truth is, have used throughout American history.\" Ramaswamy said calling on Biden to step down is \"another example\" of Republicans being \"reactive,\" which ends up \"hurting our chances rather than helping us.\" \"It's not going to be good for America and it's not going to be good for Republican electoral prospects if Kamala Harris is the President of the United States of America for even a short period of time, for even a minute,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I don't think that's something we should want, and it doesn't make sense and that's why I called it out.\" Many Republicans have focused on Harris’ record as a prosecutor, which Ramaswamy warned could backfire if they focus too much on attacks that she \"locked up\" too many people for petty crimes. NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP, HARRIS TIED IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE: 'CLOSE AS CLOSE CAN BE' \"So look, this is the other category of criticisms I see coming, even from some conservatives, saying that she locked up too many people while she was a prosecutor,\" he said. \"This is the wrong line of attack. It doesn't make sense.\" Ramaswamy continued, \"In fact, one of the images that Kamala Harris is trying to project is that she's somehow going to be a law-and-order presidential candidate. I find that laughable. Look at under the Democratic regime, including policies that she has supported, clear the jails, defund the police. That's resulted in a wave of rampant crime in this country. People in the United States of America, across the aisle and both camps, are dead set against this wave of crime. But if against that backdrop, Republicans are criticizing her for locking too many people up, it doesn't make sense because it legitimizes the otherwise laughable claim that she's a law-and-order candidate.\" Republicans have also accused Harris of covering up Biden’s health issues while at the same time accusing the vice president of orchestrating a soft \"coup\" to remove him from the ticket. Ramswamy told Fox News Digital those two messages don’t mesh. \"The main point is what voters really care about is the future,\" he said. \"What are we actually going to deliver? And the more we focus on bickering on that past political missteps or whatever from the Democratic side, the more small-minded we're going to be seen as being. \"On one hand, you have Republicans saying that Kamala Harris covered up for Joe Biden. She was covering for him and telling the public that he was actually a great president, when in fact he wasn't cognitively capable. On the other hand, at the same time, we're saying that Kamala staged this coup against Biden. It doesn't make sense to many independent voters to say both of those things at the same time. They're self-contradictory. And if we say things that don't make sense, we're more likely to lose votes, which is the thing that I care most about. So I come back to the basic point. That's not how we're going to win this election. We're not going to win this election by picking at these nit-picking… ‘inside baseball’ political criticisms of Kamala. It doesn't matter. The voters don't care.\" FLASHBACK: NEW HARRIS CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER MADE SEVERAL INSENSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT WOMEN, GAY PEOPLE Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital that Harris is not the \"biggest risk\" the Republican side faces, but rather the \"shenanigans on the Democratic side.\" \"The voters don't love Kamala Harris on her own terms,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We know that because even when she was running in the Democratic primary, she didn't even make it to the Iowa caucus. I was an unknown 37-year-old businessman, ran for office for the first time as U.S. president last year. I have more delegates that have supported me for U.S. president than Kamala Harris ever has had. That's because voters don't find her compelling. So it's not that Kamala Harris is our biggest risk.\" When asked if some Republicans are underestimating Harris’ ability to win, Ramswamy said that \"complacency\" is always a concern. \"You got to compete like you're behind, or else you soon will be,\" he said. \"We're not up against a candidate.

She has found a creative way to stay focused. “As I sit and watch, I crochet to stay quiet and pay attention,” Bottko Woods says. These two worlds — the city council and the creative arts — came together for Bottko Woods during the historic inauguration of the first all-women St. Paul City Council on Jan. 9. “It was an amazing event, and it really just inspired me,” she says. So did the inauguration photos of Mitra Jalali, Anika Bowie, Rebecca Noecker, Saura Jost, HwaJeong Kim, Nelsie Yang and Cheniqua Johnson. Specifically, one photo by John Autey, Pioneer Press photojournalist. The photo of the seven women standing together on stage at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in downtown St. Paul, the site of the inauguration, is a tapestry of colors and cultures and textures. The women, dressed for the occasion in outfits ranging from a tweedy pastel suit to a purple pantsuit to a traditional Hmong Xiengkhouang outfit and purple hat (Phuam Txoom Suab) to a gown made in Ghana — look joyful as they smile and wave, one with hand over heart, standing there like the American history they were making. Here’s how we found out about the project: “I recently crocheted a photo you took of the City Council Inauguration, and I am hopeful to ask for your blessing, or guidance in officially requesting permission to display this photo alongside dolls I crochet which I plan to display at the Smallest Museum in Saint Paul (a display outside Workhorse Coffee Shop),” Bottko Woods wrote in an email. Our editor did grant permission, by the way — more about the museum display below. But first, we called up Bottko Woods to find out more about her handiwork. Crochet artist “I’ve been crocheting on and off for about 20 years,” says Bottko Woods, 39, of St. Paul. “I started making these amigurumi dolls about 10 years ago.” (Amigurumi is Japanese for a crocheted/knitted stuffed toy.) While she uses the art of crochet to focus the mind when she needs to “sit still and pay attention,” it’s also bigger than just a way of staying fidget-free. “I make weird projects for the State Fair,” she says. In fact, this could have been one of them. But with seven dolls representing seven council members, that was a veto as the artist interpreted the rules. “The State Fair rules only allow groupings up to five,” Bottko Woods says. “So I had to find a different place for my City Council project.” Too bad. “That’s OK,” she said. “I have Mayor Melvin Carter for the State Fair.” (Also, in separate entries, Beyoncé and Prince.) To crochet and knit the dolls and their fashion, she looked at our photos and watched a video of the inauguration, which she frequently stopped to take photos of the outfits as the newly elected walked across the stage. “So I have all these grainy pictures on my phone of our council members,” she says with a laugh. It took a while to get the details right, especially since she has also juggled other creative projects and life and work along the way. “I started making one of them the day of the inauguration,” she says, “and I just finished last week.” Just in time for the museum installation. How did that come about? The Smallest Museum Shannon Forney, founder of The Smallest Museum in St. Paul, also is Bottko Woods’ colleague at City Hall. “We work together, so we talk all the time,” Bottko Woods says. “She was talking about a different display of a coworker’s (about voting) and it came up that way. Essentially, I asked her.” It felt funny to explain the project, at first. “It’s a weird thing, I have dolls of the city council in my home,” says Bottko Woods, laughing. “If I could find a place to put them, it would not be quite so weird.” Forney didn’t think it was weird; she thought the timing was perfect with the Great Minnesota Get-Together approaching and took on the role of curator of this exhibit. “When she told me that she couldn’t submit seven dolls at once, I thought it would be really cool to have an adjacent exhibit at the Smallest Museum while she had other pieces at the State Fair,” Forney says. The timing — opening on Friday and running through September — works well for other reasons, too. “I thought it was a great St. Paul connection, first and foremost,” Forney says. “And, not to wax poetic, but we are in a time when there’s a national conversation about representation.” This timing — coming as Vice President Kamala Harris suddenly makes a White House bid after President Joe Biden’s abrupt exit from the race — was coincidental, she says. “We had already decided,” Forney says of the doll display. “It just affirms why the exhibit is important.” In addition to the dolls and Autey’s photo, the museum exhibit includes two quotes. One is from Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie, about the power of dolls, and the other is from Jalali, the president of the St. Paul City Council, on the power of voting. The dolls knit together these two powers into art; it is Bottko Woods’ hope that girls will come to see the display. Muses The members of the St. Paul City Council were alerted to their muse status on Wednesday, when Forney emailed the council and Mayor Melvin Carter about the exhibit. “We are delighted to share that the Smallest Museum in Saint Paul will host an exhibit opening this weekend through the end of September, honoring this historic Saint Paul City Council,” the email began. It’s not the only work of art that the council has inspired. Another colleague created a portrait of the seven out of seed art; there have been drawings from children and who knows what other masterpieces (please tell us!). Others were inspired by Autey’s photos as well: A high school student from California and a college student from Iowa, both researching this apparent first, also reached out about the inauguration photo. “It makes me happy to see my photos of the inspiring event inspire others,” Autey says. We reached out to the council members for their reaction to the news of the crochet/photo exhibit. “I love the creativity from our residents,” wrote Ward 4 council member Jalali. “In general I’ve been really moved by the outpouring of excitement by the community.” “It’s personally amazing to see the impact that this has had on so many people,” said Ward 7’s Cheniqua Johnson said in a phone call. “To see the colors and cultures and dresses captured in knit yarn, that’s pretty impressive. It’s really cool, and it definitely made our day.” “These knitted dolls are adorable!” wrote Nelsie Yang of Ward 6. “It’s been incredible to see the many ways people are capturing St. Paul’s milestone of having an all-women city council through arts and crafts. These knitted dolls are a beautiful reflection of the diversity and strong leadership that exists all throughout our city and democracy! It is also symbolic of the resilience that our community and many people before us carried generation after generation in order to make this progress possible.” See the dolls The council-inspired dolls are on display through September at The Smallest Museum in St. Paul, which exists inside a vintage fire-hose cabinet outside Workhouse Coffee Bar, 2399 University Ave. W., St. Paul.

President Joe Biden endorsed her. Most labor unions got behind her quickly, she’s raised a trove of cash and on Friday, she secured the endorsement of former president Barack Obama. Polling shows she’s performing better in some swing states than Biden did. “So this is, and long has been, a vibes election, it is not a list-making election,” Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist, told The Independent. “It's not just Kamala Harris and the campaign that she is quickly building and or has inherited. It's down ballot. But, I mean, it's also that, it's in the White House, on the government side, on the policy side.” The Harris campaign has also hit the Trump campaign for the former president pulling out of the second debate. In the same token, on Thursday evening, a Zoom call titled White Women for Harris featured tons of would-be donors and celebrities such as actress Connie Britton and athletes like soccer legend Megan Rapinoe and retired WNBA superstar Sue Bird all joined it, as did gun control activist Shannon Watts and Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrowsuch raising a trove of cash for the vice president, generating jokes on social media about it being “Karens for Kamala.” Felicity Pereya, a former data director for the Democratic National Committee, was on the White Women for Harris call and a separate Latinas for Harris Zoom call. “You can't manufacture this, this is all organic,” Pereya told The Independent. “This is all real. And again, like she can her campaign can harness this.” By the same token, Republicans have been forced to recalibrate. As Inside Washington reported earlier this week, Donald Trump’s campaign is labeling Harris’s jump in the polls as the “Harris Honeymoon.” And indeed, Republicans seem to have found two weak spots where they can attack her: crime and immigration. On Thursday, House Republicans distracted from the fact they have been utterly unable to pass the necessary spending bills by introducing a resolution condemning Biden and Harris specifically in her capacity as “border czar.” Republicans harping about the influx of immigration at the US-Mexico border is not news; they’ve done that since Biden took office. What is new is that six Democrats--including three who represent districts that voted for Donald Trump--voted to condemn her. Down ballot, Republicans are trying to tie Democrats who immediately backed her to some of Harris’s more left-wing policies to thereby position vulnerable incumbents as radicals. Harmeet Dhillon, a member of the Republican National Committee for California, told The Independent that she planned on hitting Harris for her work on crime going back to the days when Harris was a district attorney for San Francisco. “I actually voted for her because she ran on a tough-on-crime platform, and then, you know, four months in, she betrays her voters,” she told The Independent, noting how even Democrats like then-senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein criticized her for not pursuing the death penalty for the killer of slain police officer Isaac Espinoza in 2004. “You can go out there and laugh and change the subject and talk about your race and whatever, and dance and be goofy,” she said. “ But ultimately, this is the you know, sweepstakes here, running for president, the leader of the free world, and she is not going to get a free pass. Maybe from the fawning media.” When Harris ran for president in 2019, she received criticism for being too tough on crime, creating the meme that “Kamala Harris is a Cop,” at a time when many progressives began to mistrust police. “Both things can be true,” Dhillon said. “So you can rack up your numbers by imprisoning people for relatively low-level offenses. That's what she did, all right? So that's what pisses people off.” But both Harris and her opponents will have to act fast because the campaign has slightly more than 100 days left. “She's been in politics in the biggest state in the country, as vice president, of course, but she's still not the 100 percent well-known figure with deeply baked-in opinions that Donald Trump is,” Reinish told The Independent. “They have an opportunity to potentially move a lot of folks once they start telling her story, communicating the record, communicating the vision, it,” Pereya said. That means that Harris will need to have a spring to the finish line, from the convention to potentially debating Trump to get-out-the-vote efforts. “I think her next big thing is picking a vice president that definitely balances out her, while also kind of building on that momentum and enthusiasm behind her,” Atima Omara, a Democratic strategist in Virginia who is a member of the Democratic National Committee, told The Independent. Pereya said that the veepstakes gives Democrats an opportunity to engage with voters. “’Is it going to be Senator Kelly? Is it going to be Pete Buttigieg? Like, who is it’ to sort of keep people tuned in there all the way through until the convention, announce it at the convention,” Pereya said. “They should probably do, you know, do some sort of effort to get people engaged with the campaign and, like, sign up for text messages.” Ultimately, though, Pereya said the big challenge will be keeping voters engaged and feel like they have a voice in the campaign. “So when they harness this right, like harness this natural, organic energy, they have to harness it by deputizing all of these people that are coming out of the woodwork to essentially be deputy organizers for the campaign,” she said. “That’s how they win.”","summary":"‘You can’t manufacture this, this is all organic,’ one Democratic strategist tells The Independent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-honeymoon-campaign-trump-b2586728.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/26/22/GettyImages-2162560198.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:17:24","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":252725174,"title":"Who will Vice President Kamala Harris choose as running mate? 2 popular Democrats are being considered","text":"(WSVN) - Vice President Kamala Harris is less than two weeks away from naming her own running mate. There is a list of possible picks who are making headlines. As Harris moves closer to clinching the Democratic nomination for president, who will the current vice president pick as her running mate? The top two names that are reportedly being vetted are Mark Kelly, a U.S. senator from Arizona, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. “This is about the future of this country,” Kelly said. “You know, whether, whether we want to take this country back to 2016 and 2020 when this – the world was a much more dangerous place and Donald Trump as president of the United States. The damage he did to our alliances is – we’re still recovering.” “I endorse Kamala Harris 100% for this job as president,” Cooper said. “I’ve known her a number of years. We served as attorneys general together. She has to win.” Kelly and Cooper are among the first to throw their support behind the vice president. Both of them are popular Democrats from critical swings states, which could deliver the White House to Harris. Sen. Kelly is 60 years old, a retired Navy pilot and a NASA astronaut who has clocked in 50 days in space. His first publicly held office was after a special election to replace the seat left vacant after the late Sen. John McCain’s death. He’s married to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, a victim of gun violence. Considered a moderate, he’s worked to advocate for universal background checks and has been a critical voice of the border issue. Kelly has also voiced criticism of Arizona’s strict abortion laws. Gov. Cooper is 67 years old and is the leader of a state who last went blue in 2008 for former President Barack Obama. His decades in public service began when he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1986. Since then, he’s served as the state’s attorney general starting in 2000, until he was elected governor in 2016. Cooper’s record includes vetoing versions of a bill that ordered North Carolina sheriffs to comply with federal immigration requests, pledging to protect abortion rights his state, and he has vetoed bills aimed at banning gender-affirming health care for minors.

Many observers doubtless had a similar reaction to Jason Furman, the former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who said: “Rent control has been about as disgraced as any economic policy in the tool kit.” The rent-control plan is by far the most extreme of the administration’s policies toward landlords, but it is part of a long-term trend. Soon after Biden entered office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended a temporary eviction moratorium that had begun under President Donald Trump and had already been extended for one more month by Congress. The CDC kept extending the moratorium, despite the obvious end of the pandemic emergency, until the Supreme Court struck it down in August 2021. The administration’s offensive against landlords goes beyond the CDC and reflects a “whole of government” approach. The Department of Justice assisted an antitrust lawsuit against landlords sharing information online, which the government claimed could be used to raise rents. The Federal Trade Commission’s proposed rule against “junk fees” cited rental fees as a major target. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an “advisory” opinion threatening companies that perform background checks for landlords and others, stating that improper matches could subject them to discrimination lawsuits. Other agencies have already flirted with direct rent control. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator for the government-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said that it wanted to “limit egregious rent increases” at rental properties that receive the companies’ support. The Department of Housing and Urban Development finalized a rule to cap rents in “affordable” units supported by government tax credits, though these units were already rent-restricted, so the effect was minimal. Some of the thought behind the administration’s anti-landlord campaign can be found in its 19-page “White House Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights.” It advocates a mandatory 30 days’ notice of eviction for renters, which is far more than tenants get even in the most liberal states for nonpayment evictions, and which basically guarantees a rent-free month. It supports banning “discrimination” against renters using government vouchers, despite the obvious problems such vouchers present to landlords. The blueprint claims tenants should have the “right to organize”; in other words, it adopts the tenant movement’s idea that renters’ organizations should act like unions in negotiating with landlords. Some proponents of the White House rent-control proposal note that it would be in effect for only two years and would apply only to already built homes, and therefore wouldn’t affect new construction. But almost all rent-control laws make such promises; governments often can’t help themselves and keep expanding the laws’ reach anyway. New York began regulating older buildings’ rents in the 1950s with the implicit promise that new construction would remain uncontrolled. But in 1974, it extended control to apartments built into the 1970s. Landlords and developers, twice bitten, remained shy for decades. Even if rent control remains only on older buildings, the effects can be devastating. One comprehensive look at 206 rent-control studies shows that these laws cause landlords to withdraw units from the market or cause tenants, including wealthy ones, to stay put. As a consequence of reduced rental-housing supply, rents go up in the noncontrolled apartments. The studies also show that housing quality declines rapidly, since landlords can’t afford upkeep. Rent control was one of the main reasons The Bronx in the 1970s was littered with collapsed or dilapidated apartments. Although Biden has dropped out of the presidential race, Kamala Harris publicly endorsed the rent-control plan. Until recently, rent control seemed like an idea headed for the ash heap of history, but the White House’s proposal, even if it can’t get past Congress, is part of a general revival of the idea. In 2019, Oregon adopted the nation’s at-the-time only statewide rent-control measure, which Kamala Harris celebrated. Since then, other states and cities have expanded their rent-control programs. It’s part of a growing attack against people providing rental housing, one that will end poorly for everyone.

Less than an hour after sitting down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris pulled a 180, pushing for a cease-fire and slamming the Jewish state for “the scale of human suffering in Gaza” and “the death of far too many innocent civilians.” Greeting Bibi with one hand, stabbing him in the back with the other. After the sitdown, Harris publicly touted her “unwavering” support for Israel’s right to exist — and in the next breath, fretted for the “over 2 million people facing high levels of food insecurity and half a million people facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity.” (Notice how the switch to “food insecurity” after the data proved there is no famine, as Gazans are getting more food than they needed from aid and private groups.) Reality check: All the suffering, deaths and hunger are on Hamas, which started this war by breaking a cease-fire with its Oct. 7 atrocities — and which huddles in the hundreds of miles of tunnels and bunkers it built under Gaza’s ground by diverting billions in international aid. Israel has gone to unprecedented lengths to protect civilians; but horrors are inevitable in war, especially when Hamas continues to commit war crimes every day by hiding among civilians — and stealing their food and other relief supplies. But Harris won’t say any of that because it’s not what the left wants to hear. She somehow thinks she can convince the vast majority of Americans that she’s not a pro-Hamas radical — while placating the pro-Hamas radicals. The result: Our No. 1 Middle Eastern ally is further alienated, while the antisemitic left remains unsatisfied. Plus, Harris’ Hamas-heartening comments could hamstring Jerusalem’s effort to negotiate a hostage release and risk further escalation in the region, as Iran & Co. look to take advantage of the cracks in the US-Israel relationship. Trying to please both sides is pure cowardice, and added proof that Harris has yet to learn anything about making successful foreign policy.","summary":"After sitting down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris pulled a 180, calling for a ceasefire and slamming Israel for \"the scale of human suffering in Gaza.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/opinion/kamala-harris-two-faced-position-on-israel-is-pure-cowardice/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-10j5mnu42-1722031287272.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722017000&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:07:48","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":252725542,"title":"Armie Hammer's mother says he was 'morally wrong' but not 'criminally' following cannibalism and abuse allegations controversy","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Jul 26th 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Forget the River Seine wash-out, naked Smurf, upside down flag and Lady Gaga's ostrich act...

Email tips@dailymail.com By Eve Buckland For Dailymail.Com Published:23:01 BST, 26 July 2024 |Updated:23:06 BST, 26 July 2024 e-mail 6 shares View comments Armie Hammer's mother has broken her silence on her son's career ending cannibalism and abuse allegations. The Call Me By Your Name actor, 37, who was at the peak of his fame, fell from grace when a series of disturbing allegations were made against him by multiple women, who accused him of violent abuse and harboring cannibalism fantasies. In February 2021 his ex-girlfriend, Effie Angelova, 26, accused him of 'violently' raping and abusing her in 2017. He denied the accusations of rape through his attorney and said all of his sexual encounters were 'completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance and mutually participatory'. Dru Hammer - who has tell-all book Hammered coming out - told TMZ: 'I was very careful during the whole ordeal because my own son didn't come out and defend himself. 'I had a pastor at the time who said if you come to your own defense, it's the only defense you're ever gonna have, so we believe that God is our defense and now the truth is coming out. Armie Hammer's mother Dru has broken her silence on her son's career ending cannibalism and abuse allegations Dru Hammer - who has tell-all book Hammered coming out - told TMZ: 'I was very careful during the whole ordeal because my own son didn't come out and defend himself Referring to her son's recent interviews with Bill Maher and Piers Morgan, she said: 'He was not criminally wrong, he was morally wrong but it's changed his life forever and he's sober and he's happier than he's ever been. Read More Armie Hammer DENIES that Robert Downey Jr. paid for him to go to rehab 'And coming back to God and that's the most important thing to me.' She said things were looking 'so good' for Armie now and he was set for a return to Hollywood. Dru added that she detailed her son's scandal in her new book - and that he signed off on it with no edits, adding he said: 'I wouldn't change anything, I'm really proud of you mom.' Hammer recently confirmed his ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze's accusation that he once 'branded' her with a knife — but he claims it was 'more like a scrape' or 'tattoo.' The actor made the admission in a new interview with Piers Morgan as he seemingly tried to downplay Lorenze's disturbing version of events. At the height of Hammer's cannibalism and abuse scandal in 2021, Lorenze came forward to accuse him of 'marking and branding' her during their 'traumatic' four month relationship in 2020. The Dairy Boy founder alleged to DailyMail.com at the time that Hammer had carved his first initial into her groin with a knife and licked the blood from the wound during a kinky sexual encounter that got out of control. Referring to her son's recent interviews with Bill Maher and Piers Morgan, she said: 'He was not criminally wrong, he was morally wrong but it's changed his life forever and he's sober and he's happier than he's ever been ' - pictured 2017 with Armie's now ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers Hammer, who was at the peak of his fame, fell from grace in 2021 when a series of disturbing allegations were made against him by multiple women, who accused him of violent abuse and harboring cannibalism fantasies; seen in 2019 But Hammer claimed to Morgan on Thursday, as per Page Six, that he didn't technically 'brand' Lorenze and that blood was never drawn. 'I wouldn't say brand, no,' Hammer said.'There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' — just like the tip of a small knife.' He continued: 'I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape… It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.' Morgan pointed out that taking a knife to someone's skin is 'a bit different to a tattoo.' '[It's] less permanent. I guarantee it was such a small thing,' Hammer fired back. After Morgan confessed he was 'shocked' by the whole thing, Hammer tried to frame it as a 'romantic gesture.' 'Yes, I think to some it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture,' he explained. He also insisted that he had nothing to 'gain' from 'having a sexual experience that my partner didn't appreciate or enjoy. 'That was also a huge sense of validation for me, making this person that I'm with feel good, making this person that I'm with, I don't know if I can say this, climax,' Hammer explained to Morgan. 'Like, these were things that made me feel good and made me feel powerful, which I desperately needed, because I didn't know how to give them to myself.' Lorenze shared an image of her 'A' scar with DailyMail exclusively back in 2021 as she detailed their four-month romance. Last month Hammer revealed he is grateful for the shock cannibalism and abuse allegations which imploded his once-stellar Hollywood acting career. Speaking on the Painful Lessons podcast, the actor said of the scandal: 'Whatever it was that people said, whatever it was that happened, I'm now at a place in my life where I'm grateful for every single bit of it, He denied the accusations of rape through his attorney and said all of his sexual encounters were 'completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance and mutually participatory'; seen in 2020 'I'm actually now at a place where I'm really grateful for it because where I was in my life before all of that stuff happened to me I didn't feel good I never felt satisfied I never had enough I never was in a place where I was happy with myself where I had self-esteem. 'I never knew how to give myself love. I never knew how to give myself self-validation but I had this job where I was able to get it from so many people that I never had to learn how to give it to myself.' On being accused of cannibalism - the actor reportedly said he was '100% a cannibal' in 2021 texts - he added: 'People called me a cannibal. Like I ate people! What???? You know what you have to do to be a cannibal? You have to eat people!' He added of his downfall: 'It was an ego death, a career death. A neutron bomb went off in my life. It killed off [everything]' His then-wife Chambers split from him in July 2020 - the former couple share two young children. Hammer was told 'he had issues' but he's 'not what people are saying' in a psychiatric evaluation report - after cannibalism and abuse allegations imploded his career in 2021. The star said he had contemplated suicide during that period, saying: 'There were a lot of times when I thought I can't take this anymore. I was getting hate…so it just went right in… there was a time 'I was standing at the shore and I swam out really far and just laying there..a half-assed suicide attempt…But I thought I couldn't do that to my kids.' He admitted his Hollywood career is 'nowhere now' and said he's 'creating his own sandbox' and planning to write a screenplay.

But the U.S. also put Maduro on notice that if he claims victory without providing proof, it would “call into question” whether the international community should accept the outcome. Maduro is seeking his third term as leader of Venezuela, which is under heavy U.S. sanctions. His challenger, opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, has attracted significant support. The opposition and some independent observers have questioned whether the vote will be fair, saying decisions by electoral authorities and the arrests of some opposition campaign staff are meant to create obstacles. Senior U.S. officials said today they were closely watching the final lead-up to the election. Washington relaxed but then reinstated sanctions on Venezuela’s vital oil industry in recent months after it said Maduro’s government failed to comply with an electoral deal guaranteeing an inclusive democratic vote. The officials, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said they would not prejudge the outcome, but expressed concern about possible political repression. They also warned Venezuela’s military, which has long supported Maduro, not to “put its thumb on the scale” by interfering in the process. “The United States is prepared to calibrate our sanctions policy vis a vis events as they may unfold in Venezuela,” one U.S. official said. “As we look at the post-electoral period, we will continue to evaluate and update our sanctions policy as required based on our foreign policy goals.” The officials declined to cite any specific U.S. steps but stressed that since the Venezuelan presidential inauguration is not scheduled until January the response would likely play out over the second half of the year. Asked if Washington could drop criminal charges against Maduro to help negotiate a post-election exit, one official said if he loses, the U.S. could “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power.” The official declined to elaborate. One official said it was “deeply concerning” that Maduro’s government had limited the number of international observers. The official specifically urged Venezuelan authorities to reconsider a decision to bar a plane carrying regional ex-presidents from flying from Panama to Caracas, saying their presence was needed to provide assurances the election “will be representative of the will of Venezuelan voters.” Venezuela’s transport ministry said its airspace was operating normally. Gonzalez, a veteran former diplomat, inherited the opposition mantle from Maria Corina Machado, who enjoys wide popularity and won the opposition primary but was barred from holding public office. Maduro, a Socialist whose 2018 reelection was rejected by most Western governments as a sham, has said Venezuela has the world’s most transparent electoral system. Maduro has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions that have crippled an already-struggling oil industry. Gonzalez, 74, is known for his calm demeanor and his promises that change could bring home many migrants. Analysts have suggested that a Maduro reelection or post-election upheaval could spur more Venezuelans to leave the country and head for the U.S.-Mexico border. With immigration already a hot-button issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, that could create new problems for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seen as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on Sunday.","summary":"WASHINGTON, &#xA0;(Reuters) &#8211; The Biden administration will &#8220;calibrate&#8221; its sanctions policy towards Venezuela depending on how the high-stakes election unfolds in the OPEC nation on Sunday, U.S.\n\n\nThe article US may &#8216;calibrate&#8217; Venezuela sanctions policy post-election, officials say appeared first on Stabroek News.","url":"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/07/26/news/regional/us-may-calibrate-venezuela-sanctions-policy-post-election-officials-say/","image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/07/maduro-campaigning-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:02:58","author":"Staff Editor","authors":["Staff Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":252725544,"title":"How Celine Dion fought every day to be fit to open the Olympics: Star endured gruelling therapy for crippling and incurable Stiff Person Syndrome that 'feels like someone is strangling you'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Jul 26th 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Forget the River Seine wash-out, naked Smurf, upside down flag and Lady Gaga's ostrich act...

Her body is rigid, wracked by painful spasms caused by Stiff Person Syndrome, a rare and chronic neurological disorder. That beautiful voice, familiar to millions throughout the world, is heard wailing in despair. What more perfect way to celebrate the opening of the Paris Olympics, then, than with a gold-medal winning performance by the 56-year-old singer who, two years on, has fought her way back from ill health with as much determination and grit as any world-class athlete. Her triumphant return to the stage at Friday night’s opening ceremony in the French capital brings to an end wide-spread fears that her incurable autoimmune disease might spell the career end of one of the most famous singers on the planet. How Celine Dion fought every day to be fit to close the Olympics 2024 Opening Ceremony During one of the most harrowing scenes from her much-watched Amazon Prime documentary, Celine is seen in the throes of a terrifying seizure Celine's triumphant return to the stage at Friday night’s opening ceremony in the French capital brought to an end fears her incurable autoimmune disease would end her career But as anyone who watched the documentary ‘I Am: Celine Dion’ will know, even when her health was at its lowest, leaving her struggling to move and even to sing, the star refused to give up. ‘If I can’t run, I’ll walk. If I can’t walk, I’ll crawl. But I won’t stop,’ she said during one of her darkest moments. Over the past few months, hellbent on making her come-back, Dion has been undergoing daily physical and vocal therapy, battling against an incredibly rare condition which was first diagnosed in 1956 and affects only one in a million people. Read More Celine Dion puts on an animated display as fans swarm outside her hotel in Paris As recently as April, she told French Vogue that she didn’t know when she would return to the stage, but added: ‘There’s one thing that will never stop, and that’s the will. It’s the passion. It’s the dream. It’s the determination.’ Such words which will no doubt chime with the hundreds of elite athletes from around the globe who are poised to chase down medals in the fortnight ahead. The Olympic motto - Citius, Altius, Fortius - Faster, Higher, Stronger - might even have been written for the Canadian star who has battled miscarriage, infertility, IVF and bereavement as well as ill health. No wonder the French were so desperate to have her in Paris on Friday night, dressed in Dior, belting out the iconic Gallic song ‘La Vie En Rose’ in a voice millions of fans feared they would never hear again. Who better to embody the Olympic spirit and light up the greatest sporting event in the world? Dion’s starring role at the opening ceremony was kept under wraps until the last minute. Even after she was spotted in Paris earlier this week, President Macron refused to reveal if she would be performing during an interview with the TV channel France 2. What more perfect way to celebrate the opening of the Paris Olympics than with a gold-medal winning performance by the singer? (Pictured in June) But, as anyone who watched the documentary ‘I Am: Celine Dion’ will know, even when Celine's health left her struggling to move and even to sing, the star refused to give up ‘If I can’t run, I’ll walk. If I can’t walk, I’ll crawl. But I won’t stop,’ she said during one of her darkest moments Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), her autoimmune disease of one-in-a-million rarity, has paralyzed her voice and stolen her ability to sing In April, Celine said she did not know when she would return, but said: ‘There’s one thing that will never stop, and that’s the will. It’s the passion. It’s the dream. It’s the determination’ ‘Apparently she has arrived in Paris. It’s great!’ he teased. ‘I would be immensely happy if she could be at the this opening ceremony, like all our compatriots.’ In April, while discussing her health, Dion herself appeared to hint that a possible comeback lay ahead after four years out of the limelight, telling Vogue France: ‘The way I see it, I have two choices. 'Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it’s over. I stay at home, listen to my songs, stand in front of the mirror and sing to myself. Read More Celine Dion fans hail documentary as 'raw' and 'honest' ‘I’ve chosen to work with all my body and soul, from head to toe, with a medical team. I want to be the best I can be. My goal is to see the Eiffel Tower again!’ In many ways the story of Dion’s life has always been one of dedication, hard work and, over the past couple of decades - when life threw one problem at her after another - of triumph over adversity. Born in March 1968, the youngest of 14 children born into a French-speaking family in Quebec in Canada, the Dions were not well-off but her musical mother, Therese, recognised and supported her daughter’s musical talent. She was just 12 when she wrote her first song, which her mother sent to impresario René Angélil. After hearing her sing, he signed her on the spot and then remortgaged his house to finance her first album. That fairytale beginning was followed with gruelling years of hard work. Her first Canadian TV performance in 1981 was followed by first prize at the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo. The same year, she appeared on the popular French TV show Champs-Élysées where the host, after hearing her sing, announced: ‘Remember her name: Celine Dion.’ By 1988, when she won the Eurovision song contest in Dublin, representing Switzerland with the French song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi, she was well on her way to becoming a global star, known for her soaring power ballads. Dion’s starring role at the opening ceremony was kept under wraps until the last minute. Even after she was spotted in Paris earlier this week, French President Macron (pictured) kept mum She hinted at her return in April, saying: ‘The way I see it, I have two choices. 'Either I train like an athlete and work super hard, or I switch off and it’s over' She was just 12 when she wrote her first song, which her mother sent to impresario René Angélil. After hearing her sing, he signed her on the spot and then remortgaged his house to finance her first album Her successes in the decades that followed are too numerous to recount in their entirety but some of the highlights deserve mention. The 1992 theme tune to the Disney film ‘Beauty and the Beast’ on which Dion duetted, went to number one around the world and won a Grammy and an Oscar. Falling Into You was the biggest-selling album worldwide of 1996. The Titanic film hit My Heart Will Go On, won Best Original Song Oscar in 1998 and featured on the best-selling film sound track ever. Read More My titanic struggle to have children and why I want more: Celine Dion speaks out about motherhood By then, Dion was married to her manager, René, who was 26 years her senior, but while her career went from strength to strength, their six-year struggle to start a family caused them private heartache. To complicate matters further, René was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1999. Before beginning radiation treatment, the couple turned to IVF. Dion gave birth to her eldest son, René-Charles, in January 2001 after just one round of treatment. After completing her Las Vegas residency in 2007, she and René decided to try IVF again but Dion miscarried soon after announcing she was pregnant. After five further attempts at IVF, she announced she was pregnant again, this time with triplets, in May 2010. Aged 42, she subsequently miscarried one of the babies and gave birth to twins, Nelson and Eddy, in October that year. By 1988, when she won the Eurovision song contest in Dublin, representing Switzerland with the French song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi By 1994, she and René, who was 26 years her senior, were married, but soon their six-year struggle to start a family caused them private heartache The couple turned to IVF and Dion gave birth to her eldest son, René-Charles, in January 2001 after just one round of treatment (pictured 2015) In a bid to make the painful subjects of infertility and miscarriage less taboo, Dion has spoken openly about the difficulties she faced in becoming a mother. ‘It’s life, you know,’ she told Oprah Winfrey back in 2010 before her final successful pregnancy. ‘A lot of people are going through this but it’s not being told.’ Read More Celine Dion says husband's death pushed her to fight harder amid stiff person syndrome battle But the couple’s happiness was short-lived. Just six years later, Dion lost her 73-year-old husband, the love of her life, to throat cancer. Two days after his death, one of her brothers also died. While grappling with bereavement and comforting her children, Dion was already experiencing the early symptoms of Stiff Person Syndrome. She felt the first signs in 2008 when during her ‘Taking Chances World Tour’ she had difficult controlling her voice and noticed her muscles becoming stiff. ‘It’s like somebody is strangling you. It’s like somebody is pushing your larynx/pharynx this way,’ she said, demonstrating with her hands. Earlier this year she told French Vogue that was actively working against her condition, which is incurable. ‘I work on my toes, my knees, my calves, my fingers, my singing, my voice...I have to learn to live with it now and stop questioning myself.’ Celine and all her children and a friend (centre) René-Charles, 23, is far left and twins Nelson and Eddy, 13, far right and second from right. All pictured in Las Vegas in July Dion has said to her children: 'You lost your dad [to throat cancer] but mom has a condition and it’s different. I’m not going to die. It’s something that I’m going to learn to live with’ Above all, she said, she was fighting for her three sons, now aged 23 and 13, because ‘they already lost a parent’. ‘I let them know, “You lost your dad but mom has a condition and it’s different. I’m not going to die. It’s something that I’m going to learn to live with.’ Read More EXCLUSIVE Celine Dion WILL sing at the 2024 Paris Olympics - as her eye-watering bill is revealed Ongoing speculation about Dion’s return to the stage reached fever pitch earlier this week after she was spotted in Paris, staying at the same hotel as Lady Gaga, the Royal Monceau near the Champs-Elysées. The pair, it was said, would be duetting together at Friday night’s glittering Olympic floating opening ceremony on the Seine, singing a song by Edith Piaf which has come to epitomise French culture with its lyrics about the beauty of life. As the big day drew closer, Dion appeared to confirm the news, posting footage of herself on Instagram which showed her walking into the Louvre gallery. Her glamorous, healthy appearance was a world away from the frail woman she fearlessly allowed the world to see in her documentary which was released in the UK last month. Expressing her love for the French capital while she took in the artworks on display, she appeared emotional about her long-awaited come back. ‘Every time I return to Paris, I remember there’s so much beauty and joy still to experience in the world,’ she said. STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME: INCURABLE NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION THAT LOCKS THE BODY Stiff person syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that makes the muscles in the torso and limbs alternate between spasming and being rigid. Estimates suggest it affects around 70 people in the UK and 330 in the US and remains little understood. Around twice as many women as men are hit with it. The progressive disease sees patients' stiffness increase over time and can lead to them needing to use a wheelchair. There tend to be three types of the syndrome: Classical person man syndrome: When rigidity and spasms are around the back and stomach, and occasionally thighs and neck. It can cause back curvature over time. Stiff limb syndrome: Spasms especially affect the legs and feet, occasionally causing them to become fixed in place. Hands can also be affected. Jerking stiff person syndrome: The rarest, most aggressive form, which includes symptoms from both the others, and also affects the head and eyes. Experts do not know exactly what is behind the disease. But they believe it may be caused by an autoimmune reaction, when the body attacks its own nerve cells that control muscle movement. Around 40 per cent of sufferers also have type 1 diabetes, another autoimmune disease. Type 1 diabetes is particularly associated with classical person syndrome. Other autoimmune conditions like vitiligo, which causes white patches of skin, and pernicious anemia are likewise associated with it. It is also more common in people with breast, lung, kidney, thyroid or colon cancer, as well as lymphomas, but researchers do not yet know why. In stiff person syndrome, the immune system attacks a protein that helps make gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which regulate motor neurons — the nerves that control movement. Low levels of GABA cause the neurons to continuously fire when they are not supposed to, resulting in the spasms and rigidity. What are its symptoms? The main symptoms caused by stiff person syndrome are spasms and rigidity of the torso and limbs. Spasms can be triggered by loud noises, with the condition also causing heightened sensitivity to sound. Touch and emotional distress can also be felt more intensely as a result of the condition. The spasms can be so severe they cause people to fall over or lead to difficulty walking and other disability. Stress and anxiety are also usually higher in those with the condition, particularly because of the unpredictability of spasms. The lack of GABA — which regulates anxiety — in their system also affects mental health.

She was there to lift the spirits of blindsided staffers, who after 15 months of toiling to re-elect the president, suddenly found themselves working for her. ‘It is my great honor to have Joe’s endorsement in this race,’ she boasted to cheers from a crowd who were now on her payroll. But as the assembled readily applauded, some must have harbored private concerns. For, behind the recent public self-branding of Harris as a kindly, jovial ‘Momala’, she has earned a nasty reputation as an alleged ‘soul-destroying’ workplace ‘bully’. Only four of the initial 71 staffers hired by Harris during her first year in office still remain in a job. The rest either quit or were fired, according to analysis by non-partisan watchdog Open The Books. That translates to a 92 percent staff turnover rate – and, say critics, is a likely sign that the issues on Team Harris have more to do with her than anyone else. During research for my recent Harris biography (‘Amateur Hour’, published in January), the horror stories I heard from many of her former employees and read about in numerous reports – shocked me. As far back as the 2010s, when Harris served as California’s Attorney General, she was allegedly known for running a ‘toxic’ workplace. Barbara O’Connor, a professor at California State University, Sacramento claimed that students who worked for Harris as interns frequently came back to her crying and saying that they ‘felt they weren’t valued.’ After Harris was elected in 2017 to represent California in the US Senate, working conditions reportedly did not improve. Analysis showed her office had the ninth-highest staff turnover rate out of the 114 senators who served between 2017 and 2020. Congressional sources told the Mail that she would berate subordinates in expletive-laden tirades. Even those working for Republican lawmakers allegedly got caught in the crossfire. In one instance, reported in my book, sources described how Harris lashed out at a room full of Senate staffers during the highly contentious 2018 Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh. On September 28 of that year, as Kavanaugh’s nomination moved forward despite liberal outrage over allegations he’d sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford three decades earlier, Harris and her colleagues staged a walkout from the hearings. Later, Harris was said to explode in anger outside the main Judiciary Committee room. Witnesses recalled Harris cursing and ordering around staffers who did not even work for her. ‘Anyone who’s staff, get the f*** out of here!’ she allegedly yelled. Harris’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on these allegations. Years later, amid the dramatic and rapid collapse of Harris’s 2020 presidential bid, this allegedly troubling behavior began to be leaked to the public. In a sensational resignation letter shared with the New York Times in November 2019, Harris’s then State Operations Director Kelly Mehlenbacher slammed her boss, saying: ‘I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly.’ She continued: ‘It is not acceptable to me that we encouraged people to move from Washington, DC to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice.’ ‘Morale has never been lower,’ she added, saying there was no ‘real plan’ for how Harris might win, but that she hoped her departure ‘might result in some serious consideration of […] our internal communications’. But as Harris’s failed campaign then descended into nasty blame-shifting and finger-pointing, Biden threw her a political lifeline, tapping her to be his running mate and effectively saving her skin. Just a few months into Biden’s administration, troubling stories about her management style surfaced once again. In June 2021, Politico spoke to 22 individuals familiar with Harris’s VP office who all claimed that her team was experiencing ‘low morale, porous lines of communication and diminished trust among aides and senior officials.’ ‘It’s not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like s***,’ one source said. A Biden administration official claimed Harris was responsible: ‘It all starts at the top.’ That sentiment was shared by Gil Duran, an ex-aide to Harris who worked in her Attorney General’s office and quit after five months. ‘What is the common denominator through all this?’ he said, ‘It’s her.’ Harris’s then-press secretary, Symone Sanders, tried to defend her boss, accusing complaining staffers of being soft. ‘We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day,’ Sanders told Politico. ‘What I hear is that people have hard jobs and I’m like “welcome to the club”.’ Just five months later, Sanders, a political veteran who had once worked for infamously cantankerous Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (no relation), left Harris’s office as well. ‘I’m so grateful to the VP for her vote of confidence from the very beginning,’ Sanders said. But then the dam broke. Multiple staffers who worked for Harris before she was Vice President told the Washington Post in December 2021 how she’d reportedly refuse to prepare for public appearances and blame her aides when she then underperformed. ‘It’s clear [with Harris] that you’re not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work,’ one ex-aide said. ‘With Kamala you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you’re constantly sort of propping up a bully and it’s not really clear why.’ In the summer of 2021 – and reported by CNN – Harris was said to have been ‘prepped extensively by her team’ on how she could respond to questions about why she’d not yet visited the southern border, despite her role as White House ‘border czar’. But when the time came to deliver her answer, Harris botched her interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. ‘We’ve been to the border,’ she told Holt in June of that year. ‘You haven’t been to the border,’ he replied. ‘I haven’t been to Europe,’ Harris clapped back with an awkward laugh. ‘I don’t understand the point that you’re making.’ The flippant response resulted in one of the most damaging public appearances of her entire White House tenure. She didn’t do another one-on-one interview for nearly a year. At other times, and perhaps as a result of the Holt disaster, Harris reportedly began to over-prepare for some events. In April 2022 – having been invited to a salon-style dinner at the home of David Bradley, a heavyweight DC media mogul – she was said to be so anxious about that she held a ‘mock dinner’ with staffers who acted out the roles of dinner guests, Axios reported. Speaking exclusively to the Mail, political strategists who have previously worked for Harris say the root of her problems is that she overly relies on a trusted, though under-qualified inner circle that includes her sister Maya Harris and brother-in-law Tony West, a former Obama Justice Department official. Neither are professional political strategists. Team Harris appears to now be leaking to the media that attempts are underway to bring former Obama adviser David Plouffe and ex-Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on board. But, in truth, I’m told the efforts appear to be more wishful thinking to reassure donors rather than a reality. On Monday, Harris announced that Biden campaign chief Jen O’Malley Dillon would remain on duty – as would senior Biden advisor Julie Chavez Rodriguez who previously worked for Harris in her Senate office and on her 2020 presidential race. In a May interview on actress Drew Barrymore’s talk show, Harris played the magnanimous boss. ‘It’s really important to be around people who love you, who are about you and who are going to be honest with you,’ she said. As she now prepares to tackle the monumental task of running a presidential campaign in just four months, the question for Harris will surely be whether she’s prepared to listen to that honest feedback.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris was all smiles when she arrived at Joe Biden&#8217;s former&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former Staff Expose Shocking Details of Kamala Harris&#8217;s Degrading Behavior and Bullying, Resulting in Unprecedented Quit Rates first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/former-staff-expose-shocking-details-of-kamala-harriss-degrading-behavior-and-bullying-resulting-in-unprecedented-quit-rates/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-the-039soul-destroying-bully039-Former-staff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:00:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":252724768,"title":"U.S. Antitrust Enforcers Should Reject AI Interventionism","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden hands Vice President Kamala Harris the pen he ... [+] used to sign a new executive order regarding artificial intelligence during an event in the East Room of the White House on October 30, 2023 in Washington, DC. President Biden issued the executive order directing his administration to create a new chief AI officer, track companies developing the most powerful AI systems, adopt stronger privacy policies and \"both deploy AI and guard against its possible bias,\" creating new safety guidelines and industry standards. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty Images The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, in tandem with their fellow competition law enforcers from Europe (the European Commission, or EC) and the United Kingdom (the Competition & Markets Authority, or CMA), issued a joint statement on July 23, styled “Joint Statement on Competition in Generative AI Foundation Models and AI Products.” This Joint Statement touts enforcer’s concerns with theoretical competitive harms from AI foundation models, which are “artificial intelligence models that are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with minimal fine-tuning.” The Statement, however, is highly problematic. It gives short shrift to the substantial economic benefits of AI and provides and misrepresents AI’s competitive risks and gives short shrift to the substantial economic benefits of AI. Unless it is disavowed by American enforcers, the Statement will at the margin reduce private investment in the adoption and deployment of AI, slowing innovation and harming the economy. Furthermore, its negative effects will fall disproportionately on U.S. firms, which are leaders in AI. This will undermine U.S. international competitiveness. The Joint Statement Misrepresents AI’s Competitive Risks The Joint Statement focuses on a variety of potential competitive threats arising primarily from huge high tech firms (such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft). It specifically is concerned about: MORE FOR YOU Apple iPhone 16 Pro: New Leak Reveals Powerful Design Upgrade Incoming, Report Says Leak Reveals A ‘Big’ Fed Earthquake Could Suddenly Smash The Price Of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP And Crypto Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Friday, July 26 Concentrated control of key inputs. These include “[s]pecialized chips, substantial compute, data at scale, and specialist technical expertise.” This could put “a small number of companies in a position to exploit existing or emerging bottlenecks across the AI stack and to have outsized influence over the future development of these tools. This could allow a small number of big companies to shape innovation “to their own advantage, at the expense of fair competition that benefits the public and our economies.” Entrenching or extending market power in AI-related markets. Foundation models purportedly benefit “digital firms [that] already enjoy strong accumulated advantages. For example, platforms may have substantial market power at multiple levels related to the AI stack. This can give these firms the ability to protect against AI-driven disruption, or harness it to their particular advantage”. Arrangements involving key players that could amplify risks. “Partnerships, financial investments, and other connections between firms related to the development of generative AI have been widespread to date.” These “could be used by major firms to undermine or coopt competitive threats and steer market outcomes in their favor at the expense of the public.” The Joint Statement also stresses that “common principles to enable competition and foster innovation” in AI are “fair dealing,” “interoperability” of products and services across platforms, and “choices among diverse products and business models” for businesses and consumers. But there’s a big problem. The theoretical concerns about the manipulation of AI to promote “control of key inputs,” “entrenchment,” and “anticompetitive arrangements” are at odds with reality. Professor Jonathan Barnett of the University of Southern California recently addressed the concerns the Statement raises in a detailed factual analysis of the state of AI competition: “Relying on the assumption that digital platform markets are prone to converge on entrenched monopoly outcomes, some commentators and regulators favor intervening preemptively in the [AI] ecosystem. This contribution assesses whether there are reasonable antitrust grounds for taking such action. Available evidence indicates that technically competitive entrants can generally secure access to the inputs required to achieve entry, including funding, semiconductors, cloud-computing services, datasets, and foundation models. Consistent with this view, entry into the models and applications segments of the [AI] ecosystem is especially robust. Investments and alliances involving large technology platforms, venture-capital, and institutional investors, and model developers, which have elicited regulatory concern, currently appear to be efficient arrangements to aggregate the complementary assets required to produce [AI] models and applications and face competition from other business models.” The Joint Statement is not only wrong on the facts. Its “common principles” that should guide enforcement are also flawed. “Fair dealing” may sound good, but it is a subjective standard that may be applied to benefit companies favored by government at the expense of others that are more efficient. In reality, vigorous competition on the merits that benefits the economy ultimately is the “fairest” outcome for all. Mandating “interoperability” among high tech platforms raises multiple problems. It may promote collusion among firms (the prime evil of antitrust), and it is hard to enforce, requiring error-ridden oversight by courts. This oversight is costly and time-consuming. Interoperability also imposes expensive design requirements on high tech platforms, allowing third party “free riders” to gain access. This reduces platforms’ incentives to invest in service improvements, to the detriment of platforms’ clients. Dynamic competition is reduced, not enhanced. Promoting “choice” in isolation is a meaningless concept. Competitive markets in general deliver a wide variety of new offerings for consumers. Allowing government to decide what and how many “choices” are appropriate involves second-guessing market outcomes, a role for which government is ill-equipped. The Joint Statement Does Not Factor In AI’s Benefits The Joint Statement spins its wheels contemplating imagined AI-related competitive harms, while ignoring the economic benefits bestowed by AI. The potential economic gains from AI are enormous. A 2023 analysis by Goldman Sachs found that AI “could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.” Studies show that specific AI benefits include increased worker productivity, innovation across the economy (with major gains in specific fields, such as health care), and scientific advancement. Indeed, “[a] study by Accenture found that artificial intelligence could add $14 trillion to the global economy by 2035 with the most significant gains in China and North America. The study also predicted that AI could increase labor productivity by up to 40% in some industries.” Moreover, analysis indicates that by “leverag[ing] vast amounts of data and predict outcomes. AI can significantly improve decision-making. It can optimize production, enhance product quality, and reduce waste.” The DOJ And the FTC Should Disavow the Joint Statement The Joint Statement casts a pall on AI without justification. As such, it may be expected to detract from aggressive, welfare-enhancing investments in AI improvements. It may also curtail innovative joint arrangements among digital platforms and small AI innovators (of which there are many), thus diminishing innovation-driven competition. U.S. AI leadership may be threatened. The losers will be American consumers and businesses. The FTC and the DOJ therefore should publicly disavow the Joint Statement, which reflects the ill-considered precautionary and regulatory mindset of European competition enforcers. The U.S. leads in high tech innovation, while the Europeans are laggards. The last thing the U.S. should do is emulate European high tech competition policy. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Now, just days after the Republican National Convention ended in Milwaukee, a new Fox News survey shows Wisconsinites give the advantage to Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris -- by 1 point. Harris receives 49% support to Trump’s 50%. In April, it was 48% each for Biden and Trump, and it was also tied in January (47% apiece). In June 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump’s 40%. Trump’s edge is mainly due to an expanded 14-point lead among men, up from an 8-point lead over Biden in April. He is also favored over Harris among White men without a college degree (by 20 points), rural voters (+15), and White voters (+2). Harris receives a bit more support among Democrats (96%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but he makes up the difference by having a 4-point advantage among Independents. HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP Some of Harris’ best groups include urban voters (+19 over Trump), Whites with a college degree (+18), and suburban women (+13). Her numbers roughly match or are a bit higher than Biden’s were in April among Whites without a college degree (+5), Independents (+5), voters under 35 (+4), women (+3), Democrats (+1), Whites (+1), and those ages 65 and over (-1). The biggest shift is among \"double haters\" (voters with unfavorable views of both Trump and Biden). Trump was ahead by 1 point in April, but they now favor Harris by 25 points. There are too few Harris-Trump double haters to breakout by vote preference. Trump is favored by 3 points among new voters (haven’t voted in four most recent general elections), and union households go for him by 2 points, which is different from what we see in a couple of other northern industrial states. Union voters prefer Harris by 6 points in Michigan and by 15 points in Minnesota. Biden’s personal favorable rating was negative by 10 points in April and now he’s underwater by 12. It’s the reverse for Trump, who went from being underwater by 10 points to negative 5 in the new survey. Harris is more popular than both at 49% favorable and 49% unfavorable. JD Vance’s favorability is negative by 7 points, while 15% are unable to rate him. TRUMP TO RETURN TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR FIRST TIME SINCE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT Fifteen percent of Wisconsin voters say they are getting ahead financially, up from 11% six months ago. Still, most continue to feel they are holding steady (41%) or falling behind (43%). By far, the economy will be the deciding issue this fall. It’s the top priority for 37%, trailed by abortion and immigration at 15% each. All other issues are in the single digits. Majorities of those prioritizing the economy and immigration back Trump (by 38 and 81 points respectively), while those putting abortion as their top issue prefer Harris by 78 points. \"This poll shows Harris in a slightly stronger position in Wisconsin than Biden based on personal favorability,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose company Beacon Research conducts Fox News surveys along with Republican Daron Shaw. \"However, with many voters feeling strained financially and union households breaking for Trump, she has work to do convincing voters they’ll be better off continuing with a Democrat in the White House.\" In a potential 5-way race, Harris and Trump tie at 46% each, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. receiving 5%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each. Support for Kennedy was 9% in April. Kennedy takes more support from Trump (6%) than Harris (2%), but it evens out because the other candidates also take from her (3%). The large 75% approval of Biden withdrawing from the presidential race is widespread, as it includes 88% of Democrats and two-thirds of Republicans (65%) and Independents (69%). That consensus disappears on the issue of Biden finishing his term: 92% of Democrats and 58% Independents think he should, while 57% of Republicans think he should resign. Overall, two-thirds think he should stick around. In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump’s 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes). Poll-pourri In the senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads likely Republican challenger Eric Hovde by a 54-43% margin, running 5 points ahead of Harris’ support in the presidential race. (The Wisconsin primary is August 13.) More Trump supporters are ticket splitters, as 83% of his backers favor Hovde, while 96% of Harris supporters go for Baldwin. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Overall, three-quarters of Wisconsin voters say they are extremely motivated to vote in the presidential election, and they split 50% Harris vs. 49% Trump. That’s because slightly more Harris supporters (76%) than Trump supporters (73%) say they are extremely motivated. Fully 84% of Wisconsin Democrats want Harris to replace Biden as their party’s nominee -- no other candidate gets more than 2% support. Conducted July 22-24, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,046 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (127) and cellphones (649) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (270). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with subgroup results is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.

This comes two weeks after the former president was shot in an assassination attempt in the Keystone State, and one week after President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed Harris. The state of the race is similar to where it was in April, when Biden and Trump were tied 48-48%. The survey, released Friday, shows Harris and Trump locked in a tie at 49-49% -- barely different from what the final election results were in 2020 (49.85% Biden vs. 48.69% Trump). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since April, Harris has held on to most of Biden’s coalition while Trump’s groups have stayed firm, but there are a few notable shifts in voting patterns from the spring. Trump has closed the gap with voters under 30 (-27 points in April to -4 points today), voters 65 and over (-5 to -1), suburban women (-32 to -12), those with a college degree (-18 to -10) and has widened it slightly among Independents (+8 to +9). FLASHBACK: HARRIS TRIED TO DEFUND BORDER PATROL AGENTS, SLASH ICE BUDGET Harris has narrowed the gap among White men without a degree (-34 points to -28 points). Seven in 10 Pennsylvanians are extremely motivated to vote this year, with Democrats slightly more enthusiastic (75%) than Republicans (72%), and Independents decidedly less enthused at 43%. Overall, those extremely motivated to vote are a bit more likely to back Harris (51% to 49% Trump). The expanded ballot shows Harris with a 2-point edge: 45% Harris, 43% Trump, 7% Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West with 1% each. Third parties hurt Trump here as 10% of his two-way supporters go for someone else compared to 7% of Harris’ supporters. Voters are split on Harris’ favorable rating: 49-49%. Still, views of her are better than Biden (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable) or Trump (46-53%). Those with negative views of both Biden and Trump back Harris by 41 points. In April, Biden was up by only 27 points among these so-called double haters. \"While the horserace remains deadlocked, there’s more under the surface to suggest Democrats are in a significantly better position in Pennsylvania than in April,\" says Democrat Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. \"The Democrat at the top of the ticket is now more favorable than Trump and Democrats are more motivated, and the key group of double haters are breaking more heavily for Harris than they were for Biden.\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is widely considered to be on Harris’ shortlist of potential running mates, receives a 61% favorable rating -- the highest of any individual tested. His rating has improved by 10 points since July 2022 when he was campaigning for governor. The survey also finds he does better than Harris in a hypothetical matchup against Trump: Shapiro 54% to Trump’s 44%, for a 10-point lead. That is outside the margin of error. That’s because Shapiro outperforms Harris among key groups such as women, White voters, those under age 30 and over 65, college graduates, Republicans, Independents, and suburban voters. He does slightly worse with nonwhites compared to Harris. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was also tested against Trump. She fares about the same as Harris: 48% Whitmer vs. 49% for Trump in a potential matchup. Her favorable rating sits at 38% favorable vs. 34% unfavorable while 28% can’t rate her. Those receiving the lowest favorable ratings are Trump’s running mate JD Vance (38% favorable, 47% unfavorable) and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar (32-35%), although 15% can’t rate Vance and 33% can’t rate Klobuchar. TRUMP QUICKLY MOVES TO DEFINE HARRIS AS ‘MORE LEFT THAN BERNIE SANDERS’ Biden’s job approval rating is down slightly from April, underwater by 12 points (44% approve, 56% disapprove) compared to 10 points in the spring (45-55%). One factor keeping the race tight is that voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden go for Trump by only 5 points. And while 78% approve of Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race, two-thirds say he should finish his term (65% finish term, 33% resign). Majorities of Democrats (86%), Republicans (69%), and Independents (78%) support Biden stepping aside from the campaign. Democrats and Independents think he should finish his term as president, while Republicans are more likely to want him to resign. Overall, 47% want Harris to replace Biden, including 74% of self-identified Democrats. Shapiro comes in second among both groups for replacing Biden (20% all voters, 14% Democrats). Just 2% of voters want Whitmer or Klobuchar. Shapiro and Whitmer are set to campaign for Harris in Pennsylvania on Monday. Four in 10 Pennsylvanians say the economy will be the most important issue to them when voting this fall. That’s the highest of the issues tested and comes as three times as many voters say they are falling behind (44%) rather than getting ahead financially (14%). Another 4 in 10 (42%) are holding steady. The only other issues in double digits are immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All others are under 10%. \"Even more so than in other battleground states, the economy is everything in Pennsylvania,\" says Shaw. \"Trump’s edge on the economy in general, and inflation in particular, is why he is better positioned now than he was four years ago, and that’s the biggest problem for Harris.\" Economy and immigration voters back Trump by 31 and 86 points respectively, while abortion voters back Harris by 67 points. A few more things… In the Senate race, incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania leads Republican challenger David McCormick by 13 points. It also shows he performs better than Harris does against Trump, with Casey getting 55% support to McCormick’s 42%. Some 15% of Trump supporters switch sides to Casey while just 3% of Harris backers defect to McCormick.

A majority of voters support Harris in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 52% to 46%, nearly matching the 2020 vote (52.40% Biden, 45.28% Trump). These results sit right at the margin of sampling error. The survey was completed after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump and Biden’s July 21 withdrawal announcement and endorsement of Harris. Harris is bolstered by strong support from urban voters (65%), suburban women (63%), White voters with a college degree (60%), women (58%), voters ages 65 and over (58%), union households (57%), and Independents (53%). JOE BIDEN'S HEALTH: LEADERSHIP ABILITY QUESTIONS MOUNT AS OVAL OFFICE SPEECH GAVE NO REASON FOR EXITING RACE Trump’s coalition consists of White evangelical Christians (69%), White men with no college degree (59%), rural voters (56%), men under age 45 (54%), and voters under age 30 (52%). Harris has stronger ideological (93% of liberal voters back her) and party support (95% of Democrats) than Trump (81% of conservatives and 93% of Republicans). Nearly 7 in 10 Minnesotans are extremely motivated to vote this November and they go for Harris by 7 points.

Slightly more two-way Trump supporters defect to third parties (10%) than Harris supporters (7%). Kennedy is currently the only third-party candidate on the ballot in Minnesota. Harris’ personal favorable rating is higher than Biden’s by 9 points. She also receives a net positive rating of 4 points (51% favorable vs. 47% unfavorable) versus a negative rating by 14 points for Biden (42-56%). Still, neither is as high as Amy Klobuchar, the senior U.S. Democratic Senator from Minnesota, who checks in at 57% favorable vs. 38% unfavorable. Other possible replacements for Biden are in positive territory but are much less well known in Minnesota: Whitmer (39% favorable, 33% unfavorable, 28% can’t rate) and Shapiro (33% favorable, 27% unfavorable, 40% can’t rate). The president’s job performance rating is higher than his personal favorability rating: 46% approve while 53% disapprove. Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race is met with high approval (83%). More Democrats (90%) approve than Independents (83%) or Republicans (76%). While majorities approve of the decision to withdraw, by more than 2 to 1 voters still think he should finish his term: 68% finish vs. 30% resign. Trump’s favorable rating is underwater by 13 points (43% favorable, 56% unfavorable) while his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance is underwater by 8 points and lesser known (37% favorable, 45% unfavorable, 18% can’t rate).

The top issue for Minnesota voters when it comes to their vote this fall is the economy at 33%, with more than twice as many saying they are falling behind financially (43%) as say they are getting ahead (17%). Four in 10 say they are holding steady (39%). Immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) follow the economy as the second and third most important issues. All other issues tested are in the single digits. The top issue for Democrats is abortion (24%) while for Republicans (44%) and Independents (39%) it is the economy. Overall, those who point to the economy as the most important issue back Trump by 33 points, while immigration voters support him by an even greater 83 points. Those who say abortion is their top issue favor Harris by 63 points. \"The prospect of Republicans bringing Minnesota into play this fall appears less likely with Harris at the top of the ticket,\" says Anderson. \"She is viewed favorably by a narrow majority, while larger majorities are unfavorable toward both Trump and Biden.

I'd want to. I think it's important,\" Trump said Tuesday when asked by Fox News' Bill Melugin on a conference call with reporters if he would commit to debating Harris at least once. \"I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually,\" Trump said. Minutes later, Trump noted, \"I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden.\" The Trump campaign said Thursday he will not participate in a debate until Democrats finalize their nominee because it \"would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds.\" Harris criticized that position from the Trump campaign as \"backpedaling.\"","summary":"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg&apos;s slam on former President Trump over presidential debates was mocked by conservatives on social media Friday.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-ripped-for-extraordinarily-brazen-slam-on-trump-that-critics-say-was-accidental-dunk-on-biden","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/931/523/file-50.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 22:00:08","author":"Andrew Miller","authors":["Andrew Miller"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":252724944,"title":"Fox News Poll: Dead heat between Harris and Trump in Michigan","text":"The presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is tied in Michigan, a state widely seen as a \"must have\" for Democrats. Harris exceeds President Joe Biden’s performance among some key voting blocs, and that makes it a dead-even race for the first time this year, according to a Fox News survey of Michigan voters conducted after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump each garner 49% support. Trump was ahead of Biden by 3 points in April and by 2 points in February. In the wake of being unofficially embraced as the party’s nominee, Harris received higher support than Biden did in April, while Trump’s number held steady despite the survey being conducted soon after the Republican National Convention and a failed assassination attempt. Here’s why the race is a tossup: Men favor Trump by 13 points, while women back Harris by 12. Voters ages 45 and over prefer Trump by 2 points, but Harris is the choice among voters under 35 by 5 points. Whites without a college degree pick Trump by 15 points, while Whites with a degree go for Harris by 3 points and voters of color back her by 39 points. Harris also receives support from union households (+6 points), and she trails by only 9 points among those who \"somewhat\" disapprove of Biden’s job performance. NETANYAHU REPORTEDLY UPSET WITH HARRIS OVER VP'S ISRAEL REMARKS AS WHITE HOUSE PUSHES BACK Other groups backing Trump include Independents (+8 points), rural voters (+20), and White evangelical Christians (+48). Compared to Biden in April, Harris performs better with Democrats (by 3 points), men (+5), Whites without a college degree (+6), Black voters (+7), voters under age 35 (+ 12), and those with negative views of both Biden and Trump (double haters +23). She does worse than Biden among voters ages 65 and over (-3 points) and suburban women (-2). \"Harris does slightly better with some key Democratic constituencies and heightened enthusiasm on the left is real,\" says Daron Shaw, a Republican who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"However, Democrats were completely depressed over Biden, and he was hemorrhaging support among young people and nonwhites, so it’s a pretty low bar.\" Overall, 7 in 10 say they are extremely motivated to vote this year, and they back Trump over Harris by 1 point. DOOCY GRILLS WHITE HOUSE ON CLAIMS THAT HARRIS WAS NEVER ‘BORDER CZAR’ About 5 in 10 Michigan voters say they are falling behind financially, while almost 4 in 10 are holding steady, and 1 in 10 are getting ahead. Those numbers are mostly unchanged since April. The economy dominates for Michigan voters, as more than twice as many (35%) say it will be the most important issue to their vote as say the same about immigration (17%) and abortion (16%). All other issues rank in the single digits. Trump is favored among those voting on immigration (+79) and the economy (+31), while those prioritizing abortion prefer Harris (+68). In a potential expanded ballot, Harris trails Trump by 2 points (43-45%), with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting 7%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 1% each. In April, Trump also topped Biden by 2 points, with Kennedy at 9%. Kennedy gets a touch more backing from those who support Trump (8%) than Harris (6%). Biden won Michigan in 2020 by 2.78 percentage points and received 50.62 percent of the vote. The new survey finds 43% of voters approve of the job he is doing, while 56% disapprove -- including 14% of those who voted for him in 2020. Most, 79%, approve of Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid and nearly two-thirds want him to finish his term. Those numbers are even higher among Democrats, as nearly 9 in 10 both approve of him leaving the race and want him to stay in office. Seven in 10 Michigan Democrats want Harris as the Democratic Party’s nominee, while 2 in 10 favor their governor, Gretchen Whitmer, for the role. However, Whitmer outperforms Harris in a potential 2-way matchup against Trump, besting him by a 6-point margin (52-46%). She receives more support than Harris among White voters (by 3 points), women (+3), non-college Whites (+4), and Independents (+6). Whitmer is also the only one in the survey with a positive personal rating. A 56% majority of Michigan voters has a favorable opinion of her, while 42% view her negatively for a net +14 points. All others are underwater, including Harris (-4 points), Trump (-5), and GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance (-10). One in five Michigan voters are unable to rate Vance. Since April, Biden’s favorable rating has slipped, going from negative by 16 points to negative by 20 today. Trump’s rating, on the other hand, has improved by 3 points over the same period. Four years ago this month, Biden’s favorability was +11 and Trump’s was -10 (July 2020). \"While the race might not look much different based on the horserace, Democrats are clearly in a better position with Harris at the top of the ticket,\" says Anderson. \"Biden had become deeply unpopular in Michigan, but now Democrats can hit the reset button with a candidate with the exact same favorability as Trump and who is capable of campaigning vigorously.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Poll-pourri In the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Democrat Elissa Slotkin is ahead of Republican Mike Rogers by a 5-point margin, 51-46%. The Michigan primary is Aug. 6. Some 9% of Trump supporters defect to Slotkin, while 5% of those backing Harris switch parties to support Rogers. CLICK HERE FOR TOPLINE AND CROSSTABS Conducted July 22-24, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,012 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (117) and cellphones (647) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (248). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with subgroup results is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data.

Vance Criticized for Lackluster Performance by Kennedy","text":"Now that the Democratic elite have successfully defenestrated Joe Bye-den, America must brace for an ear-piercing possibility: Presi-Brat Coconut Tree Harris. (Don’t understand me? Sorry, oldie!) I don’t care what the polling says. General elections in the US are always hang on the most nimble of knife-edges, the final result a toss-ups that teeters on the fickle feels of independents, fence-sitters and low-information bird brains. As she’ll never let us forget, even Hillary Clinton won the popular vote — so by my calculations, there’s a 50-50 chance Crazy Kam actually wins. And if that giggle-filled dystopia comes to pass, this is — I imagine — the scene in January 2025: There she is gulping down the herstory, strutting in her revenge-red pantsuit onto the balcony of the U.S. K-apitol Building (renamed for the inauguration). With a fist pump and a nod to her former paramour Willie Brown, she thinks to herself, ‘He’s still got it at 90.’ Dumpy Doug Emhoff is there, beaming and licking the innards of a jelly donut off his fingers. As Second Gentleman, he led a campaign against ‘toxic masculinity’. At this point, Kamala would settle for any masculinity whatsoever. But President H has so much to be proud of today. After defeating The Donald in a hard-fought election, she unleashed the IRS on all ten Trump grandchildren driving the family underground. Rumor has it that Eric Trump is rallying a rebellion of viking-helmeted loons who also look strangely mole-like. But that’s a problem for another day. ‘It’s Momala’s turn!’ she shrieks. Dr Jill Biden, still seething over the coup that foiled her plans to rule the country through ventriloquism, is seen visibly vibrating in her end-of-row seat. She’s left Sleepy at home in Delaware with a tub of Breyers. Up front, next to Vice President George Clooney, is First Daughter Frida Kahlo, I mean Ella Emhoff. She looks dashing in a Calvin Klein kaffiyeh and matching Palestinian flag midriff-baring shift. VP Clooney nods approvingly, his ivory veneers glistening in the January sun. He was tapped to be running mate after hammering one of the final nails into Comatose Joe’s Presidential coffin. But Amal Clooney, now-Secretary of Defense, is the real winner. In her first official act, she had Seal Team Six grab Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and deliver him to the International Criminal Court for swift prosecution. The Surgeon General is Dr. Dre, because he has more robust medical credentials than Dr. Jill. (Plus, Kamala loved smoking weed and listening to him back in the 70s.) And Kimberley Cheatle has been restored to her rightful position as Secret Service Director. For in this administration, diversity will trump credentials! Kamala looks out over the dozens in attendance. Since gasoline is now illegal, most people found it too onerous to ride their bikes into DC. And so she begins her historic address: ‘Today is what yesterday wanted to be, and tomorrow this will be our yesterday. We stand here as a nation, which is a country, but not a continent, but part of a continent with other countries and nations. We are all children of the community, which was a sitcom, unburdened by coconuts who lived together in commune. I’ve never been to Europe. Amen.’ Thanks to America’s Border Czarina that wasn’t, our collective goose will be cooked. On a gas-free stove, of course. Sofa so ugly Trump VP pick, dumpy couch-potato J. D. Vance, is already deflating like a West Wing whoopee cushion and slumping low in the settee of Republican estimations. The brazen Buckeye is in deep yogurt after feline-loving females like Jennifer Aniston bit back at his bitchy trashing of Kamala as a ‘childless cat lady’. Meanwhile, some whisper that Don feels regret over selecting the lackluster, sexist sofa-surfer. Can you blame him? Billy the bully Speaking of hayseeds, Billy Ray Cyrus has exposed himself as an abusive jerk in a newly unearthed recording where he’s heard berating every woman who’s ever suffered him in his 62 years. Of his third wife and latest ex, Aussie singer Firerose, he said: ‘You’re a selfish f***cking b**ch.’ He labelled his famous daughter Miley a ‘devil’ and a ‘skank’; his youngest, Noah, a ‘slut’; and their mom Tish – his second wife – ‘scum of the earth’. Now Miley insiders says this was the ‘last straw’ and that Bilious Billy is ‘dead to her’. For a talentless man who has only ever found relevance and fortune through the sparkling women in his life, that will no doubt be the greatest punishment of all. Gold meddling The Paris Olympics appear to have lifted the prudish 2020 Tokyo ‘intimacy ban’, dishing out 300,000 condoms to the 10,000-odd athletes who’ve descended on the city. (That’s 10 per person per week!) Meanwhile, the ‘recyclable’ carboard-box beds and wafer-thin mattresses provided by the cheese-eaters have been mercilessly mocked. But no fear, bulky British diver Tom Daley filmed himself jumping up and down in all-four formation – proving they can take quite the beating. Muscle hustle Daley’s diving teammate and greedy gold-medal winner Jack Laugher whines that he doesn’t make enough in the pool, so he and other strapping sports girls and boys are supplementing their incomes by baring their Speedo-covered bits on OnlyFans. These tacky titans have no shame but plenty of followers – including impressionable youngsters, whose understanding of Olympic grit, determination and bravery will forever be tarnished by this disgusting smut. Lonely Queen Jennifer For her Hamptons bday bash this week, JLo channeled Bridgerton’s lonely Queen Charlotte and rang in 55 with a themed soiree. Conspicuously absent: her estranged, moody husband who was presumably too busy doing who knows what. If she was trying to lure him up Long Island in her busty period gown, perhaps powdered wigs and ballroom dance weren’t the best bait. Next year she should blow out the candles at Fenway Park with Hooters wings and waitresses. Ben would definitely show up for that. Melania bares all It seems elusive former First Lady Melania Trump may have beeen absent from the stump for good reason – the plucky glamorpuss has been putting pen to paper, writing her memoir which is cleverly titled ‘MELANIA’. We don’t yet have a release date (sometime before the election, we’re told) and there’s no word on the titillating revelations tucked inside – but who cares, we’ll all be reading.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNow that the Democratic elite have successfully defenestrated Joe Bye-den, America must&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: J.D.

JD Vance of Ohio after it emerged that Vance had previously criticized Vice President Kamala Harris over not having children even though she is a co-parent to Emoff's two children from a previous marriage.\"What he said was abhorrent. It was stupid, uninformed, and I think the reaction of not only the country but the world — I mean, look at what Jennifer Aniston said — it has touched a chord in a way that has just upset nearly everyone, because everyone's family is their family \" Emhoff told former US Attorney Preet Bharara on Bharara's podcast in an episode published on Friday.Emhoff said that Vance's remarks show he doesn't appreciate the reality of a modern family.\"So you're telling many people in this country and this world that they don't matter,\" Emhoff said. \"That the only thing that matters is this so-called, you know, old fashioned view of, you know, traditional quote unquote family,\" he added. \"And it is so abhorrent and I am so proud of Kirsten, who we love so much and we are so close and we have coparented, the three of us, so brilliantly and seamlessly and it hurt. It hurt my feelings. It was upsetting and I was so proud of our daughter, Ella, who supported her mother and her mothers.\"Emhoff's daughter, Ella Emhoff, and his ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, had already teed off on Vance over previously coming after their family. Both Ella and her brother Cole were teenagers when Emhoff and Harris were married.\"These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,\" Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement to CNN. \"She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.\"Vance's comments have only exacerbated his struggle to introduce himself to the nation. He's already set a record for being the most disliked major vice presidential nominee, even after a party convention.Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said that the senator's old remarks were being mischaracterized.\"Once again, the leftwing media have twisted Senator Vance's words and spun up a false narrative about his position on the issues. The Democrats are in complete disarray with the most unpopular Vice President in history as their party's nominee,\" Van Kirk said in a statement to Business Insider. In the 2021 interview, Vance, who went on to get elected to the US Senate, was railing against the next generation of Democratic leadership for not having children.\"We are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,\" Vance told then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Vance has stressed that he wasn't poking fun at people who couldn't have kids, but he did lump Harris into the group even though she has been a stepmother to Emhoff's two children since they married in 2014.On Friday, Vance tried to clean up some of his old remarks amid the backlash. He did not retreat from his belief that the Democratic Party is \"anti-family.\"\"Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I've got nothing against cats. I've got nothing against dogs,\" Vance told former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on her podcast. \"People are focusing so much on the sarcasm, and not on the substance of what I actually said. And the substance of what I said Megyn, I'm sorry, it's true.\"In selecting Vance, former President Donald Trump made clear that he was elevating someone who could lead the populist movement that has supplanted the traditional conservativism within the Republican Party.","summary":"Since they married in 2014, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff have co-parented Emhoff's two children with his ex-wife.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/doug-emhoff-jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless-cat-lady-response-2024-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/66a41356aab37011780b0781?width=911&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-26 21:55:00","author":"Brent D.
