We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence? 5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again? 6. Will you accept the results of the election? 7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing? 8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called “red” states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states’ economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you’ll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules? 10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it.

Why did you change positions and what is your position today on fracking and can the American people trust that you will stick to that position this time? 2. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors. But permitting challenges cause these and other energy and infrastructure projects to take as long as seven years in some cases. What specifically will you do to expedite the permitting process without compromising the analysis of the potential impact on the environment and communities? 3.

During the campaign and at the Democratic National Convention, climate change and related policies seem to have been sidelined. There were a couple of very short presentations related to it at the convention, but all the mentions focused on clean air and water and not on the impact of climate change. Why and how much importance will addressing climate change have in your administration? Residents inspect damage to a marina as boats are partially submerged in the aftermath of Hurricane ...

Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events? 7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court?

The numbers are much lower now, down to levels from when you and President Biden took office. What will your border and immigration policies be in your new administration and how will you get them passed if you have a divided Congress and Senate? 9. Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue? 10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected? And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond. The moderators have their hands full.

The 81-year-old president talked to reporters outside the White House briefly. He then boarded Marine One to head to New York City for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. However, Biden bumbled his words when laying out his plans for the next 24 hours. “I’m going up to my granddaughter’s birthday in New York. Then we’re going to watch the debate,” the president said before bluntly adding, “And tomorrow I’m doing 9/11.” Biden’s words left several X users confused, with one commenting, “What?” A second person on X responded, “That sounds like some dangerous rhetoric.” Another simply wrote, “Dammit joe,” with the face palm emoji. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to deliver remarks at the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The president and vice president are expected to visit the site where the World Trade Center once stood, the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and then the Pentagon. Biden, seemingly unaware of his blunder, continued his remarks to the press, saying he spoke with Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate. “I spoke with the vice president. She’s calm, cool, and collected,” the president said. “I think she’s going to do great, and I’m not going to tell you what advice I gave her.” DEBATE NIGHT Harris and Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, are set to face off in the first presidential debate since Biden ended his reelection bid in July. The high-stakes debate comes as Trump and Harris are locked in a neck-and-neck race less than two months before the November 5 Election Day. The candidates will take the stage in Pennsylvania, one of the seven crucial battleground states that could determine the presidential race. Trump is ahead of Harris in the national polls by 1%, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll. ABC moderators are expected to hone in on both candidates on issues affecting millions of Americans, including immigration, the state of the economy, and foreign policy.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJOE Biden&#8217;s latest gaffe has left Americans perplexed as he botched his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden makes controversial statement about 9/11 before Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-makes-controversial-statement-about-9-11-before-kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Moment-Joe-Biden-bluntly-says-hes-‘doing-911-in-latest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-11 00:08:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":256117116,"title":"How to Know Who Won and Who Lost Trump-Harris Debate","text":"Everyone who watches Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate on Tuesday night will want to know the answer to a very simple question: Who won? And while everyone might think they know themselves, in a sea of spin, soundbites, and political posturing there are ways to know who really won. Here's the Daily Beast’s guide to six key indicators—grounded in history, data, and political performance—which will provide a clearer guide. Who Dominates the Narrative? The most obvious way to determine a winner is to see who controlled the narrative (and perhaps talked the most in terms of minutes). Debates are not just about what the candidates say on stage but how their points resonate with the public afterward. Did one candidate introduce a memorable zinger or a policy proposal that set the tone for post-debate coverage? One of the most famous examples of narrative control was Ronald Reagan’s 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter, when Reagan’s simple question to voters—“Are you better off than you were four years ago?”—became the defining takeaway. It encapsulated voter frustration with Carter’s presidency and was followed by Reagan’s landslide victory. In the case of Trump and Harris, whoever manages to turn the conversation their way—whether it's through a punchy one-liner or a clear vision for the future—will likely claim the debate crown. If Trump, known for his inflammatory rhetoric, successfully redirects attention away from his felony conviction and legal battles and toward economic or cultural issues that play well with his base, he could steer the post-debate narrative. Harris, on the other hand, would need to harness her skills as a prosecutor to trap Trump in contradictions or force him into unflattering positions on key issues, particularly abortion. to take control of the narrative. Polling and Data Historically, snap polls taken after debates have offered immediate data points to assess public reaction. These polls may not tell the whole story but provide a snapshot of who performed better in the eyes of undecided or independent voters. The first time snap polls became crucial was after the first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, radio listeners thought Nixon won, but TV viewers overwhelmingly felt Kennedy’s calm, confident demeanor made him the victor. The lesson? Perception matters, and polling reflects that perception. In 2020, after the first debate between Trump and Joe Biden, CNN’s snap poll found that 60% of viewers thought Biden won the first debate. Both campaigns will be conducting their own snap polls on Tuesday night—not to predict the election outcome, but to work out what undecided voters think. But snap polls are not the only ballgame: Expect snap polls to be followed by more detailed polling from major outlets like CNN and pollsters like YouGov to provide a first indication of who emerged stronger. Harris and Trump go into the debate neck and neck in the polls nationally and with some suggestions that she is slightly ahead in the swing states, but with Democratic nerves rattled by a Siena College/New York Times poll putting her behind by one point. Post-Debate Fundraising and Media Coverage Winning a debate isn’t just about the immediate reactions—it’s about the long game. In modern campaigns, fundraising spikes after debates can signal a strong performance. For example, after her breakout moment in the first 2019 Democratic debate, Harris herself raised $2 million in just 24 hours, The New York Times reported, largely thanks to her sharp exchange with Joe Biden on busing and racial issues. If a candidate sees a dip in donations or struggles to galvanize their base, that can indicate a loss. Harris just reported a massive fundraising edge over Trump so the next set of official fundraising returns will be a clear barometer of success. Media coverage also plays a critical role. Did mainstream outlets declare a clear winner? Are social media platforms buzzing more about one candidate’s performance? In the 2012 debate between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, Romney’s aggressive first-debate performance gave him a significant media boost, even though Obama handily won re-election. Post-debate headlines, social media metrics, and the volume of fact-checks for each candidate can all indicate who captured more attention—and perhaps, more voters. Body Language and Composure A candidate’s body language often speaks louder than their words. Nonverbal cues like maintaining eye contact, looking confident, or appearing rattled under pressure can drastically influence how a candidate is perceived. In the infamous 1992 town hall debate, George H.W. Bush’s glance at his watch as a voter asked him a question became a symbol of disengagement and hurt his image. Likewise, Al Gore’s frequent sighs during his debate with George W. Bush in 2000 became a focal point for criticism, overshadowing his policy points. When assessing the Trump-Harris debate, pay attention to who appeared calm and composed versus agitated or defensive. If Trump, who often relies on aggressive posturing, manages to stay composed while Harris rattles him with sharp critiques, that dynamic could shift perceptions. Conversely, if Harris shows frustration or appears overwhelmed, that might signal a loss of control. Fact-Checking and Accuracy In the era of misinformation, post-debate fact-checking has become more important than ever. Candidates frequently make exaggerated or false claims during debates, and these inaccuracies can undermine their performance if exposed. For instance, during the 2016 presidential debates, Trump’s frequent misstatements were fact-checked rigorously, which damaged his credibility with voters and contributed to the view he had lost the debates. Conversely, Hillary Clinton’s focus on policy details and sticking to facts often bolstered her perceived winner status, even if it didn’t lead to an electoral victory. In the Trump-Harris debate, both candidates are likely to face intense scrutiny. Fact-checkers from outlets like The Washington Post, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact will be on standby to verify their claims. The candidate who emerges with fewer fact-checking hits may be perceived as more trustworthy and competent—especially among undecided voters who value honesty and integrity in their leaders. Blunders and Mistakes Perhaps the most glaring indicator of a debate winner—or loser—is who shot themselves in the foot. A high-profile gaffe can overshadow any strong moments a candidate may have had, often sticking in voters’ minds long after the debate ends. In 1976, Gerald Ford made a major blunder when he claimed that “there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,” a statement so factually inaccurate that it became a defining moment of his campaign and eroded his credibility. Similarly, Rick Perry’s infamous “Oops” moment during a 2011 GOP primary debate, when he forgot the third government agency he would eliminate, was a fatal error that torpedoed his presidential aspirations. And that’s not to mention Biden’s June performance which cost him his shot at a second term. If either Trump or Harris makes a significant mistake—whether it’s a glaring factual inaccuracy, an unforced error, or a gaffe that resonates negatively—it could become the defining moment of the night. Trump, known for his off-the-cuff style, runs the risk of delivering a controversial or inflammatory remark that could alienate undecided voters. Harris, while typically more measured, can blunder as a result: an overly scripted phrase could be amplified by Trump’s aggressive tactics.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty/ReutersEveryone who watches Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate on Tuesday night will want to know the answer to a very simple question: Who won?\n\nAnd while everyone might think they know themselves, in a sea of  spin, soundbites, and political posturing there are ways to know who really won.

Many polls show Harris with a slight lead against Trump in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania – a reversal from Trump’s lead against Biden in these states before US President Joe Biden dropped out, but these numbers fall within margins of error and the contest still appears to be a dead heat overall. They are expected to spar over hot button domestic issues like abortion, immigration and crime. However, the economy – an important subject for US voters – will likely trigger arguments about import tariff rates and rules around investment restrictions and manufacturing subsidies, which involve China and foreign policy generally.

These cookies have been a hot seller for the bakery, with 4228 sold expressing support for former President Trump, whereas only 369 have been sold expressing support for Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS News Philadelphia’s Ross DiMattei spoke to the owner of Lochel’s Bakery, Kathleen Lochel, about how she has been selling cookies themed around presidential elections for years. \"Every sale gets marked off.

He later suggested, \"Maybe that has to do with where you guys are situated and all, but you’ve also seen strong support for the former president.\" \"All over the country,\" Lochel said. \"And Montgomery County is a blue county per se, so I wanna get that out there, but at least a third of those cookies have been shipped all over the United States.\" DiMattei then said \"Really quickly I wanna address the keyboard warriors out there.

Tremendous for us as a small business to produce this and sell this as well, and see the faces that are coming around to buy these from all over,\" she said. The bakery has emphasized this is a lighthearted project multiple times, writing in a recent social media post about this \"cookie tally\" to \"Keep calm.. its a cookie.\" Fox29 reported, \"The bakery has hosted this informal poll since 2012, predicting the outcome of three of the last four elections.

The event, scheduled to begin at 2am BST in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that’s dramatically changed since the last debate in June. Within a matter weeks, President Joe Biden bowed out of the 2024 US election race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and both sides chose their running mates. Ms Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Mr Biden did. Meanwhile Trump is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters sceptical he should return to the White House. The debate, televised on ABC News, will subject Ms Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview since she was secured the Democratic nomination, to a rare moment of sustained questioning. “If she performs great, it’s going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they’ll rejoice,” said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. “If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. “So there’s more riding on it.” Follow the latest updates below...","summary":"The event is set to begin at 2am BST in Philadelphia","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/us-politics/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-kamala-harris-philadelphia-abc-news-election-b1181209.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/09/10/23/30/DonaldAndKamala.JPG?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:58:16","author":"Rachael Burford","authors":["Rachael Burford"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":256117720,"title":"Undecided voters say what they're looking for from Trump and Harris' debate","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

Will today’s debate with Trump change that?","text":"With just two months to go until the US elections, Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris has failed to seal the deal. Everyone knows it, and no-one on the progressive side of things wants to admit it. Late this morning, Australian time, she will go up against Donald Trump in their first and possibly only presidential debate. Will this change the momentum, or create some? It is going to need to. Harris is a distinguished politician, a compelling speaker at times, a woman of colour with a hero story that connects to many millions. Her opponent is a shambling incoherent convicted felon who has already lost one election. They are running neck and neck, and the shambling felon is winning in the electoral college. The failure of Harris and the Democrats to crush Trump is just beginning to dawn on people. It is all the more bewildering to them, since there was such a rush of enthusiasm and energy when Joe Biden was finally detached from the nomination. But that was merely great relief, masquerading as a movement. With Biden in place, the polls made clear that the Democrats would be eviscerated in a Trumpslide. There would be collateral damage in the House and Senate; all would be lost. Harris’ elevation immediately corrected those polls, bringing half a dozen states back into play. Then, nothing. Everything locked. The polls are as they were as soon as the changeover occurred. The Democrats had a mixed strategy with Biden: a bit of incumbency, a bit of record, and a bit of being the old white guy who wasn’t mad. Then it was clear Biden was going lollygaga, and Trump looked like the least worse option to a bunch of people. These people have now gone back to Harris, or have simply decided they won’t have to vote now. But their shift has not been sufficient to give Harris a solid majority. She will have also lost a tranche of voters Biden knew he was holding on to. This was one reason, aside from drive, desperation, that he wanted to stay in the race: to keep those voters, Democrats and independents, who want an old white guy in power, especially one with a labour heritage. It appears Harris hasn’t gained that final tranche of “independent independents”, those genuinely swinging voters who are persuaded by programs, etc. Since Harris doesn’t really have one, but has no real incumbency factor either, she is caught between two sides. This is showing up in the polls. The trouble for the Democrats is these days the election runs on a knife edge. Biden won the 2020 election with 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232. But that’s a zero-sum game, which is only 36 points above the 270 needed to win. Facing a candidate like Trump, the Democrats getting to 270 is made difficult because of the swing of two big states to Republicans in the past decade or so. Ohio and Florida have 47 electoral college points between them. They used to be up for grabs; now Trump is running 5-8 points ahead in both. Ohio has been hit hardest of any state by deindustrialisation. It’s a state of mid-size and small cities, many of which were dependent on one large subsector — Buttfuzz, OH, with two factories making steering wheel covers for every US-made car — which are now gone beyond gone, hollowing out the entire community. The anger, despair and disconnection from anything like politics or power is palpable. Florida is a southern state that looked like a northern one for a while. Its south was its north, with a liberal culture shaped by northern retirees, Brooklyn on Key West, freebooters on the forgotten coast, and Jimmy Buffett fans who think Margaritaville is a member of the UN. That coalition is now yielding to deep South Republicans in the state’s north, Christians and a vast Cuban-American community. In 2020, the Democrats took Arizona and Georgia for the first time. That was 27 of their 36-vote margin. These are now running at evens, more or less. The election will be around Trump trying to win those back, and get one of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and maybe Nevada. Or Pennsylvania and Georgia. Or Pennsylvania and Michigan for a draw. And a couple of other combos. The trouble is, there are almost no swing states left. Iowa, Colorado, and New Hampshire were up for grabs regularly, recently. One can’t see any of those being battlegrounds. Nor one-offs like North Carolina and Indiana. Ohio and Florida, gone. The republic was founded on the electoral college system to give small and distant states equal sway. Instead, it has, in the presidential race, de facto disenfranchised tens of millions of voters. Who cares if you’re a California Republican or an Oklahoma Democrat? This new division is based on what is the rock-solid division in Western societies now, between the college-educated — and those who live in cities dominated by them, and their economic production — and those outside of it. In interests, ideologies and attitudes, it now supersedes old industrial class division and struggle and is a new form of class struggle. Were class, in the old sense, to be the dominant factor, Harris would be killing it, cruising to 400 electoral college votes. But the white and Black working- and middle-class want to stop the flood of immigration, and the Democrats do not. These voters want a trade war with China and a revival of a national economic plan. They are not particularly concerned if that involves lower business taxes, smaller government — which barely serves them in any case — and privatisation boondoggles. Should Kamala Harris lose in November, with an overall majority but an electoral college loss, maybe, maybe, finally, progressives, the political class, the media class, the whatever, will get it through their thick skulls that the old progressive-working/middle-class alliance is dead, gone, over. These classes have to be listened to, a conscious alliance has to be made, progressive interests have to be ceded to the groups that still have the numbers. But it will be an expensive lesson to learn, for America and the world. Okay! Let’s see if Harris can turn this round in two hours!","summary":"Harris and Trump are running neck and neck.

Pressure has been building on the Harris campaign to put up a policy platform on its website, similar to how former President Donald Trump and others have done in the past. Upon its release this week, however, the platform was met with even more criticism over a lack of specifics. In particular, one conservative immigration hawk took issue with the policy platform's failure to clarify Harris' stance on border wall funding, and whether she still views illegal border crossings as a civil enforcement issue — or rather, a criminal one. HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR LEFT-WING BENEFIT FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: ‘SMART SOLUTIONS’ \"The Harris campaign finally has an ‘Issues’ page, but — on immigration, at least — there's no there, there,\" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital. \"She doesn't say if she'd build more border barriers. She doesn't say whether she still wants to decriminalize border-jumping. The statement just repeats the vacuous nonsense about the ‘bipartisan’ Senate border bill, which was drafted by the Biden-Harris DHS to codify its unlawful schemes to import more illegal aliens.\" Despite indicating a potential Harris-Walz administration would \"bring back the bipartisan border security bill,\" the new online policy platform did not indicate where Harris stands on funding additional border wall construction. Republicans have pointed to Harris' public support for the failed bipartisan border bill as evidence she now backs a border wall after once calling it a \"medieval vanity project.\" But Harris campaign officials have said the border bill did not include any new money for border wall construction — it just extended the timeline to spend funds appropriated during Trump's last year as president. The bill, however, has limits to ensure the money is spent on border barriers. \"Americans should believe Harris' prior statements and current policies as Vice President,\" Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital in a statement Tuesday. \"She has previously stated numerous times that she opposes a border wall. And on day one of the Biden-Harris Administration, they halted construction of the border wall system.\" BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES ‘IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION’ Meanwhile, while running for president in 2019, Harris indicated during a nationally televised debate that she would not go after illegal border crossings. In a segment on ABC's \"The View,\" she reiterated her stance in a riff with the late-Sen. John McCain's daughter, Meghan. \"I would not make it a crime punishable by jail,\" Harris said. \"It should be a civil enforcement issue but not a criminal enforcement issue.\" \"Harris repeatedly said during her CNN interview that her values have not changed,\" Ries highlighted in her statement to Fox News Digital. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the criticism from Krikorian and others about a lack of specifics in its new online policy platform, but did not receive a response. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the new policy platform \"a late-night, half-ass, wish list of policies.\" \"If Kamala really wanted to lower costs and secure the border — why did she cast the tie-breaking vote to cause inflation and support the war on our energy industry, and why is she allowing an invasion of illegal immigrants through our southern border as we speak?\" Not long after the Harris campaign's \"Issues\" page was added to its website, social media users pointed out that the new web page contained metadata with language urging voters to reelect President Joe Biden, according to The New Republic. The Biden language was quickly removed, but not before leaving the impression that the Harris campaign copied and pasted from Biden's documents, the outlet reported.","summary":"The Harris campaign released policy platform on its website after criticism over its absence, but the new platform left much to be desired for critics of Harris&apos; border policy positions.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-camps-new-policy-page-criticized-lacking-specifics-border-security-theres-no-there-there","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/harriscamppage.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:49:58","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":256116466,"title":"Report: Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump by 28% in TV Ad Exposure Before First Presidential Debate","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off Tuesday night in their first Presidential Debate, but the two candidates have already been jockeying for America’s attention for weeks now, and it appears that Harris is in the lead. Despite entering the presidential race more than seven months into the year, just over 100 days before Election Day, Harris has seen her TV ad campaign skyrocket, outpacing Trump by a significant amount, according to data from Samba TV. Since beginning her ad campaign in July, Harris ads have reached 44.4M U.S. households at an average frequency of 15.7, Samba says. That’s 41% higher than the 31.4M U.S. households that Trump’s ads have graced with a frequency of 13.9 during that time. (Frequency indicates the number of times that a user or household will interact with an ad over a specific period of time and, in this case, Samba is measuring the entire stretch of time since Harris launched her campaign in July. So, on average, each of those 44.4M households have interacted with a Harris ad 15.7 times in that time frame.) Throughout the entire year, Trump ads have reached 34.8M U.S. households, Samba says, meaning that Harris has still surpassed her opponent by 28% in ad reach despite the fact that she didn’t launch a TV ad campaign until about seven weeks ago. Interestingly, Samba also points out that 90% of Trump’s ad reach has occurred in the weeks since Harris joined the race. However, neither candidate is doing particularly well with minority groups, as both are overindexing among white audiences and underindexing among Hispanic and Asian households. According to Samba, Harris is underindexing in Hispanic households by 23%, Trump by 32%. Naturally, both candidates have turned their attention to the swing states — which Samba considers to be AZ, GA, MI, NC, NV, PA, WI — with Harris’ ads reaching 65% of households in those seven states and Trump ads reaching 62%. Harris’ lowest ad reach among the swing states is North Carolina and Georgia, where her ads have permeated 57% and 61% of households, respectively. Trump is also struggling a tad in the same states, reaching 59% of households in Georgia and 62% in North Carolina. By comparison, Harris ads reached an average of 32% of households across the other 43 states, and Trump ads reached 19% of households. Samba TV doesn’t measure mobile, however, their sample includes a panel of 3M terrestrial TVs, weighted to the U.S. Census. By contrast, Samba TV’s panel is nearly 100x larger than Nielsen’s household footprint of 45K homes. The entire nation will get the opportunity to see both candidates take a position in Tuesday night’s debate on ABC. Despite the ongoing carriage dispute between Disney and DirecTV that makes ABC unavailable to the latter’s customers, the event is being simulcast on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and C-Span. The debate will also be live streamed on Hulu.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Report: Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump by 28% in TV Ad Exposure Before First Presidential Debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/report-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-by-28-in-tv-ad-exposure-before-first-presidential-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-Outpacing-Donald-Trump-28-In.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:48:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":256116468,"title":"Joe Biden surprises everyone with his ‘9/11’ remark before the debate","text":"President Joe Biden bluntly said he’s ‘doing 9/11’ tomorrow in a head-scratching comment to reporters who asked his plans ahead of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The gaffe-prone 81-year-old was heading to Marine One on the White House lawn when he made the comments just one day before the 23rd anniversary of the terror attacks. ‘I’m going up to my granddaughter’s birthday in New York,’ Biden began. ‘Then we’re gonna watch the debate, then tomorrow I’m doing 9/11.’ The president’s remark concerning the September 11, 2001 attacks on America caused social media users to express shock and amusement at his poor choice of wording. On social media platform X, one person commented: ‘Biden’s slip-ups are endless. You’d think someone would double-check his scripts by now.’ Another posted: ‘Yup… He done’, while someone added: ‘Gotta be honest until I saw that ‘tomorrow I’m doing 9/11′ clip just now I kind of forget Joe Biden was even alive.’ A Trump campaign associated X account shared the clip, saying: ‘This is the humiliating cognitive decline Kamala Harris COVERED UP.’ It is the latest in a long line of blunders for the commander in chief who stepped down from his reelection race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Just days before his shock announcement, he had even referred to Vice President Harris as Donald Trump. Other mishaps have included him bumping into flagpoles, falling off bicycles, and calling people by the wrong name. Biden is set to mark the anniversary of the attacks in New York City before also visiting the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorials. Conspirators from al-Qaida seized control of airplanes and hit New York’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon near Washington. A fourth plane was headed for Washington but crashed in Shanksville after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit. Officially, the casualty count associated with the attacks is numbered at 2,996 – including 2,977 victims and 19 hijackers. Thousands more were injured, and New York bore the brunt of the death toll – with an estimated 1,600 victims in the North Tower and another thousand in the South. Harris and Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face for perhaps their only debate in the US presidential election. The event will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that has dramatically changed since the last debate in June. Following the last debate, Biden has bowed out of the race while Trump survived an assassination attempt. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. The 78-year-old has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The former president has resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden bluntly said he&#8217;s &#8216;doing 9/11&#8217; tomorrow in a head-scratching&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden surprises everyone with his &#8216;9/11&#8217; remark before the debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/joe-biden-surprises-everyone-with-his-9-11-remark-before-the-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Joe-Biden-raises-eyebrows-with-doing-911.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:45:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":256116808,"title":"North Carolina Gov.

In recent weeks, he and running mate JD Vance have been spreading unfounded, often racist claims about Haitian and Venezuelan migrants, part of a larger false narrative about an unprecedented “migrant crime” wave in the U.S. which is not actually occurring, which they allege is a consequence of Kamala Harris’s time in a “border czar” role she never actually had. Trump and Vance may not be telling the whole truth, or much of it at all, but the comments are revealing nonetheless. They’re a signal of what a Trump-Vance presidency might look like, where the candidates have promised an unprecedented and “bloody” crackdown on migrants inside the U.S. Most recently, Vance has joined in on an unfounded, racist rumor that migrants from Haiti are abducting and eating pets in his home state of Ohio. “Months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio,” Vance wrote on X on Monday. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” The claim appears to have its roots in a post from a Springfield-based Facebook group, later parroted by far-right activists and neo-Nazis online before it reached Vance and other prominent Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz. The Springfield police said on Monday they’d received no reports of pets being stolen or eaten, though Vance’s office insisted to The Independent that the senator has been receiving a “high volume of calls and emails” from “concerned citizens” about such claims. “I think it’s sad that some people are using this as an opportunity to spread hate or spread fear,” Jason Via, Springfield’s deputy director of public safety and operations, said of the situation earlier this year. “We get these reports ‘the Haitians are killing ducks in a lot of our parks’ or ‘the Haitians are eating vegetables right out of the aisle at the grocery store.’ And we haven’t really seen any of that. It’s really frustrating. As a community, it’s not helpful as we try to move forward.” Moreover, many of the up to 20,000 Haitians who’ve arrived in Springfield since the pandemic began are there legally under Temporary Protected Status, a program designed to protect migrants from countries undergoing crises like coups or national disasters. They have been credited with helping revive local manufacturing jobs. The Trump ticket followed a similar playbook earlier this month, repeating highly contested claims that a Venezuelan street gang had taken over an apartment complex in the Denver suburb of Aurora. “Take a look at Aurora in Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town, they’re taking over buildings, the whole town,” Trump said at a recent Fox News town hall. “You saw it the other day they’re knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people.” Here, the factual situation is a bit murkier, though there’s certainly not a citywide Venezuelan gang invasion underway. Surveillance video of the apartment complex in question shows a group of armed men strolling the halls and entering an apartment, and a city council member and the mayor of Aurora have described buildings being taken over. The Aurora police department and governor of Colorado, meanwhile, say this is untrue, and that violent crime has actually been declining in the city at the same time it received an influx of Venezuelan migrants. In both cases, the claims from the Trump campaign may ignore key parts of the factual record but appear to have caused real damage on the ground. Denise Williams, a former NAACP chapter president in Springfield, who has spoken out against the torrent of hate directed at Haitians in the area, told NPR she’s been bombarded with angry messages since Vance’s claims went public. “I’m taking that as a pure threat,” she said. Residents of the apartment complexes in Aurora under the microscope have also described a wave of violent, angry threats coming their way after their lives became the focus of the Republican conspiracy industrial complex. Jefferson Medina, a Venezuelan immigrant who lives at one of the complexes, told Westworld last week that a group of men in a car with a “large gun” yelled “ugly things” as they drove through the area. “I go to work at five in the morning, and I’m already afraid for my life that someone is going to do something — because I’m Venezuelan, they’re going to do something,” Moises Didenot, another Venezuelan migrant, told the outlet. “We’ve all already been threatened with a flier saying we’re all criminals. I’m afraid someone is going to do something out of hate.” The anti-immigrant hysteria is part of the Trump campaign’s larger narrative that the U.S. is beset with a wave of “Biden migrant crime,” part of an “invasion” taking place at U.S. borders. This is also not true. Border-crossings did hit unprecedented levels at the U.S.-Mexico border in December, part of a record-breaking few years, but that hasn’t corresponded with a massive crime wave in the largely liberal-leaning cities where many have settled. Quite the opposite. As a meta-analysis of criminal justice studies from the Brennan Center notes, the data does not support the claim that immigrants commit more crimes or are incarcerated at higher levels than U.S.-born people, nor does the data suggest undocumented migration and sanctuary city policies drive violent crime. Those trends hold true even in cities to which Republican states like Texas have explicitly rerouted border-crossers, like Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York, and Los Angeles, according to an NBC News review of crime data available through 2024. But if Donald Trump’s political rise has proven anything, it’s that the hard facts aren’t particularly important to his brand of power. His numerous false claims about the 2020 election, none of which have secured meaningful victory in the courts, haven’t stopped the former president from retaining the support of nearly half of voters. And it seems more Americans are coming around to Trump’s point of view on immigrants. According to Gallup polling, between 2021 and July of 2024, the percentage of Americans who think immigration should be decreased shot up from 31 to 55 percent, mirrored by a sharp drop during that same period in those who think immigration should increase. His first term in office coincided with a string of chaotic and highly controversial comments and initiatives — a travel ban from largely Muslim countries; family separation that divided, in some cases permanently, children from their parents, including U.S. citizens; reported comments calling Haiti and other African nations “sh**hole countries”; and a pandemic-era border shutdown. As the last few weeks indicate, he was only just getting started.","summary":"Trump has vowed to carry out ‘largest domestic deportation operation’ in U.S. history if re-elected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-vance-haitians-venezuela-migrants-b2610535.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/11/02/ELECCIONES-TRUMP-HACKEO_40019.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/k70oHggG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:35:22","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":256116206,"title":"What’s riding on Kamala Harris’ answer to a simple question: What is a woman?","text":"What is a woman? It’s a question Kamala Harris will ghost unless asked at Tuesday’s presidential debate. And if queried, will she dodge it as Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson did in her 2022 Senate confirmation hearing, saying, “I’m not a biologist”? There’s much more at stake than semantics. Harris has a commanding lead over Donald Trump among female voters everywhere, including the critical swing states. Her answer would indicate if her administration would gut Title IX protections for women’s sports and green-light gender ideologues who want children and adolescents to have easier access to medical interventions while erecting legal barriers between parents and children. Harris, as with many major issues, has not expressly addressed gender identification. She’s never been put on the spot to say if she considers biology outdated and a person’s gender is whatever he or she declares it to be. That doesn’t mean her position is a secret to her supporters. In her failed 2020 presidential run, she backed a radical program: taxpayer funding for transgender surgeries for prison inmates and illegal immigrants. Advocates for Trans Equality enthusiastically endorsed her in July. A Slate article concluded that “on trans issues, her record is surprisingly consistent, especially compared to other politicians” — “she’s been very progressive on this issue for 20 years.” The country’s oldest and largest LGBT publication, The Advocate, declared last month that Harris has “a long and strong record of support for LGBTQ+ equality” and would “most likely be the most pro-LGBTQ+ president.” The Biden-Harris administration has shown its support for LGBT+ issues by policies allowing gender to trump biological sex. On its first day, it issued a landmark executive order mandating all federal agencies enforce antidiscrimination policies based on “gender identity or sexual orientation.” The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission followed up by issuing expanded guidelines for sexual-harassment complaints that included intentionally calling an employee by the wrong name or pronoun or denying access to bathrooms or other single-sex facilities to an employee who identifies as a different gender. The Biden administration also injected gender identification into the landmark 1972 Title IX rules banning sex discrimination in education. Title IX opened up opportunities for girls and women in athletic competition. Allowing boys and men who identify as female to participate would be the effective end of women’s sports. And the White House, aware of the potential political fallout, has delayed final determination on how it will treat transgender athletes until after the election. But it’s not hard to read the tea leaves for a Harris administration. House Republicans narrowly advanced a measure to block the Biden gender modifications to Title IX in July, 210-205, with every Democrat voting against. In Harris’ native California, where she served as San Francisco district attorney and state attorney general, legal protections for gender self-identification have effectively ended the rights of women to have protected single-sex spaces. Since 2021, male convicts, including sex offenders who identify as women, can transfer to women’s prisons. Would Harris support the right of men who identify as women to get housing at shelters for battered women? The vice president’s response to “What is a woman?” would answer other questions too. Might a President Harris promote Rachel Levine, America’s first transgender admiral, from assistant health secretary to Health and Human Services chief — making history and burnishing her progressive credentials with the first transgender cabinet officer. Levine, a member in good standing of the partisan World Professional Association for Transgender Health, advocates “gender-affirming care” for minors. WPATH emails made public in litigation in June revealed it was Levine who successfully lobbied the organization to drop its minimum age limits for treating children with hormones and surgeries. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in July making the Golden State the first in the nation to bar schools from notifying parents if their children want to change their pronouns or express interest in a different gender. Blocking parents from knowing if their children are enamored with the transgender contagion and simultaneously removing age limits for medicalizing that interest seems a particularly dangerous combination. “What is a woman?” is a simple enough question. Getting an answer from Harris will provide the best clue as to whether she intends to be a president who protects women’s rights and those of children and parents or instead further dilute the hard-won rights of biological women and encourage gender-affirming care for minors by embracing a left-wing ideology that someone’s gender is a matter of ever-changing personal preference.","summary":"What is a woman?

[+] U.S. military personnel. getty America's potential adversaries have been actively meddling in the 2024 presidential election, and that includes efforts directed from Beijing. Known as \"Spamouflage,\" it reportedly utilizes fake social media accounts claiming to be American voters and even U.S. military personnel. It is a largely bipartisan effort—with some attacks directed at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, while others criticized former President Donald Trump. The goal seems to be sowing division, and further dividing America politically. \"Spamouflage is not the most sophisticated influence operation targeting the United States, but it is quite interesting from a strategic perspective. Until the last couple of years, the Chinese Communist Party was mostly focused on 'positive' in its propaganda. In other words, rather than trying to denigrate adversaries, their primary—though not sole—strategy was to make China look better both for domestic and international audiences,\" explained Dr. Craig Albert, graduate director of the Master of Arts in Intelligence and Security Studies at Augusta University. A Spamalot Of Effort As with other misinformation and disinformation campaigns, it is about confusing issues, raising the volume in the process, and drowning out civil discussions. It is hardly original, but China has a long history of copying from the best—and in this case it is Russia that created the template. \"Spamouflage is interesting because it illustrates the Chinese Communist Party's shift from positive messaging to a narrative mirroring Russia and Iran: traditional information warfare targeting decision-making processes and influencing opinions of U.S. citizens to sow discord and spark potential riots, unrest, and violent protests if not more serious events,\" warned Albert.

Much like those efforts directed from the Kremlin, China's ultimate goal in this campaign, and its overall influence operations, is to make the U.S. lose faith in democracy and, as a result, citizens distrust the regime and government overall. \"Their grand idea, akin to Russia's strategy, is to spark a civil war within the United States by pitting ideological extremes against one another,\" said Albert. Even as Americans do remain as politically divided as any time since the Civil War, the fact remains that we're not really quite as close to armed confrontation. The discourse seems to be more of an uncivil war conducted on the anti-social networks. However, Albert further cautioned that Beijing may be testing the waters by interfering in the election, even if it won't lead to actual confrontation. \"Spamouflage is not there yet, but it is noteworthy in that it shows China is probing the possibilities they could exploit for election interference or for setting the battleground conditions in the case of a pending conflict in Taiwan,\" Albert noted. \"It also demonstrates that China, in line with the academic research in this manner, is increasing its use of artificial intelligence for rapid messaging through fake accounts and botnets, as well as in creating deep fakes that seek to create division in the US. China has spent a significant amount of money on the use of AI for information warfare, and Spamouflage is likely to be an initial glimpse of what the future holds for information warfare and influence operations.\" Although it has not been substantially effective, much like Russian influence operations since the 2016 election, it could suggest that the Chinese Communist Party are now contending in this contest of election interference. \"It's only a matter of time before what I call, the information adversarial axis—Iran, China, and Russia—are successful in influencing how U.S. citizens see the political system, and consequently, how the citizen may vote,\" said Albert. \"For these reasons, U.S. policymakers and intelligence analysts should pay close attention to Spamouflage as a probing operation and prepare for more sophisticated, Generative AI-based informational attacks, perhaps closer to the election.\" AI Efforts Will Continue China, along with Russia and Iran—and likely other states—will continue to use the latest technology against Americans. The irony is that the same technology that was developed to bring us closer together is now dividing us politically. The good news is that the same technology would be used to prevent similar disinformation campaigns. \"Technology platforms have made significant strides in detecting and preventing disinformation campaigns. One area of improvement may be the enhancement of artificial intelligence to better identify subtle patterns in language, imagery, or behavior in relation to emerging forms of disinformation such as deepfakes,\" said Dr. Masahiro Yamamoto, associate professor and department chair of the Department of Communication at the University at Albany. \"Continuously training and updating algorithms on diverse datasets would be crucial. These platforms can also invest in media literacy education to help users develop critical thinking skills and discern misleading content.\" Yet, the situation is likely to get worse, especially in the weeks leading up to the election as Americans remain so addicted to social media. \"Research has shown that well-coordinated disinformation efforts can reach large audiences by infiltrating online communities predisposed to certain beliefs and exploiting algorithms that prioritize content likely to provoke strong reactions and generate high engagement,\" added Yamamoto. \"Research suggests that disinformation campaigns target swing states where people may be more susceptible to false information that algins with their views. These efforts can deepen existing divides, sow seeds of distrust, and undermine confidence in democratic institutions.\" Follow me on Twitter.

The event, at 8 p.m. Chicago Time in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that’s dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and both sides chose their running mates. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris. The vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration’s accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past. The debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning. “If she performs great, it’s going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they’ll rejoice,” said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. “If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there’s more riding on it.” Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a “prosecutor’s instincts to the debate stage.” “That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,” Hogan said. The first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama. Trump plans to hit Harris as too liberal Trump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He’s been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates. Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs — and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned — as pragmatism, insisting that her “values remain the same.” Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues. The former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden’s still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months. Trump’s team insist his tone won’t be any different facing a female opponent. “President Trump is going to be himself,” senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday. Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump “respects women and doesn’t feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.” His advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a “word salad” of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to “let her talk.” The former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently “happened to turn Black.” Harris wants to argue Trump is unstable and unfit The vice president, who has been the Biden administration’s most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump’s inconsistencies around women’s reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida’s six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall. Harris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia’s invasion and Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight. She is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail “those involved in unscrupulous behavior,” including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials. Harris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies. “There’s no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,” she said. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking Tuesday to donors in Las Vegas, highlighted Trump’s experience debating after three White House runs. “No one in modern times has done more of these,” he said. “The good news is that this is his seventh debate, and we know exactly what to expect.” AP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/09/10/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate-2024-elections-philadephia","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e6965e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F3b%2F846176d747f08a45541529e948b0%2F2170","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:26:44","author":"Michelle L.

The proportion of Americans living in poverty also fell slightly last year, to 11.1%, from 11.5% in 2022. But the ratio of women’s median earnings to men’s widened for the first time in more than two decades as men’s income rose more than women’s in 2023. The latest data came Tuesday in an annual report from the Census Bureau, which said the median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose 4% to $80,610 in 2023, up from $77,450 in 2022. It was the first increase since 2019, and is essentially unchanged from that year’s figure of $81,210, officials said. (The median income figure is the point at which half the population is above and half below and is less distorted by extreme incomes than the average.) “We are back to that pre-COVID peak that we experienced,” said Liana Fox, assistant division chief in the Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division at the Census Bureau. The figures could become a talking point in the presidential campaign if Vice President Kamala Harris were to point to them as evidence that Americans’ financial health has largely recovered after inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022. On Wednesday, economists predict that the government will report that inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% in August. The Federal Reserve, whose target level for inflation is 2%, is poised to start cutting interest rates next week. Former President Donald Trump might counter that household income grew much faster in his first three years in office than in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, though income fell during his administration after the pandemic struck in 2020. The data showed that while the typical American household regained its 2019 purchasing power in 2023, it essentially experienced no rise in living standards over that time. That is a sharp difference from the preceding four years, when inflation-adjusted median incomes rose 14% from 2015 through 2019. The data is based on pre-tax incomes, including Social Security and other benefit programs, though it excludes noncash benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid. The jump in incomes reflects solid job creation last year, which helped reduce the unemployment rate to a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023. The proportion of Americans in the so-called prime age group of 25-to-54-year-olds with jobs averaged 80.7% last year, the highest level in 23 years. Economists often focus on prime-age workers because they exclude younger people, who are often still in school, and older workers, who are more likely to retire or reduce their hours. By racial groups, median household income rose 5.4% for whites to $84,630, increased 2.8% for Black Americans to $56,490 and was unchanged for Hispanics at $65,540. Asian incomes were also largely unchanged at $112,800. While the overall poverty rate declined from 2022 to 2023, under an alternative measure of income the proportion of children in poverty rose from 12.4% to 13.7%. The bump in child poverty comes two years after it had plunged to just 5.2%, when the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit provided enhanced benefits to families. But the credit expired in 2022. “If you want to reduce poverty in the short run, you transfer income to poor families,” said Steven Durlauf, an economist at the University of Chicago. Census also calculated that 92% of Americans had health care in 2023, largely unchanged from the previous year, though the proportion of uninsured children ticked up a half-point to 5.8%.

The San Francisco 49ers’ win against the New York Jets marked the program’s second-most-watched Week 1 match-up in the program’s 19 seasons airing on the sports network, beating the 19.8 million viewers who tuned in to watch the 2022 match-up between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks. But viewership for the Sept. 9 game came in lower than last year’s face-off between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets, which holds the title for the most-watched Week 1 game at 22.7 million viewers, as DirecTV’s more than 11 million subscribers looking to access Disney’s linear networks have remained in the dark since Sept. 1 due to a carriage dispute. The fight with DirecTV, which began on Sept. 1 moments before the USC vs. LSU game, has also disrupted the U.S. Open. And negotiations continue as ABC gears up for the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump Tuesday evening. Disney and DirecTV have both rejected proposals that would allow viewers to view Tuesday night’s presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, though the debate will still be available to watch on Hulu and Disney+ and free to stream on ABC News Live and over the air. Additionally, it will be simulcast on other broadcast and cable news networks. The three most-watched “Monday Night Football” Week 1 games in the ESPN era all featured Joe Buck, Troy Aikman and Lisa Salters on the mic, with Laura Rutledge joining the trio in the 2024 season on site in San Francisco. Leading into the game, “Monday Night Countdown” (6-8 p.m.) averaged 1.3 million viewers, as Ryan Clark, Jason Kelce, and Marcus Spears joined Scott Van Pelt for the crew’s first on-site show together. Adam Schefter also appeared on the programming from Levi’s Stadium. Accounting for all weeks, the Jets-49ers is the sixth-most-watched “Monday Night Football” game in the ESPN era, with four of the preceding five occurring during the 2023 season.","summary":"Despite the blackout, the San Francisco 49ers' win over the New York Jets is the second-most watched Week 1 match-up in the program's 19 season-run on the network\n\n\nThe post ESPN&#8217;s &#8216;Monday Night Football&#8217; 2024 Season Opener Dips to 20.5 Million Viewers Amid Disney-DirecTV Carriage Dispute appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/espn-monday-night-football-week-1-ratings/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Monday-Night-Football-logo.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:24:41","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.347},{"id":256115744,"title":"Preparing to fact-check Harris-Trump debate","text":"Preparing to fact-check Harris-Trump debate CBS News will fact-check claims made by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump at Tuesday night's debate.

In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Paul said he was “supportive” of the Republican nominee, but explained that he was holding back his endorsement due to concerns about the national debt. “I’m a deficit hawk,” Paul told the program. “The Trump administration added $8 trillion. The Biden administration is going to add $8 trillion. This year, we’re going to add another $2 trillion.” But Paul also voiced his opposition to the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically criticizing her proposed tax increase on unrealized capital gains—which he called “not only moronic, it’s so destructive that… she should be disqualified from any thoughtful person considering her.” Harris has proposed a 28% tax on unrealized capital gains for Americans earning more than $1 million per year. Her campaign’s platform says the tax plan is designed to “ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit.” The Kentucky senator continued to rattle off a list of issues he had disagreements with Trump about—mostly concerning his administration’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. “As Trump left office, he was advocating for $2,500 checks again passed out to everybody. I’m not for that,” Paul said. The libertarian was one of only six Republicans to vote against the relief package passed in December 2020, which included stimulus checks for businesses and individuals. In a press release from 2020, Paul again cited the national debt as his reasoning for voting against the spending package. “The answer is not printing up and distributing ‘free money.’ It’s opening the economy.” Paul repeated this sentiment on Tuesday. “I was against the lockdowns, and I want to hear stronger language in that sense. I also want to get to the bottom of the funding of the research at Wuhan,” referring to the inquiry he launched as the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this year. “My investigation hangs in the lurch, and I want a promise, frankly, from Donald Trump that he will continue, allow me to do that investigation, and he will sign legislation that I have written that will regulate gain of function research,” Paul said. The day before, Paul told Semafor that “my enthusiasm has flagged a little” for the Republican nominee, again citing his record on the national debt. He also criticized the last Trump administration’s record on American military interventions—specifically criticizing his picking of John Bolton as National Security Advisor, who served in the White House position from 2018 through September 2019.","summary":"Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesRand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky and famous libertarian contrarian, explained why he still hasn’t endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Paul said he was “supportive” of the Republican nominee, but explained that he was holding back his endorsement due to concerns about the national debt.\n\n“I’m a deficit hawk,” Paul told the program. “The Trump administration added $8 trillion.

Trump narrowly escaped death when 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on him during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The incident was a “horrible, distressing experience” for the family, as Melania recalled in a short video clip posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday. ”Now, the silence around it feels heavy. I can’t help but wonder: Why didn’t law enforcement officials arrest the shooter before the speech?” she said. The would-be assassin had positioned himself on a nearby rooftop that provided an unobstructed view of the Republican candidate. One bullet grazed the former president’s right ear, resulting in one attendee's death and injuries to two others. The shooter was subsequently killed by Secret Service agents. The House of Representatives unanimously voted to create a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination. Comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats, the task force aims to examine potential security lapses at federal, state, and local levels of law enforcement that preceded the incident. In an interview last month, Trump accused President Joe Biden and his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, of being partly responsible for the assassination attempt. “I think to a certain extent it’s Biden’s fault and Harris’s fault,” he said, claiming they “were making it very difficult to have proper staffing in terms of Secret Service” and “weren’t too interested in my health and safety” while promoting rhetoric that could have encouraged the shooter. ”There is definitely more to this story, and we need to uncover the truth,” Melania said in the video, which appears to promote her upcoming memoir.","summary":"Melania Trump has called for answers to “uncover the truth” behind the attempted assassination of her husband, former President Donald Trump \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/603799-melania-trump-shooting-truth/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66e0d3e3203027193d1de2c6.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:21:12","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.662},{"id":256116362,"title":"How Harris’ and Trump’s tax and spending plans affect U.S. debt","text":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican opponent Donald Trump have floated new tax breaks and spending plans, as they try to win votes by persuading Americans their ideas will do more to ease their financial burdens. Budget forecasters are struggling to keep up with the latest tweaks, and new ideas may be voiced in today’s Harris-Trump debate, but so far all estimates show Trump’s agenda piling up much more new federal debt. Trump has said he plans to extend all tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2017, exempt Social Security and tip income from taxes, and further cut corporate income taxes. These changes would likely add $3.6 trillion to $6.6 trillion to primary U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to published individual and comprehensive estimates from four budget forecasters reviewed by Reuters: the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the Tax Foundation and Oxford Economics. Harris’ plans, which include expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit, and no taxes on tips, could reduce deficits by as much as $400 billion or add up to $1.4 trillion to deficits over a decade, the same forecasters calculated. The estimates are based on static budget scoring, and are compared against the Congressional Budget Office’s current-law “baseline,” which already assumes a massive, $22 trillion increase in debt through 2034. ROLLING ANALYSIS The forecasts vary considerably depending on which ideas mentioned on the campaign trail are included. Estimates of Harris’ recently rolled-out tax deduction of up to $50,000 for business startup costs, and a lower top capital gains tax than the one proposed by President Joe Biden are largely not included. The forecasts include Trump’s proposal to lower the corporate income tax to 15% from 21% but not his latest comments that this rate would be reserved only for companies that produce their goods in the U.S. “The campaign talking points are moving faster than the budget models,” said Shai Akabas, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center. “I think we’re largely seeing what we’ve come to expect in recent years, which is that candidates are going to put their popular policy priorities ahead of fiscal responsibility on both sides.” Congress must approve tax and spending legislation, making it difficult for the winner of the Nov. 5 election to achieve their priorities without sweeping majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. 2025 TAX CLIFF The major differentiator between Trump and Harris is how they address the 2025 expiration of individual tax cuts passed by Republicans during Trump’s presidency in 2017. Without action by Congress, these rates would snap back to their previous, higher levels. Trump has pledged to permanently extend all of the expiring tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans, which tax and budget experts estimate would reduce revenues over a decade by about $3.3 trillion to $4 trillion. Harris would extend the 2017 tax cuts for only those earning under $400,000, keeping a Biden pledge, but this would add up to $2.5 trillion to a spending agenda already estimated at $2 trillion over a decade. Harris has quietly endorsed the nearly $5 trillion in tax hikes in Biden’s fiscal 2025 budget request, including taxing unrealized gains from fortunes over $100 billion and raising the corporate tax rate to 28% This has caused consternation on Wall Street but would substantially offset the cost of her spending plans. “I think the conclusion that Trump’s approach to taxes is more debt-fueled is correct,” said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “I say that because Harris at least has some pretty well-developed revenue raisers.” Trump has not offered any conventional tax increases to offset his extended tax cuts. Other breaks, including exempting Social Security income, would reduce revenue by $1.6 trillion, CRFB and the Tax Foundation estimate. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation called the move “unsound and fiscally irresponsible,” weakening Social Security and Medicare. Trump has said his tax cuts would be paid for with “trillions of dollars” generated by stronger economic growth, new import tariffs, ending Biden’s clean energy subsidies and a new government efficiency commission headed by billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump’s proposed 10% global tariff and 60% tariff on Chinese imports could raise up to $3.8 trillion over a decade but would reduce other revenues due to its economic effects, including imposing a de facto tax on households. The Tax Foundation was the only model reviewed that included a tariff estimate as an offset — $2.6 trillion — but even then, it estimated that Trump’s plans would boost deficits by nearly $4 trillion over a decade.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican opponent Donald Trump have floated new tax breaks and spending plans, as they try to win votes by persuading Americans their ideas will do more to ease their financial burdens.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/10/breaking-news/how-harris-and-trumps-tax-and-spending-plans-affect-u-s-debt/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-10T195154Z_3_LYNXMPEK890OT_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-BUDGET.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:20:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.02},{"id":256115746,"title":"What to expect from Harris-Trump debate","text":"What to expect from Harris-Trump debate Can former President Donald Trump stay on message at Tuesday night's debate?

On Sept. 26, 1960, Vice President Richard M. Nixon and U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts met for the first ever televised presidential debate in Studio 1 at the old CBS Chicago broadcast center, at 630 N. McClurg Ct. in the Streeterville section of the Near North Side. Political campaigns were not new to television in 1960. In 1952, campaign aide Roy O. Disney — older brother of Walt Disney — created the “I Like Ike” campaign for Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower just for television. That same year, the Democratic and Republican national conventions — both at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago — were televised. Also in 1952, Nixon — amid a scandal over campaign contribution ethics — admitted that he had accepted a gift of a cocker spaniel puppy named Checkers. Four years later, Kennedy made remarks at the 1956 DNC — again held at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago. In 1960, Nixon and Kennedy each won nomination for the top of the Republican and Democratic tickets for president, respectively. While Kennedy was on an upswing — telling Protestant ministers in Houston that he could serve both his country and his church as a Roman Catholic — Nixon suffered an injury to his left knee in a limousine while campaigning in North Carolina and ended up in the hospital with septic arthritis. Congress suspended the “equal time” rule for broadcasting, thus making it so 14 minor-party candidates running for president in 1960 did not need to be granted equal time. The Democrat Kennedy and the Republican Nixon would debate one-on-one, and millions would be watching. Some anticipated the debate audience could top that figure — and even make or break a candidate’s chances in the election. A mass of media at McClurg Court CBS was selected to handle the first debate at its relatively new Chicago headquarters at 630 N. McClurg Ct. The building had been completed in 1924 as a horse stable for the Chicago Riding Club, and a dozen years later became the Chicago Arena — which offered skating to the public and also hosted figure skating competitions, amateur hockey league games, and the Ice Capades. In addition to its vast ice rink, the Chicago Arena featured a bowling alley, a grill, and a $50,000 Wurlitzer theater pipe organ that was played as accompaniment for the skating. In 1954, CBS purchased the Chicago Arena building for $1.5 million. The theater organ was sold off, the ice rink was removed, and according to the pamphlet “WBBM Radio Yesterday & Today,” original building architect Andrew Rebori developed a new design for the building as a broadcast center. The CBS Chicago broadcast center opened in 1956 — replacing a scattered local operation with studios at the Garrick Theater at 64 W. Randolph St. and the State-Lake Theatre at 190 N. State St. — the latter which, as it happens, is now and has long been the home of Chicago’s ABC 7. The McClurg Court broadcast center later also supplanted CBS offices at the Wrigley Building. WBBM radio operations were housed on the upper floors, while TV studios for WBBM-TV, CBS Channel 2, were housed on the ground floor. Four years after the building opened as the Chicago broadcast operations center for CBS, Studio 1 at Channel 2 — the largest of four studios on the ground floor —would be the site where Nixon and Kennedy would meet for the very first televised presidential debate. Frantic preparation got under way ahead of time. Producer and director Don Hewitt, who eight years later would go on to create “60 Minutes,” served as the field commander for CBS at the Chicago studios. For several days, CBS executives and representatives of both candidates discussed debate rules, camera positions, lighting, and the style of chairs. A gray background was chosen for the black-and-white broadcast, but there were discussions and debates about the type of paint and the shade. Gallons of paint were hand-carried and the set was painted again and again. It was still sticky when the candidates arrived on the evening of Sept. 26. The candidates were driven into the broadcast center in late-model sedans through a back door on Erie Street, and right down a long, broad hallway that led to Studio 1. As seen in an old diagram prepared by the U.S. Secret Service and the Chicago Police Department — a replica of which CBS Chicago still has in its present building — every position was set ahead of time in Studio 1. The candidates were in front, facing moderator Howard K. Smith and the correspondents who would ask the candidates questions — Sander Vanocur of NBC News, Charles Warren of Mutual News, Stuart Novins of CBS News and Bob Fleming of ABC News. The Nixon and Kennedy campaigns also each had their own office space behind Studio 1. While Studio 2 was set aside for the nightly 10 o’clock news broadcasts on Channel 2, Studios 3 and 4 — farther down the hall toward the back of the building—were pressed into service for some 380 reporters who would watch the debate on closed-circuit television and type out reports in real-time. Nixon arrived first. His car came through the Erie Street rear entrance about an hour before airtime, at 7:30 p.m. He was met right away by CBS network brass—including Chairman William S. Paley and President Frank Stanton. Observers said Nixon seemed pale, and an aide said he had indeed turned sheet-white after suffering his knee injury and infection. Nevertheless, he came across as confident and relaxed. Meanwhile outside the broadcast center, dozens of Kennedy supporters only glimpsed at the back door as their candidate entered in a car through the Erie Street back door—and met with the same dignitaries and executives Nixon had. Many remarked on how good Kennedy looked — with a tan brought about by campaigning in an open car in California. The 6-foot 1-inch Kennedy also wore a dark suit that fit better than Nixon’s lighter gray suit that nearly matched the gray backdrop. Observers noted that Nixon had lost weight, and his clothes seemed baggy. Appearances overshadow what candidates say Before arriving, Nixon had met with a hostile labor union audience earlier in the day and had returned to the Congress Hotel in the South Loop a few minutes earlier, before going over the debate with an adviser on the way to CBS. Kennedy had made a brief campaign appearance before the same labor group, and had then spent time roleplaying the debate at the Ambassador East Hotel in the Gold Coast—with his advisers firing questions on all manner of domestic issues. Meanwhile, Nixon’s aides were worried about how he’d look on camera — with lost weight, pale skin, and stubble. The TV cameras made him look like he had a 5 o’clock shadow. CBS offered a professional makeup artist for both candidates, but both declined such a service — despite Nixon’s staff pleading with him to let the makeup artist work on him. So Nixon staffers went over to a Magnificent Mile drugstore and picked up some Lazy Shave—a product described in published reports as marketing itself as a “color-cake for between shaves.” Still, many thought Nixon looked haggard next to Kennedy. The subjects addressed at the debate focused on domestic policy, as noted by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. They included education, the economy, health care, labor, agriculture, and the Cold War, the library noted. “I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do,” Nixon said to the cameras. “But our disagreement is not about the goals for America, but only about the means to reach those goals.” “I come out of the Democratic Party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I’ve discussed tonight,” Kennedy told the cameras. Nixon followed a more traditional debate style — turning and facing away from the home audience and looking at Kennedy. When not speaking, observers noticed Nixon appeared to look nervously around the studio — sometimes at CBS News President Sig Mickelson, who was serving as timekeeper. But Kennedy seemed to listen calmly and intently to Nixon when not talking, observers noted. Meanwhile, Hewitt was in the control room directing the selection and timing of reaction shots from one candidate as the other spoke — standard procedure in television, but to the disappointment of the Nixon campaign. Nixon’s campaign felt the reaction shots were too close and tight, and very unflattering — and also took issue with full-body shots that showed Nixon favoring his knee that had been injured. Hot TV lights also had an effect. The 650-watt spotlights and studio lights caused Nixon to sweat profusely — defeating the purpose of Lazy Shave that had been applied to hide his stubble. The Kennedy campaign, for its part, was pleased with the way its candidate appeared in the reaction shots. Kennedy got 11 reaction shots totaling 118 seconds, while Nixon got nine shots and 85 seconds. Hewitt later said he had been told simply to call the reaction shots as he saw then, and that was what he did. After the debate, Nixon slipped quickly out the back door. But Kennedy came out the front door of the building on the McClurg Court side — and offered reporters the understatement of the year. “I thought it was an interesting evening,” Kennedy said. Meanwhile, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley was very impressed with Kennedy, saying he knew a winner when he saw one. “Terrific,” Daley said. “Kennedy looked like Wilson, Truman, and Roosevelt put together,” Daley said. Throngs of supporters of both Kennedy and Nixon were in the crowd in front of the CBS Chicago broadcast center after the debate. And many of those who listened to the debate on the radio, and had only the candidates’ words to go on, thought Nixon had won. But survey after survey of people who saw the debate on TV revealed the majority believed Kennedy was the victor. Those surveys also showed that among the audience of some 70 million, a huge number of undecided voters and independents decided to vote for Kennedy because of his performance in the televised debate. Three more debates, and a lot more history at CBS Chicago’s old studios Kennedy and Nixon debated three more times before the 1960 election—in New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Los Angeles. Nixon came off better in the later debates—particularly the last on foreign policy in New York on Oct. 21. But Kennedy won the election. Both Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1964, and Nixon — when he successfully ran again for president in 1968 and re-election in 1972 — refused to debate their opponents. The next televised presidential debate didn’t happen for 16 years, when incumbent President Gerald Ford and challenger Jimmy Carter debated in 1976. Vice presidential candidates Bob Dole and Walter Mondale also debated that year. As to the historic Studio 1 at the old CBS Chicago broadcast center, it looked much the same when “The Great Debate” special aired 25 years after Kennedy and Nixon’s visit. But it was put to other uses to great acclaim. Phil Donahue taped his “Donahue” talk show from Studio 1 before a live audience from 1982 through 1984. Chicago Tribune and Channel 2 News movie critic Gene Siskel and his Chicago Sun-Times rival, Roger Ebert, used the studio for “Siskel & Ebert” for many years too. In 1973, the wall came down between Studio 3 and 4 at the broadcast center — the very two studios where those 380 reporters had been plugging away at their typewriters during the 1960 debate. Now double in size, this space became a massive working newsroom that was designed to double as an on-air set for the news. The big newsroom with all its bustle was the on-air set for a famous era of Channel 2 News in the 1970s and 1980s — with such household name anchors as Walter Jacobson, Don Craig, Harry Porterfield, Lester Holt, Linda MacLennan, and of course, the very host of “The Great Debate” documentary, Bill Kurtis. Channel 2 went back to Studio 2 for its news set in the early 90s, but the big newsroom remained in use as the station’s newsroom until the station moved buildings. And for the last several years at the old broadcast center in the 2000s, CBS 2 News — as it was known by then — was a little farther down the hall, right back in the historic Studio 1 where Nixon and Kennedy had once debated before the country. And while the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy debate was the only general-election presidential debate ever held at the McClurg Court building, it was not the only high-profile debate held there. On March 13, 1992, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and former California Gov. Jerry Brown gathered at Studio 1 at the McClurg Court broadcast center for a Democratic presidential primary debate. This debate was staged by WBBM-TV CBS Channel 2, and WJBK-TV 2 in Detroit — now a Fox station, but a CBS affiliate back then. Kurtis moderated the 1992 Democratic primary debate with Rich Fisher of WJBK 2. A digitized recording survives on the C-SPAN website. CBS Chicago moved to its current broadcast center at 22 W. Washington St. in the fall of 2008. The old McClurg Court broadcast center was torn down, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab now occupies its footprint.

How Harris presents herself, speaks of Trump, handles the Biden administration’s record as well as her own, and talks about her plans for the future will be planned carefully. The latest New York Times-Siena College poll found that 28% want to learn more about Harris, while only 9% felt they needed new information about Trump, who has been in national politics for nine years and already served one term as president. To some of these voters, Harris will be introducing herself outside of Biden’s shadow for the first time. Prosecutor vs. ‘Momala’ Harris first rose to prominence as a prosecutor in California. She has leveraged this experience in her subsequent political forays, grilling Trump administration officials at Senate hearings as a freshman senator. But after anti-crime messaging fell out of favor with the more progressive part of the Democratic primary electorate ahead of the 2020 primaries and her prosecutorial record became an inviting target for primary opponents, she pivoted. The climate became even more hostile to Harris’s past branding when she was tapped for the vice presidential spot amid the upheaval over George Floyd. Harris also clearly worried about likability becoming a problem. Harris attempted to soften her image. Her speeches became filled with light catchphrases. As vice president, she spoke more about issues and events instead of interrogating people at committee hearings. She became known more for laughter than tongue-lashings. The image shift did not immediately work. Her poll numbers were lower than Biden’s for most of their term. Her musings about space and appearances with paid child actors were ridiculed. The softness did not translate into a tranquil office environment for her staff, among whom turnover was high. Harris has nevertheless tried to maintain a version of this persona in her joy-themed campaign. But she has also returned to her prosecutor roots as she has sought to run on parts of her record that are independent of the unpopular Biden administration. Some have advised her to be more of a prosecutor during the debate with Trump. “If [Trump’s] friend was promoting the bout, Don King, it would be the prosecutor vs. the felon,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said of a Trump-Harris debate on Morning Joe. “That’s how you’d promote it.” Pat Buchanan joked during the 1996 presidential campaign that if he were elected, he would turn toward outgoing President Bill Clinton during the inauguration and say, “You have the right to remain silent.” It remains to be seen whether Harris will go the “Lock him up!” route or simply laugh off Trump. Unburdened by what has been her platform Harris ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 Democratic nomination by positioning herself to Biden’s left. She did not make it to when the first votes were cast. Since taking over for Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has tried to move back to the center. She has celebrated the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney, a Republican who was once as controversial in liberal circles as Trump. She abandoned many of her most controversial 2019 policy positions, though often through spokespeople rather than in her own voice. Trump is likely to bring up all this history, tying her to her more progressive iteration as well as Biden’s policies. How liberal Harris chooses to be as Trump himself tries to move to the center will be one of the keys to the debate. Joe who? Harris was a top Biden defender through four years together on the Democratic ticket and in office. There is plenty of footage of her lauding Bidenomics and speaking favorably of the incumbent’s presidency. Even after the switch, she has rarely criticized and sometimes appeared at campaign events with Biden. Nevertheless, Harris also wants to be seen as her own person. Her chances hinge on whether she can be seen as a change candidate rather than more of the same despite being the sitting vice president. Harris will also face questions about what she knew about Biden’s health after years of assuring the public the now-81-year-old president was fit to keep serving until he turns 86. Harris is going to need to create some distance between herself and Biden while Trump tries to yoke them together.","summary":"Tuesday night’s presidential debate will be the longest voters have heard from an unscripted Vice President Kamala Harris since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket in late July.

Microexpressions are “the universal facial expressions of our species,” explained expert Annie Särnblad, which means they are universal for humans, despite cultural and region differences. This is also what makes them difficult to hide, she said, adding that “they precede the thought process.” “They are involuntary, and they last only a fraction of a second.” Särnblad, who previously analyzed Harris’ CNN interview, has a master’s degree in cultural anthropology and is also certified in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Tonight, Särnblad will exclusively analyze what microexpressions she sees on the candidates’ faces for the Daily Beast. A televised debate is a “really high-stakes situation,” said Särnblad. “So we are going to be looking for if the facial expressions match the words because the microexpressions precede the thought process.” “Remember, [microexpressions] tell you what they are feeling. Not what they are thinking,” said Särnblad. “For example if I say, ‘I hate broccoli,’ and I am showing the microexpression of disgust, that makes sense because I am talking about something really negative.” However there can often be a noticeable disconnect when someone attempts to hide what they are feeling by using positive words but showing negative microexpressions. She added, “When I myself have worked with my clients to prepare them for public debates or a high-stakes negotiations, I try to get them to focus on answering the questions that they are given. We all know that trick of diverting and answering the question that you wish you had gotten rather than responding honestly. But I think the public is smart enough to see through that.” Särnblad said she will also be watching to see what the candidates do to self-sooth themselves under pressure. “One of the universal things about body language is that we humans touch our skin when we get nervous,” said Särnblad. “One of the really interesting things about politicians is they will use the self-soothing technique of doing the steeple, which is actually a way to calm yourself down by touching your skin.” She added, “It looks like a powerful position but it is really used to calm your nervous system.” Leading up to the debate, the Harris camp reportedly requested that mics be left on while the opposing candidate answers a question. In turn, 6-foot-3 Trump has requested that no boxes or lifts be allowed during the event, which could lead to him towering over Harris (reportedly 5-foot-2) if they are allowed to roam around the stage, like Trump famously did during his debate against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Annie Särnblad is the author of three books: “Diary of a Human Lie Detector: Facial Expressions in Love, Lust, and Lies”; “The Facial Expressions Glossary: Business Version”; and the recently released “Annie and the Secret Language of Faces”.

It’s essential to emphasize that all of us, especially younger generations, have a role to play. We heard presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Michelle and Barack Obama all say that we have to move beyond fretting about what’s ahead and “do something.” They emphasized that moving beyond concern and taking action — becoming civically engaged — is crucial. One way that Illinois has taken steps to encourage young people’s civic engagement is through championing civics and media literacy as a required curriculum for high school students. Ten years ago, I was involved with the Illinois Civic Mission Coalition, training teachers across Illinois on how to connect and equip young people with the skills to tackle, debate and engage with contemporary issues both in and out of the classroom. Media literacy skills support civic engagement by equipping young people to take “informed action” — meaning they know how to navigate and engage with civic discourse using credible, fact-based sources of information. In 2021, Illinois took a significant step forward by becoming the first state to require a media literacy unit in all high schools, further embedding civic engagement into students’ core curricula. While training the next generation of journalists at Medill, I continue to engage with a younger, broader group of young people through supporting scholastic journalism programs. Scholastic journalism involves teaching and practicing journalism in schools, with students producing publications like newspapers and yearbooks. Student journalists learn how to report on issues relevant to their school communities in an informed and ethical manner. They also demonstrate the value of active participation in public discourse around those issues. For both student journalists and their peer audiences, the ultimate goal of scholastic journalism is recognizing the importance of high-quality, verified sources of information. It involves collecting, evaluating and synthesizing information to form conclusions and disseminate them to an audience. These experiences and work cannot be underestimated for the ways that it bolsters the critical thinking and reasoning skills that are crucial in today’s information age. Past research shows that involvement in journalism is correlated with higher ACT composite, English, and social studies scores. Recent studies show that involvement in scholastic journalism builds students’ “communication competence” and “civic self-efficacy.” This empowers them to evaluate political information and articulate their own positions, leading to greater civic engagement. I have seen some of that work be done by members of the Illinois Youth Press Corps at the recent Democratic National Convention. These young people had the opportunity to talk to lawmakers from different parties and parts of the country, and then had to quickly report back to their local school communities on what they learned and saw, in a way relevant to their peers. To help more of our young people get and stay engaged, they need to see their peers in scholastic journalism programs be models for how to collect and make meaning from multiple sources of information. To foster greater engagement, we need to support scholastic journalism programs, encouraging more young people to get involved — whether as participants or consumers. If your child’s school doesn’t have a program, consider encouraging them to start one, as even a small newsletter can spark meaningful conversations and community engagement. Michael A.

By MICHELLE L. PRICE, ZEKE MILLER and JILL COLVIN The Associated Press September 10, 2024 at 11:04PM The spin room and media center ahead of the presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2024. (Graham Dickie/The New York Times) (GRAHAM DICKIE/The New York Times) PHILADELPHIA — Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer. The event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris. The vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past. The debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking Tuesday to donors in Las Vegas, highlighted Trump's experience debating after three White House runs. ''No one in modern times has done more of these,'' he said. ''The good news is that this is his seventh debate, and we know exactly what to expect.'' The first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama. The set where the two candidates will be debating tonight is relatively small. The candidates' lecterns are positioned about 6-8 feet apart in a small, blue-lit amphitheater with no live audience in the room. That means there will be no rowdy applause, no cheers or jeers. The candidates will enter at the same time from opposite sides of the stage. Related Coverage News & Politics What to know about tonight’s presidential debate and how to watch it in Minnesota Nation The Latest: Trump and Harris are set to debate in Philadelphia Trump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions Harris took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates. Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs — and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned — as pragmatism, insisting that her ''values remain the same.'' Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues. Trump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent. ''President Trump is going to be himself,'' senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday. Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump ''respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.'' The vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall. She is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail ''those involved in unscrupulous behavior,'' including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials. ___ Price and Miller reported from Washington.

The outlet’s senior editor, Alex Shephard wrote that the approach to lying low and let the media propel her campaign on good \"vibes\" is not working anymore. He declared that the \"honeymoon is over\" and argued that Harris’ strategy resulted in making her look like an empty suit. \"But having too few policies is also risky, not least because it makes Harris look like she doesn’t stand for anything,\" Shephard declared in his Tuesday piece, titled, \"Kamala Harris Can’t Keep Running Like This.\" ‘TOTAL BULLS---’: TRUMP CAMPAIGN RIPS ‘PREPOSTEROUS’ HARRIS PRO-BORDER WALL NARRATIVE AFTER MEDIA REPORT The author began the article with his observation that the good vibes that accompanied Harris’ replacement of Biden at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket have gone. \"After seven weeks of euphoria over Kamala Harris’s ascension to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, panic finally returned to the party on Sunday,\" Shephard wrote. He cited a New York Times poll showing Trump’s \"slim lead over Harris nationally\" and their \"dead heat\" in the swing states, and offered it as evidence that \"momentum that had sustained Harris since President Biden withdrew from the race has clearly dissipated.\" Multiple outlets have reported on just how close the race is between Harris and former President Trump. CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten stated last week that it’s the closest election in a \"generation\" and noted that if Trump were to outperform polling by only a single point, he’d win. Shephard went on to rebuke Harris’ strategy, saying that the ever-tightening polls reveal \"failure\" on the part of her team. \"This was always going to be a very close election, even after Harris replaced Biden. But the tightening of the polls over the past week points to a failure in Harris’s campaign. She had nearly two months to show voters who she is and what she stands for. Instead, she has played it safe, hoping to maintain the positive vibes and momentum of the summer by deliberately not staking out positions on controversial policies.\" \"It’s now clear that that approach is no longer working,\" he added, though he did say Harris has \"plenty of time\" to right her ship, as long as she starts \"abandoning the cautious approach she’s taking up since becoming the nominee – and publicly breaking with Joe Biden.\" FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS BIDEN ADMIN MOVE TO GIVE LEGAL STATUS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SPOUSES OF US CITIZENS Shephard also grilled Harris for abandoning her previous progressive stances on issues for this election and not replacing them with anything substantial. \"She quickly jettisoned progressive positions she took during the 2020 presidential race – such as gun buybacks, a fracking ban, and Medicare for All – without saying much about where she currently stands,\" he wrote, adding that her strategy was to \"avoid the risk of an aggressive policy agenda that would expose her to criticism.\" However, the author argued that didn’t work because people don’t know what she stands for and that her minimal policy points \"then get nitpicked to death.\" \"Her price-gouging solution was roundly criticized by economists across the political spectrum, while her tip policy has come under fire because it was first taken up by Trump.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Towards the end of his piece, the editor advised Harris to \"step out of Biden’s shadow\" during the debate Tuesday night and demonstrate \"a positive agenda.\" \"The polls are clear: The summer honeymoon is over. This debate will likely be Harris’s best opportunity to shift the polls back in her favor—and to define herself to the millions of voters who are on the fence about her. But it will also require her to take uncomfortable, even controversial positions,\" he concluded. \"She can no longer expect to keep reaping political rewards without taking any risks.\"","summary":"New Republic senior editor Alex Shephard slammed Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; campaign, saying it has been too &quot;safe&quot; and squandered the momentum Harris had after replacing Biden.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/outlet-fed-harris-safe-campaign-looks-doesnt-stand-anything","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/KamalaHarris9224.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:00:46","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":256115808,"title":"What Time Does the Presidential Debate Start?","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will face off for their first presidential debate Tuesday night. ABC’s “World News Tonight” anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir will moderate this presidential debate, abiding by rules similar to the Biden-Trump CNN debate in June. The 90-minute debate will kick off Tuesday night on ABC News at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT. Harris entered the race just seven weeks ago after President Joe Biden’s disappointing first debate performance. Facing harsh criticism to drop out from top Democratic donors and leaders, Biden departed from the race and endorsed his vice president. The former California attorney general revealed in an exclusive CNN interview Aug. 29 that she and the former president have never met in person, making tonight’s matchup their first in-person introduction. Per ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, the candidates’ microphones will be muted as their opponent speaks. The Harris campaign sought to change this rule after she became the Democratic nominee, but Trump wanted to keep the rules consistent with what he agreed to originally in May. The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be allowed to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two allotted commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another. After CNN’s presidential debate this summer, viewers were disappointed by the lack of fact-checking in real-time. When asked how the network would fact-check the candidates, Rick Klein, ABC’s political director, was avoidant, according to a recent report in The New York Times. “We’re not making a commitment to fact-checking everything, or fact-check nothing, in either direction,” he said, adding that ABC is there to facilitate a good debate. The first and possibly final matchup between the 2024 presidential candidates will air live on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu, and will be available for simulcast. It will also be televised or streamed by multiple media outlets. We will be providing live updates throughout the debate.","summary":"The first meeting of Harris and Trump will take place live on ABC News Tuesday night\n\n\nThe post What Time Does the Presidential Debate Start? appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/what-time-is-presidential-debate-start-kamala-trump/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-debate.jpeg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:00:00","author":"Tess Patton","authors":["Tess Patton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179}]}
