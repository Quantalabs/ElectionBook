The glamour of the Met Gala promenade honoring Black dandyism. And, then, Ian Frazier takes a deep dive into the hazardous lives of New York City pigeons. Plus:\n• Elon Musk’s supercomputer is polluting Memphis\n• A boxing match in Times Square\n• What we can learn from broken things\nVinson Cunningham\nCunningham is a critic for the magazine, and was a finalist for the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.\nEvery time I watch the glamorous Met Gala red carpet—as sure a sign of spring as the small bottle of Zyrtec sitting on my sink—I start worrying about the poor photographers. Like all journalists, they’ve got a pushy, unlovely, absolutely essential job to do. Like all artists, they’ve got to get it done with style. Last night, watching Vogue’s live stream of the event, eager to see how the famous walkers would handle the vast, untameable concept and legacy of the Black dandy in an era of attacks on D.E.I., I kept getting distracted by the photographers behind the flower-bedecked barricades.\nThe ur-dandy in my life—having grown up uptown—is the legendary Harlem designer and haberdasher Dapper Dan. You’d glimpse him, tall and elegant in some wild getup, promenading across 125th Street or down Lenox Avenue. The trick, though, was to shut up and let the man walk on; his vibe was “uninterrupted.” At the Met, though: forget it.\nEarly on, Diana Ross showed up in a hat vibrant at its edges with a feathery fringe. She dragged a long, wide train behind her; it lay atop the carpet—midnight blue, not red—like a huge white tongue. The photographers howled with a lusty energy: “Over here!” “Stay in the center!” “RIGHT THERE!” If dandyism is, at least in part, a kind of showy restraint—being seen on purpose without caring so much about how the spectacle is apprehended by others—this was something like its zenith. Ross, always so cool, followed the photographers’ instructions with the simplest motions of her head and neck, as if she’d always meant things to turn out this way.\nAs more guests rolled in, I imagined what the photographers might have really wanted to say to certain eminences.\nTo Colman Domingo, that sweet man, wearing a pleated electric-blue cape and, later, sporting a big froofy polka-dot boutonniere appended to his checkered lapel: “PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE YOUR YEARS-LONG CHOKEHOLD ON RED-CARPET FASHION! A LITTLE TO THE LEFT!”\nTo Kim Kardashian, in her weird witch’s leather: “LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER, KIM! ALSO, PLEASE CALL YOUR EX-HUSBAND AND SOMEHOW GET HIM TO STOP TWEETING!”\nTo Kamala Harris, had she walked the carpet in her black-and-white silks: “CAN YOU TELL US ALL, IN DETAIL, HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THE DECISION TO BE HERE TONIGHT?”\n\nIn New York City, humans usually wear shoes (mostly closed-toed, if you know what’s good for you), dogs sometimes wear booties, and even N.Y.P.D. horses are reshod every four to six weeks. Pigeons, however, tackle the city barefoot. They deal with burns from landing on lighted signs, abrasions from jagged concrete, and diseases such as bumblefoot, a bacterial infection that can cause their toes to curl up and fall off. For the New York-themed Centenary Issue, Ian Frazier investigates the foot problems facing urban birds, and spends time with the people who care for them. As a specialist in homing pigeons tells him, “These birds have the blood of heroes in their veins.” Read the story »\n\nBill McKibben on how Elon Musk is powering his supercomputer\nJoshua Rothman asks what we can learn from broken things\nKelefa Sanneh on the spectacle of a boxing match in Times Square\n\nPlay today’s moderately challenging puzzle.

I can't spoil it for nobody.”\n\n However, she spilled that her character Mia “goes through a lot of twists and turns, but some really interesting ones.” \n\n “The last few weeks that we were filming it were the weeks just as we were coming up on the election and we filmed it maybe a couple weeks after the election and it was a real shift,” she explained, adding that the show “is women-led, women-run, women centric.”\n\n “There was this real penny drop,” she said of President Donald Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. “It was a sense of deadass, we were sincerely focused on what it meant to be telling a story like we were with an extraordinary candidate, Madame Vice President having not ended up in the White House, so we were really trying to create some strong, serious footing for ourselves as we went.” \n\n “Knowing what I know about what season four is, it's gonna be very interesting to see what people feel about it, knowing the political sociopolitical climate.”\n\n Of the new season, Pittman explained it will look at the aftermath of Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) stopping the sale of UBA to corporate titan Paul Marks’ (Jon Hamm) Hyperion by suggesting a merger between UBA and NBN to the board.\n\n “They step on everybody on their way up and so much of that comes to bear in season four,” she said. “I mean, there's so many things.”\n\n “We broke it down and then see how we put it back together,” she said of the upcoming season.\n\n Season four of The Morning Show will see the additions of new cast members, including Jeremy Irons, who will portray Martin Levy, Alex's father, and Marion Cotillard, who will star as Celine Dumont, a \"savvy operator from a storied European family,\" per Deadline.\n\n Aniston previously opened up to PEOPLE about the challenges the cast faced during filming.\n\n \"Oh my gosh, it was hard.

Hate to miss an historical event!\"\n\nAfter Miami Heat forward Kevin Love asked \"who's the injury replacement?\" James said his wife, Savannah, would attend the Met Gala, as the athlete labeled her a \"beautiful powerful Queen\" and said she would be \"holding the castle down as she always has done!\"Despite his injury woes, users on X weren't having it as one person joked: \"He had to let the world know why he lost 4-1 and keep up with the narrative that he’s injured,\" referring to James and the Los Angeles Lakers playoff loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nAnother suggested: \"The PR team decided you can cook up a good injury excuse narrative and address you missing a Met Gala at the same time, huh?\"\n\n\"Michael Jordan wouldn’t miss it, just confirms he’s the goat once again,\" a user said, and noted the icon's performance during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz despite having the flu.\n\nA person raged: \"What knee injury?

He got his key message across — but got a largely unrelated earful in exchange from United States President Donald Trump.\n\nA trip to the White House has become a rite of passage for leaders around the world, with a series of predictable elements in the Trump era — from the blindside on social media to the handshake and the tense sitdown in the newly gilded Oval Office.\n\nWithin the first few minutes of the meeting, Carney took an opportunity to interject with a clear pushback against Trump’s repeated assertions that Canada should become the “51st state.” \n\nThe comments were carefully calibrated, using Trump’s own preferred language of real estate. After pointing out that some properties simply are not for sale, like the White House and Buckingham Palace, Carney asserted that Canada “will not be for sale, ever.”\n\nTrump repeatedly demurred in response, replying “never say never” and later in the meeting, “time will tell.” Carney, however, mouthed “never” as the president spoke — ostensibly joking but, in fact, clearly serious.\n\nMuch of the rest of the meeting was dominated by Trump’s commentary, holding forth on everything from Carney’s recent election victory — for which the president claimed credit — to American attacks on Yemen and trade with China.\n\nCarney didn’t bite\n\nWithout mentioning them by name, Trump also found time to remind the assembled media of his contempt for Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and Canada’s former finance minister Chrystia Freeland — now handling the transport and internal trade portfolio for Carney — referring to her as “terrible.”\n\nCarney didn’t take the bait, and for the most part, seemed content to let Trump hold court, interjecting a couple of times to correct or redirect points Trump raised. \n\nIn particular, Carney made clear that he sees the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USCMA) as a basis for future talks, committed Canada to a “step change” in its military investment and vowed to contribute to the president’s war on largely fictional fentanyl trafficking across the Canada-U.S. border. \n\nCarney also pushed back against Trump’s insistence that the U.S. does not need Canada, noting that the country is America’s “biggest client.” He was alluding to the fact that Canada buys more goods from the U.S. than any other country. \n\nCarney’s verbal pushback was further reinforced with some very effective face acting, reminiscent of Kamala Harris’s debate performance. The Carney head tilt seems destined to join the internet meme pantheon, a shortcut for “that’s sus” — “suspect” — that belongs to the ages.\n\nAt the same time, almost everything Carney did say was met with skepticism and rebuttal.\n\nIndeed, the very idea of a new trade agreement and an end to tariffs on Canada was treated as an open question by Trump, who suggested that while USMCA was a “fine” agreement — miles better in his view than the very similar NAFTA agreement that preceded it — such a deal may no longer be needed.\n\nAt one point, he even suggested USMCA be terminated outright.\n\nFalse claims\n\nAs always, misinformation featured prominently in the president’s comments throughout the meeting with Carney. He returned repeatedly to his false claims about the U.S. subsidizing Canada. In doing so, he again confused a trade deficit with a financial subsidy. These falsehoods, moreover, were never directly rebutted by Carney. \n\n Read more:\n Trump's obsession with trade deficits has no basis in economics. And it's a bad reason for tariffs\n\nAt another point, Trump said Canada could do nothing to convince him to remove tariffs.\n\nHe later expanded on the point, returning to the idea that tariffs on things like Canadian energy, steel, aluminium and cars were not part of a trade negotiation, but rather an explicit attempt to end trade between the two countries in an attempt to reindustrialize the American economy. \n\nSimply put, under a thin veneer of supposed friendship and convivial conversation, Trump implied the U.S. no longer wants fair trade between the two countries, but no trade — unless it comes with an end to Canadian independence. \n\nGiven the importance of the bilateral relationship, the meeting went as well as Canadians — and sympathetic Americans — could reasonably hope. Trump and his assembled cabinet secretaries did not gang up on Carney as they did on Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this year. \n\nInstead, the meeting reinforced the idea that the two countries are indeed friends and they will continue to talk about the issues that divide them. \n\nCarney came across as polite yet assertive, and was largely treated with the respect due to a foreign head of government. \n\nTariffs, trade\n\nAt the same time, the two sides could not even agree on what they disagreed on. Carney emphasized the need for a refurbished agreement between the two countries addressing trade irritants in much the same way the two countries have done for decades. He went so far as to point out that the U.S. has taken advantage of the agreement with its approach to tariffs.\n\n Read more:\n Trump's proposed tariffs against Canada and Mexico may be illegal, but that's not the real problem\n\nTrump, conversely, remained committed to a project to fundamentally reorganize the American economy in a way that does not include Canada as an independent trading partner. \n\nAs the president said, “time will tell” whose vision ultimately triumphs. But in the meantime, Canadians should expect a decidedly frosty friendship to continue.","summary":"Under a thin veneer of supposed friendship and convivial conversation, the Oval Office meeting between Mark Carney and Donald Trump was tense.","url":"https://theconversation.com/mark-carney-tells-donald-trump-canada-is-not-for-sale-in-a-high-stakes-oval-office-meeting-255931","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/666216/original/file-20250506-56-6rv3dw.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C728%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 20:40:21","author":"Lecturer,Political Science,Stewart Prest,University of British Columbia","authors":["Lecturer","Political Science","Stewart Prest","University of British Columbia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.209},{"id":318529104,"title":"Gov. Kathy Hochul, other Dem state leaders will be hauled to DC, face congressional grilling over ‘reckless’ pro-migrant sanctuary policies","text":"WASHINGTON — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker are being called to DC next month to face a congressional grilling over their states’ pro-migrant policies.\n\nThe three Democratic “sanctuary” state leaders will have to answer questions June 12 about how their administrations reduced or banned cooperation with federal immigration authorities under former President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans argue such policies, which have continued under President Trump, fueled illegal immigration into the country and thwarted deportations of non-citizens by the feds.\n\n“Sanctuary policies only provide sanctuaries for criminal illegal aliens,” said House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), who invited the liberal governors to Capitol Hill for the hearing.\n\n“Former President Biden created the worst border crisis in US history and allowed criminal illegal aliens to flood our communities,” he said.\n\n“The Trump Administration is taking decisive action to deport criminal illegal aliens from our nation but reckless sanctuary states like Illinois, Minnesota, and New York are actively seeking to obstruct federal immigration enforcement.”\n\nRepublicans have often lashed out at blue state leaders and city officials for enabling horrific crimes — such as the murder of Laken Riley — by failing to coordinate on immigration enforcement with the feds and other lax immigration policies.\n\nThe first law that Trump signed after returning to the White House was named for the slain Georgia nursing student — and opened localities to lawsuits should they fail to deport migrants charged with theft, assault or other serious crimes causing bodily injury or death.\n\nRiley’s convicted killer Jose Ibarra — an illegal immigrant from Venezuela and suspected member of the violent Tren de Aragua gang — had been arrested for shoplifting just months before her gruesome murder on the University of Georgia campus. He has since been sentenced to life in prison for her slaying.\n\nThe Oversight hearing announcement follows a similar panel in March on sanctuary policies with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston.\n\nIt also follows an executive order by Trump calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to produce a list of cities and states that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”\n\nIf sanctuary jurisdictions don’t make changes, “the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to end these violations and bring such jurisdictions into compliance with the laws of the United States,” according to the order.\n\nIn March, Bondi announced that the Justice Department was suing New York state over its so-called “Green Light Law” allowing non-citizens obtain driver’s licenses and barring inquiries into their immigration status — unless ordered to do so by a judge.\n\nThose who obtain a license are also tipped off if federal immigration authorities seek access to it.\n\nIllinois and Minnesota have similarly battled against the Trump admin’s immigration policies, with Pritzker and Walz attacking the move to deport migrants illegally present in the country.\n\n“The president has also chosen, and I stress this, chosen, to tear up the values that once made America the shining light of the world,” Walz, who was Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election against Trump, declared in a speech to the Minnesota legislature last month.\n\n“In this land of the free and home of the brave, we have university students being swept up, shoved into unmarked vans, and fathers being tossed into Salvadorian gulags without a hint of due process,” Walz said in his State of the State address.\n\n“I want to be real clear about this. If you say you love freedom, but you don’t believe freedom is for everybody, then the thing you love isn’t freedom, it’s privilege.”\n\nHochul had previously promised a “list” of crimes that would have eased cooperation for Trump’s mass deportations operation to pick up migrant offenders — but it was never delivered.\n\nAvi Small, her press secretary, said in a statement after the DOJ lawsuit that the governor “has been clear from day one: she supports deporting violent criminals who break our laws, believes that law-abiding families should not be targets, and will coordinate with federal authorities who have a judicial warrant.”\n\nFederal funds were first frozen by Bondi in February for a 60-day review of all “sanctuary jurisdictions” — including New York, which was slated for around $8 billion in funding to city agencies in fiscal year 2025, municipal data show.\n\nRoughly 139,000 illegal immigrants were deported in Trump’s first 100 days, border czar Tom Homan announced last week, while noting that migrant arrests on the US-Mexico border had plummeted to around 11,000 in March, the lowest figure on record.\n\nThe Post reached out to reps for Hochul, Walz and Pritzker for comment on the upcoming hearing.","summary":"“Sanctuary policies only provide sanctuaries for criminal illegal aliens,\" said House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) who invited the liberal governors to Capitol Hill for the hearing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/06/us-news/gov-kathy-hochul-dem-state-leaders-will-be-hauled-to-dc-face-congressional-grilling-over-pro-migrant-sanctuary-polices/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/ny-gov-kathy-hochul-minnesota-103955209.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HlY8dVIq-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-06 20:05:33","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":318529522,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Another Trump Win at SCOTUS","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

Marc Elias: '60 Minutes' Guest Makes Shocking Promise After CBS' News Program Airs Scathing Segment About President Despite $20Billion Lawsuit — 'I Will Never Back Down'","text":"The main attorney at the center of a scathing 60 Minutes report on President Trump's controversial executive orders targeting law firms is not backing down, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nMarc Elias, a former Perkins Cole partner and longtime rival of Trump, has issued his own pledge to continue to challenge the president.On Sunday's episode of the long-running newsmagazine, host Scott Pelley slammed Trump for issuing retaliatory executive orders aimed at some of the biggest firms in the country that have been critical of him.\n\nElias was one of the few Trump opponents willing to go on camera to share their concern over the president's tactics. Hours after his appearance, Elias, who has represented Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris' presidential campaigns, wrote an op-ed for Democracy Docket, the website he founded.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Trump's hateful words are not behind me,\" he shared. \"I am certain he will escalate his campaign of political retribution. But, for my part, I will not stop fighting. I will never back down. And I will always speak out.\"Elias previously challenged Trump in 2020, when he defeated the businessman's efforts to contest the election results in court.\n\nThe lawyer explained the history of their feud, writing: \"The basic outlines of his grievances against me are well known. He hates me for working for Hillary Clinton. He despises me for humiliating him in court after the 2020 election.

But Hollywood is in freefall. California productions have flatlined and landing a TV writing job is now like competing in The Hunger Games. Can the business, as we know it, be saved—and who is truly to blame for its current implosion? \n\nHere’s a wacky theory regarding the second question from this journalist turned TV writer: Trump viewers have brought Hollywood to its knees, with an assist from the series The Wire and other “prestige” TV projects. \n\nHere’s what I mean. \n\nWhen I was a kid, there wasn’t a thing called “prestige” television. There was just television. If it was good, everybody watched it. If it was bad, it got canceled and mostly forgotten.\n\nSt. Elsewhere, Cagney & Lacey, The Golden Girls, The Jeffersons—all of these classic shows were mainstream hits, driving cultural conversations, generating massive audiences and winning plenty of critical acclaim. And they were all on network television. \n\nBut cable created a class divide. I once had to beg a friend to let me come over and watch Sex and the City—she could afford cable and I couldn’t. This divide was exacerbated by entertainment journalists and insiders who become increasingly enamored with shows many Americans weren’t actually watching. (I became acutely aware of this when Lena Dunham’s Girls became a phenomenon. There was endless coverage of Girls in the press, even though just a few hundred thousand people were watching it.)\n\nSex and the City and The Sopranos were among the first wave of shows that became like a secret only cool kids could discuss. The Wire was a tipping point. It was gritty, based on real-life and created by the journalist turned TV legend David Simon—not necessarily fun viewing, but the sort of show you’re supposed to watch. But despite the insistence of my fellow writer friends who are obsessed with it, The Wire was not a big hit. It did not win major awards, nor did it score great ratings. The audience it did find, however, was prestigious, including President Barack Obama.\n\nI’ll never forget the time another writer reprimanded me for not watching every episode of The Wire, though I had watched every episode of a show she worked on. But it was a network show and she therefore found my taste questionable, which is still hilarious. \n\nWhat’s not funny, however, is how much the divide between The Wire obsessives and everyone else has grown since I entered the industry. When I started, meetings ran the gambit from family dramas, comedies and superhero shows. Eventually though, every project centered on something “edgy.” \n\nBut ratings data consistently asserts the dominance of CBS, home to numerous middle-of-the-road sitcoms and procedurals. Most Americans don’t want “edgy.” Today, real-life is edgy enough.\n\nThe divide that has emerged in entertainment consumption parallels our country’s political divide. The campaign against Donald Trump was predicated on the idea that smart people would never vote for him; Hollywood keeps making stuff that few people want to watch, then claiming it’s “prestige” television that only smart people get. Is it a surprise then, that most of Hollywood endorsed Kamala Harris and half of the country shrugged and voted for the other guy? \n\nConservative writer Jon Podhoretz predicted in 2021 that media elites' obsession with the show Succession—versus Yellowstone, despite the latter having a much larger audience—portended a potential Trump re-election. He was right. The question is whether or not Hollywood has learned anything since.\n\nIronically, those network shows on when I was a kid could be considered “edgy.” The Golden Girls was one of the first television shows in which a gay couple discussed their wedding. It also featured an interracial couple, but was not the first—that would be The Jeffersons. Cagney & Lacey tackled the abortion debate way back in 1985. \n\nThese shows respected viewers enough not to talk down to them. They trusted that if the writing was good, and the actors were great, Americans—of all political affiliations and races—would watch. Research confirms that TV shows can move the needle on people’s political and social attitudes—but only if people watch them! By ideologically segregating content, Hollywood has actually been moving our country backwards. Unfortunately, many of its decision-makers are too lacking in ideological diversity themselves to see it. \n\nI’m hoping this changes soon. Maybe the prospect of production and shoots spreading out nationwide will help. Because I shudder to think what our country’s political landscape will look like if people never watch TV shows with their family members and friends again. Republican operative Karl Rove credits The Cosby Show with changing perspectives on Black Americans in a way that paved the way for the election of President Barack Obama. But that only happens if Americans who disagree on politics can agree on what constitutes great TV.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyPresident Donald Trump‘s announcement of a plan to try to help the American movie industry by imposing tariffs on films made abroad has drawn much confusion and criticism.

Before that, she was the foundation’s chief communications officer.\n\nIf Maher has “evolved” only in the past five years, she’s hardly cut out to run any media organization, let alone a taxpayer-funded one.\n\nBut if she really does think the president’s fascist and America’s racist, and is now lying about these inconvenient convictions, what does that say about her character?\n\nWhatever the answer, she has no business leading any organization that claims to be nonpartisan. (Maher’s mother, as it happens, is a Connecticut state senator — a Democrat.)\n\nShe can’t have it both ways, insisting America is in the grip of fascism one moment, then soliciting government support the next — who’d want to be funded by a fascist’s government?\n\nShouldn’t it be a point of pride for people like Maher to accept no money from fascists or racists?\n\nNPR’s leader is an ideologue but also an opportunist, and her public statements reveal not just her animosity toward the Republican president but her nihilistically relativist worldview.\n\n“Our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that is getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done,” she mused in a 2022 TED Talk.\n\n“We all have different truths,” she added. “They are based on things like where we come from, how we were raised, and how other people perceive us.”\n\nThis might sound like mush, but it means that objective truth — truthful truth, one might say — is too divisive a standard and instead “truth” must derive from identity, and identity politics.\n\nNPR’s programming and practices reflect that philosophy as much as its choice of CEO.\n\nWhen someone does speak up for a true truth at NPR, he can expect to be punished.\n\nThat was the experience of Uri Berliner, a senior editor with 25 years’ tenure at NPR, who was suspended without pay after he wrote an essay for The Free Press last year exposing the “lack of viewpoint diversity” inside the broadcaster.\n\nPBS isn’t as egregiously slanted as NPR, but that’s not saying much.\n\n“Public broadcasting” is simply a misnomer: These corporations are “public-private partnerships,” which means in practice they take public money to promote private beliefs that align with one party’s left wing.\n\nBig Bird’s popular enough to thrive without subsidies.\n\nNPR and PBS have become megaphones for messages like Maher’s, and it’s high time taxpayers stopped being forced to pay for them.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.","summary":"All Americans shouldn't be taxed to pay for radio and TV programming that caters primarily to Democrats — and is rife with leftist bias.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/06/opinion/big-bird-defense-wont-work-this-time-as-trump-axes-pbs-npr-funding/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/103955701.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 18:25:42","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":318508096,"title":"Kamala Harris to headline Democratic fundraiser as she ramps up public appearances","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is lending a hand to Democrats as they attempt to rake in donations on Tuesday in her latest appearance as she reemerges into the spotlight after her November election loss.\n\nHarris is slated to appear at a closed-door New York City fundraiser in conversation with Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.\n\nAhead of the event, in response to inquiries about Harris' participation, a DNC spokesperson told ABC News that it views Harris as a \"powerful\" and \"galvanizing\" force in the party and grateful for her help.\n\n\"Vice President Harris continues to be a powerful and galvanizing voice for Democrats, and we are grateful for her commitment to strengthening the party, firing up grassroots supporters, and holding Republicans accountable for their attacks on working families,\" a DNC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe fundraiser comes as Harris begins to ramp up public appearances both political and apolitical, and as speculation continues over her political future.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris sharply criticized President Donald Trump over tariffs, government cuts and the direction his administration is taking the country in remarks in San Francisco.\n\n\"Instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" Harris told attendees at a gala celebrating an organization that supports Democratic women running for office.\n\nOn Monday, Harris and her spouse Doug Emhoff made a surprise appearance at the annual Met Gala in New York City, joining celebrities and socialites in celebrating and supporting the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.\n\nHarris told Vogue, \"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics.\"\n\nThe specifics of her political future remain an open question.

The two would divorce in 1983.\n\nDuring the party, he and Von Fürstenberg made their way to a sofa - 'far away from the rest - where they spoke, flirted, and exchanged information.\n\nOn his way to the elevator, Diller - despite already coming to terms with being gay - said he realized had been seduced.\n\nHe called Von Fürstenberg - creator of the wrap dress - the next day, and they enjoyed an authentic Chinese dinner Diller noted was 'served by her Chinese butler and cooked by his wife.'\n\nAfterward, 'on the same sofa as the night before,' he notes - the two made out at length 'like teenagers.'\n\n'[It was] something I hadn’t done with a female since I was 16 years old.'\n\nThe two would continue their whirlwind relationship until the early days of Studio 54, until a fling between Von Fürstenberg and Richard Gere brought it to an abrupt end.\n\nDiller blamed the blowup to his 'overreaction' to the romance, which took place when Gere had been filming for American Gigolo. Diller was one of the film's producers.\n\nOver the course of the next decade, 'without plot or plan,' the two reconnected, eventually growing closer and closer, before rekindling their 'first ferocious love,' Diller said.\n\nOn February 2, 2001, the two finally tied the knot, 26 years after that first, fateful meeting.\n\nBy this point, Diller had held successful stints at not only Paramount, but Fox and QVC as well.\n\nHe would go on to join the board of Coca-Cola the following year - a position he retains today.\n\nAt the time, Diller was heading the technology company Expedia. Now worth a reported $4billion, he still works there today.\n\nDiller - a prominent Democratic donor who voiced support for Kamala Harris last year - also revealed how years before the two met, he was secretly cruising for men in West Hollywood as a teen.\n\nThis was before his professional stock would rise, starting in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nHe also detailed a trip to gay haven Fire Island Pines during this time, where he says he was so overwhelmed by the free and open homosexuality on display that he fled the barrier island solo on a boat. \n\nOver the course of the piece, Diller further admitted his fears that his preference for men would derail his burgeoning career, recalling how he 'would never bring a man as a date to a heterosexual event' but would never bring 'a woman as a “beard,” either.' \n\nDescribing his behavior at the time, Diller added: 'I wouldn’t do a single thing to make anyone believe I was living a heterosexual life.'\n\nHe recalled how he'd regularly 'dart in and out' of the side doors of gay bars while putting his sexuality 'in a distant box'. \n\nAs for why he didn't come out during the midst of his success, Diller said he was simply 'too scared to do so,' and said that coming of age in a less tolerant era had made him the way he is.\n\nDiller also wrote rather movingly of how he enjoyed the material fruits of his labor while living an 'arid' existence because of his repressed sexuality.\n\nVon Furstenberg - whose wrap dress served as a symbol of women's liberation in the 70s - has yet to issue a statement on her husband's piece.","summary":"The tycoon revealed his homosexuality in a New York magazine article on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14683647/barry-diller-gay-diane-von-furstenberg.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/06/15/98089849-0-image-m-17_1746540426587.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2016/03/15/9219639750312872481/1024x576_9219639750312872481.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-06 18:20:22","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.105},{"id":318504868,"title":"Trump’s immigration policy earns highest marks in Michigan poll showing overall disapproval","text":"LANSING, MI — President Donald Trump received poor ratings from 600 participants in a Michigan poll conducted last week.\n\nEPIC-MRA, a Lansing-based poll firm, published a report showing 50% of participants rated Trump as “unfavorable” compared to 43% who viewed the president as “favorable,” the report read.\n\nAnother question on the survey revealed 56% of participants rated Trump negatively when asked to assess his work as president so far.

The project fired or forced out more than 260,000 federal workers, deleted humanitarian aid for millions of desperate people overseas, and scrapped more than $2 billion in biomedical research grants. And for what? asked Zeeshan Aleem in MSNBC.com. Musk originally promised he'd save taxpayers $2 trillion, a total he's since lowered to $150 billion. But even if his numbers are correct—which they frequently aren't—research suggests those savings will be outweighed by the cost of DOGE-related firings, rehirings, and court battles, and by a substantial drop in tax collection from a shrunken IRS. Whatever one thought of Musk's \"cost-cutting crusade\" at its outset, surely no one wanted this result: \"a worse government at roughly the same cost.\"\n\nFor anyone hoping Musk would single-handedly erase the extra $2.5 trillion added to the deficit by the Biden administration, DOGE has been \"a massive letdown,\" said Christian Britschgi in Reason. But compared with the unchecked spending likely under a President Kamala Harris, DOGE was a \"smashing success,\" fulfilling its pledge to \"shrink the federal workforce\" and reduce regulatory sprawl. \"I don't blame Musk one bit\" for stepping back, said Ingrid Jacques in USA Today. As leftists vandalize Cybertrucks and firebomb Tesla dealerships—with hardly a peep of condemnation from elected Democrats—it may be the only way Musk can save his company. The rest of us should \"thank him, not hate him,\" for trying to save America from fiscal ruin.\nMusk tried nothing of the sort, said Jessica Riedl in the New York Post. The federal budget is indeed full of waste—from overlapping education programs to overbudget defense procurements. But Musk had no appetite for the \"quiet, boring work of deficit reduction.\" He pursued vendettas against foreign aid, staffers' Politico subscriptions, and similar \"high-profile culture-war targets\" rather than dig into Social Security and other mandatory programs that consume three-quarters of federal spending. Musk's baby-faced operatives did succeed in \"grabbing\" troves of Americans' personal data from multiple government agencies, said Julia Angwin in The New York Times. That information is now being merged at the Department of Homeland Security into \"a sprawling domestic surveillance system—the likes of which we have never seen in the U.S.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Its \"employees are now routinely 'embedded' in federal agencies,\" and leadership of the assault on the federal bureaucracy is expected to pass to Russell Vought, director of Trump's Office of Management and Budget. The Project 2025 co-author and self-declared Christian nationalist shares Musk's loathing of the \"Deep State\" but will be cannier and more methodical in effecting its destruction. The soft-spoken Vought will never match Musk's \"cartoon-villain malevolence,\" but his \"dull knife will cut even deeper than Musk's chain saw, and a lot less noisily.\"\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nExplore More\n\nThe Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\n5 movies to watch in May, from 'Hurry Up Tomorrow' to 'The Phoenician Scheme'\n\nthe week recommends\nThe Weeknd is back on the big screen, Wes Anderson pulls another ensemble cast and a horror franchise about death gets a new life\n\n'Beyond this damage lies something more insidious'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nHollywood confounded by Trump's film tariff idea\n\nPresident Trump proposed a '100% tariff' on movies 'produced in foreign lands'\n\nYou might also like\n\nDeportations ensnare migrant families, U.S. citizens\n\nTrump's deportation crackdown is sweeping up more than just immigrants as ICE targets citizens, judges and nursing mothers\n\nTrump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs\n\nTrump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down—and China doesn't plan to back down\n\nTrump's first 100 days: the reshaping of America\n\nTalking Point\nThe second Trump White House is 'less a new administration', and more a 'vengeful monarchy'\n\nA 'meltdown' at Hegseth's Pentagon\n\nThe Defense Secretary is fighting to keep his job amid leaked Signal chats and staff turmoil\n\nReining in Iran: Talks instead of bombs\n\nTrump edges closer to a nuclear deal with Iran—but is it too similar to former President Barack Obama's pact?\n\nTariffs: The quest to bring back 'manly' jobs\n\nTrump's tariffs promise to revive working-class jobs, but today's labor market has moved on\n\nTrump's war on academic freedom: how Harvard fought back\n\nTalking Point\nPolitical pressure on institutions compromises academic independence – and risks damaging America's ability to attract international talent\n\nAndrew Tate and the manosphere: a short guide\n\nThe Explainer\nIt is widely believed that boys and young men are absorbing sexist attitudes online, from influencers in the manosphere\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Ball was shot dead as an innocent bystander, police say, when an argument broke out after a private party at a Houston bowling alley in November 2022. His alleged murderer has been indicted, with a pre-trial hearing scheduled for May 28.\n\n “The first one, I did not want to be bothered,” she says about Mother’s Day 2023, just months after Takeoff’s death. Then, last year, she managed to cook. “I cooked because one of Takeoff’s favorite foods is cornbread dressing,” she says before breaking into tears. “I cooked his favorite food.” We hug as she cries.\n\n Davenport and I are tucked away in a dim corner of a conference room at Atlanta’s regal Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where she’s hosting an elaborate brunch for bereaved mothers who have also lost their children to gun violence. It’s exactly a week before Mother’s Day 2025, and today, women who lost small children in the 2022 massacre at Uvalde’s Robb Elementary School and others whose adult sons were slain near Atlanta are here, connecting, smiling, and dancing. “Making them feel good is what I try to do,” Davenport says. “You try to do the best you can with what you have got. This year, I wanted to do it a little bit different.” \n\n Davenport, who is also affectionately known as Mama Rocket, after Takeoff’s nickname, envisioned the event about a year ago. She’s hosting the brunch through The Rocket Foundation, founded by her younger brother Quavo, Takeoff’s uncle and bandmate in Migos and their own duo, Unc and Phew. The Foundation, formed around ending gun violence in the U.S., has provided grants to community organizations in the field, offered summer programming for high-risk kids, and hosted its inaugural Rocket Summit with the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention on Takeoff’s birthday last June. \n\n Greg Jackson, the former deputy director of that office – and a gun violence survivor himself – is now the Foundation’s president, but assures me this initiative was Davenport’s alone. “We’re excited to make this event a reality and recognize it as part of a larger legacy of highlighting the voices and courageous leaders that are helping to address gun violence,” he says.\n\n Addressing the room of roughly 50 women from an elaborate, blush stage, Davenport humbly offered a bit of advice: “Give yourself grace.” Noting that she looked forward to reuniting with Takeoff in heaven – “He’s with the Lord, I know this. He gave his life to Christ at 14; he walked down on his own,” she said proudly, recalling a day at church with him – she admitted she’s still figuring out how to adjust to her life without him. She, like women in the room from organizations like Uvalde’s Lives Robbed, Mothers Against Gang Violence, Sweet Hearts, Inc., Girassol Wellness, and Not Another Child, have channeled their pain into advocacy work, but she urged them to think about themselves, too. “When I went to the White House and I talked to Kamala [Harris]…I always hold on to the advice that they told me,” she says. “If you don’t wanna do, don’t do. We’re moms; we want to be super moms sometimes. But we need to give ourselves grace.” \n\n Though a representative tells me Davenport and Quavo’s Rocket Foundation endeavors are always an emotional battle for them, they created a space for luxury, tranquility, and even a little turn up. The day begins with a cocktail hour in the hotel garden, a bar of Quavo’s own White x Cognac set up at the foot of a cyan pool. The dress code called for white, cream, and derby chic, so several women don frilly headwear of net, pearls, and bows. A jazz trio tucked behind lush bushes plays renditions of Tyla’s “Water” and Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You” while moms like Zanetia Henry sway along, a big, round button with her late son Dre Henry’s photo on it glistening in the sun. He would have been 29 years old today, she tells me. She’s glad she’s here, she says, “Otherwise I would have been home crying.”\n\n When Quavo arrives in a khaki linen getup with silver and diamonds across his chest and teeth, he warmly hugs many of the older women like they’re his aunts. He makes a beeline to he and Davenport’s mother, Edna Mattox, also known as Mama Huncho, for his nickname. She sits quietly at a table near the bar as people chat, a Chanel purse shaped like a black rocket stationed before her.\n\n After making our way through a marble hallway and up the lobby’s gilded, spiral staircase, the second floor is cushioned with soft, beige carpet and bright paint. A memory wall with portraits of some of the women’s slain children greets us in the conference room. They immediately gravitate to it. Gloria Cazares, whose daughter, Jackie, was killed at Robb Elementary School, becomes rosy and weeps at the sight of her photo. Vivian Pitts – whose pink and teal derby hat I had noticed as she gleefully bobbed around the garden – becomes teary, too, sauntering into another woman’s arms for comfort. Her son, Rodriquez Apollo Rucker, is on the wall, but also around her neck, in a round photo on a glimmering chain. \n\n “He was a father of two kids. I raised him well, never been in trouble, but he just got caught in something he had nothing to do with,” she tells me. In her deep, dark grief, she says, she had a stroke and lost her ability to walk. “It came from stress – ‘[Did] my son call my name when he was shot?’ You know, just parent stuff. After a while, I was at peace. Now I can talk about it.” \n\n After a group photo at the wall, where the women shout “We’ll always remember you!” on three, Jackson asks us to take our seats and introduces Quavo. “I just wanna thank all mamas for showing up,” Quavo says earnestly. “I just wanna crank the vibe and have good, positive energy. I know we lost the ones, but we got to celebrate [you] just being the mamas and just having kids, ‘cause you’re still strong. That being said, let me get a ‘Mama!’” he calls out, in his signature adlib. “Mama!” the crowd yells back. Later, Quavo will hand-deliver bouquets of white and light pink roses provided by Fenty Beauty to some moms individually. “They’re from Rihanna!” he says as he passes one off, a smile beaming through his bold grills.\n\n After a brief panel on strength, coping, remembering victims, and being survivors, Mama Huncho closes the formal program. “Our lives really have changed,” she says, hesitantly. “I sometimes think that I know what to say, what to do about my life changing. I can go and I can laugh. Some days I say, ‘I can’t do this. I can’t.’” Her voice breaks. “My daughter, right there, she always tells me, ‘Mama, you always use the word can’t.’ ’Cause I can’t! But I try to be strong for her. I try to be strong for Quavo, ‘cause I’m the matriarch. My mama, she’s with [Takeoff].” \n\n She is, however, getting strength from this room. “Meeting y’all and talking and laughing with y’all – I need this in my life,” she says, brightening, and earning a big laugh as she does. “Call me! I’m at home all the time. Ask for my number before we leave. I’m up all night, and I love talking. You might have to tell me, ‘Girl, go to bed.’ Just stay with me. I love y’all so much.”","summary":"Quavo passed out Rihanna-gifted flowers at an Atlanta brunch hosted by his sister, Titania 'Mama Rocket' Davenport, the mother of Migos' late Takeoff","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/takeoff-quavo-mothers-day-brunch-gun-violence-atlanta-1235332621/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rocket-foundation-lead.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 17:56:54","author":"Jeff Ihaza,Mankaprr Conteh","authors":["Jeff Ihaza","Mankaprr Conteh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.292},{"id":318503428,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Met Gala ‘Hollywood’ Debut Sparks Democratic Backlash","text":"Kamala Harris rubbed elbows with actors, musicians and super models at the Met Gala on Monday night, but some Democrats believe her showing up at fashion’s biggest night was a tone deaf move.\n\nThe former vice president’s debut appearance at the lavish event comes as Democrats are still licking their wounds from the devastating 2024 election loss. The Harris campaign has faced criticism for blowing more than $1 billion in just three months after Joe Biden Stepped down. \n\nHowever, individual tickets to the exclusive extravaganza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art went for $75,000 a pop.\n\nThe former vice president was in the Big Apple this week for a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, but she also stopped by the swanky Polo Bar on Sunday before getting dolled up for the gala that takes place on the first Monday in May.\n\n“Kamala Harris stuns at the Met Gala,’ the DNC wrote on its X account with a picture of the vice president for its 2.3 million followers. \n\nBut such stunts show just how difficult it is for high profile Democrats to live in two worlds, said Democratic strategist Max Burns. \n\n“Harris wants to embrace Democratic populism,” Burns said. “But the Met Gala is maybe the most tone deaf place to do it. It just doesn’t send the message Dems think it does.”\n\nAnother Democratic strategist told Daily Beast that Democrats “have to be committed to fighting the appearance of elitism.”\n\n“My advice to any Democrat searching for their way out of the wilderness is less Hollywood, more Main Street,” he said.\n\nThe former vice president skipped the red carpet first keeping her visit under wraps, but she was spotted posing with a series of A-list celebrities including gala chairs race car driver Lewis Hamilton, actor Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and music producer Pharrell as well as other guests like the rapper Doechii.\n\nHarris was a guest of Vogue editor-in-chief and longtime Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour, according to a spokesperson for the former vice president. \n\nHer black and white silk gown by the brand Off-White was designed by IB Kamara. Doug Emhoff was also in attendance in a suit by Bruenello Cucinelli. \n\nThe reaction to the ex-vice president’s appearance received mixed reaction online. Some praised her gorgeous look and lamented her not being the president. But others slammed her attendance. \n\nOn X user wrote that “the one thing that is sure to bring disenchanted voters back to the Democratic Party fold is knowing that Kamala Harris stunned at the Met Gala.”\n\nBut despite her appearance raising some eyebrows, a spokesperson for Harris said the former vice president was there to celebrate the night’s theme “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.”\n\nThe 2025 gala celebrated the influence of Black fashion and dandyism, which has been used to challenge expectations and deliver a message through menswear. \n\nHarris has used her style to subvert public expectations, and she has uplifted Black designers and artists throughout her time at the White House, her spokesperson said. \n\nThe star-studded event is an annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute and coincides with the opening of its latest exhibit. According to the museum’s CEO, the event raised a record $31 million. \n\nHarris’ appearance at the Met Gala is not her first foray into the fashion world. She appeared on the cover of Vogue twice as vice president, and Wintour has been a top Democratic fundraiser for years.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has also been a guest at the elite event. She posed on the red carpet there in 2022. \n\nProgressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was torched by conservatives for appearing on the Met Gala red carpet in 2021 wearing a dress with the words “tax the rich” painted across the back. \n\nOne person not on the guest list and not likely to attend the Met Gala in the future is President Donald Trump. Before he got into politics, the president was a regular attendee of the glitzy event along with members of his family including Melania and Ivanka Trump, who attended as recently as 2016.\n\nBut Wintour, who tightly controls the guest list, revealed in a late night show appearance in 2017 that the one celebrity she would never invite back was Trump.","summary":"Courtesy of Cameron SmithKamala Harris rubbed elbows with actors, musicians and super models at the Met Gala on Monday night, but some Democrats believe her showing up at fashion’s biggest night was a tone deaf move.\n\nThe former vice president’s debut appearance at the lavish event comes as Democrats are still licking their wounds from the devastating 2024 election loss.

Forty-five per cent of Americans hold the same view.\n\nAccording to separate Ipsos data, 82 per cent of Canadians said they strongly agreed that the world had become more dangerous in 2024, a five-point decline from the previous year.\n\nIf another world war happens, YouGov says the majority (68 to 76 per cent) believe the conflict would involve nuclear weapons. Moreover, 57 to 73 per cent think that a third world war would result in a higher casualty count than previous global conflicts.\n\nAccording to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, the Second World War took the lives of 45 million civilians and 15 million in battle, though worldwide numbers vary.\n\nThe poll also found that 25 to 44 per cent believe that if another world war were to occur in the next 5-10 years, it would result in the deaths of most of the world’s population.\n\nThis sentiment was reflected in the Ipsos findings, with the threat of nuclear war sitting high in the minds of the global population. The research agency says 72 per cent believe there is a likelihood that nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare could happen somewhere in the world.\n\nIn addition, YouGov found that among all nations surveyed, there was a “clear sense” that most people felt their respective country’s militaries would not be sufficiently prepared to enter a war.\n\n“Only a minority of western Europeans believe their national militaries could effectively defend their countries in the event of a third world war, ranging from a low of 16 per cent in Italy to a high of 44 per cent in France,” the survey says.\n\n“By contrast, 71 per cent of Americans have confidence that the armed forces could defend their country,” YouGov found.\n\nAs for the source of the threat, most European countries cite Russia as the culprit, with 72 to 82 per cent of Western Europeans telling YouGov they see the superpower as a major or moderate threat to peace in Europe. Meanwhile, 69 per cent of Americans agreed.\n\nSince the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term, attitudes towards Europe’s once-steadfast ally have shifted, with many now considering the country a looming threat to peace.\n\nAccording to Ipsos, before Trump’s win, globally, 21 per cent said his becoming president would help increase world security, while 45 per cent said a win by former U.S. vice-president Kamala Harris would make the world more secure.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadians were significantly more likely to think a Harris win (54 per cent) would have made the world more secure, compared to 21 per cent who said the same of a Trump victory.\n\nThese findings were also reflected in YouGov data.\n\n“With Donald Trump making threats against Greenland, Canada and Panama, as well as his stance on Ukraine, a majority of people in Spain (58 per cent), Germany (55 per cent) and France (53 per cent) see tensions between Europe and the U.S. as a major or moderate threat to continental peace,” it says.\n\n“Meanwhile, Americans are less likely to say so, although a third (34 per cent) still agree with their western European counterparts,” the polling continues.\n\nAside from the threat of a world war, Ipsos cites domestic terror attacks as a cause for concern among respondents, with 66 per cent considering terrorism a threat, followed closely by worries for personal safety and security violations, which sat at 61 per cent, and conflict between ethnic groups at 60 per cent in 2024.\n\nYouGov sampled 1,622 adults in Great Britain, 1,081 in France, 2,381 in Germany, 1,023 in Italy, 1,051 in Spain, and 1,152 in the U.S. between April 3-16 2025.\n\nIpsos surveyed 22,989 adults aged 18 years and older in India, 18-74 in Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, Türkiye, and the United States, 20-74 in Thailand, 21-74 in Indonesia and Singapore, and 16-74 in all other countries between Sept. 20 and Oct. 4, 2024.","summary":"YouGov found that among all nations surveyed, there was a \"clear sense\" that most people felt their country's militaries would not be sufficiently prepared to enter into a war.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11166174/world-war-3-europe-usa-imminent-poll/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-582802866.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 17:41:29","author":"Rachel Goodman","authors":["Rachel Goodman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":318510568,"title":"ProPublica is rewarded for its political hackery with a Pulitzer Prize","text":"Now, the first hitch here is that ProPublica proved nothing of the sort. Its abortion stories are perhaps the sloppiest and sleaziest of its catalog, even worse than the string of pitiful smears against Supreme Court justices. In a healthy environment, journalism schools would use them as prime examples of hackery and conjecture.\n\nEven a cursory reading of ProPublica articles on abortion finds that the central contention is false. Take its piece on Amber Thurman.\n\nIn August 2022, the 28-year-old North Carolina woman checked herself into a suburban Atlanta hospital emergency room, complaining of severe pain. She was suffering from an infection caused by the remains of twin fetuses she had aborted by pill five days earlier.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when reading ProPublica’s Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters is that they fail to offer a single on-the-record source who maintains that abortion laws slowed or stopped doctors from providing medical help for Thurman. Not one.\n\nIndeed, a reader must plow through to the 57th paragraph of the article to find this throwaway line: “It is not clear from the records available why doctors waited to provide a D&C.”\n\nNot clear? Now, that’s a remarkable concession to make deep into a story. The headline, after all, promises to prove that “Abortion Bans Have Delayed Emergency Medical Care.” \n\nHave, not may have.\n\nAnyway, by “not clear,” the reporters mean no testimony exists to support the implication that a dilation and curettage procedure, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped to remove tissue, was delayed because doctors were nervous about Georgia’s abortion law.\n\nWhenever the story hits a juncture at which any real reporter would feel compelled to offer corroboration, ProPublica switches to interviewing nameless “OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion” or pro-abortion activists who offer politically motivated guesswork. Indeed, the bulk of the piece is a rehashing of political talking points and scaremongering that do nothing but distract from the lack of evidence.\n\nWe call that a “column” in the business.\n\nIt’s more than likely no medical professional involved in the Thurman case would go on the record because Georgia’s law unambiguously states that a “medical emergency” not only means saving a patient’s life under any circumstance but also allows for an abortion if it is “necessary in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.”\n\nTo confuse readers, ProPublica regularly conflates D&Cs and miscarriages with elective abortions. That’s bad journalism. But here’s the thing: The fetuses had already been destroyed. There was absolutely no legal basis for any doctor, not even one confused about the supposed ambiguities of abortion laws, to fail to give Thurman all the care she needed. That seems like a vital fact that should have been mentioned somewhere in a 3,400-word investigative piece.\n\nThe only inarguable truth in the Thurman case is that she died from complications caused by abortion pills. That’s the headline. That’s the buried lede. Knowing this, ProPublica feels compelled to assure readers that there are only “rare complications” from abortion pills — “extremely rare” even.\n\nThere is now mounting evidence that mifepristone is less safe than the Food and Drug Administration has led women to believe. When two pro-life researchers at the Ethics and Public Policy Center reviewed health insurance claims from over 800,000 chemical abortions, they found that complications occurred in about 1 in 10 cases.\n\nMaybe they should have won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nIt’s likely that the Thurman story had first been shopped around to bigger, more prestigious venues that passed for obvious reasons. That’s how it usually works. You start by pitching to the New York Times and work your way down until you end up with ProPublica. But just because bigger venues won’t publish some of these rickety hit pieces, it doesn’t mean they won’t spread their claims. Columnists at the New York Times and other venues made sure to do it.\n\nTHE ART OF SELF-DEPORTATION\n\nMostly, though, ProPublica, funded by a deep-pocketed progressive group, exists to create fake stories for politicians to use as oppo material. You may remember when many political experts assured us that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and resulting state-level abortion limitations would forever sink the entire GOP? Well, less than a week after the Thurman story hit, Axios reported that Senate Democrats would launch a “blitz on emergency abortion care this week after ProPublica reporting on death of Georgia woman.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned Thurman on many occasions. Now, obviously, we should take the biases of pro-lifers and pro-abortion activists into account when reading their stories. But ideological bias doesn’t prevent a journalist from making arguments that rely on facts. It is implausible that any genuine journalist could possibly believe ProPublica’s Thurman story was well-reported or honest. And the fact that Pulitzers reward this kind of transparent hackery only further destroys its already battered credibility.","summary":"ProPublica is perhaps the nation’s leading purveyor of Potemkin journalism, which entails dressing up political propaganda with neutral-sounding journalistic verbiage to create the impression that you’ve done genuine reporting.

OutKick spoke to Tucker and his attorney in February, during which they provided various documents that they believe dispute the accusations — including sworn declarations from spa owners, spa sessions after the alleged incidents, and emails from the accusers. Put simply, it's quite a stretch for Le Batard to suggest Tucker is guilty at this time. Moreover, he looks like a flaming hypocrite in doing so. In 2021, Le Batard personally hired a man by the name of Howard Bryant to work for Meadowlark Media. Before the hire, Bryant was arrested for assaulting his wife in public in front of his six-year-old son, and also charged with assaulting a police officer who arrived to protect his wife. According to reports, witnesses saw Bryant choking his wife. You can read more about that here. In sum, Le Batard accused the Ravens of not respecting women because they thanked Justin Tucker, who is not facing criminal charges, after cutting him. In the meantime, Le Batard hired a man arrested for allegedly beating his wife in public. Got all that? This isn't the first time he's shown this level of hypocrisy, either. In 2023, Le Batard condemned the UFC for not disciplining Dana White for slapping his wife (after she slapped him first) while literally having Howard Bryant on his show the next day. OutKick has tried various times to allow Le Batard to explain himself. The closest we got was in 2024, when his publicist asked me to interview him. I agreed, but Le Batard backed out days after. (Le Batarad and his minions have since criticized me multiple times on their show, but have yet to address their hypocrisy on domestic violence.) Further, Le Batard landed the first interview with Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff in October after a Daily Mail report claimed that he \"forcefully slapped\" his former girlfriend in the face in 2012. However, Le Batard never once asked Emhoff about the allegation. He instead asked him what \"loving Kamala\" felt like. For someone who claims to have zero tolerance for violence against women, Le Batard sure has tolerance for liberal men accused of beating women. We hope he eventually explains why that is.","summary":"Dan Le Batard&apos;s Justin Tucker criticism makes him look like a hypocrite.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/his-own-standards-dan-le-batard-has-more-respect-alleged-woman-beaters-than-women","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/05/gacxddewwaaswue-scaled.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 17:36:21","author":"His Own Standards","authors":["His Own Standards"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":318557204,"title":"The cultural significance of the Met Gala can't be dismissed","text":"The words “Met Gala” don’t exactly sparkle with the same sheen of glamour and mystique that they once did, at least not in 2025. Not long ago, the annual fundraising event for New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute implied style and showstopping pageantry. During the two Obama administrations, the event was largely off the radar to most people outside the fashion world. But the proliferation of social media stan culture, which exploded in the mid-2010s, upped the stakes. The gala’s celebrity attendees were watched with intense scrutiny from the moment they left the doors of Manhattan’s swanky Carlyle or Mark hotels until the second they finished ascending the carpeted steps of the Met’s famous steps and disappeared into the museum. \n\nEven the constant chaos of the first Trump administration couldn’t dampen the party. In such unprecedented times — aka, a moment in history when the words “unprecedented times” had never been used more frequently — the Met Gala felt like a welcome distraction. The one-two punch of 2018’s “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” and 2019’s “Camp: Notes on Fashion” themes was perfect counter-programming to the daily news. The gala put imagination back into the hands of the public, even if it was being handed down from the elite to all of us watching at home, eating takeout while picking at the holes in our socks. \n\nBut now, the Met Gala feels … different. To say the last few years have lifted the veil off the public consciousness would be an understatement. And though the celebration has long had its share of questionable themes and even more questionable guests, in times of postmodern MAGA conservatism, it feels like a party where Gotham City bigwigs would be held hostage by the Joker. The event saw its share of critics in the days leading up to 2025’s first Monday in May, who derided such a lavish display of wealth and power in the face of mass ICE deportations, crippling tariffs and having to look at Elon Musk’s bloated visage every waking minute of the day. Those are understandable, worthy complaints. But with this year’s bewitching Met Gala theme and exhibition, and all it stands to do for emerging Black creatives and artists, as well as for the millions of people gawking at the looks on the red carpet at home, there’s more nuance that needs to be considered. This year’s Met Gala demands a critical look at the institutions it props up, yes, but its theme also deserves legitimate introspection. The Met Gala is not a perfect establishment, but that doesn’t mean it’s worth refuting entirely. By doing that, its critics are no better than the artless, ahistorical fascists they purport to abhor.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Met Gala corresponded with the new exhibition opening at the Met’s Costume Institute: “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” The show explores the Black dandy, an evolving look in Black sartorial history; both retro and contemporary, that displays affection for menswear, excellent tailoring and a consistent fondness for tasteful flamboyance and whimsy. The exhibition is inspired by Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\" Miller is a guest curator for the show and worked alongside the Met’s longtime curator, Andrew Bolton, to put on a spectacular display worthy of the Black dandy’s extensive history. \n\n“Fashion and dress have been used in a contest of power and aesthetics for Black people from the time of enslavement to today,” Miller said in a video for “Vogue” when the show was first announced. “Dandyism has often been used by individuals to manipulate the relationship between clothing, identity and power . . . Historically, the term ‘dandy’ was used to describe someone, often a man, who is extremely devoted to aesthetics and approached it as a lifestyle. Dandyism has been used to think positively about Black people, their ambitions and aspirations. And negatively about those very same aspirations.”\n\nTramell Tillman at The 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York. (Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images)\n\n“Dandyism was imposed on Black men in Europe during the 1700s, as the Atlantic slave trade created a trend in fashionably dressed, or dandified, servants,” Miller continues. “Free and enslaved Black people came to understand the power of clothing and style, and signaling hierarchies of race, class and gender. Over time, dandyism gave Black men and women to use clothing, gesture, irony and wit to transform their identities and imagine new ways of embodying political and social possibilities.” \n\n“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” is the first exhibition in the history of the Met Gala to feature a Black fashion tradition. That fact is galling considering the gala’s 77-year history and is incredibly relevant to a moment when Trump, his cabinet, and businesses affected by the government are scaling back diversity, equality and inclusion policies. Miller’s book on Black dandyism was published long before a Trump presidency ever felt like a conceivable thought, and the show was announced in October 2024, when it seemed as though Kamala Harris still had a fighting chance at the incumbent presidency. In a snark-filled op-ed for the Daily Beast, the site’s Chief Creative and Content Officer Joanna Coles evoked DEI initiatives, implying that the theme was chosen by Bolton, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and the Met’s director for brownie points in what they thought would be a sure win for Harris. Coles mentions an irony in this, seeing as though “Vogue” has a historical lack of representation and support for Black designers and talent and has seldom featured Black designers and Black talent on its cover, a tainted legacy that the magazine has been trying to rectify since the summer of 2020, to varied success. \n\nDifferent designs are seen during the press preview of The Costume Institute's exhibition \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, May 5, 2025. (TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)While Coles has a salient point, she and other vocal detractors like Kennedy heir and infamous chronic poster Jack Schlossberg — who called for a boycott, saying in an Instagram Reel, “It’s not the time for a party like that” — are actively overlooking the massive historical significance and cultural importance of this year’s gala and exhibition. In a year like 2025, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” is not just another show at the Costume Institute; it’s a political statement. While the show’s curators couldn’t have known how the American presidential election would turn out, the exhibition would’ve been one of the most significant and essential in the museum’s history either way. Had Harris won, it would’ve continued the celebration of America having its first Black woman president, and examined how far the country has come (and the obstacles we still have yet to clear). With Trump in office, this exhibition and the Met Gala demand that spectators analyze and appreciate the tenacity of the human spirit. \n\nDiana Ross attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nThe exhibition is divided into 12 conceptual sections: ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism. Each section evaluates how clothing and dress have adapted for Black people over the last 300 years. Dandyism began as a point of mockery for enslaved people, and its reclamation and transformation over time is both a revelry for Black style and a sartorial form of historical observance. “To be a Black dandy and live in a world that profits from your subjugation is to be a trickster,” culture writer Taylor Crumpton said in a piece for Capital B. “The Black dandy is a Br’er Rabbit in a tailored suit and tie with a top hat. Only a Black dandy could turn the Met Gala into a celebration of Blackness.” \n\nThe Black dandy look is versatile and exquisite, with thoughtful tailoring that Gala guests showed off during the striking red carpet arrivals. The Met Gala’s official dress code was “Tailored for You,” which “Vogue” said was “purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.” And interpret is exactly what guests did. Unlike recent years, where many guests had trouble deciphering a unique take on the theme, menswear and fine tailoring allowed guests to play and explore. The gala gave viewers a hefty dose of history wrapped in sartorial magic. \n\n(L-R) Jon Batiste and Jeremy Pope attend the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. (Michael Loccisano/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images)“Severance” star Tramell Tillman was jaw-droppingly gorgeous in a finely tailored suit with lovely pinstripe detailing. Actress and musician Teyana Taylor scored one of the Gala’s best looks early in the night, with a dandified look that took pleating and accessories to the next level. Diana Ross returned to the event after 22 years with a show-stopping gown embroidered with her family’s names on its feathered train. Senegalese influencer Khaby Lame took pocket watch finery to stunning heights. Actor Jeremy Pope wore a beautifully constructed Maison Margiela bodice, which fashion theorist Rian Phin noted was aligned with Miller’s writing about “reconstruction of identity through fashion.” And those looks are just skimming the surface. It was one of the most memorably dressed Met Galas in recent years. Though, frankly, it would’ve been nice to see fewer white stars of the moment like Sabrina Carpenter and even more Black icons and emerging talent, given the young designers prominently featured in the exhibition. Was the “Sinners” press tour too booked to get any of its stars on the carpet? (Yes, I realize I sound like Bradley Whitford in “Get Out,” saying he would’ve voted for Obama a third time if he could.)\n\nDespite all the stunning displays, however, one nagging coincidence shadowed the event. The same day of the Met Gala, Sean “Diddy” Combs began his trial for sex trafficking, also in New York City. Critics noted that Combs was previously a Met Gala staple, even someone who heavily influenced Black style. The trial and the Met Gala happening on the same day is a cosmic paradox that cannot be ignored, one that points back to the gala’s history of propping up figures like Harvey Weinstein, who are long-rumored to be vile people but remain protected by the institutions that serve them until the evidence becomes damning enough not to be ignored. No, the Met Gala is not a perfect event, and just because this year’s theme honors Black fashion significance doesn’t mean that the powers behind it won’t make major blunders in the future. \n\nSabrina Carpenter attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)But at the press preview Monday morning, the Met’s CEO announced that the gala raised a record $31 million. This money pays people’s salaries and ensures that exhibitions like “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” can be put on in the first place. In a moment when Trump is trying to cut funding for educational public resources like PBS, walking through the Met’s exhibition will feel starkly important. The show runs until October, and hundreds of thousands are expected to attend over the next few months. This is a tangible, eye-popping moment of education in Black history for locals and tourists who will come from around the world to see the exhibit. It’s a celebration of Black style and transformation, of the wit and pain that are equal parts of reclamation, when the politically powerful are actively deprioritizing and erasing those opportunities. And beyond that, there is joy to be found in such a spectacle. That reserve needs to be consistently refilled, lest we find it depleted. \n\nKhaby Lame attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. (Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)This year’s Met Gala may read tone deaf and myopic to some, and in some ways, it is. But it signifies persistent hope and approaching change. Christian Latchman, the young model who is the face of “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” who appears on nearly all of the show’s marketing, posted a TikTok before the Gala that reminded his followers he’s still working a 9-to-5 job. That may seem baffling, but at Monday’s press preview, Miller spoke about how figures praised as Black dandy icons are “still beholden to the whims of the institution.” \n\nWith Latchman as the face of the show and the biggest night in fashion, but still hustling at a 9-to-5 while his modeling career takes off, “Superfine” can be seen as a commentary on the very establishment that allows it to exist. The Met Gala is a gatekeeping party, where the entry price is more than most people’s annual salary. In published materials commemorating this historic exhibit, Latchman’s face will be remembered for decades to come. But when October rolls around, the Costume Institute will begin moving on to the next thing. Walls come down and they are built back up again, but Latchman’s career will remain changed forever. Power may not be totally in the hands of the people, but it’s being dispersed in quantifiable amounts. To refuse to engage with the Met Gala and its companion exhibition this year is to ignore the opportunity to honor the work and persistence of Miller, Latchman and the countless number of Black dandies the show studies and celebrates. In a time when the most powerful people in the world jump to close-minded conclusions that cripple the rest of us, we owe it to ourselves, our fellow humans and to history to, at the very least, take a moment to pause and consider the nuances.","summary":"Some have called for a boycott of the lavish event, but disengaging with the Met Gala is a decidedly Trumpian move","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/05/06/the-cultural-significance-of-the-met-gala-cant-be-dismissed/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/05/met-gala-teyana-taylor-2213593354jpg.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 17:30:06","author":"Coleman Spilde","authors":["Coleman Spilde"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.15},{"id":318501606,"title":"Who paid $75,000 for Kamala Harris's Met Gala ticket?

Before that, she was the foundation’s chief communications officer.\n\nIf Maher has “evolved” only in the past five years, she’s hardly cut out to run any media organization, let alone a taxpayer-funded one.\n\nBut if she really does think the president’s fascist and America’s racist, and is now lying about these inconvenient convictions, what does that say about her character?\n\nWhatever the answer, she has no business leading any organization that claims to be nonpartisan. (Maher’s mother, as it happens, is a Connecticut state senator — a Democrat.)\n\nShe can’t have it both ways, insisting America is in the grip of fascism one moment, then soliciting government support the next — who’d want to be funded by a fascist’s government?\n\nShouldn’t it be a point of pride for people like Maher to accept no money from fascists or racists?\n\nNPR’s leader is an ideologue but also an opportunist, and her public statements reveal not just her animosity toward the Republican president but her nihilistically relativist worldview.\n\n“Our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that is getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done,” she mused in a 2022 TED Talk, adding, “We all have different truths. They are based on things like where we come from, how we were raised, and how other people perceive us.”\n\nThis might sound like mush, but it means that objective truth— truthful truth, one might say — is too divisive a standard and instead “truth” must derive from identity, and identity politics.\n\nNPR’s programming and practices reflect that philosophy as much as its choice of CEO.\n\nWhen someone does speak up for a true truth at NPR, he can expect to be punished.\n\nThat was the experience of Uri Berliner, a senior editor with 25 years’ experience at NPR, who was suspended without pay after he wrote an essay for The Free Press last year exposing the “lack of viewpoint diversity” inside the broadcaster.\n\nPBS isn’t as egregiously slanted as NPR, but that’s not saying much.\n\n“Public broadcasting” is simply a misnomer: these corporations are “public-private partnerships,” which means in practice they take public money to promote private beliefs that align with one party’s left wing.\n\nBig Bird’s popular enough to thrive without subsidies.\n\nNPR and PBS have become megaphones for messages like Maher’s, and it’s high time taxpayers stopped being forced to pay for them.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.

According to TMZ, Kelce and Swift were invited to the gala but had to decline due to their respective schedules.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to representatives for Swift and Kelce for comment. \n\nWhile Kelce has never been to a Met Gala before, the “Karma” singer certainly has. The last time Swift attended the event was in 2016 when she was a co-chair and the theme was “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.”\n\nIn addition to the “Cruel Summer” and the tight end not attending the Met Gala, one of the honorary co-chairs for this year, LeBron James, revealed hours before the event that he wouldn’t be able to go.\n\n“Unfortunately because of my knee injury I sustained at the end of the season I won’t be able to attend the Met Gala in NY tonight as so many people have been asking and congratulating me on!” he wrote on X yesterday. \n\n“Hate to miss an historical event! My beautiful powerful Queen will be there holding the castle down as she always has done,” he added, referring to his wife, Savannah James.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, who has, without fail, been one of the most anticipated stars to look out for every year, also said she wouldn’t be able to attend this year. The Sex and the City alum went on to tell Entertainment Tonight that she would still be watching.\n\n“I have to work,” she said during the May 2 interview. “But there’s going to be so much to see, and I look forward to seeing what everybody does, and how they interpret the theme and the homework they did for the assignment.”\n\nAlthough some well-known figures skipped the event entirely, others, such as former vice president Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, avoided only the red carpet but did pose for some behind-the-scenes pictures with Vanity Fair.\n\nHarris wore a custom gown from Off-White, featuring a flowing, floor-length white sleeve and black main dress with a train, designed in cady silks by the company’s creative director, IB Kamara, according to Vogue.","summary":"Swift was a co-chair for the Met Gala back in 2016","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-met-gala-b2745884.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/04/14/53/GettyImages-2196122888.jpeg?trim=31,0,32,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NkRutzNk-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-06 17:00:15","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.224},{"id":318493310,"title":"New Book ‘Fool’s Gold’ Warns Against Exporting California’s Policies Nationwide","text":"A new book exposes how California’s leftist political machine is unraveling the Golden State—and, sadly, how socialist policies could be exported nationwide if Americans aren’t vigilant.\n\nThe book is “Fool’s Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All,” co-authored by investigative journalists Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics and Jedd McFatter at the Government Accountability Institute.\n\n“Violent crime is surging in California. Illegal drug use is off the charts, and it is subject to a daily invasion of illegal migrants crossing its southern border,” the authors write, mincing no words.\n\n“Homeless addicts in once beautiful San Francisco shoot up, sleep, and defecate on its streets when they’re not stealing from what shops are still open in the city. Its economy is struggling. Tent cities block the sidewalks of Los Angeles as businesses leave the state’s crushing regulations, extortionate taxes, and unchecked property crime. Its police force is demoralized by negligent ‘Soros prosecutors’ who turn repeat criminals loose. Its universities, always a source of foment and dissent, have metastasized into playthings and espionage targets for America’s greatest adversary—the communist regime of China.”\n\n“Fool’s Gold” is timely, given that polling shows two of the top five potential 2028 Democratic presidential primary contenders hail from California—former Vice President Kamala Harris (a former San Francisco district attorney and state attorney general) and former San Francisco Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nNewsom is currently running an image-rehabilitation podcast after botching the fatal wildfires that ravaged his state earlier this year.\n\nMcFatter and Crabtree, a California resident and my former colleague at The Hill newspaper, also dig into Newsom’s alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party and his involvement in corruption. The book describes a nonprofit organization initiative started by Newsom called ChinaSF, which the authors report served as a gateway for Chinese Communist Party officials and Chinese criminals to exploit California.\n\n“Fool’s Gold” is already having an impact, with Newsom publicly denying the book’s claim that he secretly funded a controversial City Hall bronze statue of his own bust.\n\nThe statue commemorates Newsom’s stint as mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. Newsom used what’s known as “behested payments” to fund the monument, with a reported three private organizations donating to the nonprofit designated for “Mayoral Bust at San Francisco City Hall.” \n\n“Fool’s Gold” reports two of the three reported companies are companies owned by Newsom: Balboa Cafe Partners and PlumpJack Management Group donated a combined $10,000 to the $97,000 bust fund.\n\n“We 100% stand by our Gavin Newsom bronze-bust vanity project story,” Crabtree replied on X in response to Newsom’s claim that the donations were not secret. “Team Newsom is afraid of the shocking revelations in FOOL’S GOLD—which is backed by more than forty-five pages of endnotes containing more than 1,000 open-source, reputable, and verifiable citations with zero anonymous sources—and that is why they are trying to smear this book.”\n\nCrabtree also said “Newsom’s team has thus far refused to answer whether his companies got a tax break for funding this ‘charitable’ statue.” \n\n“Fool’s Gold” also explains how Newsom’s horrific release of thousands of prisoners during the COVID-19 pandemic created a huge spike in crime throughout the state. Its impact is still felt today as residents and businesses continue to flee California for better-managed red states, such as Texas and Florida. \n\nIt’s no wonder, in light of a new report from the United Ways of California finding that 35% of households across the state—more than 3.8 million—are struggling to cover basic living expenses.\n\nThe Committee to Unleash Prosperity noted that a 2024 national survey found only 15% of respondents felt that California was a model for other states \n\nThe Public Policy Institute of California also found that only 1 in 3 Californians think the state is a good place to achieve the American dream.\n\nMcFatter and Crabtree pithily sum up the problem of exporting California’s policies nationwide: “If the fifty states are still America’s ‘laboratories of democracy,’ California is the Wuhan Institute.”\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Trump's net approval fell by as much as 33 points in just three months among people who say they consume little or no political news.In the first poll by YouGov/The Economist of Trump's second term, conducted January 26–28 among 1,577 adults, net approval among the least-engaged news consumers was +12. In their latest poll, fielded April 25–28 among 1,785 adults, that figure dropped to -21.In comparison, among Americans who say they follow the news \"most of the time,\" Trump's approval fell by just 14 points.Meanwhile, polling by the Pew Research Center also found that Trump's approval rating has taken a hit among people who did not vote in 2024.In Pew's January 27 to February 2 poll, conducted among 5,086 adults, 44 percent of 2024 nonvoters approved of Trump's job performance. Fast-forward two months, and Pew's latest poll, conducted between April 7 and 13 among 3,589 respondents, shows that figure had dropped to 31 percent—a 13-point decline, outpacing the 7-point slide among the general public.This shift amounts to what G Elliott Morris, the former director of 538, calls a \"complete inversion\" of the political engagement dynamic that defined the 2024 election.\"The people who pay the least attention to the news and are the least involved in the political process are now the least likely to support Trump, rather than the most likely,\" he wrote in his blog, Strength in Numbers.So what changed?According to Morris, it's not about ideology but economics. Many opt-out voters likely remembered the pre-pandemic economy under Trump as relatively strong, associating Joe Biden's term with inflation and instability, he said. But now that Trump is back in office and economic conditions remain shaky, with rising prices, market volatility, and a stubborn cost-of-living crisis, those same voters are expressing frustration.He added that this trend reflects a broader phenomenon: the engagement gap. Many Americans are tuning out politics in today's polarized media environment, but that doesn't make them immune to its consequences, Morris wrote. Instead, they become unusually responsive to real-world conditions, particularly economic ones, and are less likely to filter their opinions through partisan media or elite discourse.As Morris puts it, disengaged voters \"may be more rational in reacting to economic stimulus,\" even if they're less attuned to policy nuance.\"These are people who don't read The New York Times, don't watch Sunday shows, and don't track policy details,\" Morris wrote. \"But they notice when their bills go up, their rent spikes, or their 401(k)s shrink.\"The drop in support for Trump among low-engagement voters has come in the wake of worsening economic signals. A surprise spike in inflation in February was followed by market turmoil after Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on \"Liberation Day\" last month. The announcement triggered an immediate sell-off, briefly shaking investor confidence before markets rebounded days later.However, the broader economy has yet to stabilize. In late April, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP shrank by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, the first economic contraction in three years.As a result, recent polls have shown a dramatic erosion of public confidence in Trump's handling of his job.For example, in ActiVote's latest poll, Trump's approval rating stood at 45 percent, while 51 percent disapproved, giving the president a net approval of -6 points. ActiVote's March poll showed Trump with a net approval rating of -1 point, with 48 percent approving and 49 percent disapproving.And in the latest YouGov/Yahoo poll, conducted April 25-28 among 1,597 respondents, his approval dropped from 44 percent in March to 42 percent, while disapproval rose from 50 percent to 53 percent, widening his net negative from –6 to –11. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points.Emerson College released a poll last week that showed Trump's approval rating had dropped marginally, from 47 percent to 45 percent, since March, while his disapproval rating remained the same at 45 percent. The most recent poll was conducted April 25-28 among 1,000 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.Polls have also shown fears about the state of the economy on the rise.A Navigator Research poll conducted April 24–28 found that Trump's net approval on the economy has dropped to -16, with just 40 percent approving and 56 percent disapproving—his worst rating on the economy in the group's tracking history. His numbers on inflation and tariffs were even more dismal, with net approval ratings of -29 and -26, respectively.Other surveys reflect this growing concern. A recent Decision Desk HQ/NewsNation poll showed that 82 percent of voters are worried about a potential recession, and 59 percent say inflation is the country's biggest problem.Amid such an economic climate, Democrats see an opening to win over low-engagement voters. In a recent op-ed, Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign manager, Ron Flaherty, wrote that while winning engaged voters is about \"facts,\" winning disengaged voters is about \"attention.\" He argued that Democrats must seize this moment to offer a compelling economic vision, not just to oppose Trump but to provide an alternative.Still, the volatility of opt-out voters presents a warning for both parties. Morris notes that \"we may be in an environment where engagement polarization means it's inherently harder for incumbents to win re-election.\"If current trends hold, Morris argues, Trump and the Republican Party may have squandered a key strategic asset: the support of voters who, in 2024, weren't really paying attention but showed up anyway.\"Trump has lost arguably the best advantage the Republicans had for the future. And if conditions remain poor, they may lose ground, not gain it,\" Morris wrote.What People Are SayingG Elliott Morris, the former director of 538, wrote in a blog post: \"The people who pay the least attention to the news and are the least involved in the political process are now the least likely to support Trump, rather than the most likely. That is a complete inversion of the relationship between engagement and support for Trump in 2024, and a return to the old dynamic of less-informed/engaged voters being systematically more friendly to Democratic candidates and causes.\"What Happens NextTrump's approval rating could fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations in the Russia-Ukraine war, the evolving tariff situation and concerns about a recession.","summary":"New polling shows Trump's approval among disengaged voters has dropped faster and more dramatically than among any other group.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-2068659","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2639524/donald-trump-tpusa-phoenix.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 16:42:08","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":318489346,"title":"Бывшая соперница Трампа тайно дебютировала на Met Gala 2025","text":"Шестидесятилетняя Камала Харрис посетила Met Gala 2025.\n\nЧлен Демократической партии не появилась на ковровой дорожке, но с удовольствием позировала за кулисами с сопредседателями Met Gala A$AP Rocky - Фарреллом Уильямсом, Льюисом Хэмилтоном и Колманом Доминго.\n\nОб этом сообщает The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nВ знак уважения к дресс-коду вечера, Tailored for You, в поддержку весенней выставки института Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, Харрис надела сшитое на заказ черно-кремовое шелковое платье Off-White с цветными блоками и драматичным ниспадающим рукавом.

Henson and Babyface and recently dressed Kamala Harris in a black suit as part of her first major post-inauguration appearance.\n\nIn other words, Smith is busy. But that didn’t stop him from hosting an immersive, museum-like fashion exhibition at the Park Lane New York in Manhattan, which ran from May 4 to 5. The exhibition, set in the hotel’s sprawling Park Room, showcased his detailed, intricate couture, including his famed silver knit dress and his black feather dress, among several others. From the street, guests could look up and see the dresses towering over them.\n\nIn a pamphlet accompanying the exhibition, Smith writes: “To me, the modern dandy isn't afraid to command attention with intention. It's about elegance, but with an edge.” The garments were shown alongside diamond jewelry from Maison Spoiled.\n\nLaQuan Smith, Keke Palmer at the LaQuan Smith at the Ludlow House with Samsung Galaxy Met Gala after party at Ludlow House on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York.

It’s always been my dream to make people feel like the best, most elevated version of themselves, and that’s exactly what I aim to do with every look.”\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 11: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY.

I want to create an emotional response where a look not only turns heads but also fuels a sense of motivation, power, and inspiration.”\n\nHe explains: “You don’t have to be a celebrity to wear one of my designs; the moment you put it on, you feel like that mega superstar. That’s the takeaway. It’s about evoking star quality from within.”\n\nLaQuan Smith at the LaQuan Smith at the Ludlow House with Samsung Galaxy Met Gala after party at Ludlow House on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York.

The Galaxy AI Atelier is a cutting-edge, AI-powered creative studio that brings Smith’s designs to live with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nIt’s a continuation with his Samsung Galaxy partnership, as he first worked with Samsung last year, designing limited-edition sleepwear pieces inspired by the tech behind the Galaxy Ring as part of his SS25 Collection at New York Fashion Week. “It was the first time I integrated Galaxy AI into the physical design of a collection, which made the collaboration incredibly meaningful,” said Smith.\n\nSmith calls this new collaboration an ‘organic fit.’ “I've always been excited about the intersection of fashion and technology,” he said. “I truly believe that technology and creativity go hand-in-hand and tools like the Galaxy S25 Ultra allow me to push boundaries and find new ways to outdo myself.”\n\nSmith used the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra throughout every step of his journey designing for the Met Gala red carpet. “From initial inspiration to the final touches, the AI Atelier became an essential part of my creative process; helping me design, innovate, and bring my visions to life,” he said.\n\n“Whether I was sourcing fabrics, organizing fittings, or sketching out ideas, I relied on tools like Now Brief, Sketch to Image, Gallery Search, and Audio Eraser. These features allowed me to work with precision, stay organized and inspired.”\n\nLaQuan Smith at The 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York.

It’s an individualized approach.\n\n“My approach to dressing stars for the red carpet is rooted in collaboration, intention, and a deep respect for individuality,” said Smith. “Whether it's the Met Gala or another major moment, I begin by centering my brand's core values: confidence, fierceness, sophistication, and an unapologetic embrace of sensuality. My goal is always to create a synergy between the client’s personal essence and the vision of the event, designing a look that makes them feel powerful, seen, and fully themselves.”\n\nFollowing the Met Gala, Smith and Samsung hosted an exclusive Met Gala House Party, an afterparty at Ludlow House. The event was attended by Keke Palmer, Racquel Dees, Kwasipaul Official and Daphne Velghe, among others.\n\nThe event featured interactive experiences and live content creation stations, showing party guests how Galaxy AI helps reshape the boundaries of style, self-expression, and creative technology.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 05: (L-R) Tyson Beckford and LaQuan Smith attend the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City.

I consider what they stand for, what resonates with them culturally and emotionally, and how they want to be seen.”\n\nSmith adds: “That’s where the magic happens; when their values align with mine, and we create a look that’s more than just fashion. It’s a moment in time.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Well, we guess this just proves how budget minded DemUNIST really are,' one person wrote on X.\n\n'I thought Kamala Harris was very worried about the poor and was sorry them, really she attended the met Gala last night, ticket prices started at $75,000 seem she was not that worried,' another added.\n\nWhile one person accused her of failing to 'read the room'.\n\n'While regular folks are scraping by, she’s flaunting a dress that probably cost $75,000,' the individual fumed. \n\nHarris stepped out on Monday in a sleek black and white, long sleeved gown featuring an asymmetrical cape and a flowing scarf. \n\nHer outfit was a nod to this year's theme 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style', curated Monica L. Miller, whose book 'Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity' was the inspiration for the exhibition.\n\n'To me the true core of dandyism is rooted in confidence and strength,' Off-White creative director IB Kamara told CNN.\n\n'There is no person who exemplifies these characteristics more than Kamala D. Harris, someone who has overcome adversity and continues to be a beacon for so many.'\n\nOff-White is a luxury streetwear brand which was founded by the late Virgil Abloh, a trailblazing black designer. Dresses from its off-the-rack section start at around $400.\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted the brand to ask whether it paid for Harris' ticket. \n\nHer husband wore a tuxedo designed by Brunello Cucinelli. \n\nHarris' impromptu appearance didn't come as a surprise to some, considering she and her husband were protected by a phalanx of two dozen Secret Service agents and cops as they dined at Polo Bar, one of New York's priciest bars on Sunday night.\n\nShe emerged from the renowned celebrity hotspot with Emhoff about 9:30pm and stepped straight into a waiting bulletproof car outside.\n\nThe couple were happy to mingle with other diners, many of whom booked their tables a month in advance, and took photos with some of the diners.\n\nSeveral Secret Service agents accompanied the couple as they dined for about two hours, with many more waiting outside to secure the entrance.\n\nHarris is worth about $6 million and Emhoff $8 million, as of last year. \n\nThe former Vice President is no stranger to the fashion world, having graced the cover of Vogue twice.\n\nThe first came in 2021 when she caused a stir by posing up in a casual outfit and converse sneakers.\n\nHarris, 60, opted for a more formal look when she was a cover star last year and donned a chic chocolate brown Gabriela Hearst suit and Tiffany jewelry.\n\nThe former VP has kept a relatively low profile since her election loss to Donald Trump in November.\n\nHowever, she returned to the public political arena on Wednesday, delivering a critical speech berating the president, but also urging Democrats to find inspiration from elephants at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThe failed presidential candidate took the stage at Emerge 20th anniversary gala at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco to deliver the keynote speech that began late in the evening.\n\n'It's good to be home!' Harris laughed as she took the stage.\n\nHarris attacked Trump for leveling 'reckless tariffs' on foreign countries, accusing him of creating 'the biggest manmade economic crisis in modern presidential history' asserting that tariffs 'hurt workers and families' and raised costs for Americans.","summary":"The former Vice President was invited to last night's glitzy event by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14683217/kamala-Harris-Met-Gala-ticket-paid.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/06/15/98087713-0-image-m-22_1746540849291.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/05/6150375116009717940/1024x576_MP4_6150375116009717940.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-06 14:28:16","author":"Bethan Sexton,Editor","authors":["Bethan Sexton","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.124},{"id":318429946,"title":"Liberal megadonor Alex Soros and consultant fiancée among Dems ridiculed over 'tone-deaf' magazine feature","text":"Liberal megadonor Alex Soros has been ridiculed for appearing in a 'tone-deaf' magazine feature showing off his ritzy high-rise apartment amongst other notable New York City Democrats.\n\nIn an article from The New Yorker, named 'Power Houses Inside the living rooms of notable New Yorkers', the 39-year-old appeared alongside his partner Huma Abedin.\n\nAbedin is a former staffer for Hillary Clinton while Soros is the son of the 94-year-old Democratic megadonor George Soros.\n\nOther notable Dems include the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rev.

The 2025 Met Gala's theme was \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.\" Per the Met, the theme honors Black dandyism and \"the importance of clothing and style to the formation of Black identities in the Atlantic diaspora.\" According to Vogue, Black dandyism is \"a fashion revolution, a movement steeped in history, resistance, and pride.\" The hosts of this year's event include Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo and A$AP Rocky. The Democratic Party's social media account posted a photo of Harris on Monday, along with the caption, \"Kamala Harris stuns at the Met Gala.\" Critics questioned whether the move seemed out of touch, and mocked Harris' outfit. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS HER TIMETABLE ON HER NEXT POLITICAL STEPS \"Why is the Democratic Party's main social media account posting this?\" journalist Zaid Jilani wrote on social media. Conor Friedersdorf, a staff writer at The Atlantic, mocked the Democratic Party's decision to tout Harris' attendance at a gala for \"Manhattan elites.\" \"How do we win back enough of the populists and the working class to compete for power again?\" he wrote on X. \"Photos of party leaders in designer clothes to attend the premier gala for Manhattan elites? Good call. Tweet is from the official account.\" \"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue in a statement about the gala. \"Artistic expression—whether it’s dance, music, visual arts, or fashion—has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\" \"On the one hand, Harris is probably the second-most-famous Black politician in the country behind Barack Obama. Why wouldn’t she attend the Met Gala that specifically celebrates Blackness? On the other hand, attending an event like this does not make it seem like she’s in touch with the kinds of people who are freaking out over what tariffs are going to do to the price of groceries,\" Olivia Craighead wrote for New York Magazine. Craighead also wrote that it was likely not as controversial as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's \"tax the rich\" gown at the event in 2021. Ocasio-Cortez has appeared alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., at several rallies across the U.S. on their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. HARRIS DRAWS SOCIAL MEDIA SCORN FOR DIGRESSION ABOUT ELEPHANTS DURING AN EARTHQUAKE Conservative writer Chad Felix Greene wrote of Harris' dress, \"That dress looks like there is another woman in the same dress right behind her. My eyes can't make sense of this.\" He then questioned the move, asking, \"Also, we like millionaires flaunting their wealth at vapid parties now? The day Trump imposed student loans?!\" Matthew Stoller, a political commentator and researcher at the American Economic Liberties Project, reacted to the Democratic Party's post by sarcastically saying, \"I don't understand how Democrats lost to Trump.\" Harris is also scheduled to headline a top-dollar Democratic National Committee fundraising dinner on Tuesday. Conservative political commentator Richie Greenberg wrote that the Met Gala costs $75,000 a ticket. According to CBS News, tables at the Met Gala start at $350,000, and individual tickets cost $75,000, but celebrities and public figures are often invited guests and don't have to pay to attend. Host of the \"Ruthless\" podcast John Ashbrook wrote, \"crafted from the coats of 101 Dalmatian puppies,\" likening Harris' look to fictional character Cruella de Vil, who is well known for her half-white and half-black hairstyle in Disney's \"101 Dalmatians.\" Lizzo's look at the Met Gala also closely resembled Cruella de Vil, as she also donned a long cigarette holder. Abigail Jackson, the deputy Communications Director for the RNC, asked in response to the photo posted by the Democratic Party, \"Is this satire?\" \"You lost,\" former Trump adviser Jason Miller wrote in reaction to the photo.

My skin is black — do I represent all Blacks? My good friend is white — does he represent all Whites? If we are indeed representatives of our races, do we possess superpowers of sort? Apparently, Tim Walz does. The former Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota governor was on a listening tour across the country when he stopped by Harvard's Kennedy School for a talk. He told the audience that Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate, because \"I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck (and) put them at ease.\" He added that he was the \"permission structure\" for the White man to vote for Democrats. There you have it. The self-appointed man of all White men. The one that has the \"code\" to talk to White men and command him as he may. WALZ SAYS HARRIS PICKED HIM FOR VP TO 'CODE TALK TO WHITE GUYS' It is hard to believe that such stupidity exists in the year 2025. There is no lowlier man than the one who thinks of himself in racial terms. And Walz is such a man. If you believe I am being harsh, then explain what value is to be had in thinking of oneself in racial terms? Walz was a failure since he clearly didn’t deliver the White man in enough numbers to win Harris the presidency of the land. So, I ask again what value is to be had? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Is the man so delusional that he thinks he holds a mystical grasp on whiteness? I don’t even think he thinks this far. His kind of whiteness for him is a virtue of sorts and this is precisely my point here: for him whiteness means racism. Walz’s virtue lies in believing that his white skin is racism personified and that he is guilty of all the privileges that come with it. He believes that all whites share this same guilt. Commentator and author Shelby Steele calls this white guilt. But it’s not actual guilt. Rather, it is the desire to see oneself as innocent of racism — to dissociate oneself from America’s racial past. When Walz \"confesses\" to the racism of his white skin, he believes he’s achieving innocence of America’s racist past. And he believes that as a man who knows the racism of his skin, he must return to his ignorant tribe and deliver them from their inherent racism into innocence.

The event’s theme is always tied to that year’s fashion exhibition, and most of the invited guests match their custom outfits to the theme. \n\nThe event always manages to pull in big sums for the Costume Institute. According to the Met’s website, the Gala is the “main source of annual funding for the department’s exhibitions, acquisitions, and capital improvements.”\n\nWhat is Black Dandyism?\n\nThis year’s theme was focused on Black dandyism, a historical style of dress that continues to this day. It is not simply about style; it’s a form of cultural resistance. Rooted in history, it reclaims the power of style. \n\nAs written in Vogue, “In a racially segregated America, the Black dandy’s outfit became a form of resistance, an elegant middle finger to a society that sought to define them by race, not character.”\n\nThe exhibition was inspired by Monica L. Miller’s book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. In the book, she wrote about Black history from 18th-century England to slavery, Emancipation, and on to the Harlem Renaissance, and how people reclaimed their identities through fashion.\n\n“It’s really someone who is dedicated to dress, like they see dress as a discipline, in the same way viewing working out as a discipline or studying music as a discipline,” Complex Editor-in-Chief Aria Hughes told CBS News.\n\nThe key features of Black Dandyism include custom tailoring, bold color blocking and patterns, the fusion of many cultures, and bold statement accessories.\n\n2025 Met Gala highlights\n\nThe biggest talk of the event was Rihanna revealing her third pregnancy with partner A$AP Rocky. KPOP fans were also excited, as many musicians, from Lisa to S.Coups (Choi Seungcheol), showed up dressed perfectly to the theme. Diana Ross returned to the event in full glam white gown and long cape that she designed herself, down to the crystal details and feather trims. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also made an appearance, though she skipped the blue carpet entrance, wearing a black and white dress designed by Off-White.\n\nSocial media reactions to the Met Gala\n\nAs always, folks on social media were hooked to see what the celebrity guests put together with their designers for the charity event. Common reactions covered everything from characters from a variety of fandoms such as Pokémon making an appearance, another character falling down the stairs, and people judging the Met Gala outfits from the comfort of their own beds.\n\nCheck out 32 Met Gala 2025 memes and reactions below:\n\nIt’s started 😭 https://t.co/5LGd7jHYD0 pic.twitter.com/ZhJDFsbrk7— justin (@jerstonfilm) May 5, 2025\n\n— ✧ fagatha✧ (@melokordei) May 5, 2025\n\nThe internet is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

None of those people are inspiring Gen Z. None of those people are bringing more voters into the party. It's just making this weird, radical wing of the party be the vocal voices. So, by all means, let Jasmine Crockett, AOC and Bernie Sanders be the voice, the future of the DNC. It'll make our job easier come the midterms and come 2028,\" Hollyhand told Fox News Digital in an exclusive Zoom interview this week. \"It's a really weird position that they've taken to go more radical than Kamala Harris. And that's why Kamala lost, because she was too radical,\" he said. Hollyhand, 18, is a political commentator and chair of the RNC's Youth Advisory Council who was invited to meet one-on-one with Trump in Alabama on Thursday, when the president delivered the University of Alabama's commencement speech. Hollyhand said that he and Trump discussed how to keep momentum among young voters following the 2024 election, when Gen Z voters swung to the right as Trump courted young people on TikTok and in podcasts. The youth vote, he explained, had long been in the Democrat Party's court before Trump upped the ante on youth outreach during last year's election cycle. The 18-year-old activist does not graduate high school until later this month, but he has met Trump five times as of Thursday. The pair discussed how the Trump White House can continue expanding on the strides the Trump campaign made with young people, including Hollyhand suggesting Trump tweak former President Ronald Reagan's famed 1980 campaign question: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" DEMOCRATS ACCUSED OF BEING 'OUT OF TOUCH' AS NEW POLL SHOWS DROP IN SUPPORT FROM YOUNG VOTERS \"A comment I made to him was, 'Mr. President, I'm a huge history nerd. And so I loved when you talked about that famous Reagan quote of, 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' And that's something he echoed on the campaign trail a bunch himself. But something I specifically pointed out to the president is, ‘We can tweak that a little bit.’ And he said, ‘What do you mean? What can we do?’ I said, ‘Well, now all you have to do is walk out on that stage and ask Gen Z, ’Are you're better off then you were 100 days ago?'\" Hollyhand recounted. \"The resounding answer every single time is going to be, ‘Yes.’ I mean, gas is cheaper, the border's secure, and the president performed CPR on the American dream. So, I think everybody in my generation can agree, whether you love Trump or hate Trump, he is improving the nation and making life better for us,\" he added. The political activist said that he floated to Trump that he could hold a 2025 version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats to talk directly to voters in a virtual setting, and he also told Trump that he has a \"secret weapon\" going into the 2026 midterms. \"I said, 'Mr. President, you're doing this crazy novel concept in politics called actually doing what the people elected you to do in office and actually keeping your promises. I know we never see politicians doing that, but you're doing that and Gen Z loves it,'\" Hollyhand said. On the flip side, Democrats have dangled promises of free college and cheaper costs of living to young people, while comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler and Elon Musk to a king, he argued. Hollyhand said such messaging has swayed some youths to rally around left-wing Democrats, such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but that many Gen Zers are able to see through the \"false bill of goods from the Democrats.\" DEMOCRATS' IDENTITY CRISIS: YOUTH REVOLT ROCKS PARTY AFTER TRUMP COMEBACK The Democrat Party is in the midst of finding its footing and platform on a swath of issues ranging from transgender ideology to immigration and the economy after voters poured out in support of Trump and his policies in 2024 in an election that was viewed as a rebuke of left-wing policies. High-profile Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have amplified their positions within the party in recent months, including hosting anti-Trump rallies and speculation mounting that Ocasio-Cortez could make a Senate or presidential run. Hollyhand said that Trump could use his \"secret weapon\" ahead of the midterms and publish bullet-point lists of his accomplishments, which he argued Democrats will struggle to campaign against. DEMOCRATS’ VICE CHAIR IGNITES CIVIL WAR, TARGETING 'ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL' INCUMBENTS IN PRIMARIES \"I think that's going to be a really hard thing to campaign against come the midterms. I think it's going to be super hard to campaign against this list of accomplishments come 2028. Where the Democrats are trying to … scare Gen Z with these emotions and dangle free things in front of them and say, 'oh, well, they're Nazis and they're Hitler and Elon Musk is trying to be a king.' And then we come out and just say, 'Hey, here's a bullet point list of the things we've accomplished in the first 100 days.' That's a really hard thing to campaign against,\" he said. Hollyhand underscored that his meeting with Trump backstage at the commencement speech was relaxed and stood in stark contrast with how the media portrays the president.

He took the time to say, ‘Hey, I actually watched your hit on Fox News this morning.’ He could have been saying, ‘Hey, Brilyn, get these youth numbers up, improve our numbers in this college campus, get more students out there in that arena.’ He immediately turned it to, 'Hey man, you've been killin' it. …. That shows just the testament of who the guy is. And it wasn't like a serious back and forth.

But, for my part, I will not stop fighting. I will never back down. And I will always speak out.\"Elias has been contacted for further comment via an email to Democracy Docket. The White House has been contacted for comment via email.Why It MattersIn recent weeks, Trump has signed executive orders targeting some of the country's most elite law firms. Several of the firms have either done legal work Trump has opposed or have links to prosecutors who at one point investigated the president.On Friday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell blocked an order against the firm Perkins Coie, saying it amounted to \"unconstitutional retaliation.\" Trump's order revoked federal clearance for the firm's employees and instructed federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm. The White House cited the firm's representation of Hillary Clinton's campaign during the 2016 presidential race. Trump has also railed against Elias, one of the firm's former lawyers who hired an opposition research firm that in turn commissioned former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to produce a dossier examining ties between Trump and Russia. Elias left Perkins Coie in 2021.What To Know\"Donald Trump hates me because I fight hard and I fight for free and fair elections,\" Elias told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley, who recently called out parent company Paramount for supervising content.\"I insist on fighting for democracy in court, fighting for voting rights in court, and insist on telling the truth about what the outcome of the 2020 election was.\"He said Trump was trying to \"intimidate\" law firms the way \"a mob boss intimidates people in the neighborhood.\"In the op-ed, Elias wrote that from the \"opening words of Judge Beryl Howell's opinion — 'No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit' — to the 60 Minutes closing credits, this has been an emotional weekend for me personally.\"He wrote that when a producer from 60 Minutes first reached out to him to see if he would agree to be interviewed on camera for the segment that aired on Sunday night, he was \"unsure.\"\"I knew the drill — lots of time talking, for a clip or two in the final cut,\" he wrote. \"Besides, I felt like a bit player in this instance. Yes, I had been targeted by Trump, but that was old news. I am no longer in Big Law, and my current firm is well known for representing Democrats, progressives and pro-voting organizations.\"Elias said he changed his mind after learning that \"few other lawyers—particularly partners at large law firms— were willing to speak on television. The same fear that had prevented Big Law firms from standing up to Trump was now making their partners unwilling to speak out publicly. Even the targeted firms remained quiet.\"He wrote that through interviews, Pelley had \"painted a damning picture of a president out for retribution and a legal industry too cowardly to stand up to him. I am featured—along with others braver than I—including an associate who quit her job rather than be complicit in the deal her law firm had cut.\"Several law firms have reached deals with the Trump administration to avoid being targeted by executive orders and have committed to provide hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of free legal services for causes the president supports.What People Are SayingPelley said as he opened the segment on Sunday's broadcast: \"It was nearly impossible to get anyone on camera for this story because of the fear now running through our system of justice. In recent weeks, President Trump has signed orders against several law firms—orders with the power to destroy them. That matters because lawsuits have been a check on the president's power.\"Elias told 60 Minutes: \"It is trying to intimidate them the way in which a mob boss intimidates people in the neighborhood that he is seeking to either exact protection money from or engage in other nefarious conduct. I mean, the fact is that these law firms are being told, \"If you don't play ball with us, maybe somethin' really bad will happen to you.\"Trump said during a speech at the Department of Justice on March 14: \"In recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations. They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.... They spied on my campaign, launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another, broke the law on a colossal scale, persecuted my family, staff, and supporters. Raided my home, Mar-a-Lago, and did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the President of the United States.

Gavin Newsom, almost anything he does — even if it’s merely pursuing a routine duty of his current office — will be evaluated in terms of his obvious yet still unstated desire to become president.\n\nFrom the moment last summer when former President Biden left last year’s race until this month, though, there was only one word to accurately describe Newsom’s putative campaign — supine. Before Biden’s exit, Newsom was probably America’s second most prominent Democrat, the leading Biden surrogate and one who traveled the country trying to impress other national Democrats with himself and Biden.\n\nHowever, once Biden handed off the Democratic nomination to Newsom’s longtime friend, fellow Willie Brown protégé and political stablemate Kamala Harris, the California governor seemed to disappear into a long sulk.\n\nHe played virtually no part in the fall campaign and for months did not lead any form of resistance to the sometimes dictatorial presidency of Republican Donald Trump, who cannot run for president a third time in 2028 but nevertheless suggests there may be ways for him to get another term.\n\nRather than oppose Trump, Newsom blasted his own party’s “toxic” attitudes — not necessarily inaccurate as national Democrats until lately had mostly sat by and watched Trump’s many moves. Now Newsom may have a mechanism to relaunch himself into the national picture for 2028 while becoming possibly the prime Democratic spokesman for the remaining nearly four years of Trump’s current term.\n\nIt came via the mid-April announcement of a California lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s on-again, off-again, partially on-again tariffs, which could potentially cost California farmers, merchants and manufacturers tens of billions of dollars in sales.\n\nLoss of that much income and the state taxes it produces would heavily impact future state budgets, cutting into virtually all programs, from Medi-Cal to policing and fire protection, regardless of budgetary gimmicks.\n\nTrump’s tariff actions, taken under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, set 10% baseline import taxes on virtually anything originating abroad, with higher levies on goods from China, Canada and Mexico. There are also specifically higher taxes on certain products like autos and aluminum.\n\nNewsom’s lawsuit — the first of the 15 legal actions the state has taken against the new Trump administration that name him as the lead individual plaintiff — claims the law Trump cites does not give him unilateral power to set up tariffs or take them down. That power, many legal scholars believe, belongs to Congress, which has shown even less fight than Newsom’s early campaign.\n\n“No state is poised to lose more than California,” Newsom said, which doesn’t even count stock market losses resulting from Trump’s moves. “That’s why we are asserting ourselves.”\n\nNewsom’s action made California the first state to formally challenge Trump’s tariffs, but other states have joined in on most other California lawsuits against Trump this year. When Trump lawyers quickly petitioned to have the tariff case moved from California to an East Coast courtroom, Newsom immediately riposted with “You scared?”\n\n“We’re the first mover,” Newsom said. “That’s what California does.”\n\nOfficial descriptions of the law Trump uses as his authority note that no other president has tried to claim it gives them such power. Trump seems to operate on the theory, though, that powers seized and not firmly resisted somehow become legitimized.\n\nIf Newsom’s lawsuit wins, it would very likely force a Congressional vote to either adopt and legalize Trump’s tariffs or dump them. Either way, Newsom aims to put every member of Congress on the record about tariffs, rather than letting politicians of both parties moan about how powerless they’ve been.\n\nForcing such a vote would give Newsom a claim on being politically savvy and powerful enough to force changes in Washington, D.C. even as a lame duck. It’s precisely the kind of political ammunition Newsom has sought as he blasted party mates while conducting dialogues with Trump supporters on his own podcasts.\n\nHis clear hope is that this and subsequent moves to resist Trump will give him the staying power to remain prominent through the year of political exile between the end of his term in early 2027 and the 2028 election season.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.","summary":"The California governor's moves could give him staying power on the national stage between the end of his term in 2027 and the start of the 2028 election.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/06/elias-newsoms-beef-with-trump-on-tariffs-may-boost-his-presidential-bid/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRN-L-ELIAS-COL-0509-1.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 12:15:31","author":"Thomas Elias","authors":["Thomas Elias"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":318406350,"title":"Kamala Harris Ruthlessly Roasted For Attending Swanky, Elitist Event: PHOTO","text":"Kamala Harris has the internet talking after a surprise appearance at the Met Gala.

Unlike her running mate Tim Walz, the former Senator from California has chosen to take a step back from the spotlight. It's probably for the best.

New Look, Same Attitude. Kamala Harris trolled over Met Gala appearance. Well, she popped back up Monday night to attend the Met Gala. For those of you who don't know, the Met Gala is an elitist event where people dress up like they're in the Hunger Games. It's very popular for some people dialed into the culture world. I don't understand the appeal at all, and I'm pretty sure working-class guys like myself would be shot if we tried to attend. To be clear, I would never attend the Met Gala. Give me a dive bar and Miller Lite over that circus any day of the week, but I'm also not the former Vice President. To the surprise of nobody, people were quick to spin up some reactions to her surprise appearance at the Met Gala. Specifically, some people noticed a bit of a Cruella de Vil vibe. It is certainly interesting that the Democrats got rolled because they couldn't connect with average people. The Democrats' response? Promote Kamala Harris - who will almost certainly run again in 2028 - at the Met Gala. Tickets to the event cost a staggering $75,000. Very bold strategy. Let's see how it works out for them. Say whatever you want about the Democrats, but the one thing you can't say is that they're not content machines. Now, it's not for the correct reasons, but I'm certainly not complaining.

While some high-profile Democrats like Gavin Newsom have rightly acknowledged many of the issues that plagued their party during the last cycle, others continue to appear oblivious.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, in one of her first major speeches since losing to Trump, suggested that elephants are the key to guiding beleaguered Americans through the Trump presidency. You didn’t read that wrong. Harris said this to the Emerge Gala in San Francisco:\n\nAnd look, right now, I know a lot of folks are wondering, what’s going to guide us through this moment? How are we all going to figure out how to chart the course? […] Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago, the one of the elephants at the San Diego Zoo during the earthquake? Google it if you’ve not seen it. So that scene has been on my mind. Everybody’s asking, what you’ve been thinking about these days? Well … So in the video, for those of you haven’t seen it, here those elephants were, and as soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet, they got in a circle and stood next to each other to protect the most vulnerable. Think about it. What a powerful metaphor.\n\nThat’s the message Kamala has now for her people: Be more like elephants (notwithstanding the fact that elephants are symbolic of the GOP). Elephants may never forget, but Harris has forgotten the very tone-deafness that cost her the election.\n\nNot to be outdone, Harris’s running mate, Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is likewise continuing to bask in the inability to read the room. Speaking to the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, Walz told the audience the reason he was picked to be the vice presidential candidate:\n\nBut I also was on the ticket, quite honestly, because I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that. … I could put them at ease. I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.’\n\nI can’t for the life of me imagine anyone letting Walz fix their truck. And if his Elmer Fudd-like impression of a hunter fumbling to load his shotgun during a campaign bird hunt photo op is any indication of him being a “code talker” for masculinity, masculinity is in dire straits. But Walz’s use of cryptic words like “code talk,” and “permission structure” reveal the root of where Democrats like him and Harris continue to go wrong.\n\nHaving long left behind simple, direct communication, the Left swims in obfuscation. They seem to think that people prefer code to words, which actually mean things. For them, the way to reach an alien culture is to first crack the code that these peculiar beings use. And for Harris-Walz, “white guys watching football, fixing their truck” is an alien culture whose code must be broken.\n\nThe worldview of these football-watching, truck-fixing white guys is so foreign to the Left, that they must be given permission to vote for someone enlightened to the extent that Kamala Harris is. And who better to give them permission to vote for Harris than someone who can speak their code, Tim Walz—the very same governor who signed a law that allowed for putting tampons into boy’s restrooms in schools.\n\nCode that contains errors usually doesn’t run well, and the Democrats’ code of Walz masculinity was riddled with error. The Harris-Walz Democrat approach viewed the world in caricature. Male and female, masculinity and femininity, and even a person’s identity are only caricatures in their worldview.\n\nWhat Democrats missed in the 2024 election cycle—and may still be missing—is that many of the guys who watch football and fix trucks are influenced by a worldview that can’t be reached by code talking and permission structures. Their worldview can only be accessed by acknowledging the reality of the way in which God created the world.\n\nGod communicated his truths about things like masculinity using clear words, not code—like when the Apostle Paul instructed men to “Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” In the book of Genesis, we’re told clearly—again in words, not code—that “God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”\n\nMasculinity and femininity are not caricatures. They’re outworkings of the way God has made us. Sure, it sometimes expresses itself in athletic prowess, the ability to fix things like trucks, the ability to cook a tasty meal, decorate a room, and a myriad other ways. But masculinity, femininity, and other aspects of our God-given identity are far more than expressions of machismo or the clothing we wear. They’re rooted in how God has created us in his image—something that no amount of code talking can mimic.\n\nAnd that’s why the Left has been falling short in its messaging to a wide range of Americans. They’re operating from a world they’ve created for themselves, and they’re ignoring the world God created. Until Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and other Democrats who follow them understand that truth, they’ll continue to be trampled by the elephant in the room.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

It’s why we love covering the Met Gala, which raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s costume wing.\n\nThe gala officially opens the Costume Institute’s exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” examining 300 years of Black fashion and the history of Black dandyism. Attended by the rich and famous and hosted, as always, by Anna Wintour, this year’s gala raised the most money ever in its history — $31 million.\n\nYet the party and the exhibition about Black style have a different feel than its planners may have intended. The political landscape looked very different when the Met announced the show in October, The Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, explained. Back then, Kamala Harris, the first Black woman ever to top a major-party ticket, was in the final weeks of her campaign for the White House. Now, the federal government has targeted all things involving diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as programming related to race — especially in cultural institutions.\n\nThe show has other political baggage, too. The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism. (This exhibition is the brain child of Andrew Bolton, the institute’s chief curator. It’s based on a 2009 academic text called “Slaves to Fashion” by Monica L. Miller, a Barnard professor who helped put the show together.) Despite many D.E.I. initiatives after 2020, the fashion world failed to make good on its promises; of the more than 15 recent appointments at the top of major brands, not a single one was Black.","summary":"We have photos from the biggest night in fashion.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/briefing/met-gala-fashion.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/05/arts/06themorning-nl-LEAD/oakImage-1746499187665-facebookJumbo.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 11:21:44","author":"Stella Bugbee","authors":["Stella Bugbee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.365},{"id":318359218,"title":"Kamala Harris takes next step in return to political stage","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris headlines a top-dollar Democratic National Committee fundraising dinner on Tuesday, marking the latest step back into the political spotlight by the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee. The New York City gathering of top party officials, politicians and donors, where tickets range upwards of $25,000 per person, according to an invitation obtained by Fox News, comes as Harris is mulling her political future after last November's election defeat at the hands of Republican President Donald Trump. Among her campaign options that she's weighing is a 2026 run for the open governor's seat in her home state of California and another bid in 2028 for the White House. The event also comes as the Democratic Party, facing historically low favorable ratings in national polling, aims to leave the political wilderness after the party lost control of the White House and the Senate and fell short in its bid to regain the House majority in the 2024 elections. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS POLITICAL TIMETABLE FOR MAKING KEY DECISION And it is being held as an increasingly angry and energized base of Democrats is pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against Trump's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. \"Kamala Harris understands the fight that we are in,\" DNC committee member and veteran Democratic strategist Maria Cardona told Fox News. She added that \"Kamala Harris is a beloved figure in the Democratic Party.\" \"The DNC is using every tool in their toolbox to bring people together, to get people excited about the campaigns that are coming in the next two cycles,\" said Cardona, a member of the DNC's influential Rules and Bylaws committee. \"I think it's super smart for the DNC to use her, to use every other elected [official], to use governors, to use former administration officials. … I think this is just par for the course for what the DNC needs to do going forward.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION ON FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS The fundraiser is being held the day after the president helped haul in big bucks as he headlined a gathering of major donors at one of his golf courses in Virginia for MAGA Inc., which was the top Trump-aligned super PAC during the 2024 election cycle. Harris proved her fundraising prowess last year, hauling in over $1 billion during her three-and-a-half-month White House campaign after replacing then-President Joe Biden atop the Democrats' national ticket in late July, amid mounting questions over the then-81-year-old president's physical and mental stamina. \"She raised an eye-popping record amount of money,\" Cardona noted. \"She is still a tremendous draw for the Democratic faithful and donors and that will continue to be the case going forward.\" The DNC is using much of the money brought in at its fundraisers to build its ground operations and messaging efforts ahead of next year's midterm elections. A top progressive leader agreed that using Harris to help fundraise for the DNC makes sense. HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY EVENTUALLY RUN FOR WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 But Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a major grassroots organization that promotes economic populism and democracy through electoral and issue advocacy efforts, pointed to Harris' 2024 setback as well as her flameout in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary when asked about how the left would receive a potential 2028 White House bid by Harris. \"She had her chance. Sometimes you have to know when to step away,\" Green told Fox News. He argued that Harris felt more like a candidate from the party's establishment than a shake-up of the system, populist, during her two presidential campaigns, and that the more voters got to know her, the less they supported her. Harris' appearance at Tuesday's DNC fundraiser, where she'll take part in a question-and-answer session with national party chair Ken Martin, comes a week after she made some of her first major public remarks since her 2024 defeat. The former vice president at an event in San Francisco took aim at Trump's economic agenda. She said the president's controversial implementation of tariffs, which initially triggered a massive stock market selloff, \"as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\" The stepped-up appearances by Harris come as she continues to meet with advisors and friends as she considers her political future. A source in the former vice president's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital two months ago that Harris had told allies she would decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a 2026 gubernatorial campaign. TOP TRUMP ALLY TEASES BID FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR IF HARRIS RUNS Harris served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and represented the Golden State in the U.S. Senate before joining Biden's 2020 ticket and winning election as vice president. And Harris would be considered the clear frontrunner for governor in heavily blue California in the race to succeed term-limited Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. Meanwhile, extremely early polls in the next Democratic Party presidential nomination race, which are heavily reliant on name recognition at this point, indicate that the former vice president holds a significant lead over other potential White House contenders. It is unlikely she could do both. Running and winning election in 2026 as governor of California, the nation's most populous state and home to the world's fifth-largest economy, would likely take a 2028 White House run off the table, allies and political analysts have indicated. While no decisions have been made, the former vice president has vowed to remain politically involved. Harris, in a video message to the Democratic National Committee as it huddled for its winter meeting in early February, pledged to be with the party \"every step of the way.\" And in an early April speech in California, Harris reiterated that she'll stay politically active, noting that \"I’m not going anywhere.\" 2028 WATCH: VIRAL VIDEO SPARKS MORE AOC SPECULATION But Harris is far from the only Democrat sparking 2028 speculation. Among those making headlines in the extremely early moves for the next Democrat presidential nomination race is two-term Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who took aim at Trump and his own party as he headlined a state Democratic Party fundraiser a week and a half ago in New Hampshire, which traditionally has held the first primary in the White House race. Also grabbing plenty of 2028 buzz is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the four-term, outspoken progressive from New York City. A viral video of her nationwide series of rallies with longtime liberal champion Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, drew large crowds and sparked more speculation that the lawmaker known as AOC might have presidential ambitions in 2028 or that she could potentially primary challenge longtime Democrat Senate Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in three years.
