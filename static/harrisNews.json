Call it another shameless and truth-challenged stab at relevancy.\n\nHate-crime hoaxer extraordinaire Jussie Smollett wants to return to show biz.\n\nAnd with the unmitigated gall of O.J. Simpson claiming he’s still looking for the real killer, the disgraced “Empire” actor wants everyone to know who the real bad guys are.\n\n“The villains are the two people who assaulted me, the Chicago Police Department and, if I may be so brave, the mayor [Rahm Emanuel],” Smollet told Variety in a fluff piece meant to smooth the road for his imminent reboot.\n\nYes, the perpetual victim is sticking to his infamous story about a 2019 “beatdown” — and channeling the great modern philosopher Shaggy, who once said, “It wasn’t me.”\n\nSmollett has a new R&B album to promote and will be competing on Fox’s reality show, “Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test” Plus, he was interviewed for the documentary “The Truth about Jussie Smollett?” premiering August 22 on Netflix.\n\nBut it matters not which projects he has in the pipeline or in his past. The greatest performance of the actor’s life will always be playing the role of an innocent and wronged man.\n\nAccording to Smollett, he was assaulted for his skin color and sexuality — and tossed to the wolves by a corrupt mayor and law enforcement attempting to shift attention from their botched handling of a police-involved fatal shooting in 2014.\n\nIt’s simply too rich for words. But shame has never been his strong suit.\n\n“We’re living in a world where the higher-ups, their main mission, in order to do all of the underhanded things that they’re doing, is to distract us with the shiny object,” Smollett told Variety.\n\nI would say he’s living in a bubble of delusion if he thinks anyone is buying the baloney he’s peddling.\n\nSmollett’s concocted MAGA fantasy was truly something. He claimed to have left his Chicago apartment at 2 a.m. — during a polar vortex — to grab a delicacy from Jared Fogle’s preferred sandwich shop.\n\nSuddenly, Smollett alleged, a masked man screamed, “Empire!” followed by a gay slur, another “Empire” and then an anti-black slur.\n\nThe attacker screamed “This is MAGA country” and punched him in the face. Then a second man joined, and the pair worked him like a tag team on “Monday Night Raw.” Only after they left did Smollett realize they had placed a noose around his neck and doused him in bleach.\n\nThe tale was so insane, he should be banned from ever touching a script with his own pen.\n\nStill, sympathy poured in from boldface believers. After all, it was 2019, a time when the truth mattered less than the perception of victimhood. \n\nOn Twitter, then-Sen. Kamala Harris called it “an attempted modern day lynching.” Robin Roberts landed an exclusive interview with Smollett on “Good Morning America,” where he cried and shook his fists at the doubters. If only his attackers were “Muslim or Mexican or someone black,” he would have more support, dammit.\n\nHe declared himself the “gay Tupac.”\n\nMost sensible people smelled a rat.\n\nThen a pair of Nigerian-American siblings, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo — who had been extras on “Empire” — were busted. During questioning, the brothers Osundairo said Smollett had planned and paid for the beatdown. They even claimed there had been a dress rehearsal.\n\nSmollett was arrested for filing a false police report. Charges were initially dropped in exchange for community service and bond forfeiture. The city of Chicago sued him for reimbursement of the money wasted investigating his hoax — and he had the stones to sue right back, claiming he was the victim of “mass public ridicule and harm.”\n\nHe was indicted again, found guilty, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. In 2024, the verdict was tossed on a technicality.\n\nHe was not exonerated. \n\nBack in May, he soft-launched his return on instagram, writing, “This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear.”\n\nSubtract the word “false” and this is the most honest statement the man has ever made.\n\nHe’s a spotlight-craving fabulist who exploited racial tensions to increase his fame and, apparently, his “Empire” paycheck— with no regard for the tax-payer resources he wasted. Or the public trust he broke.\n\nIn a 2019 bit about the hoax, comedian Dave Chappelle repeatedly called him “Juicy Smollye” the “famous French actor,” while “The Daily Show” put out a hilarious Lifetime movie-style spoof. In 2023, Fox News released a documentary where the Osundairo brothers recreated the choreographed fight at the scene of the crime, leaving no doubt that they were far more entertaining than Smollett.\n\nBut America is a forgiving place. Just ask Al Sharpton, who weathered the fallout from a disgusting race and rape hoax in the 1980s — and is now treated as a respectable commentator on MSNBC.\n\nWhat a great country. Not that Smollett will ever admit that fact. Or the real truth about what happened that freezing night in 2019.","summary":"With the unmitigated gall of O.J.

Tom Tiffany is the clear favorite among likely Republican primary voters in the state’s open 2026 gubernatorial race, according to recent polling.\n\nTiffany holds a commanding lead over a hypothetical primary field with 40% of the vote, followed by Washington County executive Josh Schoemann at 13% and former Navy Seal and manufacturing executive Bill Berrien at 10%. Tiffany is well-positioned to secure the Republican nomination if he enters the race and would likely cruise to the general election with President Donald Trump’s endorsement, according to a polling memo conducted by Republican firm Fabrizio, Lee & Associates and exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: GOP Rep Goes After Loophole Allowing Chinese To Abuse Birthright Citizenship In Northern Mariana Island)\n\n“Tom Tiffany is in a solid position and is the clear front-runner in the Republican Primary for Wisconsin Governor,” the polling memo states. “An endorsement from President Trump and educating voters about Tiffany and his record would propel his lead even further, with either option essentially sealing the deal for the primary nomination.”\n\nTiffany, a three-term lawmaker and member of the conservative Republican Study Committee has said he will make a decision to run for governor by the end of September. Schoemann and Berrien have already declared for the race.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to take back the governor’s mansion in the key battleground state following two terms of Democratic rule under Governor Tony Evers. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin last November, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly 30,000 votes. Evers announced in July that he would not run for a third term.\n\nThe president has yet to publicly back a candidate in the Republican primary. The survey found that a Trump endorsement would grow Tiffany’s edge over the primary field to 60%, leaving his two declared opponents with less than 10% of the vote respectively.\n\nInforming voters about Tiffany’s record in Congress further expanded his lead over the other Republican candidates in the race, according to the polling memo. Voters were 92% more likely to vote for the three-term lawmaker after hearing about his “solid border record.”\n\nDemocrats are also likely to have a crowded primary field vying for the open seat. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez is the only well-known candidate in the race thus far, entering the race less than 24 hours after Evers’ announced his retirement.\n\nThe multimodal survey of 600 likely Wisconsin Republican primary voters was conducted between July 28 and 31. Tiffany holds a commanding lead well outside the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4%. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they were undecided about their preferred candidate.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced that his state would hold a ballot initiative seeking to redraw its congressional districts as a countermeasure to the gerrymandering push by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nNewsom made the announcement in a speech laden with anti-Trump rhetoric as Border Patrol agents swarmed outside the Los Angeles auditorium. \n\nThe Democrat, who has made major steps toward running for president in 2028, said that he would request the state legislature take up the bill, which would require two-thirds of the vote to pass and reach a ballot.\n\n“We have got to recognize the cards that have been dealt, and we have got to meet fire with fire, and we've got to be held to a higher level accountability,” Newsom said. \n\nNewsom’s announcement at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo comes after Trump pressed the Texas legislature to reconvene in a rare mid-Census redraw of its congressional districts to give Republicans five more seats. In response, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, convened a special session of the legislature, which usually only meets for half of the year. \n\nIn response, many Democrats in the Texas state House of Representatives decamped to blue states including Illinois, California and New York to prevent a quorum from being reached and a vote being held on the redraw. \n\nTypically, states redo their maps every 10 years in response to the Census data. But Republicans want to shore up their slim House majority as they continue to lag in the generic ballot ahead of the 2026 midterm election.\n\nCalifornia’s constitution requires that redistricting be done by a nonpartisan commission after a 2010 by ballot initiative. But Newsom said that Trump’s moves forced Democrats to change. \n\n“We're doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior, as we've been doing for 15 years in the State of California with our independent redistricting commission,” he said. “But we cannot unilaterally disarm.” \n\nOn Thursday, Texas Democrats said that they would return once the session ends and once California unveils its new map.\n\nNewsom sought to draw a distinction between his efforts to redraw the map and those Texas Republicans.\n\n“We didn't receive a phone call from the president united states to then quietly go in the back room and start drawing maps and legislatively try to jam them through against the people,” Newsom said. “We're doing precisely the opposite. We're working through a very transparent, temporary and public process.” \n\nThe move would mean that if Texas moves forward with its map, California could redraw its congressional map to give House Democrats extra seats from the Golden State. \n\nBut a ballot measure would be a herculean effort, wherein not only two-thirds of the legislature approve of it, but also that voters turn out for the vote to allow that for the state to redraw the map. \n\n“We will affirm our commitment to the State Independent Redistricting after the 2030 census,” Newsom said. “But we're asking the voters for their consent to do midterm redistricting in 2026, 2028 and 2030 for the congressional maps to respond to what's happening in Texas, to respond what Trump is trying to excite and we'll do so in a way that also affirms our desire as a state to level the playing field all across the United States.”\n\nNewsom’s fight represents just the latest sticking point he has had with Trump since the president returned to office in January. Trump said when he first visited California after the wildfires ravaged the Los Angeles area that he demanded the state adopt a voter ID law to receive federal dollars. \n\nThen in June, Trump dispatched Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to Los Angeles, specifically at places like Home Depot, as part of his plans for mass deportation. In response to protests that at times led to the destruction of property, Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles without Newsom’s consent.\n\n“Wake up America,” he said. “This is serious moment. Wake up to what's going on. Wake up to the fear, the anxiety. Wake up to what's happening. Not just here in Los Angeles, where we saw our streets militarized.”\n\nNewsom has also taken steps to show he is interested in running for president, including visiting South Carolina, which holds the one first presidential primaries for the Democratic Party. He also served as a major attack dog for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for most of the 2024 election. \n\nThe effort also reflects a larger change in attitude among Democratic voters, who want to see their leaders take a less conciliatory approach toward Republicans and focus more on attacking them.\n\n“Here we are in plain sight before one vote is cast in the 2026 midterm election and here he is once again trying to rig the system,” Newsom said. “He does not play by a different set of rules, he does not believe in the rules. And as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way that things have been done.”\n\nBut Texas is not the only Republican state to try and change their maps to squeeze out Republican seats. Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana to try and convince them to change their maps. Other potential states include Ohio, Missouri and Florida.","summary":"Democratic governor’s effort comes as Republicans in Texas, Florida, Indiana and Ohio all seek to add GOP seats to their congressional maps","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-trump-texas-republicans-redistricting-b2808008.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/20/09/SEI262148780.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oW1g8ezw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-14 22:19:37","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":351176364,"title":"Liberal Enclave Fears DC Homeless Will Hop Border Amid Trump Crackdown","text":"Officials from Montgomery County, Maryland, reportedly appear to be flustered over President Donald Trump’s crackdown on neighboring Washington D.C.’s homelessness and crime crises.\n\nDemocratic Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich, a member of the far-left Democratic Socialists of America, stated that “it’s not a question of if more homeless people will show up in Maryland shelters, but when,” WJLA reporter John Gonzalez said in a recent video he posted to X.

Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have figured out how to use fewer National Guards, ICE agents, and federalized cops to foment, they hope, at least as much civil disorder as they did in Los Angeles with far larger deployments.\n\nAs I documented earlier this week, the level of the deployments in D.C. is far smaller than that in L.A.: just 800 Guards, with just 200 on duty at any one time, compared to the 5,000 Guards in L.A., not to mention the 700 Marines. But Trump & Co. are deploying those Guards, and ICE agents, and now the federalized police, in ways guaranteed to stir public outrage.\n\nEarlier today, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith issued an order to the city’s police (no longer under city control) that they had to assist federal authorities in their efforts to detain undocumented immigrants. The new policy was limited: The cops must now help ICE agents identify such immigrants and transport them to holding cells, but not make such arrests themselves. That marked a clear reversal of the city’s own policy of forbidding its police from cooperating with ICE at all.\n\nAs was not the case in L.A., Washington has relatively few places where the undocumented cluster, as it has far fewer undocumented residents to begin with, and the workplaces within city limits that do employ them are chiefly restaurant kitchens. Which leads to the second part of the Trump-Miller policy: With few immigrant-rich target areas to which they can swarm, they’re setting up dragnets and making the occasional immigrant arrest on the city’s busiest thoroughfares.\n\nLast night, ICE agents, some Guards, and the cops deployed to 14th Street Northwest, one of the city’s liveliest streets, chockablock with restaurants and stores patronized by a very cross-class and cross-racial clientele. As is rarely the case in Los Angeles, the sidewalks on such commercial streets in D.C. are invariably filled with pedestrians during the evening hours—and no such street more so than 14th Street last night, when ICE agents began pulling over cars to check, they said, for seatbelt compliance, and then checked the drivers’ and passengers’ IDs—with the cops standing by to assist when necessary. The dragnet lasted until 10 p.m., during which time ICE arrested at least two motorists, and appeared to infuriate the overwhelming majority of other motorists and passing pedestrians, who began chanting, “Shame! Shame!”\n\nIn the one 14th Street incident guaranteed to enter the Urban (Verified) Legend Hall of Fame, one such pedestrian threw a Subway sandwich at an ICE agent on Sunday night, for which he was arrested and charged with a felony. The pedestrian, it turned out, was actually an employee of the Department of Justice, from which he was summarily sacked.\n\nThough Trump’s choice as D.C.’s federal prosecutor—right-wing TV celebrity Jeanine Pirro—boasted that the sandwich-hurler faced a year in jail, it’s going to be very difficult to find a D.C. grand jury willing to indict him, much less a trial jury willing to convict him. In the 2024 presidential election, 90 percent of D.C. voters cast their ballots for Kamala Harris, against just 7 percent who voted for Trump. We’ve already seen this kind of jury resistance to the spurious charges leveled by the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, Bilal Essayli, where a number of grand juries have refused to charge ICE protesters who raised their hands to fend off ICE agents’ blows for the crime of raising their hands to fend off ICE agents’ blows.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the major anti-ICE protests were confined to the very few blocks in downtown L.A., normally unpopulated at night, where thousands of National Guards were clustered. In Washington, D.C., no such massive groups of Guards or troops have been sent out, but in Washington, as is not the case in L.A., there are a few streets where heavy pedestrian traffic can be safely counted upon. Hence, Trump and Miller have concluded they can provoke a kindred level of civil disorder with a smaller force of federal and federalized agents, provided they’re strategically deployed.\n\nMore productive provocateurs!

Huge chunks of the city itself — from public parks and sidewalks to the medians and green spaces between streets and inside traffic circles — are under the federal government’s control. The capital is dotted with office buildings, military installations and other properties under federal control, woven into a city with a complicated governing structure shared with Congress and federal law enforcement.\n\nThis week, Donald Trump pushed for even more authority by declaring a “crime emergency” to “federalize” local police and deploy the National Guard and federal law enforcement to local landmarks and monuments as well as city streets and neighborhoods.\n\nCritics have argued that the move is low-hanging fruit for Trump in a city already under limited local control, serving as the president’s backyard “political theater” for national ambitions.\n\nAfter Trump declared from the White House that “we’re going to take our capital back,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser appeared to admit her hands were tied, thanks to the city’s complicated dynamic with the federal government looming over it.\n\n“For decades, D.C. has been used as a petri dish by Congress and presidential administrations to try out a variety of policies,” according to at-large city councilmember Christina Henderson.\n\n“Without statehood, we are limited in our ability to prevent or deter these repeated federal incursions,” she said in a statement this week. What the president has imposed is “an entirely new level of interference,” she said.\n\nTrump and his allies routinely berate local officials and the people who live in the capital, despite the federal government largely holding the city’s purse strings and the fact that residents lack full voting power in Congress. There are no D.C. senators, and the sole member of the House of Representatives representing the district cannot vote on legislation.\n\nThe city’s residents also overwhelmingly have voted against Trump.d Democrats Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton each received more than 90 percent of the vote against Trump in 2024, 2020 and 2016 elections, respectively. \n\nEarlier this year, Republicans in Congress approved legislation that blocks D.C. from spending nearly $1 billion of its own taxpayer funds towards a city budget that Congress had already approved. That deficit forced city officials to scramble for public investment in schools, infrastructure and police salaries.\n\nPublic spaces fall under the purview of the National Park Service, so any improvements are up to the feds to handle.\n\nCritical vacancies on the D.C. courts are up to Congress to fill. And the city’s U.S. Attorney’s Office — which handled the nation’s largest-ever criminal investigation in the wake of January 6, 2021, among other high-profile cases — also is responsible for prosecuting other crimes in the district.\n\nHow those crimes are prioritized is also up to that office, not the city leaders who take the blame for what Trump called a capital overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to put D.C. under total control, and critics have warned that his latest maneuvers imperil what autonomy it has left. The president’s agenda is driven by “fear, misinformation and the misuse of federal authority,” according to the Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nThe administration’s takeover could “destabilize communities and undermine some of the evidence-based reforms D.C. has already been implementing to address crime and disorder,” including federally approved programs for juvenile offenders, the group said.\n\nTrump is “micromanaging D.C. to serve a political agenda of overreaching federal control,” according to Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of the District of Columbia.\n\nSince it was enacted federally in 1973, the Home Rule Act has delegated the city’s day-to-day operations to the municipal government run by the mayor’s office and city council. For Trump to exert full control over the district, Congress would have to repeal it.\n\nThat would require 60 votes in the Senate, where Republicans carry a thin 53-47 majority. Democratic lawmakers have resisted such proposals, though many prominent Democrats have advocated for D.C. statehood that would expand residents’ representation in Congress and bring the district more fully into local control.\n\nThe Home Rule Act, however, grants the president authority to take control over the local Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days. The president must then ask Congress for legal permission to extend that takeover once time runs out.\n\nOn August 13, Trump said he wants “long-term extensions” of his federal occupation.\n\n“I don’t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will,” he said.\n\nThe president also called on Congress to pass a “crime bill” that’s “going to initially pertain to D.C.” but serve as a “very positive example” for other cities.","summary":"Huge chunks of the capital are under the federal government’s control.

The police told me to make a citizen’s arrest.","text":"I was not drunk. It was not late. I was not in a bad area. With permission, I was leaving the Washington Examiner office a little early, just after 3 p.m., to prepare for a joint birthday party I was hosting, walking east on L St. Northwest toward 13th St. toward my Chinatown apartment when I felt the jolt of pressure, then pain, of a stranger’s fingers inside of me. I whipped around in a frenzy to see a tall man smiling at me as his hand wove under my coat and between my legs, flashing his ultra white teeth and almost a wink at his little stolen moment, and then he ran down the alley going north. I screamed and stumbled into the street. It was broad daylight, with two eyewitnesses who stayed to corroborate my story to the police. Later, a detective would tell me that there were multiple private security cameras on the block. But the man was never arrested, and I was never called back. The last thing the police told me was that if I ever saw him again, I could make a citizen’s arrest.\n\nI guess I should consider myself lucky, as far as crimes in D.C. go. Earlier that year, one of my best friends was maced by a group of teenage girls outside a Safeway, and a few years later, a mutual friend would be stabbed in broad daylight. My husband was the victim of a hit and run while he was on a jog, which the police saw but refused to pursue. And my fellow On Deadline cohost has had a gun pulled on him and his car stolen more than once. By the time Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) 2021 victory liberated Virginia from COVID-19-era tyranny, Mr. Doescher’s proposal of a move across the Potomac that came with one of marriage elicited more of a “Hell yes” than an “Oh well.”\n\nI still take the metro into D.C. every week to work. I still walk down L St. Northwest. I still cavort across town for on-the-record meals and off-the-record martinis, and despite my better judgment, I still love D.C and want it not to be a wasteland of shuttered and boarded-up storefronts, silent but for gunshots and the wailings of the deranged and drug-addled lunatics who wander the city.\n\nSo, naturally, it should surprise me that the Democrats who dominate the district evidently do not agree.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump announced he was invoking Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to federalize the D.C. police and crack down on the worst of the district’s violent crime, Democrats and their media stenographers exuded more apoplexy than they had over the violent crime itself.\n\nThe ostensibly objective New York Times reporter Peter Baker insinuated that Trump, “citing a nonexistent crime crisis,” was a hypocrite for cracking down on violent crime because he “himself has been convicted of 34 felonies and is the first criminal elected president.” CNN’s Dana Bash proclaimed that “the most violent moment in recent history in D.C. was Jan. 6,” and MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian declared that crime in D.C. “is actually at historical lows.”\n\nJan. 6 was indeed a disgraceful day. The 174 law enforcement officers assaulted that day indeed outnumbered the 60 injured during D.C.’s race riots in May 2020, though nobody was murdered during either event. But crime in D.C. is nowhere near historic lows. In their effort to triple down on opposing everything Trump even suggests, Democrats have deluded themselves into defying the cold, data-driven reality that D.C.’s violent crime rate is a national disgrace.\n\nIt is true that D.C.’s homicide rate has fallen from its 20-year high in 2023. It is also true that the lower homicide rate in 2024 — 26.6 per 100,000 people — was the fourth highest of the nation’s cities and more than twice as high as the murder rates of Bogota, Baghdad, Mexico City, and Nairobi. Both the 2024 homicide rate and the 2024 violent crime rate of some 500 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in D.C. are more than any other state in the union. That’s, of course, if you believe the data isn’t understating — the police commander has been suspended for allegations of intentionally downgrading the data.\n\nThe city’s liberal elite may be subject to carjackings or sex crimes, but they can mostly ignore the worst of violent crime because it simply doesn’t affect them. Nearly half of all violent crime victims in D.C. and more than half of its homicide victims are residents of Wards 7 and 8, where nine in 10 residents are black and a quarter are impoverished.\n\nMore than a quarter of sex crimes and two-fifths of murders went uncleared last year, as did the overwhelming majority of robberies and nonfatal shootings.\n\nD.C.’s dark indigo electorate may not necessarily agree with Trump’s solution, but they agree that violent crime is a crisis. Just last year, the Washington Post found that two-thirds of the district’s residents consider local crime to be “extremely” or “very” serious, with fewer than a quarter considering themselves “very” safe from crime.\n\nWithin the confines of the Home Rule Act, Trump cannot solve all of (as former Vice President Kamala Harris liked to say) the root causes of the crime crisis. For example, officers widely attribute the 5% increase in juvenile crime in 2024 and the fact that juveniles are responsible for two-thirds of carjackings to the more than doubling of truancy at D.C.’s public schools. The 30% of middle schoolers and the majority of high schoolers who are truant have to be doing something all day, and the police suspect that said something is often violent crime. One of the 15-year-old Maryland girls who stabbed a DOGE employee over the weekend had “major truancy issues,” according to Judge Kendra Briggs. Section 740 doesn’t fix the fact that the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Education does not follow up on educational neglect reports, nor does it fill the 1,000-officer void in the Metropolitan Police Department, which has a staffing level of a half-century low.\n\nAll of this is why Republicans are considering bringing the half-century experiment of D.C. home rule to an overdue end. The Constitution mandates that Congress govern the seat of the federal government, but as with the depreciating U.S. dollar, Great Society, and the rest of our modern ills, the Home Rule Act was championed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The year was 1973, and D.C.’s population was larger than it is today.\n\nThe 2019 sexual assault was far from the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, but the assailant is still out there, presumably at large. The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform estimates just 200 to 500 people are responsible for D.C.’s thousands of gun crimes, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that convicted sexual predators in general are three times as likely to be rearrested for repeat offenses as other criminals who serve their time. Presumably, the man who attacked me is still out there.\n\nHollywood starlets can flee Studio City for Cannes, and big bankers can trade Manhattan for Miami. But the Constitution demands that D.C. be in D.C., and Congress still reserves the power to federalize the D.C. police for the president. In a city of some 700,000 people, nearly 16,000 or over 2% have been the victim of a crime in the first eight months of this year, including 55 victims of sex crimes and 101 murders. Those numbers might not be too high for our media elite — but they are for Trump and for me.","summary":"The grand irony of the day I was sexually assaulted in the District of Columbia is that my skirt really was rather short, not that you could actually see it.

I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor, too.\" Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election, outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters, and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier. But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better, compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026, 29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods. A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's \"meeting Latino Virginians where they are — on the ground and in-language — and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families, keeping communities safe, and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.\"Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population, according to the Census Bureau, and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart. \"We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican,\" Rocha said. \"She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better, and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now.\" Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, housing and energy, as governor.Her ad also takes aim at her opponent, GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education. \"Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care, too,\" the ad says. \"We need a governor who fights for Virginia, not Trump.\" Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday, her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger, who represented Virginia in Congress for six years, as a \"Washington insider.\" She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad, saying that the former congresswoman \"voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time.\" \"That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards,\" Earle-Sears says in the ad. \"Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.\"Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration, since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June, Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: \"This November, Virginia gets to be the first to the polls, along with our friends up in New Jersey, to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.\"","summary":"Democrat Abigail Spanberger is trying to win over Latino voters in her bid to be the next governor of Virginia.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abigail-spanberger-virginia-latino-voters-ad/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/14/933b56c4-6d62-4d27-964a-8c18946c435f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/cc6ff957ca305991adac3fb0dba8b629/gettyimages-2178592639-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 16:05:06","author":"Anne Bryson","authors":["Anne Bryson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026},{"id":351118654,"title":"John Stockton Calls Karl Malone The Best Ever, Describes Michael Jordan And LeBron James With One Word","text":"On a recent appearance on The Maverick Approach podcast, NBA legend John Stockton participated in a rapid-fire segment where each prompt required just a one-word response. True to form, the Hall of Fame point guard was concise but impactful, and in the process, he made a bold claim about his longtime Utah Jazz teammate, Karl Malone.\n\nWhen asked to sum up Malone, Stockton didn’t hesitate: “Best-Ever.” \n\nIt was a striking declaration given the context of the all-time great debate that usually revolves around names like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bill Russell. \n\nStockton’s answer speaks volumes about the respect he has for Malone, with whom he shared the court for nearly two decades. Together, they formed one of the most lethal duos in NBA history, revolutionizing the pick-and-roll and leading the Jazz to back-to-back NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998.\n\nWhen the conversation turned to Michael Jordan, the player who famously denied Stockton and Malone championship glory in those Finals, Stockton chose the word “Competitor” later adding “Top Competitor” for emphasis. \n\nIt’s an acknowledgment of Jordan’s relentless drive, which Stockton experienced firsthand on basketball’s biggest stage. There was no bitterness in his tone, only respect for the way Jordan approached the game with unmatched determination.\n\nLeBron James, another perennial figure in the GOAT conversation, drew the word “Amazing” from Stockton. \n\nIt’s notable that Stockton’s one-word choices for Jordan and LeBron were both deeply complimentary, though with different tones, Jordan as the ultimate rival and competitor, LeBron as a generational talent whose skill set and longevity remain awe-inspiring even to fellow legends.\n\nStockton’s rapid-fire continued beyond basketball. He referred to The Dream Team, the iconic 1992 Olympic squad he was a part of as “Truly a Dream”, capturing the once-in-a-lifetime nature of that roster and experience. \n\nFor Robert F. Kennedy (RFK), he used “Idol”, and for Kamala Harris, a more cryptic “Woosho” paired with a sigh, leaving listeners to interpret his meaning.\n\nHis non-basketball answers revealed glimpses of his personality and beliefs. He described the FDA as “Needs work”, called the COVID vaccine “Absurd”, and said the CDC needs a “Redo.” \n\nAsked about the CIA, he initially responded with “No Comment” before reconsidering and adding “Spooky.” \n\nOn the subject of aliens, he answered “Could be,” showing an openness to the idea. \n\nFor Donald Trump, Stockton’s response was more cautious: “Jury’s out... boy a step in the right direction.”\n\nStockton’s quick responses painted a picture of a man who remains fiercely loyal to those he believes in, especially Karl Malon,e while holding strong personal convictions about a wide range of topics. \n\nHis declaration of Malone as the “Best-Ever” is sure to spark debate, but it’s also a testament to the bond they shared on the court and the historic success they achieved together. Whether or not fans agree with Stockton’s hierarchy, his words leave no doubt about where his loyalty and admiration lie.","summary":"On a recent appearance on The Maverick Approach podcast, NBA legend John Stockton participated in a rapid-fire segment where each prompt required just a one-word response.","url":"https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/john_stockton_calls_karl_malone_the_best_ever_describes_michael_jordan_and_lebron_james_with_one_word/s1_16751_42586726","image":"http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_1123,w_2000,x_0,y_31/c_fill,f_auto,h_1215,q_auto,w_2160/v1/m/8/5/850cb9ce1b3715c686ac4bc623570872382cbbb3/feb-16-2014-new-orleans-la-usa-nba-legend-karl.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 15:31:33","author":"Fadeaway World,Vishwesha Kumar","authors":["Fadeaway World","Vishwesha Kumar"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.487},{"id":351128002,"title":"Taylor Swift obliterates Donald Trump and Joe Rogan's podcast ratings... but president could have the last laugh","text":"Taylor Swift obliterates Donald Trump and Joe Rogan's podcast ratings... but president could have the last laugh\n\nREAD MORE: Travis Kelce does weird impression as Swift suffers confetti gaffe\n\nBy JAKE FENNER, US SPORTS WRITER\n\nPublished: 15:25 BST, 14 August 2025 | Updated: 16:29 BST, 14 August 2025\n\nThe most anticipated sports podcast episode in history ended up giving the world's biggest pop star bragging rights over the President of the United States.\n\nWednesday night saw a special release of the 'New Heights' podcast where co-host and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce brought on his pop superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nTeasers leading up to the episode revealed that Swift would be unveiling the cover and release date for her highly-anticipated 12th album, 'The Life of a Showgirl'.\n\nSwifties flocked in droves to listen to the episode live - breaking the record for the most-watched live-streamed podcast in YouTube's history at 1.3million viewers.\n\nIt shattered the previous mark - held by 'The Joe Rogan Experience' when the eponymous host brought on then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nThe stream was so popular that Swifties ended up crashing the YouTube stream at the 1 hour, 44 minute mark.\n\nBest-of moments from the Taylor and Travis podcast\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:02\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nTaylor Swift's appearance on Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast broke the record for the most-watched YouTube livestream of a podcast episode when it dropped Wednesday\n\nThe episode surpassed a mark previously set when Donald Trump went on Joe Rogan's show\n\nMarried football manager's interviews with stunning reporter go viral\n\n39.6k viewing now\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Isak is on strike.

Travis and Taylor have been the definitive storyline in the NFL over the last two years, with the sport seeing a massive spike in female audience in that time. \n\nOn the episode, Swift mentioned how important that July 2023 episode was to their eventual meeting.\n\n'This kind of felt more like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie,' Swift said.

John Kennedy said on Wednesday that the Democratic Party’s leadership was frightened of calling out the far-left wing of its party.\n\nDemocratic socialists Zohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have surged to prominence within the Democratic Party. Kennedy argued on “Hannity” that “mainstream” Democrats and party leadership do not condemn radicals out of fear and called on them to find courage to do so — particularly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. (RELATED: NYC’s Socialist Mayoral Candidate Has A Problem)\n\n“The mainstream wing of the party is scared to death of the loon wing. They won’t speak up. And they don’t stand for anything anymore. All they stand for is against whatever President [Donald] Trump stands for,” Kennedy told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “That’s why we find ourselves in the extraordinary position of mainstream Democrats have now come out firmly and passionately in favor of crime in Washington, D.C., Why? Because Trump is trying to do something about it.”\n\nHannity asked Kennedy if he believed Schumer and Jeffries would ever “stand up to that wing.”\n\n“No, but they could. And I don’t mean any disrespect. I don’t know Mr. Jeffries that well. I know Senator Schumer very well, so I say this with respect: Chuck and Hakeem need to go to Amazon, buy some testicles and stand up to the loon wing of their party,” Kennedy said. “And until they’re willing to do that, I haven’t heard Senator Schumer say anything bad about Mamdani. I mean, the guy’s a socialist. He’s a whackjob. They’re scared to death. And the party is not going to get better until they do.”\n\nMamdani is campaigning for mayor of New York City and has run on policies including free buses, city-run grocery stores and rent freezes. He has also championed “seizing the means of production.”\n\nFormer Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine also told Hannity on Aug. 6 that his party was plagued by leadership that was fearful of angering its far-left base.\n\n“Chuck Schumer is terrified of being primaried by AOC … Good luck being the majority leader again if you go to war with your own base … [Jeffries] wants to be speaker if we’re able to retake the House,” Turrentine said. “He needs the base … And so we have two leaders terrified of the base.”\n\nMoreover, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Ken Martin said on “America’s Newsroom” Aug. 6 that he was perfectly fine with socialists being part of the Democratic Party coalition.\n\n“[T]he difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party is that we’re a big tent,” Martin said. “We have lots of people in that tent from all of the different ideological wings, from conservative Democrats to centrists, to progressives, to these new leftists … you win through addition, not subtraction. You don’t win by pushing people out of your coalition, you win by bringing people into your coalition.”\n\nWhen asked to identify the Democratic leader they believe “best reflects the core values” of their party, 10% of Democrats chose Ocasio-Cortez, while 8% selected Sanders, according to a CNN/SSRS poll published March 16. Ocasio-Cortez ranked first, while Sanders ranked third, with former Vice President Kamala Harris in between at 9%.\n\nA July 16 Quinnipiac University poll found that only 19% of voters approved of Democrats in Congress, marking an all-time low for the polling outlet.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

These “burrowers” may represent a deep state threat to the president’s ability to fulfill the promises he made to the American people.\n\nAn April poll found that 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy. Furthermore, a February Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies, and 84% of federal employee’s political contributions went to Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nWhile some “burrowers” may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that the new administration likely faces a deep state threat, and The Daily Signal’s coverage aims to expose it before it becomes a problem.\n\nThe Daily Signal’s eight-part series on the Biden burrowers highlights the many Biden political appointees who burrowed into the bureaucracy.\n\nRussiagate Advisor Turns Burrower\n\nLucian Sikorskyj, a former advisor to then-Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., appears to still be associate administrator for materials and safety at the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAfter nine years at the FBI, Sikorskyj served on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council (and would later join Biden’s), and joined the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in February 2019. At the time, Schiff used his position at the head of that committee to suggest he had evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia that was unavailable to the general public. \n\nIn 2023, the House of Representatives censured Schiff, faulting him for having “abused” a position “of extreme trust” to suggest he had evidence of collusion that “never existed.”\n\nBiden had nominated Sikorskyj principal deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism at the Department of Homeland Security in 2022, but he moved to the FAA career role in September 2024.\n\nKamala Harris’ Lawyer and Anti-Kavanaugh Strategist\n\nSamantha Goldstein, currently associate deputy general counsel in the Department of Defense, previously called Trump “unfit to hold office.” She worked as special counsel for then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in 2018, specifically advising her on the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Harris engaged in extremely aggressive tactics against Kavanaugh. \n\nBiden appointed her senior counsel at the DOJ Office of Legal Policy in 2021 and she took a career role at DOJ before ultimately joining the DOD in February.\n\nThe Environmental Justice Advisor\n\nAndrea Delgado-Fink, a former “environmental justice” advisor to Biden, remains in the Trump administration as deputy regional forester at the Forest Service in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“Andrea Delgado is currently serving as a Deputy Regional Forester in the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region,” a spokesperson told The Daily Signal on Friday. “USDA does not comment on personnel matters beyond confirming employment status.”\n\nBiden nominated Fink to be chief of staff for natural resources and the environment under Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and she transitioned to her current “career” FDA role in October 2024. Before joining the Biden administration, she worked at the environmentalist group Earthjustice from 2012 to 2019 and served in the Biden-Harris transition team. She also joined the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.\n\nA Biden Campaign Lawyer\n\nSarah Scheinman, who appears to still be serving as an attorney-advisor in the Justice Department’s antitrust division, previously worked on the Biden campaign’s legal team in the 2020 presidential election. Biden appointed her as associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget in September 2021, and she burrowed in in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, she posted a photo of herself with Biden.\n\nTaking the Buyout\n\nWhen Jeff Baran, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, failed to secure Senate support to stay in his job, he found a “career” appointment in the bureaucracy and remained long enough to take the Trump administration’s buyout offer.\n\nTrump designed the buyout offer to entice potentially hostile bureaucrats to leave, and Baran may have fit that definition. However, he would not have been in the position to take the buyout had he not “burrowed in” ahead of time. \n\nEric Holder’s Protege\n\nTina Thomas, currently an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., wrote on her LinkedIn profile that she “served as a strategic adviser and counselor to the Hon. Eric H. Holder,” Barack Obama’s attorney general. Holder, notorious for championing the Black Lives Matter movement and for getting held in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over documents related to the Fast & Furious scandal, also launched redistricting efforts aimed at helping Democrats win elections. Thomas advised him on those redistricting efforts.\n\nBiden appointed her to serve as senior counsel in the DOJ Office of Legal Policy in September 2021, and she transitioned to the assistant U.S. attorney role in August 2024.\n\nAn Immigration Holdover\n\nThe final name on this list, Jeff Rezmovic, does not count as a burrower, though Biden did nominate him for a political position and he continues to work in a career role in the Trump administration.\n\nRezmovic, who has worked at the Department of Homeland Security since 2011, rose through the ranks under then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Biden appointed him to become DHS’ chief financial officer, but his nomination died in the Senate. Toward the end of the administration, Rezmovic moved from deputy chief of staff for policy at DHS to a leadership role on the Board of Trade at Customs and Border Protection. \n\nKen Cuccinelli, former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security in Trump’s first term, told The Daily Signal that “Rezmovic’s history is extraordinarily political for a career employee in DHS.”\n\n“He would not have been continuously moved to and through the extremely sensitive policy implementation positions of the last four years if he wasn’t doing the political work of Biden/Mayorkas, ultimately being formally nominated for a political appointment,” Cuccinelli added.\n\nIt is possible that these and other burrowers are conscientious public servants, willing to follow the lawful orders of any president, regardless of their own personal preferences. However, some of these burrowers’ work histories and personal statements suggest they may pose a threat to Trump’s administration from within the bureaucracy.","summary":"In 2018, The New York Times published an op-ed written by a self-described official in President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration who confessed to be &#8220;working diligently...

More than 1.3 million viewers tuned in to watch the YouTube version of the podcast, which ran for almost two hours.\n\nThe figures dwarf the 800,000 people who tuned in to Donald Trump’s appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience in its first hour last October, CNN reported, citing CNN data analyst Harry Enten.\n\nOn YouTube, nine million people have watched Swift’s interview in 13 hours, while Rogan’s Trump episode was watched 26 million times on YouTube in its first 24 hours, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nNew Heights’ YouTube channel also saw a spike in subscribers from 2.85 million to 2.96 million at the time of writing.\n\nThe most-watched episode of Rogan’s wildly successful podcast is Elon Musk’s 2018 appearance, which boasts 69 million YouTube views. Trump’s episode has had 59 million views.\n\n“I could see them beating the Rogan-Trump video,” one industry observer told MarketWatch on Thursday.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging episode, Swift discussed her relationship with Kelce and her much-anticipated new album, The Life of a Showgirl, explaining that the 12 songs were inspired by her experiences during her record-breaking Eras Tour. She also revealed that the album would feature a collaboration with fellow pop star Sabrina Carpenter.\n\n“This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “It just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life. That effervescence has come through on this record, and like, as [Kelce] said... bangers.”\n\nShe added that the album will stand alone without bonus tracks, confirming: “There's no other songs coming.”\n\nTrump will likely be displeased at Swift’s podcast appearance outperforming his own. The president became a vocal critic of the “Shake It Off” singer after she publicly endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the build-up to the election last year.\n\n“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” he wrote in all caps on his Truth Social platform at the time.\n\nIn May of this year, the president followed up with a post saying: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”\n\nSwift first announced her new record in a preview clip from the episode posted earlier this week. The album is now available for pre-order and will be shipped before October 13, according to Swift’s website.\n\nThe multi-Grammy-winning pop star’s previous album was The Tortured Poets Department, released in 2024. In the same year, she ended her Eras Tour, which sold tickets worth an estimated $2.2 billion (£1.6bn) in its nearly two-year run, making it the highest-grossing tour of all time for two years in a row.\n\nShe has not yet mentioned whether she plans to tour the new album.","summary":"Swift unveiled her new album, ‘The Life of a Showgirl,’ on the Kelce brothers’ podcast","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-new-heights-joe-rogan-trump-b2807636.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/12/15/Taylor-Swift-on-New-Heights-and-Donald-Trump-on-The-Joe-Rogan-Experience.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Tv0sbYWc-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-14 13:00:38","author":"Tom Murray","authors":["Tom Murray"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.222},{"id":351033458,"title":"Grok Hits Back at Claims Taylor Swift 'Overrated'","text":"AI chatbot Grok has revealed it is a Swiftie after it dismissed a suggestion that Taylor Swift might be overrated.The pop superstar announced her highly anticipated new album, The Life of a Showgirl this week. The announcement came during an appearance on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his brother, Jason Kelce.The internet has been ablaze with discourse about the new album, as Swift's loyal fans eagerly anticipate the album's release.But one unexpected development in the conversation about the album came from Grok, the AI chatbot on Elon Musk's platform X, which stepped in to share its views on the star.Why It MattersThe Life of a Showgirl marks Swift's first album release since her record-breaking Eras Tour—the highest-grossing tour in history—wrapped in December.It follows Swift buying back the rights to the master recordings of her first six albums, Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation. \"You belong with me,\" she wrote on social media on May 30 alongside a photo of herself surrounded by her albums, in a reference to her 2008 song by the same name from her sophomore album, Fearless.The Life of a Showgirl is Swift's twelfth record, and fifth released in the past five years, following Folklore (2020), Evermore (2020), Midnights (2022), and The Tortured Poet's Department (2024).What To KnowBefore the podcast was released, the Kelce brothers teased the appearance with posts on social media, including an introduction from Jason Kelce. That clip was shared to X, with the accompanying text \"IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING,\" a reference to Swift's 2019 song, Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince, which was the opener on the Eras Tour.Sharing that clip, one social media user asked Grok, \"grok is TAYLOR SWIFT the most overrated artist of all time?\", to which Grok responded, \"No, TAYLOR SWIFT isn't the most overrated artist. Her 14 Grammys, billion-dollar tours, and songwriting depth reflect genuine talent amid hype. Critics cite overexposure, but her impact rivals legends. Who's yours?\"One social media user responded to this interaction, \"I knew Grok would be a swiftie,\" to which Grok replied, \"Guilty as charged—if recognizing unmatched talent counts. With 14 Grammys and tours shattering records, it's hard not to stan facts.\"Swift, who was the most-streamed artist on Spotify for 2023 and 2024, can be divisive. She has received backlash at numerous points in her career, most recently prompted by her appearance at football games, something she poked fun at during the New Heights episode, and following her endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 Presidential Election, something which prompted continual criticism from President Donald Trump.The album announcement, a monumental moment for Swift's incredibly loyal fan base, has so far seen a positive response, both from fans and in the press.What People Are SayingCaitlin Clark, a WNBA player, posted on X, addressing streaming issues with the New Heights podcast: \"Swifties so powerful we broke the internet.\"Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, during media availability, spoke about Swift's upcoming album: \"I'm obviously super excited … \"Just knowing Taylor and seeing the process from just a little bit closer of how she makes the albums, it's going to be amazing because of how much work she puts into it.\"Muireann O'Connell, an Irish radio and television broadcaster: \"She adds billions to economies globally.

The history — and lack of Democratic response — is shocking.\n\nWhile a state must go to court to take away your gun, five Republicans on the US Supreme Court have refused to enforce the “right to vote” provisions of the National Voting Registration Act of 1993 so states don’t even have to notify you when they steal/take away your vote.\n\nAnd, wow, are Republicans committed to taking away your vote!\n\nBack in 2008, following Barack Obama’s win, Chris Jankowski of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) organized a program called REDMAP (Redistricting Majority Project) to create, as closely as possible with the aid of sophisticated computer analyses, a permanent Republican majority, both in control of individual state legislatures and in the US House of Representatives.\n\nThey’d been running voter suppression scams for years, of course; an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that decades of gerrymandering had given Republicans a more-or-less permanent 19-seat advantage in the US House that they wouldn’t have had without it.\n\nBut that wasn’t enough for the GOP, which was facing the headwind of promoting unpopular policies like tax cuts for the rich and gutting the social safety net. So REDMAP was launched with the goal of creating a Republican majority in the House.\n\nThe first step was to seize such complete control of a handful of decisive states that they could then engage in outrageous levels of partisan gerrymandering after the 2010 census; this was done with roughly $30 million (much from the US Chamber of Commerce) spent in usually sleepy state house and senate races.\n\nThat money spent on 107 state legislative races across 16 states, including pivotal then-swing states Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Florida, flipped 19 legislative bodies from Democratic to Republican control.\n\nAs a result, following the 2010 election 10 of the 15 states that were set to redraw their congressional maps in 2011 were firmly in the hands of the GOP.\n\nThen they set about surgically gerrymandering those 10 states and the result, according to research by the Brennan Center for Justice, was that Republicans picked up (and Democrats lost) 16 additional seats in the US House of Representatives and would be able to hold onto them with a high level of confidence in future elections.\n\nREDMAP worked spectacularly: in the 2012 congressional elections, despite Democrats receiving over 1 million more votes for House members nationwide, that gerrymandering campaign helped Republicans capture a 33-seat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThat year in Pennsylvania, for example, Democrats won 51 percent of the congressional vote but only five of 18 US House seats; in Ohio, Democrats also won 51 percent of the statewide congressional vote but because of the extreme gerrymander got only four of 16 seats in the House. In North Carolina, Democrats received 50.6 percent of the vote but ended up with only four House seats compared to 9 held by Republicans.\n\nWhile Republicans were pulling off this evil deed, “good government Democrats” (encouraged by local rightwing media) were embracing an end to gerrymandering in their states with California, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, Washington, and Michigan putting nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions in charge of their redistricting to draw maps that are “fair” to both sides.\n\nAnd now, Trump — looking at an election wipeout next year as he destroys the economy, deploys Gestapo-like secret police, and engages in foreign policy that may well plunge the world into WWIII — is demanding that Texas, Ohio, Indiana, and other Red states make their existing gerrymanders so extreme that they’ll essentially lock out most all House Democrats from those states.\n\nFinally, it seems to be waking up Democrats. California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote a sternly-worded letter to Trump saying:\n\n“You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you can hope to make. This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy. …“If you will not stand down I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states. But if the other states call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.”\n\nWill he follow through? If he does, it’ll be a huge departure from past Democratic Party practices of simply ignoring Republican voter suppression efforts.\n\nSimilarly, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said of the proposed Texas gerrymander:\n\n“I think cheating the way the president wants to is improper. … What Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is doing … is trying to cheat mid‑decade here. … They’re attempting to change the map.”\n\nBut Pritzker won’t commit Illinois to re-gerrymandering. At least not yet.\n\nAnd even if they do, gerrymandering California and Illinois is a good beginning but frankly is weak tea. Democrats should never have abandoned gerrymandering when Republicans were hanging onto it; it was a stupid form of unilateral surrender in the name of fairness and good government. They’re noble ideas, but they’ve also stripped the Party of its political power.\n\nEvery Democratic state should begin gerrymandering right now, regardless of what Republicans do in Texas, Ohio, Florida, etc. It’s necessary to undo the impact of REDMAP, if nothing else.\n\nBut Democrats shouldn’t stop there. An analysis by reporter and statistician Greg Palast — using numbers exclusively from official federal and state sources — found that 4,776,706 mostly-Democratic (and mostly minority) voters were purged from the election rolls in the months leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans had also organized a nationwide campaign to have partisan election judges sit with vote-counters in swing states where mail-in ballots were counted. They challenged so many signatures or found small errors in ballot markings that an additional 2,121,000 mail-in ballots (again, mostly Democratic) were disqualified from being counted.\n\nAdditionally, Republican election officials made sure that 1,216,000 “provisional” ballots were rejected and thus not counted, and 3.24 million new 2024 voter registrations — gathered by Democrats in Get Out The Vote campaigns — were rejected or not entered on the rolls in time to vote.\n\nAs Palast writes, using official US Election Assistance Commission, Federal Election Commission, and state-level official numbers:\n\n“Trump lost. That is, if all legal voters were allowed to vote, if all legal ballots were counted, Trump would have lost the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Vice-President Kamala Harris would have won the Presidency with 286 electoral votes.“And, if not for the mass purge of voters of color, if not for the mass disqualification of provisional and mail-in ballots, if not for the new mass vigilante challenges in swing states, Harris would have gained at least another 3,565,000 votes, topping Trump’s official popular vote tally by 1.2 million.”\n\nThe main weapon the GOP is using to purge voting rolls is called “caging.” They were under a federal consent decree forbidding its use from 1982 to 2018, but that year five Republicans on the US Supreme Court legalized the practice.\n\nIn the direct-mail business, when junk mail is returned because it’s undeliverable those pieces of mail were put in a “cage” to be later fed into a computer to remove the bad addresses, which is where the term caging came from.\n\nRepublicans, though, have elevated caging into a partisan art form. They mail postcards — that intentionally look like junk mail — into heavily Democratic areas that must be returned within a specific time period or the voter will be scrubbed from the rolls for “inactivity.” The typical return rate is 6.8 percent.\n\nWhen Democrats sued in 2018 to stop Ohio Secretary of State John Husted from caging voters in that state, Sonja Sotomayor wrote in her dissent in the Husted v Randolph case that voters were purged after missing an election and “…after failing to send back one piece of mail, even though there is no reasonable basis to believe the individual actually moved. … At best, purged voters are forced to ‘needlessly reregister’ if they decide to vote in a subsequent election; at worst, they are prevented from voting at all because they never receive information about when and where elections are taking place.”\n\n“As one example, amici point to an investigation that revealed that in Hamilton County, ‘African-American-majority neighborhoods in downtown Cincinnati had 10% of their voters removed due to inactivity’ since 2012, as ‘compared to only 4% of voters in a suburban, majority-white neighborhood.’”\n\nIn his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out that only around 4 percent of Americans move every year, revealing the lie that Ohio’s Husted was “just trying to keep the voting rolls clean”:\n\n“The record shows that in 2012 Ohio identified about 1.5 million registered voters — nearly 20% of its 8 million registered voters — as likely ineligible to remain on the federal voter roll because they changed their residences.”\n\nWhen Democrats are talking about “fighting fire with fire,” organizing partisan ballot challenges, voter roll challenges, and caging in heavily Republican districts should also be weapons in their arsenal.\n\nNOW READ: Trump's catastrophic collapse is real — and he may take us all down with him\n\nAfter all, there are huge, well-funded Republican organizations like True The Vote actively challenging voter registrations and attempting to remove individuals from the rolls.

An MIT study found that, nationwide, Hispanic voters wait 150 percent longer in line than white voters, and Black voters can expect to wait 200 percent longer in line to vote.\n\nThis is how Republicans work to win elections, and although it’s not a legal crime (under interpretations by the Republican majority on the Supreme Court), it’s certainly a moral crime and an all-out assault on what remains of our democracy.\n\nIn Indiana, then-Governor Mitch Daniels' new rigorous voter ID law — the first in the nation at the time (2005) — caused an 11.5 percent drop in African American voting. Students sued for their right to vote and lost, and in Red states, retired people who no longer drive but care passionately about their Social Security and Medicare are routinely turned away at the polls by the tens of thousands for lack of a “current” drivers’ license, another GOP trick. In 2008, around six million eligible voters did not vote because of difficulties associated with registration requirements, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2012 election in Pennsylvania, Republicans had just passed that state’s first voter suppression law. It eliminated the right to vote of 758,000 registered voters because they lacked a Department of Transportation-issued ID, meaning over 9 percent of that state’s then 8.2 million registered voters could no longer cast a ballot.\n\nAs the US Commission on Civil Rights noted about the 2000 election after Governor Jeb Bush purged over 90,000 mostly-Black voters and Republicans began seriously challenging voters’ right to vote:\n\n“14.4 percent of Florida’s black voters cast ballots that were rejected. This compares with approximately 1.6 percent of nonblack Florida voters who did not have their presidential votes counted. … [I]n the state’s largest county, Miami-Dade, more than 65 percent of the names on the purge list were African Americans, who represented only 20.4 percent of the population.”\n\nIt’s not like Republicans don’t know what they’re doing. This is at the core of their ability to seize and hold power. As Pennsylvania’s GOP House Majority Leader Mike Turzai famously bragged:\n\n“Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.”\n\nBut the GOP was just getting warmed up. In 2018 in Georgia, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp purged 340,134 mostly Black and entirely legitimate voters (out of the 534,000 total purged) from the state’s rolls. He then “won” the election for governor against Stacy Abrams by about 55,000 votes.\n\nFlorida and Texas are among other “close” states where Republican officials hang onto office in part through aggressive culling of voters from the rolls. The DeSantis administration has purged almost a million voters from the Florida voter rolls using the excuse that they failed to vote in a midterm election.\n\nJust between 2020 and 2022 fully 19,260,000 Americans — 8.5 percent of all registered voters — were purged, flipping control of the House to the GOP in the 2022 election. The purge rate in Republican-controlled Red states was 40 percent higher than the rest of the country.\n\nWhen Florida essentially criminalized voter registration drives ($250,000 fines for even minor errors), the League of Women Voters and other groups simply stopped operating in those states. Similar laws were put in place over the past 15 years by Republican legislators in Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Montana and Tennessee, and are pending in other Red states (and will probably pass soon).\n\nTo make matters worse, in March 2025 Trump signed an executive order to overhaul and exert partial control over our nation’s election systems.\n\nHe’s demanding that voters must show a passport or similar citizenship document to register to vote, wants all voting equipment re-certified (only one voting system meets their certification standards and that company’s systems were only certified on July 7, 2025), and is demanding voter lists with sensitive, personal information from Blue states so they can be combed for “fraud.”\n\nDemocrats are finally talking about “fighting fire with fire,” but Republicans have been going after Democratic voters with flame throwers for two decades and now have the support of the Republicans on the Supreme Court, along with Trump’s efforts to involve the federal government in even worse voter suppression.\n\nDemocrats, in addition to gerrymandering, should start caging operations and challenging Republican voters the way the GOP has been doing against Democratic communities for decades. The resulting squeals that will come from Republican operatives and officials might provoke a change in the law outlawing caging and gerrymandering.\n\nIf the Democrats’ goal is to prevent the 2026 and 2028 elections from looking like those in Hungary and Russia, they need to be raising absolute hell and get on the ball quickly.

The history — and lack of Democratic response — is shocking.\n\nWhile a state must go to court to take away your gun, five Republicans on the US Supreme Court have refused to enforce the “right to vote” provisions of the National Voting Registration Act of 1993 so states don’t even have to notify you when they steal/take away your vote.\n\nAnd, wow, are Republicans committed to taking away your vote!\n\nBack in 2008, following Barack Obama’s win, Chris Jankowski of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) organized a program called REDMAP (Redistricting Majority Project) to create, as closely as possible with the aid of sophisticated computer analyses, a permanent Republican majority, both in control of individual state legislatures and in the US House of Representatives.\n\nThey’d been running voter suppression scams for years, of course; an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that decades of gerrymandering had given Republicans a more-or-less permanent 19-seat advantage in the US House that they wouldn’t have had without it.\n\nBut that wasn’t enough for the GOP, which was facing the headwind of promoting unpopular policies like tax cuts for the rich and gutting the social safety net. So REDMAP was launched with the goal of creating a Republican majority in the House.\n\nThe first step was to seize such complete control of a handful of decisive states that they could then engage in outrageous levels of partisan gerrymandering after the 2010 census; this was done with roughly $30 million (much from the US Chamber of Commerce) spent in usually sleepy state house and senate races.\n\nThat money spent on 107 state legislative races across 16 states, including pivotal then-swing states Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Florida, flipped 19 legislative bodies from Democratic to Republican control.\n\nAs a result, following the 2010 election 10 of the 15 states that were set to redraw their congressional maps in 2011 were firmly in the hands of the GOP.\n\nThen they set about surgically gerrymandering those 10 states and the result, according to research by the Brennan Center for Justice, was that Republicans picked up (and Democrats lost) 16 additional seats in the US House of Representatives and would be able to hold onto them with a high level of confidence in future elections.\n\nREDMAP worked spectacularly: in the 2012 congressional elections, despite Democrats receiving over 1 million more votes for House members nationwide, that gerrymandering campaign helped Republicans capture a 33-seat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThat year in Pennsylvania, for example, Democrats won 51 percent of the congressional vote but only five of 18 US House seats; in Ohio, Democrats also won 51 percent of the statewide congressional vote but because of the extreme gerrymander got only four of 16 seats in the House. In North Carolina, Democrats received 50.6 percent of the vote but ended up with only four House seats compared to 9 held by Republicans.\n\nWhile Republicans were pulling off this evil deed, “good government Democrats” (encouraged by local rightwing media) were embracing an end to gerrymandering in their states with California, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, Washington, and Michigan putting nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions in charge of their redistricting to draw maps that are “fair” to both sides.\n\nAnd now, Trump — looking at an election wipeout next year as he destroys the economy, deploys Gestapo-like secret police, and engages in foreign policy that may well plunge the world into WWIII — is demanding that Texas, Ohio, Indiana, and other Red states make their existing gerrymanders so extreme that they’ll essentially lock out most all House Democrats from those states.\n\nFinally, it seems to be waking up Democrats. California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote a sternly-worded letter to Trump saying:\n\n“You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you can hope to make. This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy. …“If you will not stand down I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states. But if the other states call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.”\n\nWill he follow through? If he does, it’ll be a huge departure from past Democratic Party practices of simply ignoring Republican voter suppression efforts.\n\nSimilarly, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said of the proposed Texas gerrymander:\n\n“I think cheating the way the president wants to is improper. … What Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is doing … is trying to cheat mid‑decade here. … They’re attempting to change the map.”\n\nBut Pritzker won’t commit Illinois to re-gerrymandering. At least not yet.\n\nAnd even if they do, gerrymandering California and Illinois is a good beginning but frankly is weak tea. Democrats should never have abandoned gerrymandering when Republicans were hanging onto it; it was a stupid form of unilateral surrender in the name of fairness and good government. They’re noble ideas, but they’ve also stripped the Party of its political power.\n\nEvery Democratic state should begin gerrymandering right now, regardless of what Republicans do in Texas, Ohio, Florida, etc. It’s necessary to undo the impact of REDMAP, if nothing else.\n\nBut Democrats shouldn’t stop there. An analysis by reporter and statistician Greg Palast — using numbers exclusively from official federal and state sources — found that 4,776,706 mostly-Democratic (and mostly minority) voters were purged from the election rolls in the months leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nRepublicans had also organized a nationwide campaign to have partisan election judges sit with vote-counters in swing states where mail-in ballots were counted. They challenged so many signatures or found small errors in ballot markings that an additional 2,121,000 mail-in ballots (again, mostly Democratic) were disqualified from being counted.\n\nAdditionally, Republican election officials made sure that 1,216,000 “provisional” ballots were rejected and thus not counted, and 3.24 million new 2024 voter registrations — gathered by Democrats in Get Out The Vote campaigns — were rejected or not entered on the rolls in time to vote.\n\nAs Palast writes, using official US Election Assistance Commission, Federal Election Commission, and state-level official numbers:\n\n“Trump lost. That is, if all legal voters were allowed to vote, if all legal ballots were counted, Trump would have lost the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Vice-President Kamala Harris would have won the Presidency with 286 electoral votes.“And, if not for the mass purge of voters of color, if not for the mass disqualification of provisional and mail-in ballots, if not for the new mass vigilante challenges in swing states, Harris would have gained at least another 3,565,000 votes, topping Trump’s official popular vote tally by 1.2 million.”\n\nThe main weapon the GOP is using to purge voting rolls is called “caging.” They were under a federal consent decree forbidding its use from 1982 to 2018, but that year five Republicans on the US Supreme Court legalized the practice.\n\nIn the direct-mail business, when junk mail is returned because it’s undeliverable those pieces of mail were put in a “cage” to be later fed into a computer to remove the bad addresses, which is where the term caging came from.\n\nRepublicans, though, have elevated caging into a partisan art form.

Left unchecked, the technology can and will shift public perception to the left without most users even realizing it. \n\nMRC President David Bozell warned the Trump administration of this very phenomenon in letters to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson on Wednesday. In the letters, Bozell called attention to top AI companies’ training data agreements with predominantly left-leaning legacy media outlets (59% left-leaning vs. 5% right-leaning). He also asked Vought to clarify whether these contracts violate a recent executive order by President Donald Trump and requested that Ferguson investigate whether the AI firms’ contracts constitute anti-competitive and unfair practices that could distort the marketplace. \n\nOpenAI has opted to train ChatGPT with outlets like The Washington Post, The Atlantic, Financial Times, Vox Media and others. Amazon has similarly made an agreement to use The New York Times and Google has contracted with The Associated Press. News Corp, which has a contract with ChatGPT, is the only right-leaning media group that has this type of contract with a major AI company.\n\nUp until now, these contracts have gone on without a hitch despite President Trump’s recent executive order promoting ideological neutrality. But Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI’s 97 agreements with media entities are anything but neutral.\n\nIn the letter to OMB Director Vought, Bozell explained: “The Media Research Center’s analysis found that AI platforms are contracting with left-leaning outlets over ten times more often than with outlets rated ‘lean right’ or ‘right’ by AllSides. These contracts—such as those between OpenAI and The Atlantic or The Associated Press—limit competition, reinforce a single ideological perspective, and undermine the diversity of information essential to neutral AI outputs.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nIndeed, OpenAI has more contracts with media outlets than any other top AI company, and an MRC analysis found that only two of its agreements are with media outlets AllSides rates as “right” (Fox News) or “lean right” (the New York Post). Meanwhile, OpenAI has made deals with at least 21 media outlets AllSides deems left-leaning. This raises many legal questions. \n\nIn his letter to FTC Chairman Ferguson, Bozell noted that, “Courts have upheld the right to use publicly available material for AI training, suggesting these exclusive agreements are unnecessary and may exist primarily to funnel payments to favored outlets.” [Emphasis added.] \n\nThese contracts further bring up antitrust concerns because they “consolidate influence in a few legacy voices [and] reduce market diversity.” Bozell continued, adding, “Big Tech’s selective contracting, combined with its political influence and push for stricter copyright enforcement, appears designed to block new competitors and entrench control over information markets.” \n\nAs such, the MRC asked that the FTC to “immediately investigate whether Big Tech’s artificial intelligence firms are engaging in anti-competitive and unfair practices by contracting almost exclusively with ideologically aligned media outlets. ”\n\nGiven these AI platforms’ overt reliance on left-leaning sources, MRC also asked that OMB offer guidance clarifying whether the AI companies’ “intentional use of a narrow set of biased sources” in their training data “violates the ideological neutrality requirement in President Donald Trump’s recent Executive Order on AI.” Bozell additionally stressed the need for action noting the “hundreds of millions of dollars recently awarded in federal defense contracts to AI companies.” \n\nAs Bozell repeatedly emphasized in his letters, the impact of these contracts is significant given that excluding diversity in artificial intelligence training data would have the effect of biasing its results. It seems both tech CEOs and politicians are well aware of this.\n\nDuring a roundtable event, former Vice President Kamala Harris said the quiet part out loud. “[T]he machine is taught—and part of the issue here is what information is going into the machine that will then determine—and we can predict then, if we think about what information is going in, what then will be produced in terms of decisions and opinions that may be made through that process.”\n\nOpen AI CEO Sam Altman made a similar admission when he testified before the Senate in 2023, saying that “one of my areas of greatest concern” is “[t]he more general ability of [AI] models to manipulate, to persuade, [and] to provide sort of one-on-one interactive disinformation.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai also stated in a 2021 interview with Yahoo! Finance that bias review is “extraordinarily important” and that “studying for bias needs to be done up front” to ensure fairness.\n\nJust last year, Elon Musk similarly acknowledged a growing problem OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini were experiencing. “The concern I have—and this may seem like a small concern, but I think it’s actually a very big, big issue—is that they are not maximally truth-seeking. They're pandering to political correctness.”\n\nMRC contributor Zackory Langin contributed to this report\n\nMethodology: For the analysis, MRC researchers cross-referenced Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI’s 97* agreements with media entities with AllSides’ political bias ratings. AllSides had rated 39 of the media entities. Researchers then tallied how AllSides rated the 39* entities. AllSides rated 21 as “left” or “lean-left,” 14 as “center” and two as “right” or “lean right.” \n\n*OpenAI and Google both have contracts with The Associated Press (which is rated by AllSides) and OpenAI and Microsoft both have contracts with Harper Collins (which is not rated by AllSides). The above numbers reflect that these were counted separately.","summary":"As artificial intelligence platforms continue their race to be the first to reach artificial general intelligence, these same AI platforms are contracting almost exclusively with media outlets with a leftist bias. Left unchecked, the technology can and will shift public perception to the left without most users even realizing it. \n\nMRC President David Bozell warned the Trump administration of this very phenomenon in letters to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson on Wednesday. In the letters, Bozell called attention to top AI companies’ training data agreements with predominantly left-leaning legacy media outlets (59% left-leaning vs. 5% right-leaning). He also asked Vought to clarify whether these contracts violate a recent executive order by President Donald Trump and requested that Ferguson investigate whether the AI firms’ contracts constitute anti-competitive and unfair practices that could distort the marketplace. \n\nOpe","url":"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/gabriela-pariseau/2025/08/14/mrc-warns-trump-admin-ai-media-contracts-infusing","image":"https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2025-08/AI_Contract_Study_0.png?itok=QTlP8c7n","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 10:33:00","author":"Gabriela Pariseau,President Donald Trump","authors":["Gabriela Pariseau","President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":351016554,"title":"The invented threat to gay marriage","text":"It all started when reports broke that a request for Supreme Court review was made, asking the high court to overturn its 2015 decision establishing gay marriage as the law of the land. With this one headline, a viral narrative emerged: The Supreme Court is about to take away gay marriage! Look what President Donald Trump is doing!\n\nThere’s just one problem: this all rests on a series of misunderstandings about how the American system of government actually works.\n\nYes, it’s true that lawyers representing Kim Davis, a former county clerk who infamously refused to issue gay marriage licenses, requested Supreme Court review in a case and did specifically ask the court to reconsider gay marriage. But, unless and until the Supreme Court accepts this case for review, this news isn’t a major development. It certainly doesn’t suggest an impending revocation of gay marriage.\n\nAfter all, the Supreme Court receives roughly 10,000 requests for case review every year, and only accepts fewer than 100 of them, a review rate of roughly 1%. So, just because this gay marriage request was filed doesn’t mean the court is likely to take up the case. Every commentator, journalist, and politician presenting this news as indicative of looming change is misleading their audience.\n\nDespite the glib social media posts “checking in” on “gays for Trump,” this development doesn’t directly have anything to do with Trump or his reelection in 2024. This exact scenario — Kim Davis’s lawyers filing a request for Supreme Court review — most likely would have played out if former Vice President Kamala Harris had won the presidential election. (If the high court were to take up the case and overturn gay marriage, it would have a lot more to do with Trump’s win in 2016, which allowed him to appoint three current Supreme Court justices, than his 2024 victory.)\n\nMoreover, while I think it’s unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant Davis’s petition for review, even if it did, it still wouldn’t guarantee that gay marriage would be overturned. Considering Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s past writings, Chief Justice John Roberts’s long-standing aversion to overturning precedent, and Justice Neil Gorsuch’s past support for gay rights, there is a very real possibility that this court would uphold gay marriage even were it to review the case.\n\nESCALATING CHINA-PHILIPPINES TENSIONS CRYSTALLIZED BY CHINA WARSHIP COLLISION\n\nFinally, even in the unlikely scenario that the Supreme Court did overturn its gay marriage decision, gay Americans would still have access to same-sex marriage rights in all 50 states thanks to the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act passed under former President Joe Biden.\n\nSo, the panic and alarmism over gay marriage isn’t just baseless and scaring Americans needlessly. It’s also a bleak reminder of the civic and media literacy crisis that’s plaguing our political discourse.\n\nBrad Polumbo is an independent journalist and host of the Brad vs Everyone podcast.","summary":"Another day, another left-wing meltdown over something that isn’t actually happening.

By the way, I’m not following him or listening to every word.”\n\nHoward continued: “When I was working with him, all his quotes about the administration were very public. He was trying to run an investment fund.

So when 1,200 delegates from across the country came to Chicago last weekend for the group’s biannual convention, there was much to debrief. And argue about. And celebrate.\n\nMost recently, New York City DSA member Zohran Mamdani burst into national attention after winning the city’s Democratic mayoral primary, beating Andrew Cuomo and becoming a national target for Republicans (and some Democrats). It’s impossible to ignore DSA’s hand in his win: The organization created a network of tens of thousands of canvassers who spent months going door-to-door in all five boroughs to bring voters Mamdani’s socialist message, tightly focused on basic economic issues.\n\nDSA badly needed that victory. Last summer, the organization was hit with three major electoral defeats. First, in the most expensive House primary in history, AIPAC money and corporate Democrats pushed Rep. Jamaal Bowman from his New York seat. Bowman had a complicated history with DSA over his record on Israel (some members had sought to expel him) but nonetheless was endorsed by the group and had been proof that socialists could gain federal office.\n\nJust two months after Bowman’s loss, Missouri Rep. Cori Bush lost her seat in much the same way. The third defeat was the dispiriting presidential campaign and Trump’s eventual election, which left many DSA members all the more disillusioned with American electoral politics and the Democratic Party’s stance on Palestine.\n\nEvery two years, DSA delegates from across the country meet to vote on resolutions and elect their National Political Committee (NPC), which largely steers the group’s direction, though local chapters retain a great deal of autonomy. This year, reckoning with the wins and losses of 2024 and 2025 was top of mind, along with crafting the organization’s response to the genocide in Palestine.\n\nWalking around the massive Chicago convention center that housed the convention, I could see the organization’s concerns and tensions just by looking around. Members wore keffiyehs on their heads or draped over their shoulders. Some caucuses (ideological groups within the DSA) had their own hats (green for the electorally focused Groundwork Caucus), T-shirts (the communist Emerge Caucus had a nice cherry blossom design), and bandanas (worn by the moderate Socialist Majority Caucus). I worried at first that some of these caucus dynamics would unfocus the group and push so-called “sectarian” debate to the forefront. But I left with a much stronger view of the organization, which emerged united on many of its most crucial questions.\n\n“I think it is a critical juncture for the organization. This moment is clearly very dire,” said Colleen Johnston, who joined DSA after President Trump took office in 2017. “Fascism is barreling through the country. And so the urgency is definitely there. And the question for us is: How seriously and clearly are we going to be meeting the moment with urgent, focused power-building demands that are going to unite a broad coalition of people to fight fascism?”\n\nThough some might be concerned by the infighting they saw at the convention (or on social media), I have a more optimistic view after three days of observing debate and speaking to delegates from across the ideological spectrum. Regardless of what happens at the convention, serious material work is being done on the local chapter level across the country, which builds local power.\n\nThe Mamdani Effect\n\nOne obvious route to power is by winning elections at all levels of government. The majority of DSA members, delegates told me, support its moves into the American electoral system, regardless of their ideological leanings. Many of the group’s furthest-left members, those who might otherwise reject the Democratic Party, actively canvassed for Mamdani, who ran as a Democrat—as have virtually all DSA elected officials who’ve run in partisan elections.\n\nSammy Zimmerman, a member of the left-wing Emerge Caucus, is one of those members. “I volunteered for several canvassing shifts and petitioning shifts for Mamdani. It was really, really heartening,” they said. “It was definitely the most helpful I felt about a candidate for office in a long time.”\n\nThat hope helped kick-start a massive growth in NYC-DSA’s membership. Grace Mausser, a co-chair of NYC-DSA and longtime adviser of Mamdani’s, said that the chapter has grown by several thousand members since the June victory. That brings the total number of members in the chapter to 10,500.\n\nThese new members are eager to build on Mamdani’s momentum, Mausser said. “[They’re] very excited to see what the organization will be doing in 2026 with our electoral work.” Mausser also noted a number of legislative campaigns built around Mamdani’s agenda, such as their effort to pass revenue-raisers in Albany, which still controls the tax funding necessary to any city initiatives.\n\nElectoral Philosophy\n\nToday, DSA is looking to replicate Mamdani’s success across the country. Minnesota State Sen. Omar Fateh is a democratic socialist running for mayor in Minneapolis. DSA’s National Electoral Commission has endorsed 12 candidates from across the country in municipal elections this year.\n\nAnd the group made their first 2028 move, passing a resolution called “Unite Labor & the Left to Run a Socialist for President and Build the Party,” which encourages the group to run a presidential candidate in the next election. After Rep. Rashida Tlaib gave a fiery speech to open the convention—“The working masses are hungry for revolutionary change,” she said—some DSA members both on X and in person suggested that she could be a good fit for the role. Whomever the group runs, it will likely be on the Democratic ballot line, in recognition that third parties are not currently viable in the U.S.\n\nKareem Elrefai, a New York member who was elected to the NPC at the end of the convention, said that resolution was one of his biggest takeaways from the weekend, steering DSA in a power-building direction. He recounted that the body debated whether their 2028 candidate should run as a Democrat or a third-party candidate, but he was happy with the ultimate outcome. “There was an amendment that would have strongly urged us to go independent. I am very excited that it has kept us on the Democratic Party ballot line, not because I’m a proud Democrat, certainty not by any means,” he said. “Third-party agitational campaigns fail pretty consistently.”\n\nIt was a Democratic presidential primary campaign that first brought Elrefai to DSA. While working on the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2020, he met dozens if not hundreds of democratic socialists who were eager to build power together. On the day Sanders dropped out, just as the pandemic came crashing down on the country, Elrefai signed up to join DSA “through tears.” He certainly wasn’t alone: The group’s membership shot up by the thousands each time Sanders ran for president (indeed, membership growth had been moribund for three decades until Sanders first declared his candidacy in 2015).\n\nA common criticism of DSA is that its members aren’t serious about gaining electoral power and making material change; the delegates I spoke to fervently denied this claim.\n\n“We’re more electorally focused than we [were] five, six years ago,” said Mausser from NYC-DSA. “There are no longer live debates about whether socialists should participate in electoral contests.”\n\nNow, Mausser said, the debates focus on “how we engage in those electoral contests.” The question of running candidates as Democrats versus as third-party candidates is still one such debate, as Elrefai mentioned.\n\nZimmerman believes that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to party politics. “A strategic relationship with the Democrats necessarily looks very different in different parts of the U.S.,” they said. “You have places like New York where, basically, the Democratic primary determines the mayoral election. That’s very different than somewhere like Idaho, where … a plurality of people [is] more conservative and wouldn’t vote for a Democrat anyway.”\n\nSome caucuses value electoral politics above other forms of organizing, while others prefer instead to prioritize mutual aid work or labor organizing. But the vast majority of DSA members don’t see these goals as mutually exclusive. “We want to win and wield power,” Johnston summarized. “One of the ways we can do that is through the power of the state, by actually changing conditions in people’s lives. I think there are a lot of other ways that can be done that are not oppositional to electoral politics but actually very complementary.”\n\nEthan, a member from New York, identified some of those other methods of organizing: “Our theory of change is defined by a diversity of tactics,” he said. “We have members of the organization that are really actively doing labor organizing, running people in elections, doing field organizing in elections and doing street organizing, organizing on college campuses.” The list goes on.\n\nRed Lines for Palestine\n\nDelegates also debated the criteria that would determine their support for politicians’ views and votes on Israel. One resolution passed by the group, “For a Fighting Anti-Zionist DSA,” called for DSA members and endorsed elected officials to be expelled from the group if they give material support to Israel or related lobbying groups like AIPAC or longtime two-state advocate and Likud critic J Street. Members could also be expelled for statements like “Israel has a right to exist.” An amendment that would have removed the expulsion clause was voted down. Fully 40 percent of the delegates opposed the unamended resolution, however, and by its criteria, DSA’s NPC could vote to expel Sanders if he were a member, and might also expel Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe resolution’s passage comes after years of public disagreement within DSA about how to approach Israel and Palestine. Both AOC and Bowman faced censure from DSA due to their votes and comments on Israel. In 2021, Bowman voted to fund Israel’s Iron Dome, attended a trip to Israel sponsored by J Street, and met with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. These actions prompted DSA’s NPC to re-evaluate their endorsement of him; they eventually decided to publicly condemn his actions but didn’t expel him from the group.\n\nLast June, the NPC voted to endorse AOC if she followed a short list of demands on Palestine. Less than a month later, the committee withdrew their endorsement (she remained endorsed by NYC-DSA) in part due to her support for the Iron Dome, even as she has consistently joined Sanders in opposing the sale of offensive weapons to Israel and decrying the nation’s bloody apartheid policies.\n\nAfter October 7, 2023, some longtime members of the organization left, citing comments other DSA members made in the wake of Hamas killing 1,200 Israelis, as well as the increasingly sectarian politics of many DSA caucuses. My colleague at the Prospect, Harold Meyerson, was one such DSA member. Since late 2023, when Meyerson left the group, DSA has worked to articulate a clear anti-Zionist position. The new resolution comes in response to the debates around Bowman, AOC, and the nature of DSA’s policy on Palestine and Israel, drawing brighter red lines on the issue for members and elected officials alike, even as a sizable minority of delegates opposed it.\n\nIt was just one time of many that Palestine animated the convention’s attendees. One of the most pressing reasons that DSA is looking toward gaining more power in 2028 is Palestine. In 2024, DSA worked with the Uncommitted movement for delegates to the forthcoming Democratic convention as a way to protest the Biden administration’s continued support for Israel’s war on Palestine, and joined the call for a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention. That call was rejected by nominee Kamala Harris and her team. In the early days of her campaign, Harris had tried to signal a superficial difference between her and Biden on Israel, but ultimately toed the party line. Now, Trump sits in the Oval Office and, of course, hasn’t put a stop to Israel’s destruction of Gaza, either. Sixty-one thousand Palestinians have been killed by Israel, and half a million are living in famine conditions.\n\n“I think we as the left really felt the void that was left in 2024 with no presidential candidate,” Elrefai said. “There was nobody up there to anchor our ideas … and that was a mistake, especially in the midst of an ongoing genocide.”\n\nDSA is looking to 2028, but also hopes to make change in the three years before then. “Whether we’re talking about the genocide that’s happening in Gaza, the climate crisis, the rise of fascism, [or] the dismantling of civil society, we don’t have the luxury of time to be setting a plan for figuring things out in two or three or four years,” Johnston said. We have to be acting urgently now.”\n\nPublic Struggle\n\nDSA’s debates—whether over Palestine, elections, or anything else—tend to get broadcasted to outsiders (especially over social media). After scrolling on X during the convention, it would be easy to take a cynical view of DSA, whose convention was chock-full of niche arguments, caucus callouts, and oblique and obscure references. But at least some DSA members say that disagreement within the organization is a feature, not a bug.\n\n“Every organization has this level of dissent and disagreement, and we’re just open about it,” Mausser said. “Our debate and our disagreement [are] intentional.”\n\nAnd on Palestine, Johnston said: “We’re not really interested in … focusing on that inward-facing stuff about who has the perfect position. If you’re against the genocide and you want to stop it, we want to work with you.”\n\nIt will remain to be seen if Johnston’s hope for unity comes true, especially due to the newly passed resolution’s expulsion clause. But it seems that years of debate on Israel and Palestine have cohered the organization around a set of guiding principles, including support for the BDS movement.\n\nThat’s not to say that all delegates welcomed the disagreements or supported everything the convention did or didn’t do. Elrefai and Mausser both pointed to losses in the convention that deeply concerned them. Elrefai, along with his caucus, Groundwork, wanted to amend the convention agenda to put two issues up for discussion: transgender rights and the Green New Deal. That effort failed.\n\n“The reason I find that as upsetting as I do is that, at a moment where the Democrats have completely failed to be a bulwark against trans rights, at a moment when they’ve largely stopped talking about climate change, that’s an opportunity for us,” Elrefai said. “And if we don’t fill that void, somebody else will.”\n\nMausser echoed that frustration. “I am a little disappointed that at the convention we’re not spending a lot of time on the floor talking about some of the biggest existential fights of our time,” she said. “We’re not spending too much [time] on the floor talking about Trump himself, not spending too much time talking about trans rights, but we do have active programs on those things.”\n\nPaul Garver, a longtime DSA member from the Boston chapter, said that he understands why delegates spent less time talking about Trump than they did about, say, Gaza. When it comes to Trump, he said, chuckling, “there’s nothing controversial, so people don’t think it’s interesting!” But speaking more seriously, he reflected on his own activism during the Vietnam War and said that he too had had a narrow focus on the atrocities he saw abroad. “It’s perfectly understandable that Trump didn’t come up” as frequently as some might have expected, he told me.\n\nMausser, despite her own disappointment about the lack of debate on Trump’s policies, cautioned against seeing convention arguments as definitive statements about DSA. “I think sometimes at convention, we focus on what we disagree on, which is actually pretty small in the scheme of things,” she said. “And it seems like we’re deprioritizing [things we agree on], but in reality … once we go home after this, that’s where most of the work is going to live.”\n\nMarina, a member of the Emerge Caucus from NYC-DSA, said that she came to conference to build coalitions around resisting ICE, work that would follow her back home to New York. After working to pass a resolution calling for action against ICE, she started making connections with kindred members from across the country.\n\n“I was also here to create a national network of immigrant justice organizers, which has now become an ongoing chat and a series of meetings,” she said.\n\nAfter I left the convention hall, I wondered if I’d been swept up in the excitement of being among so many hopeful people, all striving, roughly, in the same direction. At the end of the convention, the NYC-DSA choir led the thousand-strong ballroom in song. Delegates stood for “The Internationale,” some taking their hats off, others waving massive red flags over the crowd. Behind me, a man swayed with his fist held high for the whole song. The singers bounced and smiled as they sang; someone strummed a guitar. But I think there was really something there, behind all the singing.\n\n“Things are starting to feel very real,” Zimmerman said. “I think that’s the vibe at this convention. It really feels like eyes are on us right now, and what we do next as an organization really matters.”\n\nAnd now delegates have made it back to their home chapters, where the outside world awaits them: Metro DC DSA is organizing against Trump’s takeover of their city; NYC-DSA returns to canvas for Mamdani; DSA-LA teaches their ranks to resist ICE.\n\n“People always say [DSA] is a big-tent organization,” Zimmerman said, “and that really allows it to be this dynamic thing that is able to adapt to the moment and what people are thinking and needing in the moment. So I think what DSA becomes is really always up for debate.”","summary":"Energized by Zohran Mamdani’s primary triumph, 1,200 DSA members came to Chicago to chart the group’s future.","url":"https://prospect.org/politics/2025-08-14-dsa-convenes-argues-and-celebrates/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23371/download/Janssen-DSA%20081425.jpeg?cb=791e2c57fce7447835543bf3ee80ae5d&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 09:30:00","author":"Emma Janssen","authors":["Emma Janssen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.121},{"id":351015322,"title":"Democrats loaded with losers going into 2028","text":"It’s the dog days of summer, so let’s take a look at election 2028. Sure, there are 1,181 days until Election Day, but the Democrats couldn’t be in a worse position.\n\nHow bad is it? Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the 35-year-old who was a bartender just a few years ago, is atop the polls. But then, Democrats have hit new lows aside from the AOC thing: Just 32% identify as Democrats, which makes sense after they followed Kamala Harris off the cliff in 2024.\n\nMs. Harris was swept across all seven swing states on the way to a wipeout loss in what was supposed to be one of the closest elections in history. (Well, that’s according to the mainstream media; you could have dropped an alien in Des Moines and it would’ve told you she was about to be blazed.)\n\nSo now the desperate race is on to find the new party leader who, in 2028, can go up against whoever is carrying the MAGA torch. (First notice here: It won’t be J.D. Vance.) The White House wannabes are lining up their ducks, but it’s clear that in the past 100 years, there’s never been a bench so weak, so full of candidates who might eke out the nomination but get crushed in the general, as this paltry lot.\n\nMs. Harris recently bailed on the governor’s race in California (she would’ve gotten crushed) and then declared the system “broken” (that’s what a loser does when they lose). She’s done. She may run for something again, but she’ll never win again.\n\nSo who are they talking about? Sure, California Gov. Gavin Newsom seems like the obvious pick, and he’s been moderating his extreme positions in an effort to capture Middle America. For instance, he hosts right-of-center guests on his podcast, and in March, he sat down with Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe governor said that allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports, something that most elected Democrats supported throughout 2024, is “deeply unfair.” He’s handsome and young (although anyone is young compared with the octogenarians we’ve had at the helm for the past bunch of years), so it’ll probably be him on the ticket in 2028.\n\nBut then there’s Gov. Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania and Gov. Wes Moore from Maryland. Mr. Shapiro, with his Midwestern appeal and knack for governing in a swing state, is quietly building a case as the quintessential “safe” candidate. And Mr. Moore is being whispered about as Obama 2.0. “I think Josh Shapiro is the Democrat most likely to beat a Republican in 2028,” Jon McHenry, vice president of North Star Opinion Research and a Republican polling analyst, told the Daily Caller.\n\n“The way he’s governed in Pennsylvania, which maybe wouldn’t win him a nomination on the Republican side, has still been pretty effective. He just seems like he has an ear for essentially the middle of the state of Pennsylvania, which is also essentially an ear for the middle of the country, in a way that a lot of Democrats don’t seem to have. You know, Tim Walz is the perfect example. He’s from Minnesota, he looks like your football coach, and he’s just as completely out of touch as you can be, whereas Josh Shapiro actually seems like he gets it,” he said.\n\nHow about Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who, unlike Mr. Shapiro, decided to join the big-time loser ticket of Ms. Harris in 2024? Mr. Beshear hopes his folksy charm will translate past the Bluegrass State, and Mr. Walz hopes … well, who knows what he hopes. Once a loser, always a loser. Fork him too; he’s done.\n\nThe invisible primary is already underway. Candidates are locking down donors and endorsements, counting down the 1,181 days. But their prospects, at least right now, do not look so good. A recent Gallup poll put the party’s approval rating at the lowest ever.\n\nAdolph Mongo, a Michigan-based Democratic commentator and consultant, summed it up best.\n\n“A bunch of losers,” he told the Caller. “I’m looking for someone who’s going to be more realistic and who’s going to be able to not only dish it out but be able to take it. The Democrats, they ran a spineless 2024 campaign, they let Republicans create the narrative, and they never responded to it.\n\n“They just dropped the ball on several issues, one on immigration, two on transgender rights. Three, they took their base for granted, Black voters, Hispanic voters — they just did everything wrong. And the biggest boo-boo was they knew that the president, two or three years ago, should have just been a one-term guy, and they didn’t do anything and waited too late. … They might as well have just left him in,” Mr. Mongo said.\n\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

On Wednesday, President Trump claimed that the media were purposely working together to damage his reputation.He made the claims before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and said that 'fake news' outlets are working hard to get him negative coverage. President Trump further took a swipe at the media, stating it has become so biased that even if he struck a deal like getting Moscow and Leningrad for free, they would still continue to tarnish his image.“The Fake News is working overtime... If I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!”The detail in the statement that drew everyone's attention was the fact that he mentioned a Soviet-era name to describe St. Petersburg. The city was called Leningrad (named after Lenin) from 1924 to June 1991, after which the residents voted to change it. President Trump's mistake also grabbed former world No. 1 Navratilova's attention, who took a jab at him, suggesting that President Trump could have made an even bigger mistake by calling it Stalingrad (currently known as Volgograd).\"LENINGRAD????????

Nearly a week after taking the keys to the battered media company, Ellison and his top executives met with reporters at the Paramount Pictures lot Wednesday to show that they mean business. Ellison and his team will be based in Hollywood — not New York — and they plan to view the entertainment industry through a California lens by making big investments, leaning into technology and building on popular franchises, including \"Top Gun,\" \"Star Trek\" and \"Yellowstone.\" Last week, Ellison's Skydance Media and its backer RedBird Capital Partners closed their $8-billion takeover of the firm that includes CBS, Comedy Central, MTV Networks, Showtime and the Melrose Avenue movie studio. \"One of our biggest priorities is actually restoring Paramount as the No. 1 destination for the most talented artists and filmmakers in the world,\" Ellison said. \"Very simply, great filmmakers make great movies.\" Such a Paramount comeback would be long overdue. The film studio has suffered from decades of under-investment, and was often bypassed by many of Hollywood's biggest filmmakers. The studio plans to release eight films next year, but that's too small an output to sustain a theatrical film business, Paramount executives said. The plan is to nearly double the number of feature films to 15 and, and eventually, 20 movies a year. Ellison, the 42-year-old chairman and chief executive, was eager to bury his days of being a political target, following the lengthy regulatory review of the deal and President Trump's lawsuit against CBS for its edits of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris last fall. Paramount settled the lawsuit last month, agreeing to pay $16 million. Days later, CBS notified Stephen Colbert that it was ending his late-night talk show in May — prompting howls among some fans and raising speculation the show was sacrificed to appease Trump. CBS has said the decision was \"purely\" based on economics; the show has been losing money. Programming will be created with broad audiences in mind, Ellison and his lieutenants said. Ellison said his goal is to move the company away from political divisions in an effort to reach a wider audience. \"One of the things I think is important is I don't want to politicize this company,\" Ellison said. \"We're an entertainment company first, and I genuinely believe if you're breathing, you're our audience. We want to be in the business of speaking to everybody.\" For Ellison, movies have been a lifelong interest. He recounted his days growing up when he, his mother and sister would go to the cinema or pick from their extensive home library of video cassette tapes. He intends to \"significantly scale\" the amount of content the studio produces and has entrusted his longtime deputy Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, a former Sony executive, as co-chairs of Paramount Pictures. The studio plans to concentrate on key intellectual property such as \"Star Trek,\" \"World War Z\" and \"Transformers,\" with Goldberg saying that \"Star Trek\" is a priority across the company. Paramount executives are also interested in filmmaker-driven original films. Late last week, Paramount said it landed an original project called \"High Side,\" helmed by \"A Complete Unknown\" director James Mangold, which reunites him with actor Timothée Chalamet. In addition, Paramount Pictures plans to greenlight family films, with classic movies like \"The Goonies,\" \"Gremlins\" and \"Night at the Museum\" as touchstones, Goldberg said. There's also interest in R-rated comedies, horror and stories that appeal to Middle America. Paramount has no plans to crank out low-cost films for its Paramount+ streaming platform, said Cindy Holland, the new head of streaming for Paramount. \"The movies that we make will be made for theatrical,\" Ellison said, adding that there is cultural significance to making films for the big screen. Ellison also praised actor Tom Cruise, whom he met when he founded his Skydance Media company in 2010. Skydance co-produced \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and recent \"Mission: Impossible\" installments. Goldberg recounted how she and Greenstein called Cruise after Paramount unveiled its new leadership structure. \"It was to thank him for, frankly, the huge piece he's been in Paramount's history, Paramount's present and how important he is for Paramount's future,\" Goldberg said. \"'Top Gun 3' is a massive priority for us.\" The new corporate ownership structure gives the family of Larry Ellison (David's billionaire father) and RedBird the ability to build the company for the future, rather than manage for quarter-by-quarter earnings. The Ellison family now owns 50% of the company, and RedBird holds 20% — a dominant position. Regular shareholders have 30% of the stock in the new company. Shares soared more than 36% on Wednesday to $15. The event included Ellison's co-investor, RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale, who stressed his confidence in Paramount's prospects. Cardinale noted that he dispatched two of his top executives to join the company — Andy Gordon, a former Goldman Sachs banker is now Paramount's chief operating officer and chief strategy officer, and Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal executive who's now Paramount's president — to signify the importance of rebuilding. \"I'm betting my firm and my career on this deal,\" Cardinale said. On Wednesday, longtime Paramount shareholder Mario Gabelli sued Redstone and Paramount, alleging the deal structure disadvantaged shareholders other than Redstone, who received a premium for her stock. As part of the deal, the Redstone family was paid $2.4 billion for their National Amusements Inc. firm, which held the controlling shares. After their considerable debts are paid, the family should come away with $1.75 billion. Paramount's B-class shareholders received $15 a share. Skydance and RedBird have promised investors that it will find $2 billion in cost savings, which means further belt-tightening and layoffs. Shell said he didn't want Paramount to become a company that had perpetual layoffs, saying the plan was to have one restructuring and \"then be done with it.\" The executives also showed no interest in cleaving off the cable channels, unlike Comcast or Warner Bros. Discovery, which are preparing for spinoffs. Shell said the diminished status of the channels gives the company opportunities to rebuild those brands. In their first week, Ellison and RedBird have made big bets. On Monday, the company said it would spend $7.7 billion over seven years to lock up U.S. streaming and television rights to UFC mixed-martial arts fights for the Paramount+ streaming service and CBS. In addition, Paramount in July agreed to pay $1.25 billion over five years to the creators of Comedy Central's \"South Park.\" A separate deal with Trey Parker and Matt Stone allows the cartoon to run exclusively on Paramount+. When asked what Paramount assets were underappreciated, Ellison talked about the broad reach of CBS, which just ended the regular television season in first place in prime-time among broadcast networks for the 17th consecutive year. He also mentioned CBS' relationship with the NFL, Masters golf tournament and NCAA March Madness. Gordon added, \"I actually think every asset is underappreciated here.\"","summary":"One week on the job, tech scion David Ellison is settling in at the Paramount lot after his family took over the century-old studio.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-08-13/david-ellison-greets-reporters-at-paramount","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06222b5/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5400x3602+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F17%2Fad%2Fa81169134930ac9daf43ab60ee1c%2Fparamount-media-event","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 00:04:54","author":"Meg James,Samantha Masunaga","authors":["Meg James","Samantha Masunaga"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.045},{"id":350856594,"title":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce call Brittany Mahomes ahead of ‘New Heights’ Podcast, new album release","text":"ET OnlineTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce call Brittany Mahomes ahead of ‘New Heights’ podcast episode featuring Swift’s new album release\n\nOn Wednesday, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes shared that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce called his wife Brittany after recording Kelce’s podcast “New Heights.” Mahomes said he didn’t get the call himself and was just in the background of FaceTime, claims reports.Swift’s 12th album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” will be released during Wednesday night’s podcast episode.

Speaking on “The Chris Salcedo Show,” Halperin said Biden’s team harbors deep frustration over Harris.\n\n“What some Biden folks have said to me is Kamala Harris better stay on the reservation. She better stay on the good side of Joe Biden and his team. Otherwise, they’re prepared to tell the stories that they know that at least one Biden official described as Palinesque,” Halperin said.\n\nHalperin said tensions between Biden and Harris date back to the start of the administration, when Biden’s team scrambled to prepare her for the presidency in case he couldn’t finish his term.\n\n“It’s not just the book. It’s the whole relationship. The Biden folks, at the beginning of the administration, found that Kamala Harris needed a big pressure, a big briefing, series of briefings. So they spent a lot of time getting her to meet with world leaders, policy briefings to try to make sure that she was ready to be president in case Joe Biden had to step aside or left office for some other reason. Now they know all those stories,” Halperin said. (RELATED: Kevin McCarthy Has Three Questions He Wants Kamala To Answer In Her New Book)\n\nHarris said her forthcoming book, “107 Days,” will detail her short-lived presidential run and explain why she chose not to pursue California’s governorship, blaming what she called a “broken system.” Despite that criticism, Harris built her career through decades in public office, holding positions from San Francisco district attorney to U.S. senator.\n\nHarris’ next political move remains uncertain after losing the 2024 race to President Donald Trump. Major Democratic donors and strategists have shown little enthusiasm for a potential Harris 2028 campaign, pointing to her $1.5 billion spending spree marked by media buys and celebrity events.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We don't want you on Staten Island,\" a protester wearing a \"Trump girl\" t-shirt and holding an American flag shouted at the 33-year-old self-described socialist as he exited the backdoor of the Istanbul Bay Authentic Mediterranean Restaurant. Inside the event, as Mamdani kicked off his third anti-Trump event of the week, protesters outside the restaurant drowned out the introductory speeches with their cowbells, sirens and megaphones. Despite the heat in the crowded restaurant and his detractors outside, Mamdani maintained a smile throughout the event and told reporters, \"It saddens me to hear language of being told to go back to where I came from, and yet, it is not surprising because it is so much of what characterizes President Trump's politics.\" MAMDANI TAKES AIM AT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN FIERY STATEN ISLAND SPEECH: 'WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP NYC A SANCTUARY CITY' Mamdani was hosting his third \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" event of the week on Wednesday, reaffirming his commitment to protecting New Yorkers from Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration if he's elected mayor of New York City this November.

Ed told Fox News Digital that he wanted to give Mamdani \"a little surprise party\" and let the socialist candidate know that his values do not represent those of Staten Island. \"This is Trump country,\" said Manny, another protester and Wall Street retiree who said Mamdani's policies are \"anti-Wall Street.\" Trump won Staten Island by 30 points in the 2024 presidential election, according to The New York Times' data. Meanwhile, in neighboring Brooklyn, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the borough by 44 points. Tommy Banks, a native Staten Islander, said his message to Mamdani on Wednesday was simple: \"Get out of town.\" \"He wants to make everything free. He can't afford that. He's a socialist. He don't live that. We're not socialist,\" Banks said. Banks agreed with the other protesters outside the restaurant, telling Fox News Digital that \"nobody else\" could be mayor but Sliwa. \"He's a true New Yorker. He's been fighting for New York all his life. Give him a chance to get in there,\" Banks said. Another protester, Liz, shouted, \"Mamdani's a commie!\" as the Democratic nominee departed in his SUV. Liz said she doesn't like Mamdani because \"he's not a Democrat, he's a communist.\" She said Mamdani is trying to tempt New Yorkers with campaign promises like free childcare, free bus fare and government-run grocery stores, but Liz said it would be a \"disaster\" if he became mayor. When Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary, incumbent mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, called Mamdani a \"snake-oil salesman\" that would \"say and do anything to get elected.\" Trump has often criticized Mamdani and his policies, calling him a \"100% communist lunatic.\" Staten Islanders who spoke to Fox News Digital outside Mamdani's anti-Trump event on Wednesday seemed to agree with those sentiments, calling him a \"commie\" and criticizing his socialist policies, which include freezing the rent, raising corporate taxes and increasing the minimum wage.

According to CBS News, the first town hall took place on Tuesday in New Jersey with Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. Monica McIver, and several other local leaders in attendance. Baraka and McIver were both arrested earlier this year at a protest outside of a Newark ICE detention center. Baraka had his charges dropped, but McIver was charged with assaulting a federal law enforcement officer. “It may still seem far away, but the 2026 midterm elections will determine whether our democracy still holds on or whether the people surrender their power to a king,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CBS News. “So, from our perspective, as the NAACP, it’s clear: we’ve got to start organizing early.” Johnson’s warning of democracy being at risk is far from hyperbole. The NAACP’s town halls come as Texas Republicans have begun a redistricting process critics have called blatant gerrymandering. Texas Democrats have stood their ground, fleeing the state to prevent a vote on a new map that would add five new seats in Republican-controlled districts. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered the arrest of the Texas Democrats and filed a lawsuit to have the lawmakers removed from office. The Texas redistricting effort has inspired several Democrat-led states to consider a redistricting attempt of their own to counterpunch Texas. These aren’t things that happen in a healthy, well-functioning democracy. In the coming months, the NAACP plans to have town halls in Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin, New York, and Maryland. The town halls will focus on Trump’s policies and the adverse effect they’ve had on Black communities. This includes the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and workplaces, as well as examining how cuts to SNAP benefits and Medicaid will disproportionately affect Black communities. “Our neighbors are being illegally kidnapped by ICE, Trump’s budget is taking away our health care and access to food stamps, and our civil rights are being stripped away at every turn – all while costs, from housing to groceries, continue to rise, and the billionaire class get richer,” Johnson said in the statement. The town halls will also encourage civic engagement with information on how to help with voter recruitment, grassroots organizing, and old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning. “We’ve got to strengthen community, recruit volunteers, inform each other about Donald Trump’s oppressive policies, and map out local strategies that will ensure everybody gets out to vote,” Johnson said in the statement. “As we build toward the 2026 midterm election, our campaign will focus on connecting past liberation struggles to the urgent demands of the present,” Wisdom Cole, the NAACP’s Senior National Director of Advocacy, told CBS. The NAACP spent $20 million on voter mobilization efforts during the 2024 election, which helped get 14.5 million Black voters to the polls. While Black voters overwhelmingly went for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, 21% of Black men voted for Donald Trump. Given how much contempt the Trump administration has shown to Black and brown communities over the last year, one only hopes that number goes down significantly in the midterms.

Those warrants can only be enforced within state lines, making them largely symbolic for the lawmakers who had absconded to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York.\n\nBut Burrows and Paxton took the unusual step of asking courts in those states to carry out the warrants and bring the lawmakers back to Texas.\n\nOn Wednesday, Illinois Judge Scott Larson rejected the petition, ruling that Paxton and Burrows had “failed to present a legal basis for the court” to take up the issue.\n\nIllinois courts’ cannot consider whether “foreign legislators” were willfully evading their duties, and they cannot direct Illinois law enforcement to execute civil quorum warrants upon “nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois,” Larson said, noting that the warrants specifically say they are to be enforced within Texas. Even if the court were to take up the case, which Larson ruled it lacks the ability to do, the response would be a ruling on whether the lawmakers are willfully disobeying a court order — not an order returning them to Texas as Paxton and Burrows demanded, Larson said.\n\nSpokespeople for Paxton and Burrows did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Illinois’ westernmost county, four and a half hours away from the Chicago suburb where the Democrats have camped out. The county voted for Trump by 47 percentage points in 2024, suggesting Paxton was seeking a friendlier venue than he might have found in DuPage County — where the Democrats are staying — which went for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 14 points.\n\nThe Legislature is winding down its first 30-day special session, which was abruptly interrupted by the Democrats’ quorum break. Burrows has said he will adjourn the session Friday if there is no quorum, and Gov. Greg Abbott has promised to call lawmakers back immediately for another overtime round.\n\nThe new congressional map, drawn after pressure from President Donald Trump, aims to give Republicans five additional seats to shore up the party’s slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

Thank Trump and Kristi Noem spoofs","text":"Comedy Central's \"South Park\" continues to target President Trump, and viewers appear to be loving it. Ratings for the 27th season of the irreverent and often ribald animated series have surged, according to data from Nielsen and Comedy Central. The second episode, which premiered Aug. 6, scored 6.2 million viewers across the cable network and Paramount+, now the exclusive streaming home for the series, over the first three days. The figure is 49% higher than the first three days for the season premiere, which debuted on July 23. The second episode scored 1.56 million viewers on Comedy Central, making it the highest-rated episode since 2018, with nearly all of them in the 18 to 49 age group coveted by advertisers. The new season of \"South Park\" launched amid the tensions between Comedy Central's parent Paramount and the Trump White House. It also arrived after the show's co-creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, scored a massive $1.5-billion five-year deal with Paramount for the streaming rights, which previously belonged to HBO Max. Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit over Trump's claim that \"60 Minutes\" deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to aid her in the 2024 election. First Amendment experts said the suit had no merit. But the settlement was seen as necessary for Skydance Media to get federal regulatory approval of its $8-billion acquisition of Paramount, which closed on Aug. 7. \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert joked that the settlement was a bribe. Days later he was told by CBS that his program was being canceled at the end of the 2025-26 season due to financial losses. But \"South Park\" has not held anything back in its comedic takes on Trump, presenting him naked and in bed with the devil. Trump's boast that Paramount is giving him $20 million in public service announcements as part of the \"60 Minutes\" settlement was also lampooned. (The company has not confirmed that such a deal was made for free ad time.) The second episode showed the president dressed in a white \"Fantasy Island\"-style suit with Vice President JD Vance as his diminutive sidekick. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was portrayed with a melting face and a trigger-happy response to puppy dogs. Both were were running gags throughout the espisode. \"South Park\" regular Cartman became a conservative podcaster in the second episode and was seen sporting a hairstyle similar to that of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Parker and Stone will take a break this week as Comedy Central will air the very first \"South Park\" episode — 1997's \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\" — on Wednesday as part of a marathon for the series.","summary":"The second episode of the durable Comedy Central hit scored its largest TV audience since 2018.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-08-13/south-park-ratings-surge","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/52ecadb/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3800x2138+0+0/resize/1486x836!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2F4b%2F760739d04d689ec9f68cc10b11a2%2Fsp-2702-preview-image","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 20:49:49","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":351008086,"title":"CLIFF MALONEY: Josh Shapiro’s Moderate Mask Is A Fraud—Stop His 2028 Power Grab","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s “moderate” label is a scam, and his record screams it.\n\nFrom crushing liberty during the 2020 pandemic to his latest stunt suing the Trump administration’s directive to end the mutilation of our children, Shapiro’s a Deep State wolf in centrist clothing, eyeing a 2028 presidential run.\n\nLet’s start with 2020. As Pennsylvania’s Attorney General, Shapiro cheered Gov. Tom Wolf’s draconian lockdowns, which shuttered businesses, tanked livelihoods, and trapped families in their homes.\n\nHe backed Wolf’s mask mandates and vaccine push, bullying Pennsylvanians into compliance while small businesses bled out. Hardworking folks lost everything to Shapiro’s power grab, all under the guise of “public health.”\n\nHis moderate act? Pure theater. He is all in for control, not freedom, crushing the spirit of the Keystone State. (RELATED: Governor Suspected Of Running For President In 2028 Makes Clearest Indication Yet)\n\nFast forward to 2025, and Shapiro’s at it again, filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a ban on federal funding for sex changes for minors. This isn’t about compassion—it’s about pandering to the woke left while pretending to be a centrist.\n\nThe Trump policy protects kids from irreversible procedures, yet Shapiro’s fighting to keep taxpayer dollars flowing to this madness. Why the flip flop here? It’s a calculated move to curry favor with the radical Democratic Party’s base, who love the trans ideology because it gives them the tools they need to push more big government overreach, despite the fact that a majority of Americans today are against it.\n\nShapiro also flip flopped on fracking. After making big promises on the campaign trail to regulate the oil industry, he backtracked and essentially did nothing. This particular flip flop actually benefits Pennsylvania residents, who are already struggling with energy costs, but it says something about his integrity. He made promises that he never intended to keep.\n\nNormal, working-class voters see this for what it is: Shapiro’s sacrificing Pennsylvania families to boost his national profile.\n\nElection integrity is another key issue that sounded good in sound bites but was just more political theater. While the Democrats spent the last several years screeching that any criticism or questions about the integrity of our elections was an anti-American conspiracy theory, as soon as they were voted out, that all somehow became fair game again in their minds. Yet another Shapiro flip flop followed by a press tour.\n\nWhy the hustle? Shapiro’s got his eyes on 2028.\n\nHe dodged Kamala Harris’ 2024 VP slot, not because he loves being governor that much, but because he knew she’d crash and burn against Trump. A new book, “2024: How Trump Retook the White House,” reveals Shapiro was Harris’s “obvious choice” but hesitated, wary of tying himself to a losing ticket.\n\nHis “Get Shit Done” slogan and high approval ratings are his launchpad for a White House bid. He’s playing the long game, schmoozing progressives with lawsuits while posing as a moderate to fool swing-state voters. It’s Déjà Blue—same old Democrat playbook.\n\nShapiro’s no friend of working families. He backed a school voucher program tied to school choice visionary Jeffrey Yass and then vetoed it when the left cried foul, proving he’s a political chameleon who’ll sell out PA’s most vulnerable students for power.\n\nThe $36.2 trillion national debt and 51 million illegal border crossings under Biden-Harris? Shapiro’s silent, too busy plotting his next move.\n\nHis 2020 tyranny crushed small businesses, and his current lawsuit now endangers kids to score woke points.

Geraldo Grovels With Cringey Nobel Peace Prize Pitch","text":"Geraldo Rivera is at it again, diving headfirst into the Trump love fest. The longtime Republican turned socially liberal TV vet dropped jaws on Newsmax’s Finnerty when he declared that President Donald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, even if he doesn’t actually bring home peace. \n\nDuring the Wednesday morning segment, host Rob Finnerty asked the million-dollar question, “If he does end this war, Geraldo, can they deny him the Nobel Peace Prize?” Rivera did not hesitate. “Hell no. This and or Gaza would put him on the fast track, and anyone denying that is just letting partisan politics get in the way of logic,” he shot back. He went on to argue that even the public, aggressive, and overt effort toward peace deserves recognition, even if nothing actually changes.\n\nGeraldo, known for his flair for sensational soundbites, is now tossing Trump the biggest olive branch in tabloidy history, or is it a smooch? He framed Trump’s actions as “trying so hard… for peace” that he’s earned brownie points regardless of the outcome. And who are we to argue with effort, right?\n\nThis headline-hungry endorsement is all the more eyebrow-raising considering Rivera’s history with Trump. He has said Trump was the “first rich guy [he] ever knew,” and they were tight until January 6. After the Capitol riot, Rivera called Trump a “sore loser” who “could not be trusted to honor the Constitution.” That’s quite a pivot. He even endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, but now he is back to showering Trump with praise.\n\nMeanwhile, the political soap opera keeps rolling in Washington. Trump is gearing up for a summit with Vladimir Putin, without Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky in the room, and has ominously warned of “very severe consequences” if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire. He has yet to offer specifics.\n\nBREAKING: In an unbelievable moment, Trump again threatens “very severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t stop the war after their meeting, despite not following through on his previous threats of consequences.\nPutin is playing this feckless President. pic.twitter.com/93pae1e8bE\n— Really American 🇺🇸 (@ReallyAmerican1) August 13, 2025\n\nOn another front, Israel recently announced plans to occupy Gaza City in a move it claims will “free Gaza from Hamas,” sparking international outrage and a German arms embargo. Back in July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially nominated Trump for the Nobel, applauding his 2020 Abraham Accords and calling him a peace broker “in one country after another.”\n\nTrump has made no secret of his desire for the award. At the Detroit Economic Club last year, he grumbled, “If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump wanted that Nobel peace prize right?

I do not always think that more police make streets safer.'\n\nA smirking Scarborough listened silently as Sanders Townsend continued her spiel.\n\n'When you walk down the streets of Georgetown, you don't see a police officer on every corner, but you don't feel unsafe,' she argued. \n\n'I think we have to rethink what safety means in America,' she added.\n\nScarborough, a former Florida Republican, replied: 'Well, you know, there have been black city council members in New York City when people were talking about defunding the police, saying the people we represent are the people who need police officers the most.'\n\n'So our children can walk from their homes to school without being stopped, you know, five, ten times by drug dealers or people that are going to assault them,' he added.\n\nSanders Townsend remained unconvinced, causing Scarborough to outright question his coworker's stance.\n\n\"I just, I don't, I don't think this is an issue of Black versus white\", he said.\n\n'When you come- when you're talking about safety, there are a lot of Black Americans who don't feel safe in their homes, in their neighborhoods.\n\n'And when they hear people talking about defunding the police, it freaks them out'.\n\nSanders Townsend still insisted Trump taking over DC's police force was 'authoritarian overreach,' before clarifying some of her views. \n\n'I'm not saying that the police are not good, I never supported defund,' she said. 'I think you're making a good point, Joe. \n\n'I want to be able to call the police in my neighborhood, and when they come, I don't want them to think that I'm a suspect,' she added.\n\n'But what we are talking about is that the president of the United States is saying that there is a crime emergency in Washington, D.C. \n\n'An emergency could be anything that he says it is,' she concluded, as Scarborough attempted to interrupt.\n\nBoth have called DC home for the past decade, during a pandemic-related spike in crime that finally began to decrease last year.\n\nTrump has cited the 2023 spike as evidence that federal intervention is needed. Troops began arriving in DC on Tuesday morning. More than 800 National Guard agents have been deployed.\n\nSome have criticized the move as being for show. Others, like Scarborough, have claimed it was a long time coming. \n\nCurrently, DC's murder rate is high - seventh in the nation when looking at cities with 250,000 or more citizens. \n\nShoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, moreover, have persisted since the pandemic. \n\nEarlier in the week, Scarborough chided local officials for what he framed as lax sentencing laws that have allowed local judges to me more lenient with younger criminals.\n\n'If city council members continue to do things that undermine the security of, of the streets and of the communities and the places, not only where tourists go, where people have to go to work day in and day out,' he argued Monday. \n\n'Then yeah - we need the federal government to be far more involved in the nation’s capital. This is not Nebraska.'\n\n'This is the nation’s capital,' he asserted, hours after Trump ordered an increased presence of law enforcement.","summary":"Scarborough, 62, had claimed the municipality has serious crime problems, and that Trump's decision was the right one to make.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14997343/morning-joe-Symone-Sanders-Townsend-black-woman-dc.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/13/17/101191951-0-image-a-66_1755104219290.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/12/1751579238820302541/1024x576_MP4_1751579238820302541.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-13 20:32:43","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":350825884,"title":"Taylor Swift's latest conversation with Brittany Mahomes revealed by Patrick","text":"Patrick Mahomes gave an inside look into his family's interactions with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce at Chiefs practice on Wednesday.

The Kelce brothers gave fans a hint earlier Monday morning after posting their podcast would return from hiatus early for a \"VERY\" special guest. Only the guest's silhouette was shown at the time, but fans immediately guessed, correctly, it was Swift. TOM BRADY BURNS JETS FANS ONCE MORE DURING STATUE CEREMONY Swift's appearance on \"New Heights\" will mark the first time the pop star has given an interview since she was named Time's Person of the Year in 2023 and following the completion of her \"Eras Tour.\" Meanwhile, Brittany and Swift have formed a friendship in recent years since Swift began dating Patrick's teammate, Travis Kelce, in 2023. Throughout that season, the Chiefs' WAGs were spotted in suites together at several Chiefs games, and it was not uncommon to see them hanging out outside of games with their significant others. However, the two appeared to support different candidates in the 2024 presidential election. Mahomes liked a post from Donald Trump on Instagram and wrote several messages regarding her critics, while Swift openly endorsed Kamala Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The duo made headlines at the Chiefs' first game against the Ravens when they sat in separate suites to open the season. The two sat separately after Brittany incited backlash for publicly liking a post by Trump on Instagram. Swift fan groups on social media were partially responsible for circulating screenshots of Brittany's like of Trump's post. Trump even weighed in on the controversy after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Sept. 10. In an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" the next day, Trump said he liked Brittany \"much better\" than Swift. However, Swift and Brittany continued to occasionally make public appearances together throughout last season, and Brittany even congratulated Swift on winning back ownership of her music in May.

This means every congressional district with a foreign-born population exceeding 15.5 percent has a 90 percent chance of electing Democrats and only a 10 percent chance of electing Republicans.\n\nThe Washington Post, the New York Times, the Atlantic, Axios, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all admitted that rapid demographic shifts spurred by mass immigration are tilting the nation toward a permanent Democrat political majority.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Why?","text":"It’s a tough time to be a Democrat.\n\nThe party is locked out of power in Washington, largely relegated to the sidelines as President Donald Trump pursues his sweeping agenda. Republicans are trying to redraw congressional maps in Texas and other states, adding potential hurdles to Democrats’ efforts to take back the House in 2026.\n\nThen there are the polls.\n\nDespite the fact that Mr. Trump’s approval rating has fallen to its lowest point since Inauguration Day, Democrats are facing historically ugly numbers of their own. Poll after poll has shown them to be underwater, with higher unfavorable ratings than favorable ones. In four July surveys, Democrats were between 26 and 30 percentage points underwater, hitting levels of unpopularity not seen in decades. In the long-running Gallup survey, the Democratic Party’s approval rating hit 34%, the lowest ever recorded by the polling firm.\n\nOne subgroup driving the Democrats’ poor ratings: their own base. A recent CNN poll found that Democratic voters currently hold far more negative views of their own party than Republican voters do of theirs. At town hall events and in focus groups, frustrated Democrats say they want their representatives to push back harder against the Trump administration. But congressional Democrats have few tools to do so, especially as the courts have allowed Mr. Trump to keep expanding presidential power.\n\n“Outside of banging your fist on a table, there aren’t many mechanisms on the federal side for Democrats to step up and stop the president,” says Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist. “That’s what’s really driving this sense of despair and hopelessness coming from the base. They want Democrats to do something about it, but they can’t.”\n\nDemocratic politicians eyeing potential 2028 presidential runs have tried to break the despair cycle with marathon speeches, social media tit for tat, and stunts such as hosting Texas legislators who fled the state in their attempt to block Republican gerrymandering efforts.\n\nBut the party remains without a clear leader. Complicating the messaging challenge, its base has moved left since Mr. Trump’s first term, with more Democrats self-identifying as liberals, even as the party grapples with an urgent need to woo independent voters who helped Mr. Trump win all seven swing states last November.\n\nDemocratic operatives admit the base’s frustration is cause for concern, particularly if it depresses turnout. But some also see it as fuel for much-needed change. For Democrats to be successful in 2026 and 2028, they can’t keep doing things the same way, they say. And Democrats will have to start by showing they can respond to disgruntled voters – both far-left and moderate – who are increasingly unhappy with politics as usual.\n\n“This is an opportunity,” says Jennifer Hilsbos, chair of the Pinal County Democrats in Arizona. “We like to talk and explain things, but we don’t spend enough time listening. No one was sitting down at kitchen tables last year and listening to voters say what they needed from us.”\n\nMs. Hilsbos, who was elected chair a few months after Mr. Trump took back Arizona on his romp to the White House last fall, has been spending three to five hours in a public place every week, so voters can come talk to her. She says she wants to show them her party can “focus on more than just the ‘isms,’” such as racism or feminism. In her increasingly red county outside Phoenix, that means more conversations about immigration.\n\n“We have recognized there is a problem,” says Ms. Hilsbos, “and now we’re trying to address it.”\n\nYoung Democrats taking on incumbents\n\nFor many, fixing the party’s problems will require not just fresh thinking – but fresh faces. A slate of younger Democrats have already launched primary challenges against longtime congressional incumbents ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats’ rock-bottom polling “has been a long time coming,” says Harry Jarin, a Democrat running in Maryland against Rep. Steny Hoyer, a former House majority leader who has been in Congress for more than four decades. Voters have become disillusioned with the party, says Mr. Jarin, because veteran Democrats like Mr. Hoyer haven’t solved problems that matter to them, such as a lack of affordable housing. Worse, he adds, many voters don’t know what the party stands for.\n\n“You could have gone to any polling booth in America on Election Day last year and the average voter [knew] what Donald Trump’s plan for the future was,” says Mr. Jarin. “I’m not sure you could have said the same about [Kamala] Harris or the Democratic Party.”\n\nMr. Jarin has seen that play out within his volunteer firefighting department. When he joined 12 years ago, the firehouse was split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Now, he says, the entire department is “100 percent MAGA Republican” except for him and one woman.\n\nGeorge Hornedo has seen a similar drop in support for Democrats in Indianapolis, where 2024 voter turnout was the lowest in two decades. Mr. Hornedo, a Democratic strategist, has launched a primary challenge against Rep. André Carson, a nine-term congressman representing one of Indiana’s two Democratic House districts. He says Democrats need to rebuild their state parties.\n\n“Too often, we bring spoons to a knife fight when Republicans bring a machete,” says Mr. Hornedo. “I may not like what the Republicans are doing, but we can’t say they aren’t thinking out of the box.”\n\nWhen a recent Associated Press poll asked Democratic voters to describe their party, fewer than one-quarter offered positive adjectives. The most common descriptors were “weak” and “tepid.”\n\nFrustrated – but still motivated to vote\n\nStill, just because voters are frustrated with their party’s representatives doesn’t mean they’ll vote for the other side. In polls where Democratic voters have given their own party poor marks, they also have given Democrats an edge in voting preferences.\n\nAnd, right now, Democrats appear more motivated to vote than Republicans. In the CNN poll from July, 74% of Democratic voters called themselves “extremely motivated” to vote in next year’s congressional elections, while only 54% of Republican voters said the same. If the election were held today, 46% of voters in a recent Wall Street Journal poll said they would vote for a Democratic candidate, compared with 43% who said they would vote for a Republican.\n\nIt’s not as clear an advantage at this point as it was in 2017, ahead of 2018’s “blue wave.” But Democrats have led Republicans in YouGov’s poll of a generic congressional ballot – where respondents are asked to pick between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican – for the past six months. And the Democratic Party surpassed the Republican Party in voter identification in the first half of 2025, according to Gallup, after the GOP had led through most of 2024.\n\n“At the end of the day, elections are binary choices,” says DJ Koessler, a Democratic strategist who worked on Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign. Democratic voters might be frustrated with their own party, but their antipathy toward Mr. Trump’s GOP could be strong enough to make up for it.\n\nMr. Koessler expects Democrats’ poll numbers to improve as the midterm elections get closer and actual candidates are campaigning against Mr. Trump’s agenda – including his “Big Beautiful Bill,” which remains widely unpopular. To effectively convey their message, he and others add, Democrats will need to build a new media ecosystem through social media and podcasts, as Republicans have done.\n\n“All this chaos is going to give us the opportunity to rebuild,” says Mr. Hornedo. “Do we rebuild back to what we have which wasn’t sufficient? Or do we have the imagination to think about what can be?”","summary":"Frustrated Democratic voters describe their party as “weak” and “tepid.” As Democrats try to regain their footing ahead of next year’s midterm elections, some call for fresh faces and fresh thinking.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/0813/democrats-polls-unpopularity-midterms?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/08/0813%20NDEMS%20aoc%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_1200x800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 19:00:08","author":"Story Hinckley","authors":["Story Hinckley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":350820762,"title":"'Hercules' Star Turned Trump Looney Kevin Sorbo Fumes Over Male On Football Team's Cheerleading Squad and Threatens to End Fandom — As 'Has Been' Actor Mocked Over 'Fragile' Stance","text":"Kevin Sorbo has found another way to cling to relevancy, this time raging over a man on an NFL team's cheerleading squad, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe 66-year-old, best known for his role on the TV series Hercules, took to X to complain and even threatened to find a new team to root for.Sorbo Ripped For Being 'Fragile'On Tuesday, August 12, Sorbo took to X to post a video of a male dancing in a cheerleading uniform while holding pom poms.

Lawless would hit back, claiming Sorbo has only stuck up for one Black person: suspected killer O.J. Simpson.\n\nShe claimed at the time: \"The NZ summer, Feb 1995, when my character, Xena, was introduced into my husband's show, 'Hercules the Legendary Journeys.' \n\n\"We actors were sitting around, and I brought up a news item. I said, 'Guys, did you guys hear about that woman and her friend who were brutally murdered in LA? I think maybe the footballer did it!'\"\"And Peanut [Sorbo] growled: 'Hey! I knew Nicole [Brown Simpson], and let me tell you… she was no picnic!' BOOM,\" Lawless added.\n\nLawless reportedly said Nicole \"didn’t deserve to be stabbed to death.\" To which, Sorbo is accused of responding, \"I'm just saying, she was a piece of work.\" \n\n\"It stuck in my mind because those Americanisms were unusual to us. But we knew what he meant,\" Lawless recalled.\n\nDespite his shocking comments throughout the last couple of years, Sorbo thinks he will be welcomed back into Hollywood, even while being the \"first canceled victim,\" all thanks to President Trump.\"Well, I'm the first cancel culture victim before I knew it was a term,\" the deluded Sorbo said during an interview with Fox News Digital. \n\n\"Hollywood booted me up a dozen years ago for things I was posting on the internet.

Because they hate the truth, and they hate anybody who's a Christian in Hollywood, anybody who is a conservative.\" \n\n\"So I'm like a double leper to them. I'm, like, kryptonite or something,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Sorbo thinks things are changing.He explained: \"I think people are tired of it, and Hollywood's tired of losing money, like they're going to lose another $300million on this woke Disney movie with Snow White.\n\n\"I think the American people are fed up, and I think they showed it in the last election as well.

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is recycling the “democracy in danger” declaration as he opposes Senate Republican appropriations efforts. \n\nMurphy, who is the Democratic Deputy Conference Secretary in the Senate, explained that in his view working with Senate Republicans to fund the government through appropriations bills was “putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of [Trump’s] campaign to destroy our democracy.” \n\nAs Politico recently reported, Murphy has in the past few weeks come out against every spending measure that has been moved forward during the Senate Appropriations Committee markups when he was present in the process. He also voted against the Senate’s stopgap funding bill in March, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. was criticized by some Democrats for allowing to become law. \n\nThe strident opposition to the GOP agenda coupled with media appearances, including on a notable social conservative’s podcast, has prompted prognostication that the Connecticut senator may be setting himself up for a future presidential run. As such Murphy’s rhetoric is a potential bellwether for whether Democrats will continue to discuss American democracy’s state in such bleak terms.\n\nDemocracy in danger rhetoric was a mainstay during the final months of last year’s presidential race with then-President Joe Biden declaring at the Democratic National Convention, “We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024.” 2024 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris had urged voters to imagine “Donald Trump with no guardrails.” But those arguments fell flat to the extent that Trump managed to surge not only an electoral college win from all seven swing states, but also a plurality of the popular vote. Trump’s popular vote victory was the first time the Republicans managed such a feat since 2004.\n\nBut the talking point has not abated with Trump’s decisive victory. In a recent interview with Stephen Colbert, Harris said, “I always believed that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles, and I think right now that they’re not as strong as they need to be.” \n\nSuch rhetoric has been a part of the discourse around the president and his supporters for about ten years at this point. \n\nOne of the most notable proponents of the line about democracy in peril was none other than former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a July 2016 speech given in Springfield, Illinois, Clinton said, “This man [Trump] is the nominee of the party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the party of Trump, and that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy, it is a threat to it.” \n\nThe mainstream media has also taken to portraying the president and his supporters as opponents to the American system of government. “Trump’s triumph threatens an already battered democracy, experts say,” ran one headline from the Washington Post published a day after the president won reelection in 2024. That paper had previously unveiled the slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness” in February 2017 as Trump was beginning his first term. “Capitalizing on Democrats’ weakness, President Trump is winning his battle to undermine democracy in this country,” begins a recent opinion article in the New York Times.\n\nFor now, Murphy’s dogged approach to appropriations is getting a decidedly lukewarm reception from Democrat colleagues.\n\n“He has the right to his opinion, and I just have the opinion that the more we can do to get bills done, the better chance we have of getting better things for our country.” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash, the Senate Appropriations Committee vice chair, remarked. \n\n“I’m not his spokesperson, so all I can say is: We’ve been demanding a bipartisan process. So when there’s a step in that direction, I think it’s our obligation to try to be constructive,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii., commented.","summary":"Sen.

Her fans expect that the episode itself could shatter podcast records and said they hope the producers have “backup servers to handle the traffic.”\n\nIn anticipation of the episode, multiple news and entertainment outlets, from the Associated Press to People magazine, have published stories to let the public know how they can listen or watch Swift on the podcast — as if her appearance is of significant national importance, like the Super Bowl or Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSpeaking of Trump, the fact that there’s been so much frenzy around Swift going on a podcast seems to counter his declaration in May that she’s “no longer hot,” as Billboard reported. On Truth Social on May 16, Trump raged: “Has noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?'”\n\nTrump could have been talking about Swift’s looks, although he revealed in an interview, published in a June 2024 book, that he found her to be “unusually beautiful” — even if she’s “liberal,” Billboard also reported.\n\nIn terms of Swiftness being “hot,” Trump was most likely talking about her as a force in national culture. And he changed his tune about her appeal in September 2024 after the “Reputation” singer endorsed Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival in the 2024 election. Swift’s highly anticipated endorsement of the vice president came shortly after Trump and Harris finished their one and only debate.\n\nIn her Instagram post, which received more than 11.5 million likes, Swift said, “I’m voting for @kamalaharrisbecause she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”\n\nSwift also took issue with Trump earlier using AI images of her to portray her as a MAGA supporter. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” Swift said.\n\nIn response, Trump said: “I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time … She’s a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Several days later, Trump posted an all-caps declaration on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”\n\nTrump got to gloat after he and Swift attended the 2025 Super Bowl, and Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. At one point, some people in the crowd booed when Swift’s face appeared on the giant screens at the stadium. Trump used the boos to contend that Swift’s cultural influence was on the wane because she didn’t endorse him.\n\n“The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nSince Swift announced her new album in a clip promoting the “New Heights” episode, her fans have speculated that her new album might contain diss tracks about Trump, according to the Daily Mail. TMZ also said she could write about the reported end of her friendship with Blake Lively, from whom she reportedly became estranged after Lively dragged her into Lively’s messy legal battle against Justin Baldoni.\n\nOverall, little is known about Swift’s appearance on the podcast. In one of the clips, she told the Kelce brothers she wanted to show them something, revealing a mint-green briefcase that featured her initials in orange. She then pulled out a vinyl record with a blurred cover.\n\n“This is my brand new album, ‘The Life of a Showgirl,’” she shared.\n\nIn another teaser, Swift took a playful swipe at “male sports fans.” She said to the Kelce brothers: “As we all know, you guys have a lot of male sports fans that listen to your podcast. I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens — it’s more of me.”\n\nSwift’s joke played off the backlash she has received from football fans for being shown too many times on TV screens during games. This same clip also had Jason Kelce jubilantly introducing Swift by shouting out many accomplishments, which could again counter Trump’s view that she’s no longer a cultural force.\n\n“She is the most awarded artist in the history of the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, and I Heart Radio Music Awards,” Jason Kelce declared. “Fourteen Grammy Awards, and is the only artist in the history of the awards to win album of the year four times. Last December, she wrapped up (her) Eras Tour, which spanned 149 shows across 51 cities, five continents. It was the most attended tour of all time. Her last album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ set a record with 1.76 billion streams within the first week alone.”\n\nMeanwhile, Swift’s episode of the “New Heights” podcast premieres 7 p.m Pacific time. It will be available to stream in full on YouTube. Fans who would prefer to listen to the show, instead, can do so via most podcast-streaming platforms: Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Audible, Spotify and Wondery, which produces the show.","summary":"All the social media frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift's new album and appearance on Travis Kelce's 'New Heights' podcast Wednesday seems to counter Trump's declaration in May that she's 'no longer hot.'","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/13/taylor-swift-on-new-heights/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ENTER-MUS-SWIFT-KELCE-GET.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 18:06:15","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":350814932,"title":"Laura Loomer sets her sights on her next target to get the boot from the Trump administration","text":"After playing an outsized role in pushing out roughly a dozen Trump administration officials for supposedly showing insufficient allegiance to the president, far-right extremist and self-appointed MAGA “loyalty” enforcer Laura Loomer is now setting her sights on a new target.\n\nIn an interview with Politico Playbook this week, Loomer said she is taking aim at Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his senior counselor Stefanie Spear over concerns that Kennedy is eyeing a 2028 presidential run. \n\nLoomer, who says she is running a tipline to purge “disloyal” members from the administration, told Politico that while she is realistic about the unlikeliness of her running Kennedy out of Washington, she does feel she can knock out some of his deputies – with Spear being front and center on her list.\n\n“I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK, but I will say that … there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at HHS,” Loomer said.\n\nSpear, who served as the principal communications adviser on Kennedy’s long-shot 2024 presidential campaign, is now one of his closest aides at HHS and apparently tightly controls access to the secretary.\n\nAccording to Politico, even before Loomer began targeting her, Spear had begun to run members of the Trump administration the wrong way and had “been a thorn in their side for months,” with many expressing concern about her influence on Kennedy. However, for Loomer, the main issue is that Spear is apparently steering the 71-year-old MAHA leader towards another presidential run. \n\n“I think that there’s a clear intention by Stefanie Spear to utilize her position to try to lay the groundwork for a 2028 RFK presidential run,” Loomer claimed, adding that she knew this through “sources in HHS.”\n\nWhile Spear did not respond to Politico’s story, a senior HHS leader did not deny that Kennedy is indeed weighing a presidential bid. A Trump administration official also said they “would not be surprised if [Kennedy is] thinking about” running again, even though they “don’t think anyone thinks it’s a real threat.”\n\nWith the 79-year-old president constitutionally ineligible to run in 2028, though he has repeatedly quipped about campaigning for a third term, Trump has suggested that Vice President JD Vance will be the MAGA movement’s heir apparent – though he has yet to officially crown Vance as his successor.\n\nIn response to Loomer’s campaign against Spear and Kennedy, HHS acting chief of staff Matt Buckham said Kennedy and his staff “are laser-focused on delivering President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again” while ignoring “Beltway gossip” and political speculation.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy and the entire HHS team are doing a terrific job as they deliver on President Trump’s mandate to Make America Healthy Again,” a White House official told Politico. “Scores of prominent restaurant chains and food brands dropping artificial ingredients from our food supply and historic reforms at the FDA to fast track lifesaving drugs and treatments prove that the entire HHS team is delivering for the American people.”\n\nSpear helped kickstart speculation about a Kennedy 2028 run last month when she joined an organizing call for MAHA supporters and influencers that Kennedy’s super PAC co-hosted, Axios reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has long been in Loomer’s crosshairs. Despite his vaccine skepticism and embrace of conspiracy theories, which generally align with Loomer’s worldview, she has labeled Kennedy a “Marxist” and “very problematic person.” Also, after Loomer successfully launched a campaign to oust FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad for being a “progressive leftist saboteur” last month, the agency brought him back two weeks later as its top vaccine regulator.\n\nBesides taking issue with Spear supposedly prepping a Kennedy presidential run, Loomer is also lobbing allegations of disloyalty at the HHS aide.\n\n“There’s been some things that have happened,” Loomer cryptically said. “There’s been several things that have happened at HHS that are contradictory to the initial promises made.”\n\nOutside of her role as “Trump’s Rasputin,” which has prompted the president’s inner circle to grow tired of her influence, the “proud Islamophobe” has also been busy with her defamation lawsuit against HBO late-night host Bill Maher for joking that she “might be” sleeping with Trump.\n\nIn an off-the-rails deposition with HBO lawyer Katherine Bolger late last month, Loomer not only claimed that she lost out on a White House job because of Maher’s quip but also repeatedly tried to avoid admitting that she made her own wild accusations about prominent figures.\n\nAt one point, after Loomer refused to explain what she meant when she tweeted an especially gross allegation about Kamala Harris, Bolger apparently had enough. “God, you’re a coward,” the attorney said. “You’re a coward, you won’t even admit to what you did.”","summary":"‘I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK, but I will say that … there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at HHS,’ Laura Loomer said this week.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-rfk-hhs-stefanie-spear-b2807088.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/12/15/newFile-11.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ycDaAiU0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-13 17:36:26","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":350767986,"title":"Patrick Mahomes reveals what Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce did immediately after recording New Heights show","text":"Patrick Mahomes is a true Swiftie. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is just as excited as the rest of the world for Taylor Swift's debut appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason's New Heights podcast.\n\nThe pop sensation is set to make her long-awaited guest appearance on the hit show in a special episode Wednesday night to unveil her 12th studio album: The Life of a Showgirl. \n\nAnd while Mahomes, Travis's Kansas City teammate and close friend, is eagerly awaiting the release, he admitted that he got a little heads-up. \n\nThe three-time Super Bowl winner revealed that he was the NFL's power couple's immediate port of call after wrapping up the recording. Or rather, his wife was. \n\n'It surprised me too,' he said when asked about the special episode. 'I mean I knew before y'all did just because they called me after the podcast was done.'\n\n'They didn't call me, they called Brittany. I was in the back of the FaceTime,' he added, hilariously self-correcting. \n\nThe Mahomeses have struck up a close bond with Travis and Taylor since the pop sensation began dating the tight end two years ago. The two couples have frequently spent time during the offseason together and even dined out in New Orleans before February's Super Bowl. \n\n'I'm obviously super excited,' Mahomes continued. 'Just knowing Taylor and seeing the process from just a little bit closer of how she makes the albums, it's going to be amazing because of how much work she puts into it.\n\n'What better place to announce it than New Heights podcast, where I feel like she can be herself and showcase who she is. I think people are going to be really excited to watch it tonight. I haven't seen it yet, just little clips of it. But I'll be tuning in tonight just like everybody else. I'll be able to have something to watch on this night off that I have here.'\n\nThe signal caller already considered Travis to be a close friend, however his wife Brittany warmly welcomed the singer into the NFL world with open arms. \n\nThroughout Taylor's first season as a Chiefs WAG, the duo were frequently spotted cheering on their NFL beaus from a luxury suite at Arrowhead Stadium, even preparing a special handshake to celebrate touchdowns. \n\nHowever, there was speculation that their political differences may have triggered a rift between the close friends last summer. \n\nBrittany sparked a meltdown when she was spotted liking a social media post endorsing Donald Trump ahead of the presidential election. Taylor, meanwhile, made her own stance clear when she shared a statement on Instagram publicly endorsing Trump's rival for the White House, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe two WAGs were not seen together as games as frequently last season, sparking speculation that they had drifted apart. However, that doesn't appear to be true with the two couples seemingly as close as ever. \n\nChiefs head coach Andy Reid shared Mahomes's enthusiasm as he gushed over Travis and Taylor's romance. \n\n'Listen, I'm like really old. My grandkids will be all over it,' the 67-year-old told reported Wednesday when asked if he'll be tuning into the podcast.\n\n'I'm happy for them,' he added of the A-List couple. 'Both of them care about each and what a plus that is. The older you get, you want these guys to have someone they can settle down with. I think it's a neat deal for both of them.","summary":"The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is just as excited as the rest of the world for Taylor Swift's debut appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason's New Heights podcast.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14997485/Patrick-Mahomes-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-new-heights-recording.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/13/17/101191367-0-image-m-15_1755102059530.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 16:24:43","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":350758132,"title":"US presidents have always used transactional foreign policy – but Trump does it differently","text":"The US president, Donald Trump, watched on recently as the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands in the White House. They had just signed what Trump called a “peace deal” to end nearly four decades of conflict. \n\nThe deal grants the US exclusive rights to develop a transit corridor through southern Armenia, linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan. The White House says the corridor will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity. \n\nTrump has positioned the US as the guarantor of security in the South Caucasus, packaging this as a commercial opportunity for American companies. This exemplifies what researchers call transactional foreign policy, a strategy that offers rewards or threatens costs to get others to act rather than persuading them through shared values.\n\nUS presidents have long mixed economic incentives with diplomacy. But Trump’s approach represents something very different. It’s a foreign policy that operates outside institutional constraints and targets democratic allies. It exploits American power for personal gain in ways no previous president has attempted.\n\nUS presidents have commonly used transactional approaches in their foreign policy. In the early 20th century, Theodore Roosevelt promised to protect Latin American governments from internal rebels and external European intervention to ensure debt payments to American bankers. \n\nThis sometimes required the US military to take control of customhouses, as happened in Dominican Republic in 1905 and Cuba in 1906. Presidents Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge ordered similar military interventions in Nicaragua in 1911, Honduras in 1911 and 1912, Haiti in 1915 and Panama in 1926. \n\nIn the mid-20th century, presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy innovated foreign aid policy in an attempt to dampen the appeal of communism. They did so specifically through land reform policies. \n\nAmerican officials viewed rural poverty in developing countries as fertile ground for communist recruitment during the cold war. So US aid was used to promote food price stabilisation and facilitate land distribution. \n\nAround the same time, Dwight Eisenhower applied financial pressure on the UK during the 1956 Suez crisis. Britain and France, coordinating with Israel, invaded Egypt to retake the critical Suez Canal waterway after it was nationalised. The US blocked British access to financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to force the withdrawal of its troops.\n\nMore recently, Barack Obama’s 2015 Iran nuclear deal bundled sanctions relief with nuclear limits. And Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, coupled export controls with subsidies and tax credits to pull allies into a shared tech-security posture. As a result, Japan and the Netherlands limited the sale of semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nThe Armenia-Azerbaijan peace negotiations also began under the Biden administration. It is not hard to imagine that a similar deal, without the Trump branding, would have occurred under a Kamala Harris presidency.\n\nTrump’s undemocratic approach\n\nWhile a transactional approach isn’t unique in American foreign policy, Trump’s strategy marks a shift. Particularly in his second term, it resembles that of a typical authoritarian leader. Trump is carrying out his approach with minimal congressional or judicial constraint, with policies shaped by personal whims rather than institutional consistency.\n\nThis manifests in four key ways. First, Trump operates outside international and domestic legal frameworks. His tariff policies, for example, probably violate international and US domestic laws. \n\nSecond, Trump systematically targets democratic allies while embracing authoritarian partners. The US has had strained relationships with its allies before. But there has never been this level of animosity towards them. Trump has threatened to annexe Canada, while praising authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Viktor Orbán and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nThird, Trump prioritises domestic political enemies over traditional foreign adversaries. He has gutted institutions that he views as politically hostile like the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) and the State Department. He has even deployed federal forces in US cities under dubious legal reasoning.\n\nAnd fourth, Trump exploits American foreign policy for personal gain in ways no previous US president has attempted. He receives more gifts from foreign governments, including a US$400 million (£295 million) Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar. The jet was expected to serve as Air Force One during his presidency, but was transferred to Trump’s presidential library foundation. \n\nTrump’s own company, the Trump Organization, has also signed deals to build luxury towers in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. And Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner secured US$2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund just six months after leaving the White House. Kushner has denied the investment represented a conflict of interest.\n\nAuthoritarian approaches lead to authoritarian outcomes. Research consistently shows that authoritarian systems produce weaker alliances, underinvestment in public goods and non-credible promises. \n\nThey also decrease state capacity as professional institutions are hollowed out in favour of personal loyalty networks. Trump’s weakening of career diplomatic services and development agencies sacrifices institutional competence for direct presidential control. This undermines the very capabilities needed to implement international agreements effectively.\n\nTrump’s style further encourages flattery over mutual interests. The naming of the Armenian transit corridor mirrors earlier examples: Poland’s 2018 proposal for a US military base named “Fort Trump”, foreign nominations for a Nobel peace prize and overt flattery at diplomatic meetings. These are all designed to sway a leader with personal praise rather than emphasising American interests.\n\nPrevious US presidents usually embedded transactional bargains within larger institutional projects such as Nato, the IMF, non-proliferation regimes or the liberal trade system. While those arrangements disproportionately benefited the US, they also produced global gains. \n\nTrump’s deals may yield benefit. The Armenia-Azerbaijan peace agreement, for instance, could reduce the risk of conflict and unlock trade in the South Caucasus. But his approach represents a fundamentally different kind of American leadership – one that is undemocratic.","summary":"US presidents have long mixed economic incentives with diplomacy, but Trump’s approach represents something very different.","url":"https://theconversation.com/us-presidents-have-always-used-transactional-foreign-policy-but-trump-does-it-differently-262920","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685282/original/file-20250813-66-lxltc3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 16:05:01","author":"Patrick E.

PBS PRESIDENT DECLARES SHE 'CAN’T MAKE ANY SENSE' OF ACCUSATIONS OF LEFT-WING BIAS \"Just like its investigations into ABC News’ slanted 2024 debate moderation and CBS News’ hidden 60 Minutes interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the FCC should investigate whether Arizona PBS violated its duty to act in the public interest when it engaged in viewpoint discrimination against a candidate for governor,\" he said. In 2022, during the Arizona gubernatorial race between Democrat Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake, Hobbs declined an invitation to debate Lake. Hobbs and Lake did participate in a town hall-style event where each candidate was questioned separately during a forum hosted by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, but Hobbs subsequently refused to debate her opponent. She cited concerns that a debate with Lake would become similar to the Republican primary debate, and would support erroneous claims that the 2020 election was rigged. Lake, a former TV news anchor, had also expressed fears that Democrats would cheat in the 2022 election. The Arizona PBS station gave Hobbs what Petersen called \"an unprecedented 30-minute interview\" but Lake’s solo interview with the outlet, set for Oct. 12, 2022, was canceled hours before it was set to begin. PBS STATION SINGLES OUT GOP SENATORS IN CONTENTIOUS PUBLIC BROADCASTING FUNDING BATTLE AZ Central reported that \"The Arizona Citizens Clean Election Commission backed out of the event that was to be hosted in partnership with Arizona PBS (KAET) after the television station agreed to a separate, similar interview with Democrat Katie Hobbs.\" Petersen alleged that the day after Arizona State University’s president \"questioned the long-standing tradition that would have provided Kari Lake with a solo interview because of her positions on election integrity, university officials internally predicted that Hobbs would win the election.\" The letter quotes emails between Arizona State’s Media Enterprise head, Mi-Ai Parrish, who said, \"Katie is getting roasted hard, but I don’t think it will matter,\" and a response from the university president’s chief of staff, which said, \"I don’t think it matters either.\" In his letter, Petersen said that it took Arizona State University \"more than two years—743 days—to produce the internal emails exposing these partisan conversations.\" \"Based on the emails between top university officials, Arizona PBS made broadcast decisions based on how it viewed Kari Lake’s positions on election integrity and Katie Hobbs’ electoral prospects,\" Petersen wrote. \"Arizona PBS did not act in the public interest because it exhibited ‘broadcaster favoritism’ for Hobbs and acted ‘in a partisan, discriminatory fashion’ that was ‘designed to serve the political advantage of a candidate,’\" he added. The Arizona state senate president is asking the FCC to investigate KAET for \"PBS’ blatant viewpoint discrimination against Kari Lake and partisan calculations designed to benefit Katie Hobbs,\" and the revocation of their license. ARIZONA ICED TEA'S 99-CENT PRICE MAY FINALLY END AFTER 30 YEARS — TARIFFS COULD BE TO BLAME Fox News Digital reached out to the Arizona PBS station and Arizona State University for comment. Arizona State University directed Fox News Digital to this webpage addressing Arizona PBS, which said, in part, \"As one method of delivering information on candidates, Arizona PBS had an arrangement with Arizona Clean Elections Commission to host and broadcast debates among candidates for state offices. While the Clean Elections Commission was the producer of the debate, Arizona PBS continued to maintain its responsibilities under its license and to its viewers by providing coverage of the elections separate from and in addition to the debates. Debates are not the sole mechanism for informing the public about elections.\" It added that, \"In 2022, one of the planned debates was for the office of Governor of Arizona between Republican nominee Kari Lake and Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs. When Hobbs decided not to debate Lake, the Clean Election Commission’s plan to proceed with a one-party debate conflicted with Arizona PBS’s licensing requirements.
