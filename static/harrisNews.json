Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) stunning announcement that she will resign from Congress — with longtime Trump ally Laura Loomer branding her as an “evil, parasitic woman.”\n\nLoomer piled on after President Trump initially slammed Greene in an early morning post labeling her “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown.”\n\n“President Trump is basically calling Marjorie Traitor Greene a stage 5 clinger,” Loomer posted on X. \n\nGreene’s congressional pension becomes vested Jan. 3, two days before her announced resignation date and five years after she took office, Loomer pointed out. \n\nShe also slammed Greene as an “evil, parasitic woman who smeared me and lied about me for years,” adding, “I wish her the worst.”\n\nLefty “Squad” member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasted no time in also piling on Greene over the pension issue.\n\n“She’s carefully timing her departure just 1-2 days after her pension kicks in,” the Bronx rep posted on Instagram.\n\nAfter initially slamming Greene in an early Saturday Truth Social post which read in part, “Marjorie went BAD,” the president appeared to soften his stance.\n\nAsked by a reporter at the White House later in the day if he would forgive Greene, Trump replied: “Forgive for what? I just disagreed with her philosophy.”\n\nThen he talked up her political career in a brief interview with NBC.\n\n “It’s not going to be easy for her” to bring back her career in politics, he said. “I’d love to see that.”\n\nTrump also advised that “she’s got to take a little rest.”\n\nLoomer and Greene clashed last year after Loomer, a conspiracy theorist who traveled with Trump during the campaign, attacked then-VP Kamala Harris. \n\nShe said if Harris won “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Greene, who has called Loomer a “liar,” called the comment “extremely racist.”\n\nGreene’s departure makes House Speaker Mike Johnson’s already narrow six-vote majority even tighter.\n\nWithout Greene, there will be a lively primary in a district outside of Atlanta speckled with mid-sized cities including Rome, Georgia, a state operative said.\n\nGeorgia holds its regular primary election in May. Gov. Brian Kemp (R-Ga.) must decide whether to hold an earlier special election, possibly in March, to fill Greene’s seat.\n\nFor years, Greene had been one of Trump’s most vocal defenders. But in recent weeks, she broke with the president on the Jeffrey Epstein files, the government shutdown and rising prices.\n\nPolitical operatives have speculated Greene could run for the governorship, the Senate — where Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) is seeking reelection — or even the White House, or continue her recent run of headline-making TV appearances.\n\n“When the common American people finally realize and understand that the political industrial complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country,” she said in her resignation video, “and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, the people, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.”","summary":"Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) stunning announcement Friday that she will resign from Congress sets up a political battle in her deep red district, and leaves her free to plot a new independent course outside or alongside MAGA.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/22/us-news/trump-calls-traitor-marjorie-taylor-greene-a-nice-person-as-longtime-rival-laura-loomer-flames-clinger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/u-s-president-donald-trump-116031789_221de1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wR5Lj2BB-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-22 22:02:11","author":"Geoff Earle","authors":["Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":381650720,"title":"Five Reasons Donald Trump Fell For Zohran Mamdani","text":"Sure, we know Mamdani is charming, but so is Barack Obama, another leader Trump has spent friendly-seeming time with, even as he falsely accuses Obama of treason. So it's got to be more than Mamdani's charisma. Here, we offer up five theories to explain what Vanity Fair's Aidan McLaughlin described as a “lovefest.”\nTrump is powerless in the presence of a beard\nName the powerful bearded politician who made these comments about Donald Trump:\n\n“Trump is a cynical asshole … he’s America’s Hitler.”\n“I don’t think he actually cares about folks.”\n”He’s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\n\nTed Cruz? No, I said “powerful.” It's Vice-Presdent J.D. Vance! Before Friday, the only things Vance and Mamdani had in common were a track record of Trump opposition and a beard. After Friday, they could add Trump's glowing praise to the list of commonalities. Fox News host Brian Kilmeade might be on a similar track as I am, saying “I think J.D. Vance is jealous\" as he discussed Friday's event.\nTrump watched Heat Thursday night\nEveryone agrees that the coffee shop meeting between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters is the most indelible scene in Michael Mann's classic 1995 film Heat. Nemeses in the same room, the grudging respect between hero and villain, the growing understanding that the opposites are far more alike than they realized…it's one of the world's most compelling narratives, from Batman and the Joker to the horseshoe theory.\nMamdani looked in Trump's left eye\nAccording to the New York Post, which appears to be where most of Middle America gets their Zohran Mamdani news, MIT prof Tara Swart says that mothers and their babies bond using right eye to left eye contact. “Most people are right-handed so they’ll be holding their baby in their left arm, so they can use their dominant hand to do stuff,\" she says. “That means when you gaze at your baby, your right eye is looking at their left and then that interaction from the optic nerve is going around the brain.” According to Swart, that eye contact creates an “emotional resonance loop that’s part of how the mother and baby bond.” So, if we assume that Trump was able to keep his eyes open during the private meeting he had with Mamdani prior to the press event, Mamdani might have been able to provide the president with enough maternal good vibes to briefly counteract Trump's awful-sounding upbringing by Fred Trump.\nSome Mamdani-loving billionaire got on the horn\nLong branded a horrific hellhole by Fox News, San Francisco has been bracing for Trump to deploy the National Guard to the famously liberal town since he started rolling troops into Democrat-led cities earlier this year. In October, the incursion seemed inevitable—that is, until a couple oligarchs, including billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and billionaire Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, called Trump and told him to stand down. Trump complied.\n“One of the things that President Trump is really good at is he’s a really good listener,” Huang told the SF Chronicle about the call. “If you appeal to him, logically, pragmatically, with common sense, he will listen.” Benioff's Mamdami-aligned creds have recently taken a beating, but it wasn’t that long ago that he backed a hefty tax on large corporations to generate funds to fight homelessness. And Benioff was a White House guest on Tuesday, at the president's dinner to fete Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. An ideal time, perhaps, to take the president aside and suggest a warm and friendly approach.\nDonald Trump has been engaging in the greatest long con of all time\nRemember when Donald Trump was on Sex and the City? When he donated to Kamala Harris's campaign when she ran for California Attorney General? When he told CNN “I probably identify more as a Democrat…And it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans”? Some pundits describe his remarkable change in position as a set of craven flip-flops, a symptom of someone who lacks a belief in anything but power, or a sign of “accelerating cognitive decline.”\nBut Occam's Razor is overrated! What if, as Mamdani's election rival Curtis Sliwa claimed last night, “we all got played”? Is Trump about to reveal himself as a deep cover mole for The Resistance? It's 2025, don't rule it out.","summary":"Anyone expecting fireworks when New York City's mayor-elect met with the president was disappointed Friday—unless they were hoping for an explosion of love.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani-donald-trump-oval-office-white-house-meeting","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6921d1a394bd3d82a3b1a751/16:9/w_6480,h_3645,c_limit/2247217930","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 20:07:07","author":"Eve Batey","authors":["Eve Batey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.057},{"id":381619680,"title":"Trump ends deportation protection for Somalis in Minnesota","text":"Nov. 22 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump said he is \"immediately\" ending deportation protections for more than 400 Somali immigrants living in Minnesota.\n\nTrumo made the announcement on Truth Social on Friday night.\n\nThe East African nation has had protection since 1991, and it was renewed on Sept. 18, 2024, through March 17, 2026, when Joe Biden was president.\n\n\"I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota,\" he wrote. \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.

Minneapolis has your back -- always.\"\n\nRepublican House Speaker Lisa Demuthg, who is running for governor against Walz, applauded the decision.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that far too many individuals who were welcomed into this country have abused the trust and support that was extended to them, and Minnesota taxpayers have suffered billions of dollars in consequences as a result,\" Demuth said in a statement to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nMinnesota Republican U.S. Rep.

Maher expressed his surprise at her comments on a recent episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher.”\n\nMichelle Obama, during a November 5 event on her book tour, implied that sexism remains a hurdle in electing a female president. Her comments came just a day after Democratic women Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger achieved significant victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively.\n\nReflecting on Kamala Harris’s past electoral defeat to Donald Trump, Obama stated, “As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready.” She further explained her reluctance to run for office, saying, “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman.”\n\nObama’s comments underscore her belief that societal growth is needed, as she remarked, “We got a lot of growing up to do, and there are still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\n‘As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,’ she said, talking about Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump. ‘That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying.

Just because we weren’t ready or didn’t like the candidates, Hillary and Kamala, doesn’t mean we’re not ready for a woman,’ he said.\n\n‘I think it’s a bad attitude. I do,’ he went on to say. ‘We said we weren’t ready for a black president, and someone, I can’t remember who, maybe she remembers.’\n\nMaher concluded by saying, ‘Maybe it just has to be the right one.’\n\nStephen A. Smith, the sports commentator who has been increasingly wading into politics, has also condemned Michelle’s pessimism about female presidential contenders.\n\nOn his SiriusXM radio show this week, he pointed out that Clinton had nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016.\n\nOf course, she lost the electoral college because Trump had just enough votes in crucial battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to come out on top.\n\n‘What do you mean we weren’t ready? What do you mean we weren’t ready?’ he said. \n\n‘Weren’t there white women who voted for Donald Trump? Not just white men. Didn’t the blacks show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Didn’t Hispanics show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton?’\n\nAfter blaming Clinton for campaigning poorly in swing states that year, Smith then turned to Harris’ run in 2024, which he said couldn’t have been decided by sexism.\n\nHe asked: ‘How about 2024 when Kamala Harris was running as the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States of America? Yes, she did only have 107 days to do it. But whose fault was that?’ \n\nSmith then blamed Democrats for holding on ‘to Joe Biden for dear life until July of that summer when there was evidence that showed months earlier that he wasn’t ready anymore.’ \n\nHe slammed Harris for being ‘hesitant to do interviews, hesitant to answer questions and you were hesitant to separate yourself from the Biden administration in terms of some of the decisions that they made.’\n\nSmith added that he believed Michelle could be the first woman president, though she has expressed a distaste for politics.\n\n‘You are not just beloved, you are revered, you are sensational in so many ways.

Then, Greene stunned D.C. by announcing on November 21 that she was resigning from the House of Representatives in January.\n\n“I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms,” Greene wrote.\n\nSo where did it all go wrong?\n\nThe most immediate cause of the split is the Epstein scandal. \n\nGreene is among several Republican members of Congress who have backed an effort to force the government to release more files on the late sex offender, a longtime former friend of the president’s who died in prison while awaiting trial on charges that he trafficked young girls. The House will vote on the effort next week. \n\nWorse still, in a Republican party that virtually never openly criticizes Trump, Greene accused Trump of a “huge miscalculation” in his continued dismissal of the scandal and the Republicans pushing for more information.\n\n“Just being very honest with you, it’s something that I don’t understand,” the MAGA rep told CBS, arguing that releasing more Epstein information in the hands of federal law enforcement sends a powerful message that the government “will not protect the predators,” even if they are tied to rich and influential people. \n\nThe president, who denies being involved in any wrongdoing tied to Epstein, has called Republicans pursuing the Epstein scandal “stupid” and accused them of distracting from GOP achievements. \n\nBut the tension between Greene and Trump’s inner circle has been building for months. \n\nGreene, once better known for spouting conspiracy theories and demonizing her progressive colleagues when she entered Congress in 2021, has recently turned her considerable bully pulpit towards major parts of the Republican agenda.\n\nShe has hammered the GOP across the board, taking aim at its continued dithering on lowering health care costs.\n\nDuring the recent government shutdown, she broke from her party to join Democratic members in calling for action to keep expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies in place, though she was ultimately ignored.\n\nShe has also accused the president of abandoning Trump’s “America First” agenda by focusing too much on foreign intervention, emerging as an outspoken critic of the bipartisan support for the Israeli war effort in Gaza, and becoming one of the few American lawmakers from either party to agree with a consensus among human rights groups and a United Nations commission that have labelled the conflict a genocide.\n\nLast year, she mounted a failed attempt to oust her former ally Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House, and she has accused the top House Republican of fostering an environment that sidelines powerful women in the party, a charge she applied to the president on Saturday amid her ongoing feud.\n\n“Republicans don’t have support from women and this right here is a perfect example of why,” she wrote on X, linking back to a series of posts from Trump and allied GOP Rep. Troy Nehls dismissing the Epstein scandal as a Democratic “hoax.”\n\nThe weekend blow-up is a dramatic change from Greene’s rapid rise through MAGA world.\n\nGreene said she was inspired to seek office because of Trump, and the president praised her as a “future Republican star” and “real winner” after she won her first primary in 2020.\n\nOnce she took office, the two moved in lockstep. She wore a “Trump won” mask on the House floor at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as she unleashed a months-long campaign against vaccination efforts and public health guidelines.\n\nTrump defended Greene after her colleagues moved to strip her from committee assignments over past inflammatory comments, while she backed the president as he and his allies in Congress sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election on baseless conspiracy theories that the results were rigged against him.\n\nGreene would go on to be the first of Georgia’s congressional delegation to endorse Trump for re-election in 2022, a time when the president’s political stocks were at a low ebb following a brutal round of impeachment trials and committee investigations that examined in detail how he nearly toppled a rightful election.\n\nGreene’s split with Trump is certainly notable, but those who go against the president have a way of burning brightly then fading to irrelevance within the party.\n\nFormer Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who supported the second Trump impeachment and helped lead the January 6 committee, lost her primary in 2022 then decided to back Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nPence is now a marginal figure in the party, while Musk – despite a brief handshake with Trump in September at the funeral of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk – is no longer the omni-present fixture he was in Washington during the first months of the second Trump administration.\n\nGreene may have provoked Trump’s fury, but some in the Republican camp remain supportive of the Georgia rep.\n\n“I respect President Trump but I stand with my Congresswoman,” Emory Roy, Georgia-based activist for the conservative group Turning Point Action wrote on X, calling Greene “an America First fighter in D.C.”\n\nJim Tully, chairman of the local Republican party in the district Greene represents, wrote on X that the congresswoman enjoys the district’s “unwavering support.”\n\n“Her willingness to speak candidly on behalf of her constituents, even in the face of political pressure, underscores her courage and her fidelity to her oath,” he added.","summary":"After months of tension on everything from Epstein to inflation, Trump breaks up with his former die-hard ally","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-resignation-trump-epstein-b2870485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/16/1/26/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GREENE-ka2gl1m7.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HVvn5FBf-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-22 15:05:26","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":381576846,"title":"Bill Maher Calls Michelle Obama’s Claim That America Isn’t Ready for a Woman President “Bullsh*t”","text":"Bill Maher and former DNC chair Donna Brazile weren’t having it on Friday night, taking aim at Michelle Obama’s recent suggestion that Americans still aren’t ready to elect a woman as president. The pair unpacked the former first lady’s remarks during the season finale of Real Time, calling her assessment — as Maher put it — “bulls*t.”\n\nMaher zeroed in on Obama’s comments from her book tour stop at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week, where she opened up about why she has no plans to step into the political arena in 2028, despite persistent speculation.\n\n“She was in the news this week, Michelle Obama. She has a book out. A coffee table book,” Maher said. “Her statement, I was rather shocked by it.\n\n“To me, this is logical fallacy 101. Just because we weren’t ready or didn’t like the candidates, Hillary and Kamala, doesn’t mean we are not ready for a woman.”\n\nObama had told moderator Tracee Ellis Ross that her decision not to run stems from what she sees as a deeper issue in American politics. “As we saw in the past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” she said during the November 5 event. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. So don’t waste my time.”\n\nShe doubled down, saying, “We got a lot of growing up to do and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nMaher pushed back by invoking her husband’s historic 2008 victory. “I think it’s a bad attitude. We said we weren’t ready for a black president and someone, I can’t remember who maybe she remembers, said maybe it just has to be the right one,” he joked.\n\nBrazile backed Maher up with a numbers-based rebuttal. “We are ready,” she said, pointing to the popular vote totals from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat. Clinton won 65.8 million votes to Trump’s 62.9 million, while Harris pulled in 75 million in her own losing bid.\n\n“Maybe we should stop talking about it and just do it,” Brazile added, later emphasizing, “We are ready. Eighty percent of American people say, ‘they are ready.’ So the idea that America isn’t ready is bullsh*t. They might not be ready for this one or that one.”\n\nYou can watch a different clip of the panel, which also featured rapper and activist Killer Mike, in Maher’s “Overtime” segment from last night’s episode above.\n\nMaher also stirred things up earlier in the week on his Club Random podcast, where he floated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as a potential White House contender — with one caveat.\n\n“If she had some deprogramming, she could be such a fantastic candidate,” he said of AOC. “She’s never going to resonate with people outside of the bubble she lives in, in the very, very far left.”","summary":"The HBO host pushed back on the former first lady’s take: “Logical fallacy 101.”","url":"https://decider.com/2025/11/22/bill-maher-michelle-obama-america-woman-president/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bill-maher-112125.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 14:59:17","author":"Michael Haskoor,mliss1578","authors":["Michael Haskoor","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":381573174,"title":"Bill Maher slams Michelle Obama's 'bad attitude' over claim Americans are too sexist to elect female president","text":"Bill Maher said Michelle Obama is suffering from a 'bad attitude' after she claimed earlier this month that Americans are still not ready to elect a woman to the presidency.\n\n'Her statement, I was rather shocked by it,' Maher during Friday's episode of Real Time With Bill Maher.\n\nMichelle implied that many male voters are sexist and don't want a woman in the White House during a November 5 stop on her book tour. \n\nThis came a day after two Democratic women, Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, cruised to victory in their respective New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races.\n\n'As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain't ready,' she said, talking about Kamala Harris' loss to Trump.

What do you mean we weren't ready?' he said. \n\n'Weren't there white women who voted for Donald Trump? Not just white men. Didn't the blacks show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton? Didn't Hispanics show up for Hillary Rodham Clinton?'\n\nAfter blaming Clinton for campaigning poorly in swing states that year, Smith then turned to Harris' run in 2024, which he said couldn't have been decided by sexism.\n\nHe asked: 'How about 2024 when Kamala Harris was running as the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States of America? Yes, she did only have 107 days to do it. But whose fault was that?' \n\nSmith then blamed Democrats for holding on 'to Joe Biden for dear life until July of that summer when there was evidence that showed months earlier that he wasn't ready anymore.' \n\nHe slammed Harris for being 'hesitant to do interviews, hesitant to answer questions and you were hesitant to separate yourself from the Biden administration in terms of some of the decisions that they made.'\n\nSmith added that he believed Michelle could be the first woman president, though she has expressed a distaste for politics.\n\n'You are not just beloved, you are revered, you are sensational in so many ways.

This information comes from a new report.\n\nAccording to insiders speaking with The Guardian, Larry Ellison discussed the potential removal of prominent CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar during conversations with White House officials. The sources noted that the anchors were mentioned due to their lack of favor with former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 81-year-old Oracle co-founder is also said to have considered a shift in programming that would integrate the iconic CBS News program, 60 Minutes, into CNN’s lineup. This consideration follows Paramount’s recent acquisition by his son, David, a deal that Larry Ellison helped finance.\n\nThe report, released on Thursday, has generated buzz within CNN’s New York City headquarters located at Hudson Yards, as reported by Status.\n\nDavid Ellison, who is 42, has reportedly made an undisclosed offer for the entire Warner Bros Discovery portfolio, which includes CNN.\n\nDavid Ellison, 42, has entered an unknown bid for the entire WBD portfolio, including CNN.\n\nLarry and David are the only prospective WBD bidders who want to buy CNN as part of any deal. Others are said to be willing to spin off the ailing cable network into a separate company while focusing on more promising assets like Warner Bros. movie studio and HBO. \n\nLarry Ellison, a well-known GOP donor, donated to Trump’s 2024 campaign and does not play a formal role within Paramount.\n\n He is, however, the company’s primary shareholder – and he fourth-richest man in the world with a net worth of nearly $200billion.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Paramount for comment on the report Friday. Reps from CNN declined to comment. \n\nBurnett, 49, has been with CNN since 2011 after joining from CNBC. Keilar , 45, joined CNN as a correspondent in 2006, after several years with CBS News. The two have offered critical reporting Trump for years, but are far from the only CNN stars known for targeting the president. \n\nBurnett – currently the host of hour-long primetime program Erin Burnett OutFront – last week tore into the conservative for what she saw as inconsistencies in his story about Jeffrey Epstein on November 13.\n\nOn Thursday, she hosted Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan to criticize Trump for accusing six Democratic lawmakers of of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ for a video urging members of the military to not follow orders if they are unlawful.\n\nKeilar did the same later in the night on News Central with Congressman Chris Deluzio (D-PA), one of the politicians in the video, calling Trump’s comments ‘outrageous.’\n\nLast year, she tore into the president for his false claims about Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe news comes after former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss was minted as CBS News’ chief on October 6 after ‘informally consulting’ the network for weeks, a source told the Daily Mail last month.\n\nDavid Ellison personally headhunted Weiss after buying Paramount in July.\n\nShe is said to be keen to hire a new evening news star, with Fox News host Bret Baier and CNN favorite Anderson Cooper among her rumored top picks. Weiss resigned from Times in 2021 to found the Free Press, which was purchased by Ellison in October for roughly $150 million.\n\nAfter being named CEO, Ellison pledged to shed any prior political connotations that may be tied to the company after a string of controversies and claims of ‘deceptive’ editing practices from both Donald Trump and Homeland Security boss Kristi Noem.\n\nBefore the merger, Paramount balked at settling a lawsuit with Trump that claimed a 60 Minutes interview with a then-campaigning Kamala Harris was ‘deceptively edited.’\n\nThe suit was settled for $16million days before the FCC approved the merger. \n\nOther companies who have entered a bid for Warner Bros.

To wrap a remarkable span of days at the White House, he permitted New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, who was visiting the Oval Office at Trump’s invitation, to reaffirm his assessment that the president is indeed a fascist. Hosting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, Trump heaped praise on the strongman tied by U.S. intelligence to the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We’ve always been on the same side of every issue,” Trump said of bin Salman in front of the gathered journalists, one of whom quickly found herself in the president’s firing line. \n\nABC News reporter Mary Bruce asked Trump about the crown prince’s connection to Khashoggi’s murder and Trump’s reversal on releasing the Epstein files. The president reprimanded her, calling her “insubordinate” and a “terrible person,” and recommending that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr revoke ABC’s broadcast license.\n\nBeyond the president, other MAGA figures are exerting pressure on major journalistic institutions to place ideological loyalists into key media roles while pushing out dissenting voices: A hallmark of authoritarian control. \n\nThis week Vice President JD Vance revealed that he wants Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Post, to hand over control of his newsroom to Matthew Boyle, an editor at the conservative media outlet Breitbart. “I am being dead serious,” Vance said in a Nov. 20 fireside chat with Boyle that was livestreamed on the White House YouTube channel, calling him “the most well-sourced journalist in Washington, D.C.” \n\nShortly after Trump returned to the White House, Bezos announced a “significant shift” of the Post’s opinion page to focus on “free markets and personal liberties.” Vance admitted that he reached out to the publisher then with his recommendation. “I texted Jeff Bezos and I said, ‘If you’re really serious about this, you should just hire Matt Boyle and make him run your entire political reporting shop… Unfortunately for the Washington Post, they did not take my advice.”\n\nIt doesn’t matter that Bezos was unlikely ever to take Vance’s unsolicited recommendation. The vice president’s public flattery of Boyle flaunts the fact that the far-right Breitbart staffer is not a marginal voice. Although he is not in control of the Post’s political coverage, Boyle sat beside the vice president this week as a central ideologue for MAGA’s media takeover movement. Vance’s bragging about his direct political intervention into the Post newsroom is intended to reveal MAGA’s control and normalize backchannel influence.\n\n“We’re doing what’s called journalism,” Boyle said earlier this year of his website, which infamously featured a “Black crime” vertical. The mainstream media, he said, are “doing what’s called propaganda.” His antipathy toward legitimate news outlets isn’t new. In a 2017 speech, Boyle declared that “the goal eventually is the full destruction and elimination of the entire mainstream media…We envision a day where CNN is no longer in business; we envision a day where the New York Times closes its doors.”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?

Paramount Skydance is currently trying to force Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, to sell the network to him, Ellison has reportedly floated the idea of firing CNN hosts who are critical of Trump, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, to sweeten the deal. \n\nSuch an arrangement would undoubtedly thrill Trump, who is widely seen as favoring CNN’s acquisition by Paramount Skydance over an anticipated bid by Comcast. Earlier this year, Paramount Skydance, which owns CBS News, paid the president a $16 million settlement over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that he claimed was deceptively edited. Meanwhile, Trump has called Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts a “disgrace” to broadcasting.\n\nThe reported push behind closed doors comes after the president publicly demanded the firing of another CNN reporter. In June, correspondent Natasha Bertrand reported on air that an internal intelligence assessment found that U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran’s nuclear program by only a few months. “She should be IMMEDIATELY reprimanded, and then thrown out ‘like a dog,’” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nThis week’s revelations made it clear: MAGA’s effort to restructure mainstream media from the inside out is not just focused on the opinion pages, but also on newsrooms themselves. Institutional capture through ownership, power over personnel and regulatory instruments to exert control over mass media is a defining characteristic of fascism. Trump has long referred to the press as the “enemy of the people,” a phrase that has a brutal history with its use by authoritarians including Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Nazi propagandists like Joseph Goebbels. The president’s contempt for a free, independent press tells us where his loyalties lie — and what a bleak future could hold.","summary":"The Trump administration's effort to control mainstream media is expanding and accelerating","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/11/22/trumps-white-house-wants-to-tell-cnn-wapo-who-to-hire-and-fire/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump-2246764781-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 11:45:25","author":"Sophia Tesfaye","authors":["Sophia Tesfaye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":381618152,"title":"Famed Hollywood Producer Brian Grazer Says 'There Was Blowback' for Voting Trump in 2024","text":"Famed Hollywood producer Brian Grazer (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Parenthood, etc.) said he faced “blowback” for voting Trump in 2024 but not to the point it affected his career.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year, a documentary from Fox Nation, titled Art of the Surge, featured several clips behind the scenes of President Trump’s 2024 campaign, including a surprise appearance from the three-time Oscar winner. The documentary shows Grazer socializing with President Trump inside the V.I.P. box at a football game, getting his photo taken, and admitting that he pulled the lever for 47.\n\nGrazer also said in the documentary that when he told “some women he knows” about his Trump vote over Kamala Harris, it felt like “getting canceled.”\n\n“All the women looked in and go, ‘You mean, you’re not voting for Kamala?’ And I go, ‘I just can’t do that.’ And then, one of them leaned in further, and said, ‘Are you voting for Trump?’ And I said, ‘I am.’ I swear!’” Grazer is quoted as saying.\n\nSpeaking to Variety, Grazer said he faced “blowback” albeit without losing his standing in Tinseltown.\n\n“Brian, it came out that you voted for Donald Trump. Given that Hollywood is a liberal town, what was the reaction?” Variety asked.\n\n“There was blowback,” responded Grazer.\n\n“Do people not want to work with you?” asked Variety.\n\n“No. I am what I am. I haven’t changed. I don’t know if I should say anything more than that,” he said.\n\nGrazer also discussed the prevalence of generative AI, saying that it could be used as a tool that helps build a movie.\n\n“It’s a great collaborator in building stories.

The unofficial results two weeks prior had Mahmood trailing by 11 votes, but after the counting of some other ballots, he was down by only six votes.\n\n\"The votes were inaccurately counted by the city of Hamtramck and inaccurately canvassed by the board of canvassers,\" Mahmood wrote in his petition, obtained by the Free Press.\n\nAlharbi has the right to object to the recount request. He had to file his objection by Friday afternoon, according to a letter to Alharbi from the chair of the Board of Canvassers, Lisa Capatina. It's unclear if Alharbi filed an objection by the deadline. Alharbi, who works with patents in the Commerce Department, did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nIf the board agrees to the recount, the staff of the Wayne County clerk \"will do a hand recount under the supervision of the County Board of Canvassers,\" Mahmood's attorney, Mark Brewer, told the Free Press.\n\nA spokesperson for Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett, Dorian Tyus, explained to the Free Press how the process for a possible recount would work.\n\n\"The Board will meet on Tuesday to consider the petition and any objections (if filed),\" Tyus said.\n\nAny \"recounts are conducted under the authority of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers,\" Tyus added. \"The Wayne County Clerk is the clerk to the Board (of Canvassers) and staff from her Elections Division assists the Board with the recount.\"\n\nThe race for mayor and other elected positions in Hamtramck are nonpartisan, but the two candidates differ in their political views and backgrounds. Mahmood endorsed Kamala Harris last year for president while Alharbi was a Trump supporter and the former campaign manager for current Mayor Amer Ghalib. Ghalib did not run for reelection after he was named by Trump to be ambassador to Kuwait. Ghalib faced a bruising Senate confirmation hearing in October and it's now unclear if he will be approved. Alharbi had accompanied Ghalib in 2023 to a visit an evangelical church in Sterling Heights to meet with former General Michael Flynn, convicted of lying to the FBI about conversations with Russian officials, as part of the Republican Party's outreach to Arab Americans and Muslims in Michigan. Trump lost to Harris in Hamtramck, but greatly improved his results compared to the 2020 race against Joe Biden.\n\nGhalib was elected mayor in 2021 with 68% of the vote, but Alharbi received less than 50%, indicating reduced support for Trump or Trump-tied candidates among Arab American and Muslim voters compared to 2024. In Dearborn, a candidate for mayor who endorsed Trump in 2024, was crushed in the November election this year, receiving only 28% of the vote.\n\nSupport for the two mayoral candidates in Hamtramck was also split along ethnic lines. Alharbi, an immigrant from Yemen, received support from Yemeni American groups while Mahmood, an immigrant from Bangladesh, received support from Bangladeshi American voters. In 2017, another immigrant from Bangladesh, Mohammed Hassan, currently a councilman, lost in his race for mayor after some Yemeni American groups endorsed Mayor Karen Majewski.\n\nMore: Find all 2025 Michigan election results here\n\nDuring a board of canvassers meeting on Nov. 13 to discuss 37 ballots Hamtramck Clerk Rana Faraj said had not been counted, Yemeni American residents spoke up against counting them, alleging fraud, while Bangladeshi American residents spoke up in favor of counting them.\n\nRepublicans on the four-member board of canvassers — two Republican and two Democrat — blocked a motion last week to count the 37 votes. Three votes are needed to pass motions.\n\nAlharbi filed a lawsuit this month alleging Mahmood lives in Troy and should be disqualified from being mayor. A judge denied on Nov. 14 his request. A spokesman for Michigan State Police said recently they are still investigating whether Mahmood lives in Hamtramck.\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com, X @nwarikoo or Facebook @nwarikoo","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2025/11/22/hamtramck-mayoral-candidate-muhith-mahmood-requests-recount/87398927007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2021/08/26/PDTF/2c7a708b-f441-40c9-9fc7-7c7f8ea82a2b-08252021_hamtramck-14.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y122&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 11:06:23","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":381525006,"title":"‘A whole bunch of financial mess’: Affordability feels out of reach in PA district crucial to Trump","text":"Jenique Jones is “super busy” these days. Because of what she does — and where she lives — that is perilous news for President Donald Trump and Republican control of Washington. “My business assists people in repairing their credit,” Jones said in an interview at the Bethlehem office of Lehigh Valley Credit Restoration. “Managing their finances and basically being financially organized.” She has been super busy, Jones told us, because “times are tough.” “Everything is going up except the wages here. This is the Lehigh Valley, or the hub between Philadelphia and New York, and they are raising prices and the locals really can’t afford to keep up.” Bethlehem is synonymous with blue-collar America, and because of the area’s voting history it is a laboratory for testing the national mood. Right now, plenty of people are living paycheck to paycheck; more and more are asking to meet with Jones because of an affordability crisis. They tell her a range of stories. “My husband lost all of his overtime,” is one Jones often hears. Or also: “My kids’ daycare went up. Can’t afford the cost of food. Using credit cards for everyday expenses. No money left after the bills are paid.” “Pretty much just a whole bunch of financial mess,” she says. Jones is a three-time Trump voter. She still believes he is more qualified than Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent in the last election. But now, she is blunt in saying he has simply failed to keep his 2024 campaign pledge to make life more affordable. “I’m very let down by that. Very, very let down because it’s — I feel like it’s only gotten worse,” she said. The numbers back Jones up. The unemployment rate in the Lehigh Valley is up since Trump returned to the White House. Pennsylvania grocery costs are up 8.2% in the past year, well above the national average of 5%. And rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Bethlehem averages $1,900 a month, up just shy of 6% from a year ago. “People are just struggling to pay basic needs,” Jones said. “People can’t afford everyday life. The average grocery shopping, even for myself, let’s say $150 a week is now $250 a week.” Anger over affordability pressures helped Trump win Pennsylvania and all the swing states in November 2024. This November, it was again the driving issue as Democrats made big gains — and by big margins in off-cycle elections such as in the Virginia and New Jersey governors’ races and the New York mayoral race. High prices in a key district Bethlehem will be central to testing whether the same dynamics play out in the 2026 midterms, when Democrats are looking to capture the House majority and create a roadblock to the Trump agenda. It sits in Pennsylvania’s bellwether Northampton County, a place known for picking political winners and a county we visited several times during our 2024 travels for our All Over the Map project, looking at the election through the eyes and experiences of voters. The winner in Northampton has won statewide and nationally in the past five presidential elections — and in 29 of 32 dating back to 1900. Plus, Trump’s 2024 win helped flip Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District from blue to red, but by just 4,000 votes. It is a top 2026 Democratic target. Ronald Corales knew well before Election Day 2024 that Trump was running strong in the Lehigh Valley, and stronger in the Latino community than in 2016 or 2020. Corales owns three Gentlemen’s Barber locations in the area, and politics is a constant topic of conversation. These days, clients grumble a lot about prices, and some of them say Trump has failed to make life more affordable, he said. Corales is also a three-time Trump voter. He was named after Ronald Reagan, because his Peruvian immigrant parents were so proud to come to the United States and Reagan was president at the time. Corales believes Trump deserves more time — that 10 months isn’t enough to fix the big affordability challenges — but he agrees that, right now, things are not better. “I think we still got to give it some time,” he said. “The country really shifted in the past couple of years. So his, his policies hopefully (will) take effect soon… it hasn’t happened yet.” Ashley Ruiz, one of the barbers who works for Corales, says clients grumble about costs more now than they did during the presidential campaign. She tries to help. “I’ll tell the client, ‘Hey, if you get it cut a little shorter, the haircut will have a longer lifeline.’ Because I want them to feel like they’re getting a service that will last longer so their money goes further.” Ruiz understands the affordability stress; she does the tough math at home and lists rent, food and child care as her family’s biggest budget challenges. “They are a lot higher,” Ruiz said. “So I try to make wiser decisions in hope that things will get better.” She was one of a handful of barbers at the Bethlehem shop who joined us for a few minutes of conversation — all Latino, with a mix of political allegiances, but a unanimous assessment that costs are higher now than a year ago. Health insurance and grocery prices were mentioned most. ‘It’s going to be triple, triple, triple this year’ The political impact is clear in the president’s moribund approval rating. Still, our visit was stunning. No one said costs were down. Some said they were about the same. But most — including several loyal Trump voters — said that the pressures they face in November 2025 are worse than a year ago. Tariffs and grocery prices would have been the top complaint if you stopped in Cutters Bike Shop a few weeks ago, but now health care has been added to the mix. John and Lisa Ronca own the shop, and have a teenage daughter who rides competitively. They get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchange, and their renewal letter just came. “It’s tripling,” Lisa Ronca said, repeating herself as if in disbelief. “It’s going to be triple, triple, triple this year, which equates to double the cost we pay for our mortgage, for our house. So we can’t keep that plan, to say the least.” Extending enhanced ACA premium subsidies was the major goal for Democrats during the recent government shutdown. They failed to win concessions from Republicans, though Trump and some GOP leaders promise to work on Obamacare alternatives. Lisa Ronca rolls her eyes at that, remembering Trump promised the same in his first term and did nothing. “There’s been years,” she said. “ I mean how many years?” The Roncas are not Trump fans and did not vote for him. The family eat in to save money, only indulging once a week at a favorite local Mexican restaurant. Lisa was at the grocery store a couple of hours before we stopped by the bike shop. “A couple of things I, like, have to do a double take. Like, wow.” Pennsylvania has among the highest rate of inflation for food costs among the 50 states. Trump has repeatedly said costs are down, and that it is his critics who are lying about prices being high. But “he doesn’t go grocery shopping,” Lisa Ronca said. “It’s hard. It’s definitely significantly more.” The Roncas’ overall 2025 experience has been higher costs and lower profit margins. The bike shop and its inventory — bikes and parts — carry labels from China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia. For them, Trump’s tariffs are like riding a rollercoaster blindfolded. “Over this current year, it has been constant increases,” John Ronca said. “Every two to three months. We get letters from the companies, ‘We’re having a 10% increase.’ (Then) another 10% increase. And it just keeps escalating.” A chain that was $35 a few months ago is now $50. A shock bump for a mountain bike up from $75 to $120. Christmas season is approaching; early sales are behind last year. Lisa Ronca is worried people are spending less, worried to fill the bike shop floor with a normal holiday season hit. They have eliminated part-time help at the shop. “I don’t know how many kids’ bikes to bring in for Christmas,” she said. “A 20-inch single-speed kids’ bike was $250, which is still decently high. Up to $400 in just the last couple of months. So it’s kind of tough.” Though they generally vote for Democratic candidates, the Roncas did support moderate Republican Charlie Dent when he represented their congressional district a few years back. Lisa Ronca said Dent was helpful when some new local bike trails were in the works. “I have no problem voting for either side if the person is good for the area,” John Ronca said. But their affordability stress — especially from rises in their health=care costs — shapes their early thoughts about next November. “I’m going to vote for a person who puts a check on him,” John Ronca said as Lisa nodded in agreement. “You know what I mean? Who’s going to rein the president in.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/22/politics/affordability-crisis-trump-voters-pennsylvania-aotm","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/videothumbnails/40167836-47737749-generated-thumbnail.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 11:01:00","author":"John King","authors":["John King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":381659050,"title":"Republicans will be left holding the bill for Trump’s policies in the midterms | Sidney Blumenthal","text":"The elections of 4 November were the end of a grandiose illusion. After his 2024 victory, Donald Trump claimed he had an “unprecedented and powerful mandate”, that his “mandate” was “massive” and that his “Maga movement” was irresistible, the wave of the future. It lasted 10 months, in which he had betrayed his chief promise to lower inflation, turned the public against him on every issue and Republicans at last faced a battering by voters.\n\nTrump’s image of omnipotence has rested upon a pyramid of dread. His ability to maintain the servility of the Republican Congress, whose members are intimidated by the danger that if they defy him he would support primary opponents to run against them, has been the political foundation for all the other forms of fear he incites throughout American institutions. Trump could not have leveraged himself as “dictator on day one” without congressional abdication. The Republicans immediately fell into lockstep. But within two weeks of the 4 November elections, only one Republican in the House voted against the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which Trump had called a “hoax” before he felt compelled to bend in the cyclone to sign the bill – and yet still suppresses the files.\n\nThe Republicans in Congress now have another fear that places them in a terrible tightening vise. They have allowed Trump to avoid accountability and in next year’s midterms – of which these elections are an augury – they will be held mercilessly to account in his stead. Trump is the cause for which they will suffer the effect. He will not be on the ballot. Only they will pay the butcher’s bill.\n\nThe Republicans are helpless. Through their abject obedience to him they have permitted Trump to sever their organic connection to their voters. None dare venture any longer to town halls in their districts. They cower before their constituents’ wrath over Trump. He is more unpopular than any president of recent time, including himself after January 6, with the exception of George W Bush at the end of his presidency in the financial collapse. The colossus who proclaims “I have the right to do anything I want to do, I’m the president” has reduced the Republicans to ciphers. They are not public servants, but his sycophants. Their lord, however, is not their protector. The closer they attach themselves to him, the more vulnerable they become. The voters repudiate Trump by rejecting Republicans.\n\nIf the Republicans had paid more attention to his career, they would have observed that he always maneuvers to set up fall guys to take the rap. Trump has his Roy Cohns and his Michael Cohens. “He directed me to make the payment,” Cohen testified about the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels in order to shut her up to affect the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump was ultimately convicted in 2024 of 34 felonies of business fraud in an election scheme. “Michael has great liability to me!” Trump tweeted. Cohen served two and a half years in prison for tax evasion, lying to a bank, and campaign finance violations for the payments to Daniels and Karen McDougal, a Playboy model with whom Trump had an affair. “The man doesn’t tell the truth,” said Cohen. “And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.” Trump called Cohen, who testified in the trial, a “rat”, a Mafia term for an informant. “The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering,” Cohen told a congressional committee in 2019. The Republicans collectively are now Michael Cohen.\n\nA Marist-NPR poll on 19 November sent a shock wave. Democrats held a towering 14-point advantage. Then a Marquette University poll rolled in later that day showing Democrats with an 11-point advantage among likely voters. In the 2018 midterms, a Democratic lead of around seven to eight points on the generic ballot translated into a gain of 40 seats. The latest numbers might project roughly 60 seats. The supposedly dead Democrats would easily carry a large majority. With those margins, they would also likely take the Senate.\n\nIf that seems too breathless, consider what the recent 4 November elections portend. Republican turnout cratered; Democratic enthusiasm ran high. The polls, which were weighted on the basis of the 2024 results, were distorted in showing closer races than the final counts. In the New Jersey gubernatorial contest, in the highest voter turnout in an off-year election in two decades there, the Republican vote count declined 42% for the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, compared with Trump’s 2024 total. In the Virginia gubernatorial race, the Republican vote count dropped by nearly 45% compared with 2024, while the Democratic vote fell by only 22%.\n\nThe final polls significantly underestimated the winning margins for the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. Late polls had Spanberger leading by seven to 11 points, while others suggested a lead as narrow as 2.5 points or a virtual “dead heat”. In New Jersey, final polls had the race even closer. A RealClearPolling average showed Sherrill’s lead at approximately four to eight points, with some polls placing the race within a single point’s margin of error. Spanberger won by 15 points, Sherill by 13. The polls generally, in election after election, miscalculated the Democratic margin of victory by approximately five to nine percentage points compared with the actual results.\n\nAll of Trump’s gains were swept away in every demographic group. In the two New Jersey cities with the greatest percentage of Hispanic voters, Union City and Perth Amboy, Sherill won by 69 points compared with Kamala Harris’ 17, and by 56 points compared with nine, respectively. Sherill won all 21 counties. The Democrats picked up enough state legislative seats, including in a district held by Republicans for more than three decades, to achieve a super-majority in the assembly.\n\nIn Virginia, Spanberger outperformed Harris in more than 95% of Virginia’s counties and independent cities. The Democrats gained more than 16 points in small cities and 12 in rural areas. Before the election, Democrats held 51 seats and Republicans 48 in the house of delegates, with one vacancy. The Democrats won 13 seats and now have 64 delegates. Voter urgency to defeat Republicans was so persuasive that Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for state attorney general, whose emails expressing his desire to shoot the Republican speaker of the house of delegates in the head were a central focus of the campaign, won by six points.\n\nElections elsewhere demonstrated the same pattern. In Erie county, Pennsylvania, which Trump had narrowly won, the Democratic candidate for county executive beat the Republican by 25 points. For the first time since 2006, Democrats in Georgia won statewide nonfederal offices with two candidates gaining about 60% of the vote for seats on the Georgia public service commission. Little noticed, Democrats flipped two state senate seats in Mississippi, which broke the Republican super-majority.\n\nThe claim that Trump’s 2024 election represented a fundamental realignment of American politics has swiftly turned into a mirage. He had won by a slender margin of 1.5 points, overwhelmingly on the issue of inflation, and dependent on winning the 7% of voters who decided in the last week for him by nine points, generally considered low-propensity voters. This time, many of them apparently either switched to vote for the Democrats or stayed home. The much touted newly consolidated Trump electorate has vanished. Trump in office has built no mandate. His coalition has disintegrated and been reduced to his base, which is beginning to splinter over continuing inflation, increases in premiums for Obamacare and the Epstein files.\n\nProjecting forward, accounting for the discrepancy between the polls and the results in 2025, conservatively giving the Democrats running for the Congress an additional five points to make up for it, and assuming similar party turnout, the outcome would be startling. If that formula is to be believed, Democrats would win more than 60 seats in the 2026 midterms and capture the Senate, too.\n\nThe circumstances that produced the Democratic sweep in 2025 will not be replaced by election day next year with the dawning of Trump’s “Golden Age”. His economic damage through his draconian and chaotic tariffs, a major contributing factor to inflation and unemployment, the poisonous combination of stagflation, can hardly be unraveled quickly, even if the supreme court supports lower court rulings against his invocation of emergency authority as unlawful. The rest of Trump’s policies radically redistributing wealth and resources upward and immiserating the working and middle classes, which have had unanimous Republican support, will not be reversed. In 2026, the midterms will be fought on even more difficult ground for Republicans of an even lengthier period of economic decline.\n\nTrump’s absence from the ballot eliminates his attraction to the low-propensity voters that previously backed him. In any case, they have mostly evaporated, as the 2025 results demonstrated. It is a further illusion about the past election that if Trump campaigns on the stump for Republicans it will benefit them. In fact, Trump’s vote in 2024 was for Trump, but even so the congressional Republicans actually performed better than Trump. Overall, Trump did better in 198 congressional districts and the GOP House candidates did better in 237. For districts with GOP incumbents, Trump did better in 29, but the House candidates did better in 191, according to calculations derived from the Downballot.\n\nNow Trump’s enveloping presence casts a shadow over Republicans which they cannot escape. His unpopularity is deep and settled. The more he appears next to them, the more intensely the larger public is galvanized against them, if they need the reminder that the Republicans and Trump are one and the same. The Republicans have trapped themselves, willingly so. He is their cement shoes.\n\nThe key propulsive numbers for turnout in the 2026 election are to be found among those who strongly approve and disapprove of Trump. In the latest Marist Poll, 68% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 81% of Democrats and 60% of independents strongly disapprove. Those numbers can get worse for Republicans. Polarization now works against them. The numbers are inexorable harbingers of 2026.\n\nTrump himself is an immutable factor. He is hardwired against flexibility and self-reform, which he believes is the core of his strength and appeal. He is certain that his intransigence is his greatest asset. If he never gives in, he will always win. His only road to victory is that everyone must fear him. He cannot admit a mistake. It would violate his canon of power. Any erosion of his followers’ subservience is taken as not only an unjustifiable attack on his authority, but on his very being.\n\nTrump perceives every challenge, no matter how sensible, as an existential threat. He prizes unstinting fealty above reason. He can respond in only one way. Refusing to acknowledge the repudiation of the 4 November elections, he explodes in rage and aggravates alienation.\n\nHe must call Marjorie Taylor Greene for questioning him a “traitor”. He must shout at a Bloomberg News reporter for asking a question about the Epstein files: “Quiet, quiet, piggy!” He must label an ABC News correspondent who also asks a question about his suppression of the Epstein files “insubordinate”. He must declare that Democratic members of the Congress, all military and national security veterans, invoking the law that the armed forces and intelligence officials are obligated not to follow illegal orders, are “traitors” who should be “ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL” for “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n\nBut in the midterm elections to come, however distant they may still seem, it is the Republicans in the Congress who will stand alone to receive the final verdict before the people for their cowardice in collaborating with Trump and as contemptible exemplars of all his collaborators.\n\n Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to the Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth.

Rob Bonta ponders a run for governor, he faces scrutiny for his ties to people central to a federal corruption investigation in Oakland and payments to private attorneys. Bonta has not been accused of impropriety, but the questions come at an inopportune time for Democrat, who says he is reassessing a gubernatorial bid after repeatedly dismissing a run earlier this year. Bonta said the decisions by former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla not to seek the office altered the contours of the race. \"I had two horses in the governor's race already,\" Bonta said in an interview with The Times on Friday. \"They decided not to get involved in the end. ... The race is fundamentally different today, right?\" Bonta said he has received significant encouragement to join the crowded gubernatorial field and that he expects to make a decision \"definitely sooner rather than later.\" Political advisors to the 54-year-old Alameda politician have been reaching out to powerful Democrats across the state to gauge his possible support. Historically, serving as California attorney general has been a launching pad to higher office or a top post in Washington. Harris, elected to two terms as the state attorney general, was later elected to the U.S. Senate and then as vice president. Jerry Brown served in the post before voters elected him for a second go-around as governor in 2010. Earl Warren later became the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Bonta, the first Filipino American to serve as the state's top law enforcement official, was appointed in March 2021 by Gov. Gavin Newsom after Xavier Becerra resigned to become U.S. Health and Human Services secretary. Bonta easily won election as attorney general in 2022. Bonta was a deputy city attorney in San Francisco and vice mayor for the city of Alameda before being elected to the state Assembly in 2012. During his tenure representing the Alameda area, Bonta developed a reputation as a progressive willing to push policies to strengthen tenants' rights and to reform the criminal justice system. In his role as the state's top law enforcement official, Bonta has aggressively fought President Trump's policies and actions, filing 46 lawsuits against the administration. Bonta also faced controversy this past week in what Bonta's advisers say they suspect is an attempt to damage him as he considers a potential run. \"Political hacks understand it's actually a badge of respect, almost an endorsement. Clearly others fear him,\" said veteran Democratic strategist Dan Newman, a Bonta adviser. On Monday, KCRA reported that Bonta had spent nearly $500,000 in campaign funds last year on personal lawyers to represent him in dealings with federal investigators working on a public corruption probe in Oakland. On Thursday, the website East Bay Insider reported that as that probe was heating up in spring 2024, Bonta had received a letter from an Oakland businessman warning him that he might soon be subject to blackmail. The letter writer, Mario Juarez, warned Bonta that another businessman, Andy Duong, possessed “a recording of you in a compromising situation.” Duong was later indicted, along with his father David Duong and former Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao, on federal bribery charges. All have pleaded not guilty. An attorney for David Duong this week said that Juarez, who is widely believed to be an informant in the case against the Duongs and Thao, was not credible. Juarez could not be reached for comment. Bonta said his legal expenditures came about after he began speaking with the U.S. Attorney's office, who approached him because prosecutors thought he could be a victim of blackmail or extortion. Bonta said the outreach came after he already had turned over the letter he had received from Juarez to law enforcement. Bonta said he hired lawyers to help him review information in his possession that could be helpful to federal investigators. \"I wanted to get them all the information that they wanted, that they needed, give it to him as fast as as I could, to assist, to help,\" Bonta said. \"Maybe I had a puzzle piece or two that could assist them in their investigation.\" He said he may have made \"an audible gasp\" when he saw the legal bill, but that it was necessary to quickly turn over all documents and communications that could be relevant to the federal investigation. \"The billing rate is high or not insignificant at private law firms,\" Bonta said. \"We were moving quickly to be as responsive as possible, to be as helpful as possible, to assist as as much as possible, and that meant multiple attorneys working a lot of hours.\" Bonta said the state's Fair Political Practices Commission also has alerted him that it received a complaint against him. Bonta and his advisers believe is about the use of campaign funds to pay the legal expenses and suspect it was filed by the campaign of a current gubernatorial candidate. \"We're not worried,\" Bonta said. \"That's politics.\" Asked whether these news stories could create obstacles to a potential gubernatorial campaign, Bonta pushed back against any assertion that he may have \"baggage.\" He said he was assisting federal prosecutors with their investigation with the hopes of holding people accountable. \"That's what I would expect anyone to do, certainly someone who is committed as I am to public safety.,\" he said. \"That's my job, to assist, to support, to provide information, to help.\"","summary":"As California Atty.

The second installment in this two-part musical saga has already made more than $30 million in preview screenings ahead of its official opening this weekend. It also has marketing tie-ins shooting out of its broomstick. Variety reported that Universal, the studio behind the film, has partnered with 400 brands to cross-promote this revisionist “Wizard of Oz.”\n\nPerhaps lost in all that hype is the fact that this “Wicked” sequel is an undeniably political film that’s arriving at a time when Americans may be looking to the movies more for pure escapism than social messaging. Like the 1995 novel and long-running Broadway musical that inspired it, “Wicked” is a blunt commentary on the dangers of fascism, a subject that is all the more potent now that President Donald Trump is running the country using a fascist’s playbook. It will be interesting to see whether those themes resonate with mass audiences or can even spark some political change. Or is that too much to hope for in this fraught climate?\n\nThere is no way to ignore the similarities between life in our country right now and life in the fictional Oz.\n\nThere is no way to ignore the similarities between life in our country right now and life in the fictional Oz presided over by the fraudulent Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and his craven aide Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). \n\nIn “Wicked: For Good,” new laws require the citizens of Oz to show their identification papers when they travel, an echo of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. In Oz, the Wizard’s regime has stripped away the voices and civil rights from animals who once possessed both, a reminder of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to do away with diversity and inclusion programs. \n\nThe green-skinned Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo, is characterized by authorities as an evil witch who wants to kill everyone in Oz, even though what she really wants is to expose the Wizard’s lies. “The best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy,” Goldblum advises. It’s the same strategy Trump and his cohorts use every time they marginalize women, people of color or anyone else they perceive as hostile.\n\nBut the most chilling dialogue may be the words that Ariana Grande’s Glinda speaks after a house falls on the Wicked Witch of the East, instantly crushing her. Acting as an official representative of Oz but unaware that Madame Morrible orchestrated that death, Glinda blithely says, “Accidents happen.” Who else will think of President Trump’s comments this week about the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi? While sitting in the Oval Office next to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the man who U.S. intelligence agencies concluded had to have approved the operation that killed Khashoggi, Trump dismissively said, “Things happen.” \n\nEven if people recognize the parallels, it’s naive, perhaps, to think that recognition may spark political change, especially since past evidence tells us that rarely happens. Remember in 2004, when Michael Moore’s scathing anti-George W. Bush documentary, “Fahrenheit 9/11,” became an unexpected box-office hit? Bush still won a second term. The 2023 box-office smash success “Barbie,” a cotton-candy-colored act of rage against the patriarchal machine that imagined a Black woman as president, should have foreshadowed the election of Vice President Kamala Harris the following year. But it did not, and now we live in the darkest, most demented mojo dojo casa house imaginable.\n\nIt’s naive to think that popular culture doesn’t have an effect on how we think and feel about the world around us.\n\nYet it’s also naive to think that popular culture doesn’t have an effect on how we think and feel about the world around us. If it didn’t, conservatives would not be working so hard to ban so many books and Trump would not have taken over the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Pop culture has the capacity to unify people in groups large and small. When a couple hundred people watch a movie together, it feels easy to agree on a shared morality. We collectively know which characters are virtuous and which are despicable. We’re on the same team, rooting for the same heroes.\n\nDemographic data from the opening weekend of the first “Wicked” suggest that the people watching its sequel together in the coming days will be overwhelmingly female and young, part of the same youthful demos that drove significant wins for Democrats in state and local elections earlier this month. If Democrats were smart — I did say if — they would court the Elphaba-Glinda vote with the same fervor that corporate America has displayed in all those “Wicked” product tie-ins. \n\nIn one of two new songs written for “Wicked: For Good,” Elphaba sings: “Why do I love this place/That’s never loved me/A place that seems to be devolving/And even wanting to,” and, in a later verse: “When you feel you can’t fight anymore/Just tell yourself/There’s no place like home.” \n\nThese are universal lyrics, but, like so much in this destined-to-be-blockbuster, feel completely intertwined with this moment in our country’s story. If even one American who feels politically defeated by this administration hears those lyrics and is inspired to fight harder for democracy, that’s a victory.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/wicked-for-good-movie-fascism-message","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1763760659/251121-wicked-fascism-bk/251121-wicked-fascism-bk.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 11:00:00","author":"Jen Chaney","authors":["Jen Chaney"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.116},{"id":381530754,"title":"Bill Maher, Donna Brazile blast Michelle Obama’s claim that US isn’t ready for female president: ‘It’s bulls–t’","text":"Bill Maher and ex-DNC chair Donna Brazile Friday tore into former first lady Michelle Obama’s “bulls–t” claim that America is not ready for a female president.\n\nThe “Real Time” host took aim at Obama’s political cries after the 61-year-old, who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in her failed 2024 White House bid against President Trump, let loose her feelings during a book tour event at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week.\n\n“She was in the news this week, Michelle Obama. She has a book out. A coffee table book,” Maher said during his “Real Time” season finale on Friday. “Her statement, I was rather shocked by it.\n\n“To me, this is logical fallacy 101. Just because we weren’t ready or didn’t like the candidates, Hillary and Kamala, doesn’t mean we are not ready for a woman.”\n\nObama stressed she has no desire to run for president in the 2028 election amid persistent speculation because Americans allegedly proved they weren’t ready for a woman in the Oval Office.\n\n“As we saw in the past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama told actor Tracee Ellis Ross, who moderated the event in New York on Nov. 5.\n\n“That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. So don’t waste my time,” she said. “We got a lot of growing up to do and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nMaher invoked the ex-first lady’s husband, former President Barack Obama, in a rebuttal to the controversial statement.\n\n“I think it’s a bad attitude. We said we weren’t ready for a black president and someone, I can’t remember who maybe she remembers, said maybe it just has to be the right one,” the comedian quipped.\n\nBrazile, the contentious former chair of the Democratic National Committee, declared “we are ready” as she pointed out the popular vote results both Clinton and Harris received in their losses to Trump in 2016 and 2024, respectively.\n\n“Maybe we should stop talking about it and just do it,” Brazile said.\n\nClinton garnered 65.8 million votes to Trump’s 62.9 million, but lost the electoral college vote 304 to 227.\n\nEight years later, Harris – the incumbent vice president – got 75 million votes and 226 electoral votes in her landslide loss to Trump.\n\n“We are ready. Eighty percent of American people say, ‘they are ready,” Brazile said.\n\n“So the idea that America isn’t ready is bullsh–t,” she added. “They might not be ready for this one or that one.”\n\nDuring his “Club Random” podcast on Monday, Maher floated the idea that progressive darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) would be a “fantastic candidate” for the White House – if she “had some deprogramming.”\n\n“If she had some deprogramming, she could be such a fantastic candidate,” Maher said about AOC.\n\n“She’s never going to resonate with people outside of the bubble she lives in, in the very, very far left,” he added.","summary":"\"She was in the news this week, Michelle Obama.

This was a narrower margin than in 2020, when Joe Biden carried the same age group by 61 percent to Trump’s 36 percent.\n\nBecause they are an important voting bloc, if more young people move to the right, they will influence the GOP and its policy offering as it heads into future elections, including the November 2026 midterms.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAt 53-years-old Nikki Haley, represents a more traditional brand of Republican Party politics. She is pro-Israel and supports American intervention in foreign conflicts and issues and has also supported immigration when it is legal and merit-based.\n\nFor instance, in a March 2017 speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference, she declared that “the days of Israel-bashing are over” at the U.N.\n\nHer son, however, has called to stop legal immigration altogether and has purported views that are more sympathetic to isolationism. Speaking to Carlson on Wednesday night, he said foreign students should be restricted from American universities and that naturalized citizens “should not be able to hold public office.” He also criticized the concept of dual citizenship.\n\nHe also said the U.S. should stop all foreign aid to Israel and other countries. “That’s part of America first,” he said.\n\nNEW: Nikki Haley's son, Nalin Haley, says naturalized citizens should not be able to hold office, lists off all the things he sees wrong with immigration and citizenship.Here is what he said:1. \"Naturalized citizens should not be able to hold public office.\"2.

Indeed, a specific foreign policy area that has caused Republicans in general to butt heads is Israel. While the U.S. has traditionally supported Israel financially and militarily, some younger Republicans, have come out against doing so.\n\nAccording to a March survey by the Pew Research Center, 48 percent of people have a positive view of Israel, a 15 percent decrease from 2022 when 63 percent of Republicans held this view.\n\nMeanwhile, some figures associated with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement have spoken out against Israel amid its actions in Gaza, though these figures have come from other age groups too.\n\nFor some, this criticism of Israel has gone too far. On Tuesday, right-wing commentator Laura Loomer said on X that “The GOP has a Nazi problem.”\n\n“People can get mad at me for saying this, but it’s true,” she wrote, adding that while she has “no problem with people criticizing Israel” some of the commentary among Republican figures has glorified Hitler and “will cost us the midterms.\n\nMeanwhile, Calvin Jillson, a politics professor at Southern Methodist University in Texas told Newsweek: “There is a generational rift within both political parties.”\n\n“The rift has its origins in the changing media landscape,” he said. “The generation to which [Chuck] Schumer and [Mitch] McConnell belong developed their political style and worldview out of books, newspapers, and the evening news, a shared reality to which most of their generation was attuned, while the rising generation including [Zohran] Mamdani and [Nick] Fuentes learned theirs in the hothouse nether reaches of social media.

The symbolism stitched into a tote","text":"It’s the biggest political handbag since Margaret Thatcher entered 10 Downing Street with her boxy Launer London purse – in all sorts of ways.\n\n“It”, of course, is the black tote carried by Sanae Takaichi, the new prime minister of Japan.\n\nOfficially called the Grace Delight Tote, but often referred to simply as the Sanae Tote, it is a leather bag large enough to fit an A4 file.\n\nA simple rectangle with a neat silver clasp at the top and handles long enough to carry over one shoulder or in the crook of an arm, it is made by Hamano, a Japanese “leather crafts” company founded in 1880.\n\nSaori Masuda, the editor of 10 Magazine Japan, called it the “Asprey of Japan”, referring to the heritage London leather-goods house beloved of the British aristocracy.\n\nIt is available in nine different colour combinations and retails for ¥136,400 yen (approximately RM386).\n\nIt is, in other words, in no way unusual except for one thing – it is carried by the leader of a Group of 7 country, a job that usually does not involve lugging a handbag.\n\nBefore Takaichi’s election, it was almost impossible to think of a prominent female politician who actually carried a bag.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the first female prime minister of Italy, does not. Claudia Sheinbaum, the first female president of Mexico, does not.\n\nKamala Harris, the first female vice president of the US, did not. Neither did Angela Merkel during her time in office as the chancellor of Germany.\n\nDitto Hillary Clinton. Even Liz Truss did not carry a bag during her brief tenure as the British prime minister (although when she met Queen Elizabeth II, the queen had her own famous bag with her).\n\nRead more: From gowns to pantsuits, Michelle Obama looks back on her fashion as first lady\n\nAs to why, and despite the recent popularity for really big bags and the recurring desire of designers to put big bags on their runways, the answer is pretty simple – men in power do not carry briefcases, why should women?\n\nForgoing a bag simply telegraphs the impression that you have someone else to do the lifting for you.\n\nAs Karla Welch, a stylist who worked with Harris at the beginning of her term, said: “They all have bags. It’s just an aide carrying it.” (the television series Veep poked fun at this reality via an assistant to the title character, who was known variously as her “bag man” and her “body man”).\n\nThat’s why, in the final season of Succession, one character mocks another’s date for carrying a “ludicrously capacious” handbag to a family gathering.\n\nHer large Burberry bag served to symbolise her misunderstanding of the semiology of the rich and powerful, where membership means no one need schlep so much stuff on their own shoulders.\n\nGenerally, the more important the person, the smaller the bag. Now Takaichi is changing the calculus.\n\nEmi Kameoka, the fashion director of Vogue Japan, said that Takaichi’s bag serves to underscore her image as a professional woman and reinforces her campaign promise to “work and work and work and work”.\n\nIt can hold both files and tablets, and it telegraphs elegance and utility.\n\nWhether Sanae Takaichi’s tote will make its mark the same way other handbags have in political history remains to be seen. Photo: The Yomiuri Shimbun via AFP\n\nIndeed, Hamano sells the Grace Delight Tote as the bag that “answers the desires of career-minded women”.\n\nIt is also classically Japanese, Masuda said, with Hamano having been known primarily for supplying the imperial family.\n\nAnd though, as she noted, the company was previously favoured by “very conservative, non-fashion-forward women”, Takaichi’s patronage has brought it to the attention of a new generation of consumers who see her choice of the bag as a gesture of national pride.\n\nNot to mention a through line that connects Takaichi to her self-professed political hero, Thatcher, whose attachment to her own bag gave the world the term “handbagging”, meaning a surprise tongue-lashing (Takaichi also has an affinity for blue jackets and pearls, both of which were Thatcher style signatures).\n\nFor Thatcher, the handbag was a way of aligning herself with a respectable Everywoman accouterment at a time when part of the country was uncomfortable with the idea of a female leader – and a useful metaphor.\n\nHer bag was the kind of bag, British Vogue declared, carried by “a sensible, well-put-together person, reflective of an organized mind”.\n\nBut that’s not all it was.\n\nEdwina Currie, a Conservative member of Parliament and health minister for Thatcher, called the bag the prime minister’s “weapon”.\n\nThatcher herself referred to it as the only “leak proof” place in her government.\n\nIn 2013, Cynthia Crawford, her onetime personal assistant, wrote a piece in The Guardian noting that “anything that was highly secretive or precious, we would put in her handbag because we knew she was never parted from it.”\n\nRead more: Designer Fern Chua’s batik spotlights Malaysian fashion at Asean Summit\n\nThe bag became such an effective shorthand for the woman who owned it that in 1988, during Thatcher’s final state visit with Ronald Reagan, George Shultz, then secretary of state, gave her a replica of her bag to mark her entry into what he called “the Grand Order of the Handbag”.\n\nIn 2011, an Asprey bag she carried during an earlier visit sold for US$39,800 (RM165,400) at a charity auction. By the time she left office, the bags had become, according to the Margaret Thatcher Center, “potent symbols of her unyielding authority.”\n\nWhether Takaichi’s bag will have the same staying power, influence and historical resonance remains to be seen.\n\nBut it has already inspired a spike in sales, as well as numerous breathless reports about a “nationwide craze” and “viral sensation”.\n\n“People are paying attention to what she is wearing, much more than they did for male politicians,” Kameoka said.\n\nAnd this particular accessory is, by dint of its size, impossible to miss.\n\nIndeed, according to the Hamano website, the company has had so many requests for the black Grace Delight Tote that its current production run is sold out, and the company is “currently receiving orders equivalent to approximately 10 months’ worth of factory production”.\n\nHamano currently plans to ship the bag at the end of August next year. – ©2025 The New York Times Company\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/style/2025/11/22/can-fashion-do-the-heavy-lifting-in-politics-the-symbolism-stitched-into-a-tote","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/11/21/3634179.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 07:00:00","author":"Agency","authors":["Agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.247},{"id":381487080,"title":"What does the US Congress want with Australia’s eSafety commissioner?","text":"In the lead-up to the much-discussed social media ban taking effect, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant is often in the headlines.\n\nFor all the attention she’s been getting, Inman Grant probably didn’t expect any of it to come from a foreign government committee, calling her to answer for a so-called “censorship regime”.\n\nBut the US House Committee on the Judiciary has asked her to appear before it to testify about laws governing the internet.\n\nChair of the committee, Republican Jim Jordan, was blunt in his request. In a letter to the commissioner, he wrote:\n\nas a primary enforcer of Australia’s OSA [Online Safety Act] and noted zealot for global take-downs, you are uniquely positioned to provide information about the law’s free speech implications […]\n\nWhile it seems an unusual move, censorship has grown into a hot-button issue in the United States. Inman Grant finds herself at the centre of a perfect storm of rhetoric, politicking and fierce American individualism.\n\nDoes she have to testify?\n\nThe committee has no jurisdiction over the activities of the Australian government. Indeed, it does not even have jurisdiction over US-Australian diplomatic relations, which are the provenance of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee can call anyone it wants to come and testify at a hearing, but potential witnesses outside the US cannot be compelled to do so. This means Inman Grant can decide whether she wants to appear.\n\nJordan, the committee’s chair, is a member of the House Freedom Caucus: a formal group of around 45 mostly libertarian conservatives in the Republican Party in the House. \n\nThe caucus does not necessarily represent the views of most Republicans. It has often been in conflict with House Republican leadership. \n\nMounting cynicism\n\nThe issue of internet censorship is fraught in US politics. At the height of the COVID pandemic, this issue became even more heated and controversial. \n\nMany Americans were very upset to learn the Biden administration worked with Facebook to censor posts about the pandemic. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who testified before the Judiciary Committee about this issue last year, has vowed his company would never do so again. \n\nOn his first full day in office this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning government from censoring social media. \n\nThe backlash from Americans against any kind of censorship has at least two sources. The first the generalised resistance to taking any kind of direction from the government. \n\nAmericans don’t want to be told “no” by their government. Whether it’s guns, drugs, gambling, abortion, gay marriage or even seatbelts, Americans don’t want to be told what to do (although after a few years of clever advocacy, Americans accepted the need to wear seatbelts). \n\nThe idea that their own government would censor their social media posts – no matter how wrong that post might be on the facts or how counterproductive to the public interest – is anathema to many Americans. \n\nSecond, the backlash against the US government, specifically for actions taken during the COVID pandemic, has been fairly broad. Americans have criticised mask mandates, social distancing, working from home, and other measures taken to reduce exposure to the coronavirus. \n\nWhile there certainly has been a lot of disinformation regarding COVID, the policies of and information from the US government itself during the pandemic have been widely criticised as ineffective or wrong-headed.\n\nThe confusing politics and fraught policies from the pandemic era have made many Americans – particularly represented by the Freedom Caucus – much more sceptical of government actions generally.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that politicians like Jordan cast a wide net in the quest against censorship, real and imagined.\n\nGhosts of disputes past\n\nOf course, many of the large social media platforms and internet technology companies are American (X, Meta, Google and Amazon, among others). \n\nThe people who run these companies have generally made a point of getting along with Trump and his administration. They are often seen funding his initiatives and supporting his policies. \n\nNo doubt they also would have done this if Kamala Harris had won the presidency. \n\nBecause VPN (virtual private network) technology can allow individual users to escape national restrictions, some foreign governments have asked American companies to take down all posts globally on a certain topic. \n\nThis is what Inman Grant did in the commission’s case against X, owned by former Trump administration figurehead Elon Musk. The commission wanted video of Wakeley church stabbing in Sydney removed everywhere, not just in Australia. eSafety ultimately dropped the case in 2024.\n\n Read more:\n Elon Musk vs Australia: global content take-down orders can harm the internet if adopted widely\n\nJordan cites this case in his letter to the commissioner. It clearly struck a sour note.\n\nThese sorts of requests, if granted, affect Americans because they wouldn’t have access to those posts. Libertarians in particular do not react well to this possibility, and that means it won’t land well with Congress. \n\nThe position of the House Judiciary Committee does not represent American foreign policy. Jordan, however, is an influential member of Congress and generally friendly with Trump. Jordan’s advocacy may come to impact Trump’s foreign policy, but for the time being, Inman Grant doesn’t have too much to worry about.","summary":"Julie Inman Grant has been asked to testify to Congress.

Aftyn Behn, who is running against Republican Matt Van Epps in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District special election, also worked as a regional organizing director for the nonprofit activist group Indivisible prior to becoming a state legislator. The radical left-wing entity was also a frequent advocate for stripping funding from police departments, calling it \"critical,\" during the height of the defund movement. \"Where's the proposal that dissolves @MNPDNashville,\" Behn questioned on an old social media account, which has since been deleted, in response to a separate social media post from a Nashville City Council member indicating local officials had submitted a \"substitute budget proposal\" aiming to strip Nashville police of $2.6 million in funding. \"If it's been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police … we can do it and there is a world,\" Behn subsequently said during an interview with a local Nashville advocacy group. Behn's comments largely came during the height of the \"defund the police\" movement in 2020 and 2021 following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Amid violent protests that often devolved into dangerous rioting and looting following Floyd's death, Behn also downplayed the violence that was occurring and ridiculed white people for criticizing the looting, stating it was simply how minority communities were expressing their grief over Floyd's death. KAMALA HARRIS RETURNS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN TRUMP COUNTRY TO BACK ‘AOC OF TENNESSEE’ \"Looks like Aftyn is getting a visit from the Ghost of Wokeness Past,\" quipped Republican strategist Matt Gorman. \"Democrats over and over have been haunted by their past positions they thought they could hide from. Ask Kamala Harris about her advocacy of taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for illegal immigrant convicts on how that goes.\" Behn did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, Democrat strategist Eric Koch argued that attacks on Behn have been surging because \"Republicans are getting worried in a district that Trump won by over 20 points,\" adding that Democrats making this race competitive shows they are in good shape to take back the House in the midterms next year. Behn's special election is slated to take place on Dec. 2. While popular in the immediate aftermath following Floyd's death, the push to \"defund the police\" has become a political liability for many Democrats running in recent elections. New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced criticism in the lead up to his victory for his past anti-police rhetoric, which Mamdani ultimately went on Fox News to apologize for. Earlier this month, a progressive candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan, was reported to have quietly deleted old social media posts he made in support of defunding the police. DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL VOWS TO HELP WORKING CLASS DESPITE RECORD OF HIKING TAXES \"I’m currently involved in a transformative justice seminar, and so it’s how to imagine a world without police and what that looks like and what community mechanisms look like. How people cannot police themselves,\" Behn said during an interview with Nashville Musicians For Change in July 2020. \"If it’s been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police, please tune in to, maybe not this episode, but the next one. Because I’ll talk about things I’m learning and growing as an organizer. Because I think, especially for those of us that are young, and talking to our parents about what police abolition looks like, that we can do it and there is a world.\" Behn's comments came amidst her work with the left-wing nonprofit Indivisible, which itself also has a record of pushing to defund the police, calling the effort \"critical\" in order to \"keep everyone safe,\" in a Facebook post in 2020. The same year, the group called on people to phone their local, state and federal lawmakers to demand for policies and budgets that steer money away from police departments and toward \"Black communities.\" \"Good morning, especially to the 54% of Americans that believe burning down a police station is justified,\" Behn said in another post she made, which came in response to polling about who saw the destruction of a Minneapolis police precinct as justified, versus not. The precinct was ultimately razed to the ground and police were forced to abandon the precinct as it burned down. Amid the chaos spurred by the death of Floyd that resulted in billions of dollars in damage and multiple lives lost, Behn was also co-hosting a podcast at the time. During one of the episodes, titled \"Black Lives Matter,\" Behn argued that it \"is not for us to decide as privileged white people how marginalized communities express their suffering and their pain and their grieving,\" referring to the looting and the rioting that was taking place. Behn called it \"a trope\" for white people to say the looting was bad. \"I would really challenge all of you when you see these stories of looting and you revert to this law and order type of response, I really challenge you to step back from that and think about what's driving that,\" Behn added about the rioting. \"You should not condemn it because you don’t know the first thing about being where they come from and what their generational trauma that has been inflicted upon them by the police, by institutional racism.\" SCOOP: TRUMP-ALIGNED MAGA INC. JUMPS INTO HIGH STAKES BALLOT BOX CONGRESSIONAL SHOWDOWN During the same podcast episode, Behn suggested the police don't actually serve to guard and protect Americans. \"You think calling the cops is going to save you?\" Behn asked her listeners. \"Black men are being killed when white women call cops.\" Behn also came under fire this week for other comments on her podcast, during which she said she hated her city of Nashville and all the southern-style elements that come with it, like country music. Meanwhile, in addition to Behn's remarks in interviews and on podcasts, the Democrat House hopeful also repeatedly espoused defund the police rhetoric on a now-deleted X account, which was formerly Twitter at the time. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP For example, Behn responded to a post, claiming \"the Los Angeles teachers union\" was demanding a commitment to \"defund the police\" before they would commit to returning to in-person learning for students, with a response that called on teachers in her state to do the same. The post Behn was responding to also called for more similar demands across the country. \"Let's go Tennessee teachers! We have your back!!!!,\" Behn wrote in response to the post. \"Your individual positive experiences with cops do not outweigh the fact that the entire criminal justice system was built on institutionalized racism,\" another post Behn shared on her now-deleted Twitter account stated.","summary":"Aftyn Behn, Dem candidate for Tennessee&apos;s upcoming special election, has a history of calling to &apos;abolish&apos; and &apos;defund&apos; the police in now-deleted social media posts","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-house-hopeful-exposed-far-left-activist-pushing-abolish-police-weeks-before-special-election","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/aftyn-behn-tennesse-congressional-primary-election-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 23:43:42","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":381401590,"title":"Donald Trump’s pursuit of celebrity validation dragged Brittany Mahomes into an unexpected political storm","text":"Long before the 2024 election cycle intensified, one of the more unexpected political dust-ups involved former president Donald Trump and Kansas City Chiefs WAG Brittany Mahomes. The story resurfaced months later, partly because it revealed just how intensely Trump courted and weaponized celebrity approval. At the time, fans noticed Brittany had quietly interacted with posts tied to Trump’s 2024 platform, a move that immediately clashed with her public friendship with Taylor Swift, who had endorsed Kamala Harris and urged voters to choose “calm and not chaos.” What followed was a spectacle fueled less by policy and more by Trump’s fixation on star power, turning a small digital interaction into a headline-making moment.Donald Trump’s hunger for star endorsements put Brittany Mahomes and Sydney Sweeney in the spotlightOnce fans detected Brittany Mahomes’ likes on Trump-aligned posts, including one supporting “Trump-Vance 2024”, online speculation erupted. Many wondered whether political differences would threaten the high-profile camaraderie between Mahomes and Swift. Trump, however, didn’t wait for the conversation to unfold naturally.He rushed to Truth Social, triumphantly posting, “I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country.”He doubled down during a Fox News appearance, adding, “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better… She’s a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan.” The moment underscored something observers had long noted: Trump saw celebrity backing as political currency.That same instinct emerged again when he learned actress Sydney Sweeney was a registered Republican amid backlash surrounding her American Eagle campaign. Caught off guard yet thrilled, he said, “She’s a registered Republican? Oh, now I love her ad… If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”Predictably, he took the celebration back to Truth Social, calling her spot the “HOTTEST” and urging fans to buy the jeans.In hindsight, these episodes illustrated how Trump’s need for cultural relevance often overshadowed the political moment itself. Brittany Mahomes’ casual social-media engagement wasn’t a policy endorsement, but Trump’s amplification turned it into a firestorm, pulling a sports celebrity into a political narrative she never publicly claimed.Also Read: “Not be able to walk”: Patrick Mahomes’ mom Randi shares emotional health confession after completing challenging Colorado hikeGet an chance to win ₹5000 Amazon Voucher by taking part in India's Biggest Habit Index!

Now, lawsuits are piling up","text":"In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that the facility had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.\n\nSix months later, an Alameda County jury found another facility had violated the rights of 71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.\n\nIn February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against a nursing home accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. \n\nAnd next spring, trial is scheduled to begin in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice in another Alameda County facility; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.\n\nAll of these facilities have one thing in common: state records list Shlomo Rechnitz as an owner.\n\nCourt documents show Rechnitz and his companies have denied all allegations in all of the cases. Mark Johnson, an attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities and one of his main companies, Brius LLC, said in an email that facilities cannot comment on active litigation. \n\n“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” he said. \n\nJohnson sought to distance his clients from the cases, saying that Rechnitz and his wife, Tamar, “are passive owners of the facilities” and have “absolutely no role in operations or management.” Johnson said “the licensees” contract with a company to manage the facilities, adding that “each facility has all the necessary resources for patients and staff.”\n\nRechnitz has been on the state’s radar for years. In 2014, then-Attorney General Kamala Harris attempted to prevent him from purchasing new homes. In 2018, the State Auditor’s Office found his companies had significantly higher rates of federal deficiencies and complaints than the rest of the state’s care facilities.\n\nIn 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired the homes. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. \n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.\n\nNow elder care advocates say he is Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens. They say the state could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.\n\nWendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”\n\nYork brought the lawsuit in 2021 alleging that one of Rechnitz’ companies’ facilities, Windsor Redding Care Center, was responsible for the COVID-related deaths of some 24 elderly and dependent residents. Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, previously said the company “vehemently” disagrees with the allegations in the case, which is headed to trial early next year.\n\nThere are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”\n\nJohnson called it “crucial to note that California is one of the only states in the country to provide zero liability protection for healthcare providers during the unprecedented pandemic.”\n\n“This is particularly noteworthy since nursing homes were the front line in trying to protect our frail and elderly,” he said.\n\nAt least one of the cases against Rechnitz’ facilities includes allegations about his own conduct. A man suing Rechnitz and his companies over a relative’s injuries wrote in a sworn declaration filed in court that Rechnitz attempted to intimidate and bribe him with Lakers tickets during an unexpected phone call on the eve of his scheduled testimony in Los Angeles County Superior Court. \n\nJohnson, the attorney representing Rechnitz’ facilities, called allegations about threats “completely false and defamatory.” A judge ruled the conversation could not be introduced as evidence.\n\nIn another case, Rechnitz and his wife Tamar in discovery disclosed their net worth: $786 million. \n\nTony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.\n\n “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.\n\nJohnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, did not comment on the disclosure of the family’s wealth when CalMatters asked him.\n\n‘Heightened monitoring’ for two years\n\nThe Department of Public Health has for years refused CalMatters’ requests for an interview about licensing issues related to Rechnitz’ companies’ homes. They again declined requests for an interview for this story. They did not provide a reason. \n\nInstead, spokesman Mark Smith, said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.” In response to CalMatters’ questions about facilities in which Rechnitz is listed as an owner, Smith noted that the department had “negotiated for and obtained heightened monitoring authority and additional enforcement powers, beyond those applicable to other skilled nursing facilities, for a period of two years at 24 of this provider’s locations.” \n\nThat period has ended.\n\n“This does not mean our department will avoid holding this provider or their facilities accountable,” he said. “We will continue to monitor these locations as appropriate, enforce and cite for regulatory violations if needed, and take further corrective action if necessary.”\n\nA CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed as having an ownership stake. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. \n\n1. In the past three years, the 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.2. A higher proportion of these facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of the facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.3. The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.4. The facilities had comparably low federal quality ratings: Almost 58% of these facilities had recent ratings of one or two stars (out of five), compared with slightly over 37% of facilities statewide.\n\nJohnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, noted in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which he said issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.\n\nHe also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’ facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.\n\nKamala Harris’ intervention\n\nBack in 2014, Rechnitz bid on 18 Country Villa nursing homes in federal bankruptcy court. Then Attorney General Harris was so concerned with his track record that she filed an emergency motion to prevent him from purchasing or managing the homes, describing him as “ a serial violator of rules within the skilled nursing industry.” At the time, Rechnitz’ attorney characterized the remarks as “ defamatory ” and “ outrageous.” \n\nThe purchase went through. \n\nRechnitz then submitted change-of-ownership applications seeking licenses to run those homes. Rather than approving or denying them, CalMatters found that the state Department of Public Health simply left his applications in “pending” status for years. Despite that, his companies were allowed to continue operating the homes.\n\nIn 2015, he applied for licenses for five Windsor nursing homes. The next year, the department denied the change of ownership applications, but again allowed Rechnitz’ companies to operate them. \n\nIn her scathing 2018 report, the state auditor Elaine Howle criticized the California Department of Public Health, saying weak oversight and licensing lapses increased risk to nursing home residents. \n\nIn an effort to address these issues, the Legislature passed a law in 2022 to close a loophole that had allowed nursing home operators to run facilities without first receiving licenses. The law required the Department of Public Health to look at an applicant’s track record over several years before granting a license.\n\nBut before that law took effect the following year, the Department of Public Health suddenly granted Rechnitz and his companies many of the licenses it had previously left pending or outright denied. The group includes nursing homes that were the focus of recent lawsuits, such as Country Villa Wilshire, the Los Angeles-area facility where a jury awarded $2.34 million after a woman allegedly fell repeatedly due to understaffing; Windsor Redding, where the 24 patients died during a COVID outbreak; and Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland, where complaints filed in Alameda County Superior Court allege a woman was sexually assaulted twice and a man died after being given too much medication.\n\nEd Dudensing, a Sacramento-based attorney who specializes in elder abuse in nursing homes, is bringing the case in Alameda County Superior Court alleging that neglect and poor staffing allowed a fellow patient to rape 79-year-old Cheryl Doe on multiple occasions while she stayed at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland. He is also representing the family of 64-year-old Alando Williams in the lawsuit against the same facility alleging overmedication and wrongful death.\n\nDudensing has three other active cases against facilities affiliated with Rechnitz and his web of companies alleging neglect, abuse and wrongful death. \n\nIn one of them, 78-year-old Barbara Pendley allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. \n\nNorth Point was another facility that the state opted to grant Rechnitz and his companies the license for under the 2023 settlement agreement. \n\nRechnitz and his companies have filed legal responses denying allegations in all of these cases, several of which are scheduled to go to trial in the coming year. \n\n“We’ve just got to keep fighting,” Dudensing said.\n\n“There was a time when there was a lot of scrutiny and that’s obviously well-documented,” he said. “But he managed to slip through.”\n\nCassie Dunham, the previous deputy director of the Center for Health Care Quality for the California Department of Public Health, last year became chief executive and president of the California Association of Health Facilities, the industry’s lobbying group. Through a spokesperson, Dunham declined an interview for this story citing her involvement with the development of departmental policy during the time that the state granted Rechnitz the licenses.\n\nCorey Egel, a spokesman for the industry group and himself a former spokesman for the Department of Public Health, said in a statement that the association “supports strong, transparent oversight but believes the system would benefit from clearer timelines, more consistent application of standards, and more efficient resolution of pending cases — so that regulatory goals and resident care priorities can both be met.”\n\nPatient lawsuit at newly licensed nursing home\n\nAmong the facilities that Rechnitz’ companies received a state license to run in 2023 was Country Villa Wilshire, an 81-bed Los Angeles nursing home. \n\nAccording to a lawsuit against the facility, 84-year-old Betsy Jentz landed there in November 2020 after she fell and fractured her ribs and hip. Prior to her injuries, the complaint stated that Jentz had been in excellent health; her attorneys said she had run 27 marathons.\n\nBut during the next year, according to a plaintiff’s brief, Jentz fell at least 10 times. On some of these occasions, she hit her head, suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder and a fractured pelvis. The complaint also described malnutrition and severe pressure ulcers. It attributed those injuries to neglect. In court filings, Rechnitz and his companies have denied all responsibility.\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 28, 2024, Jentz’ great nephew Derek Skylar Aud was preparing to testify in court the next morning. Then, according to court documents, he received an unexpected phone call.\n\nThe man on the other end of the line introduced himself as Shlomo Rechnitz, Aud later wrote in a declaration filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. \n\nOver the course of more than an hour, Rechnitz allegedly told Aud that “things would get very nasty” for him and Jentz if Aud testified, the declaration said. Rechnitz allegedly said he would prolong the case for years and bring to light damaging information his private investigators had collected about Jentz. \n\nHe also said his private investigators had learned that Jentz loved basketball, and said she could receive courtside Lakers tickets “right next to LeBron James” if she agreed to a side deal, Aud told the court.\n\nRechnitz did not directly respond to these allegations in court, and the judge ultimately did not allow the jury to consider the phone call to Aud in making its decision. \n\nAttorneys from Lanzone Morgan, a Long Beach law firm that specializes in nursing home abuse, represented Jentz and Aud in their case against Country Villa Wilshire. They said that the judge accepted defense attorneys’ argument that the call constituted “confidential settlement discussions” and did not allow the jury to hear testimony about it. Gittler & Berg and Ekpebe Law Group, the law firms that represented Rechnitz and his companies in the case, did not respond to CalMatters’ requests for comment. The jury’s $2.34 million verdict is now being appealed.\n\nLanzone Morgan also brought the case against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness that ended in the $7.6 million judgment in August. The case is in a post-trial phase in which the judge is determining how to apportion the liability among defendants.\n\nRockport Healthcare Services, the administrative services company for many of the homes, is also named in some of the lawsuits, including the one against Alameda Healthcare & Wellness. Rockport is owned by Steven Stroll, who has also served as Rechnitz’ accountant. Rockport has filed responses in court denying responsibility for the allegations. \n\nElizabeth Kim, an attorney with Lanzone Morgan, said she wants to see the Department of Public Health stop issuing licenses to Rechnitz and “other bad actors.”\n\n“It’s shocking to me that he’s able to get licenses after he pretty much runs many of his facilities into the ground,” she said. She referred to an Aug. 22 trial in which Rechnitz acknowledged owning a private plane and having recently sold a home in Los Angeles for $23 million. \n\nHer client, Aud, whose great aunt Jentz died in January 2025 a few months after the jury made its decision, wrote in his declaration to the court:\n\n“I continue to feel uneasy about the calls and threats and I carry the fear of retaliation with me daily…I do live in fear that Mr. Rechnitz is now even more furious and that he will make good on his threats.”\n\nCalMatters Data Reporter Erica Yee contributed to this story.\n\nThis story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/mark-smith-general-news-nursing-homes-california-courts-56efffa2fd9da5dc3af765886a7b2819","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3a1cb52/2147483647/strip/false/crop/700x450+0+0/resize/700x450!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 22:09:39","author":"Jocelyn Wiener/calmatters","authors":["Jocelyn Wiener/calmatters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":381390794,"title":"Trump lands another legal victory as lawsuit against Iowa pollster, Des Moines Register remains in state court","text":"FIRST ON FOX — President Donald Trump scored yet another legal victory Friday when the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit shut down Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer’s appeal, reinforcing that the president’s \"election interference\" lawsuit will now land in Iowa State Court. Trump’s legal team has accused Selzer and The Des Moines Register of \"brazen election interference\" with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump originally requested the case be moved to Iowa State Court in May after the defendants \"removed\" the case to federal court. A federal judge denied the request at the time, but the Obama-appointed judge was overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. TRUMP SCORES LEGAL WIN, GETTING LAWSUIT AGAINST IOWA POLLSTER, DES MOINES REGISTER MOVED TO STATE COURT Trump last month notched a key victory when the 8th Circuit granted Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus — a rare judicial order used to correct clear legal errors — and directed a district judge to treat the case as dismissed \"without prejudice,\" allowing Trump to refile the case. As a result, the case would be litigated in Iowa State Court. The defendants petitioned the 8th Circuit for relief but were shut down. \"The petition for rehearing en banc is denied. The petition for rehearing by the panel is denied,\" Clerk of Court Susan Bindler ruled. Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), who represents Selzer, issued a statement. \"This procedural decision doesn't change what has been true from the beginning — this frivolous claim is entirely without substance and that fact ultimately will be borne out in court,\" Corn-Revere told Fox News Digital. FORMER POLLSTER ANN SELZER HITS BACK AT CRITICISMS OVER IOWA POLL: 'THEY ARE ACCUSING ME OF A CRIME' A spokesman for Trump's legal team told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in deception and fake news to account. The Des Moines Register and Gannett knowingly ran a phony poll from the now disgraced Democrat pollster Ann Selzer in an underhanded attempt to interfere in the election and defraud the country into believing Kamala Harris was winning the state of Iowa and nationwide, mere hours before she lost Iowa and the overall election by an overwhelming margin to President Trump. \"This scam was designed to damage President Trump’s dominant campaign in the final days of the race. Such fraud cannot be allowed to stand, and President Trump is committed to seeing this case through to a just, winning conclusion.\" Lark-Marie Antón, a spokesperson for The Des Moines Register's parent company, Gannett, previously said the case belongs in federal court. \"We are assessing the court’s decision. Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit. In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly,\" Antón told Fox News Digital last month. Gannett did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. TRUMP’S LAWSUIT MOVES TO IOWA STATE COURT: WHAT’S NEXT IN HIS CASE AGAINST POLLSTER, DES MOINES REGISTER Selzer released her final Des Moines Register-sponsored poll showing Harris leading Trump by three points in Iowa just three days before the election. That shock poll showed a seven-point shift from Trump to Harris from September, when he had a four-point lead over the vice president in the same poll. Selzer’s poll was hyped up by the media in the days leading up to the election as her polling predictions had been historically accurate. Many suggested it implied a monumental shift in Midwest support for Harris in a red state, but the poll turned out to be way off. Trump thumped Harris in Iowa by more than 13 percentage points, the third straight time he'd won the state and the first time any candidate had won there by double digits since 1980. Shortly after the election, Selzer announced she was done with election polling and moving on to \"other ventures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Lindsay Kornick and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.","summary":"President Trump has accused Selzer and The Des Moines Register of &quot;brazen election interference&quot; with their final 2024 Iowa presidential poll that showed him trailing Democrat Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-lands-another-legal-victory-lawsuit-against-iowa-pollster-des-moines-register-remains-state-court","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/trump-iowa-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:39:17","author":"Brian Flood","authors":["Brian Flood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":381407280,"title":"At Dick Cheney’s Funeral, Talk of “Spontaneous Combustion,” Unlikely Democratic Reverence, and No Mention of Iraq","text":"That’s because Cheney’s family had pointedly not invited Donald J. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance. Not that they would have come; Trump hasn’t even mentioned Cheney since his death two weeks ago at the age of 84, and federal flags were quietly lowered to half-staff. But given the scrambled, kaleidoscopic nature of this moment in American politics, Trump and his VP weren’t the only major no-shows. Former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were also conspicuously absent. It wasn’t immediately clear why, though a Clinton spokesperson told USA Today that he had a scheduling conflict. But for many, evidently the wounds of Cheney’s controversial vice presidency have yet to heal.\nStrange bedfellows were everywhere. As the ceremony began, Cheney’s old boss George W. Bush chatted amiably with Joe Biden, who, despite his recent bout with aggressive prostate cancer, looked fitter than he has in years. Nearby sat three vice presidents who, in different and dramatic ways, had seen their presidential hopes immolate: Clinton’s Al Gore, Trump’s Mike Pence, and Biden’s Kamala Harris.\nDick Cheney was possibly the most disliked vice president of all. He was the co-architect of the Iraq war and an unabashed defender of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques after the attacks of 9/11. Cheney, along with his partner Bush, helped pave the way for the populist revolution of Trump and his MAGA movement. Yet at the time Cheney wore his dismal approval rating like a badge of honor and relished being caricatured as Darth Vader.\nBut there was another Cheney—a kinder, gentler one, recalled in eulogies by his cardiologist Dr. Jonathan Reiner and notably by George W. Bush. In remarks that never mentioned 9/11, Iraq, or the 2008 financial meltdown, Bush praised Cheney’s judgment, reticence, loyalty, and humor. In a touching tribute, Cheney’s granddaughter Grace Perry spoke movingly of how much Grandpa loved driving her to rodeos across Wyoming in his pickup truck (without using GPS).\nIn multiple interviews for documentaries and books over the years, I got to know this Cheney. As President Gerald Ford’s 34-year-old chief, he’d been the toast of Washington, DC—known for his wry sense of humor, humility, and uncanny ability to forge consensus. For reasons no one knows for certain, as vice president, Cheney’s worldview became bleaker, his disposition darker. It became almost a parlor game among his old friends and colleagues: What in the world happened to Cheney?\nWhen her turn came to speak, Liz Cheney barely mentioned her father’s accomplishments as vice president. Instead, she dwelled on his belief in freedom and democracy, his conviction that “a choice between defense of the Constitution and defense of your political party was no choice at all.” It was a direct shot at Trump, though she didn’t name him. And she spoke of the cherished time she spent with her father in his final years. By then Dick Cheney had morphed from Darth Vader to “Rodeo Grandpa,” as his granddaughter titled him. But to many of the assembled mourners, he’d also become a kind of dark knight of the Trump resistance, standing shoulder to shoulder with his daughter to oppose what they regarded as Trump’s assault on the Constitution and the rule of law.\nOn the eve of Trump’s first election, in the fall of 2016, I called Cheney, who was accompanying Liz as she campaigned for her Wyoming congressional seat. After two rings, he picked up. “Mr. Vice President, where are you?” I asked. He replied: “Right now, I’m having coffee at a McDonald’s in Laramie, Wyoming.” He paused for a beat. “I used to run things. Now I’m the chauffeur.” I could tell he was right where he wanted to be.\nA week later, the age of Trump began.\nRiding back to my hotel in an Uber from Dick Cheney’s funeral service, I saw a forlorn-looking figure standing by himself on a street corner in Georgetown. It was John Brennan, looking over his shoulder.","summary":"Washington’s old guard turned out to pay respects, with Biden, Harris, Pence, and Bush in attendance, and Trump and Vance conspicuously absent.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/dick-cheneys-funeral-talk-of-spontaneous-combustion","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69209bd75e76db09cca67df9/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf1125-cheney-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:31:59","author":"Chris Whipple","authors":["Chris Whipple"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.049},{"id":381383076,"title":"Arizona attorney general asks state supreme court to revive case against Trump’s 2020 allies","text":"An appeals court upheld that order, and Mayes had until Friday to ask the state’s high court, consider seeking a new indictment or dropping the case altogether. Mayes’ bid to resuscitate the long-stalled case ensures it will be a live issue for months, including as she seeks reelection in 2026.\n\nThe indictment described Trump himself as the unindicted mastermind of a plot to subvert the 2020 election, pressuring state officials to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state, enlisting allies to sign false paperwork claiming to be legitimate presidential electors and using their signatures to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his unique role in the process to stop Biden’s victory.\n\nAmong those facing charges are former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn and Christina Bobb and a group of 11 “false electors” — including former state GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward. One of those electors who signed the false Electoral College paperwork has already pleaded guilty for her role.\n\nThe grand jury that indicted Trump’s allies initially considered indicting Trump himself but was urged against doing so by prosecutors. But the unusually aggressive grand jury delved deeply into the allegations against Trump and his inner circle ahead of its indictment.\n\nThe case’s original judge, Bruce Cohen, recused last year after defendants discovered he had emailed colleagues on the court urging them to reject attacks against Kamala Harris rooted in race and gender.

Nevada’s Supreme Court earlier this month revived a case against six Republicans “false electors” that had been stalled over questions about the proper venue.

It is the latest blow for Summers after he was put on leave from his teaching gig at Harvard University this week. \n\nThe Obama and Clinton administration alum worked for the wildly lucrative investment firm “off-site” from Boston, a stone’s throw from Harvard’s Cambridge campus, and reported to one of the firm’s managing directors, Max Stone, the insiders said.\n\nHis first stint with the New York-based powerhouse began in 2006 when he joined as a managing director, bringing with him his long-time trusted adviser, Michael O’Mary, who joined the following year, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe one-time Harvard president left in late 2008 to become President Barack Obama’s top economics guru before returning as a consultant after Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary quit government for the second time.\n\nDE Shaw saw its algorithm-driven trades make it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine.\n\nThe firm was founded by major Democratic donor David E. Shaw, who helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe company’s top brass have been some of the most vocal champions of DEI on Wall Street while effectively slapping gag orders on former employees, as The Post has previously reported.\n\nThe one-time president of the top college has also stepped back as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nIt comes amid revelations that Summers flew to Saint James on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express” with his wife, Elisa F. New, shortly after their Dec. 11, 2005, wedding in Cambridge.\n\nThey were accompanied by the disgraced financier’s infamous British madam, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted on sex trafficking charges, the Harvard Crimson reported Thursday.\n\nThe island getaway came six months after Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein for the rape of a 14-year-old girl, with a search warrant later executed on his mansion in October 2005.\n\nFlight logs show Summers flew to the 72-acre Caribbean island on Dec. 21, 2005 — and took Epstein’s jet, allegedly used to ferry victims and accomplices in his sex-trafficking rings, three other times.\n\nEmails released by a Dem-led congressional oversight panel also show the two men appeared to have had a close relationship right up to Epstein’s arrest in July six years ago.\n\nThe pervy pair often discussed women, politics and Harvard-related business in hundreds of emails exchanged between 2013 and 2019, according to the treasure trove of messages.\n\nIn one missive, Summers joked that women were less intelligent than men.\n\n“I observed that half the IQ in world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population,” Summers wrote Epstein in October 2017, without providing further context.\n\nIn another online back-and-forth in March 2019, Summers asked Epstein for romantic advice.\n\n“I dint [sic] want to be in a gift-giving competition while being the friend without benefits,” Summers told Epstein while discussing his pursuit of a woman, adding that “she must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.”\n\nSummers — who helmed the elite university between 2001 and 2006 and was a tenured economics professor there since 1983 — resigned from the board of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, on Wednesday amid a firestorm over his ties to the infamous predator.","summary":"Sources said Summers was still listed as an adviser on the company's internal directory as recently as this morning.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/business/larry-summers-forced-out-of-consulting-gig-at-woke-hedge-fund-de-shaw-after-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/115973873.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/skQfoq0v-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:24:49","author":"James Franey","authors":["James Franey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":381384344,"title":"The Real Reason Eric Swalwell Is Running for Governor","text":"Swalwell, who represents California’s solidly blue 14th district, entered the already crowded Democratic primary, which suggests that his campaign is more about positioning than governing. Think about it, do you think it’s a coincidence he’s jumping in just as Katie Porter’s support keeps slipping and Sen. Alex Padilla declared he’s not running? He seems primed to jump in and become the frontrunner. But I don’t buy for a second that he wants to be governor.\n\nHis messaging gives the game away. “I'm running for Governor because prices are too high and people are scared. California's next governor has two jobs,” his campaign website says. “One, keep the worst president in history out of our homes, out of our streets, and out of our lives.’\n\nHe’s not talking about Barack Obama or Joe Biden.\n\nI will be California's fighter and protector. Our state is under attack. The President has militarized our streets, canceled cancer research, zeroed out clean energy climate projects, and is chasing our immigrant friends and neighbors through their workplaces, kids' schools, and houses of worship. A lot of candidates talk about taking on Trump. I'm taking him on in real time. My January 6 lawsuit is one of the only lawsuits against the President that survived his new presidency. Speaker Pelosi selected me to help lead his impeachment, and today, I'm leading the Democrats' effort in the House to investigate January 6.\n\nDoes this sound like a guy who’s running for governor of California, or is he hoping to position himself as the face of the anti-Trump resistance in California with the ultimate goal of setting up another presidential run?\n\nI think we all know the answer.\n\nSwalwell holds a locked-down blue district with no term limits, so he doesn’t face pressure to give up his seat. An open Senate seat in California could take years to materialize. The governor’s race gives him a real shot to establish himself as a key figure of the Trump resistance.\n\nThe political landscape also lines up in his favor.\n\nA successful bid for governor would give him a whole year to posture as California’s Trump-Resister-in-Chief. At the same time, former Governor Gavin Newsom has to spend the entire time clinging to relevance without any actual power to wield.\n\nOf course, Swalwell’s run isn’t without baggage. The cloud of a scandal involving an affair with a Chinese spy while he was on the House Intelligence Committee hangs over him like a guillotine. That, combined with his public image issues, will offer easy ammunition for rival candidates eager to derail his ambitions.\n\nRecommended: Bill and Hillary Clinton Ordered to Testify on Jeffrey Epstein\n\nHis original presidential run was underwhelming at best, and this latest gambit seems calculated to create a fresh narrative as the evergreen Trump adversary. Holding California’s top office would give Swalwell a platform, visibility, and a storyline to re-enter the national spotlight with a vengeance. It’s less about governing and more about positioning for what he really wants: the Oval Office.\n\nDo you remember Swalwell’s 2020 presidential campaign? I can’t blame you if you don’t, because it barely got off the ground. It was like a loud fart that vanished quickly. He entered the Democratic primary with a pitch built on youth and energy, aiming to set himself apart from Biden and the other older contenders. \n\nVoters never bought it. His fundraising stalled, his polling stayed flat. By midsummer, his campaign ran out of gas due to a lack of money and momentum. He bowed out in July 2019 after only three months as a candidate. Even Kamala Harris held on longer. In the end, Democrats chose the old white guy instead of the young white guy. \n\nSwalwell is clearly taking a page from Gavin Newsom’s playbook. He’s watched the governor turn Sacramento into a launching pad for a 2028 presidential run, and now he wants his own spotlight. By making a play for the governorship, Swalwell isn’t just aiming for a promotion; he’s positioning himself to leapfrog Newsom and grab the Democratic nomination for himself.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/21/the-real-reason-eric-swalwell-is-running-for-governor-n4946269","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/230/df668b79-adcf-4d32-90b4-b97fe6838d3e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 21:16:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.214},{"id":381386708,"title":"NYT, Politico: Say, Why Is the DNC Taking Out a $15M Loan?","text":"Good question. Maybe the inflation of the Biden Regency has impacted the prices of political campaigns? \n\nOf course, Republicans don't seem to have the same issues with donors as Democrats. Nor do they have the same leftover bills that Kamala Harris left the DNC, either.\n\nDNC chair Ken Martin paints the move to tap credit as a sign of investment, but the New York Times doesn't quite buy it:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee took out a $15 million loan last month to replenish its shrunken coffers before elections in Virginia and New Jersey and to keep operations fully funded entering 2026, according to party officials and documents reviewed by The New York Times.Tapping a line of credit outside the crucible of a midterm or presidential election year is unusual for a major party committee, and it is the latest sign of financial distress for the official arm of the Democratic Party.The D.N.C. entered November with $18.3 million on hand — $15 million of which came from the loan.By contrast, the Republican National Committee entered November with $91.2 million in the bank and no debts.\n\nI put this in the Final Word last night, but it's worth a deeper look. Had it not been for this loan, it appears that the DNC would have been entirely tapped out a week before the elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City. The money struggles have continued all year, as Breitbart noted at the time that Martin attempted to reverse the drain:\n\nDemocrat National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin is trying to rally the troops after his party’s major losses in 2024 while grappling with the fact the committee is strapped for cash.Turmoil and pressure have been growing as some influential leaders within the group have stepped down, the Hill reported on Sunday.Founder and Executive Director of Defend the Vote Brian Lemek, who is also a Democrat strategist, said, “Ken Martin is stepping into a really difficult situation right now, and I would say he was elected and they handed him a mop and a bucket.”The news also comes amid reports of infighting within the Democrat Party as it lacks clear leadership. It is also important to note the DNC recently voted to remove gun control activist David Hogg as vice chair, per Breitbart News.\n\nIf anything, matters have grown worse. One reason for this is that the DNC is still paying down Harris' campaign debt from last year, as I wrote about last month. Martin and the DNC had paid $20 million already as of the end of September. Separately, the DNC claimed they had finished September with $15.2 million cash-on-hand. That means the DNC burned a net $12 million in October, and nearly tapped out. Three months earlier, Martin had claimed that the DNC was \"breaking grassroots fundraising records,\" but if that's the case, why would the DNC need a loan?\n\nPolitico asked Martin to explain, but the answer was less than specific:\n\n“We can’t win elections or fight back against Trump if the D.N.C. downsizes operations like it often does after a presidential cycle,” Martin said in a statement. “I made a bet that investing early would build power, rack up wins and rally supporters back to the table. That bet is paying off.” ...The DNC also spent $16.9 million in October, the most it has spent in any single month this year. Driving that total was election-related spending: The national party spent over $6 million in New Jersey and Virginia to boost Democratic gubernatorial candidates, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Pennsylvania to help retain control of the state’s Supreme Court.Democrats won all those races.\n\nTrue. However, all those races took place in blue jurisdictions too, with the arguable exception of Pennsylvania, which is purple at best these days in statewide races. These also took place in an off-year cycle, an environment which usually rewards better-organized campaigns. Martin's spending in October helped boost that organizing, but the problem Democrats will face is that the spending and the lack of donor success in 2025 will likely mean fewer organizing resources in 2026, especially if the Mamdani movement delivers on its threats to primary dozens of Democrat incumbents in the House and Senate. \n\nMartin has a few months to fix the income issue for the DNC before this becomes a critical problem for the midterms. If they're taking out loans now, though, perhaps the problem may already have hit the critical stage. And given that Martin had to take out the loan during their Schumer Shutdown Fundraiser just to avoid overdrawing their accounts, I suspect that Martin's fundraising woes will only get worse from here. \n\nEditor’s Note: After more than 40 days of screwing Americans, a few Dems have finally caved.

We’ve always had tough times.” \n\n Calling himself “very hopeful” and “optimistic,” Leno added, “Stuff that used to be the law is now against the law, and that’s great.”\n\n However, he has a unique philosophy when it comes to addressing political change. \n\n “Ultimately, it’s a bit like a donkey, sometimes you’ve gotta hit in the head with a 2 x 4 to get its attention, but eventually it’ll listen,” he quipped. \n\n This isn’t the first time Leno has spoken about foregoing politics in his comedy. \n\n “Why shoot for just half an audience all the time?” Leno asked during a July interview with Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute President & CEO David Trulio. “I like to bring people into the big picture… I don’t understand why you would alienate one particular group.” \n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In recent months, late-night hosts have come under fire from President Donald Trump’s administration.

Gavin Newsom (D) term-limited and ineligible to run again, a massive group of contenders is lining up to take his job running the Golden State. Given the state’s strong liberal lean, most headlines have been focused on the Democratic candidates, many of whom have served or are currently serving major roles in government. But now they are looking to secure a seat in Sacramento come November 2026.\n\nOver a dozen Democratic candidates\n\nThe numerous Democrats who have declared their candidacy include “former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and activist billionaire Tom Steyer,” said NBC News. Rep. Eric Swalwell, one of the most high-profile California congressmen, has also joined the race.\n\nSwalwell “gained prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term in office when he was heavily involved in both impeachment proceedings,” said NBC News, and he has previously run for president. His opponents are “emblematic of the current state of the California gubernatorial race: A wide-open contest, shaping up to be one of the most expensive political battles of 2026,” said Bloomberg.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, is “pitching himself as a Democratic anti-corporate crusader who would spur housing production,” said Bloomberg. Porter was originally seen as a frontrunner, but her “bid was tarnished after she angrily confronted a television reporter and a video of her shouting at a staffer surfaced.” However, she “still leads Democratic contenders with 11% of support.” Villaraigosa “says he has the experience his rivals lack, but has so far steered clear of specific proposals.”\n\nAs former President Joe Biden’s HHS secretary, Becerra has some name recognition from his time at the White House. But he has also become embroiled in a scandal “involving his closest aides siphoning money from one of his campaign accounts,” said Politico. There is also a major name notably not running: former Vice President Kamala Harris, who ruled out a run for governor earlier this year. California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was also considered a potential contender, but like Harris, he has declined a bid.\n\n‘Lack of a blockbuster candidate’\n\nDespite the number of candidates, the gubernatorial contest remains a “sleepy race filled with candidates looking for ways to catch fire in the 2026 election,” said the Los Angeles Times. Interest in the race among voters “remains relatively moribund” due to the influx of people running. However, the “lack of a blockbuster candidate in the race” has prompted others, such as Steyer, to throw their name into the ring.\n\nEven as the candidate pool narrows down, it will be an uphill battle, as “getting elected governor of California is a difficult task, requiring the creation of a large apparatus to plan and execute a campaign strategy and raising tens of millions of dollars to pay for it,” said CalMatters. The “uncertainty underscores not only the daunting logistics of a California campaign, but perhaps some hesitancy” about running the state itself.","summary":"Over a dozen Democrats have declared their candidacy","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/crowded-field-democrats-california-governor","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQboib8a8yXWtJCpJsTqPP-2000-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:35:30","author":"Justin Klawans","authors":["Justin Klawans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.082},{"id":381375926,"title":"Hakeem Jeffries Totally Melts Down on CNBC When Host Obliterates His Talking Points","text":"There’s a reason why Rep.

They can't buy houses. They can't educate anybody. There was the CEO of Ford saying there's 5,000 auto mechanic jobs that they have that they can't fill. \"I think that this country made two bad bets,\" Carville added, \"And they both seemed like good bets at the time. One is we decided we're going to be a nation of homeowners. And, two, that we were going to be a nation of people that went to college. Both of those strategies are, in effect, blowing up in our faces.

And if somebody doesn't get ahead of it, it's going to get ahead of everybody else,\" Carville said. \"And people are starting to get really pissed. They're starting to figure out what's happened to their lives.\" Carville is one of several commentators who have sounded the alarm on the issue, as many Democrats have been debating how to appeal to young male voters struggling to enter the middle class in a changing, globalized economy. In March 2024, months before President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, Carville warned Democrats to abandon woke politics, arguing the party was dominated by \"too many preachy females,\" both of which, he said, were alienating male voters. HOME AFFORDABILITY CRISIS TAKING A TOLL ON AMERICA'S YOUNG ADULTS On Thursday, Carville said many younger Americans are \"starting to figure out why they don't have a lot of hope to get a good job or to be able to buy a house. Because, people, once we all bought houses, we put zoning restrictions and God knows what else just to drive the price of the asset up, which our price of our asset goes up, the price of what a young person has to pay goes up too. \"We’ve got to really rethink this whole idea of four-year college and homeownership.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"James Carville says rising housing costs and stagnant wages are creating a generational crisis that requires presidential action and &quot;economic populism.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/carville-gives-dire-warning-future-presidents-embrace-populism-this-thing-could-break","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/james-carville-speaks-at-event.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:23:01","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.555},{"id":381401726,"title":"My Mom’s Disappearance Was A Mystery. Then I Saw An Old Photo — And What I Discovered Next Left Me Shaken.","text":"Part of that victory can be seen in a viral photograph from last year that is now forgotten because the news cycle has moved on. It’s a snapshot of Kamala Harris taken last summer during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was shot from the point of view of a brown biracial girl in a pink pantsuit and pigtails, transfixed as she gazes upward at Harris from the front row at the United Center in Chicago. The girl is Amara, Harris’ great-niece, age 8.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the photo went viral. It was a sneak preview of a Brown New America. The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority country (the majority of citizens will be non-white) by 2044. The number of people who identify as multiracial increased by 276% over the past decade. Advertisements today routinely depict interracial couples, straight and gay, along with their children. And some of our most prominent public figures — Obama, Harris, film director Jordan Peele and NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes — are biracial.\n\nThe acceptance of interracial marriage cuts across racial and partisan lines. Harris and Doug Emhoff, her Jewish husband, were the first interracial couple to reach the highest levels of the executive branch, but they were immediately followed by another interracial couple, GOP Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Some white supremacists objected to Usha Vance’s race but even within the MAGA universe there is widespread acceptance of the Vances’ interracial marriage.\n\nSomeday, perhaps soon, an interracial couple will occupy the White House.\n\nIt’s easy to miss, but Usha Vance’s ascension and Harris’ groundbreaking run for the White House represents one of the greatest victories of the Civil Rights Movement: the normalization of interracial marriage and biracial people throughout America. When Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2022, few if any news stories dwelled on the fact that her husband is white.\n\nThe casual acceptance of interracial couples at even the highest echelon of American life demonstrates something that’s so important to remember today: how quickly people’s attitudes on seemingly intractable issues can shift. When a Gallup poll asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and white people in 1958, only 4% approved. Gallup asked the same question in 2021, and 94% approved — an all-time high. Public opinion about one of the most entrenched racial taboos in American history went from near-universal disapproval to virtual universal approval within a lifetime. \n\nHow did this happen? The quick answer is that in June 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down “anti-miscegenation” laws in the Loving v. Virginia case. But something else also made it happen. It was a choice that certain people made and a type of courage they all displayed. One of them was my mom.\n\nI only saw my mom as this fragile flower, but my brother, Patrick, was the first to notice another side to her. One morning, he took her to a hair salon that served women in a group home where our mom lived. She had been transferred to the home with other women with severe mental illnesses after Crownsville was shut down, in part, for mistreating patients. While they were waiting, our mom watched a hairdresser berate and throw hair products at a woman sitting in her chair.\n\n“She’s a bitch,” my mom said, her eyes narrowed on the hairdresser. \n\nPatrick had never heard our mother speak in such an indignant tone before. He suppressed a smile.\n\n“Mom, do you know you just said a bad word?”\n\n“I’m sorry, Pat.” Our mom briefly paused, then added, “But she is a bitch.”\n\nAs I dug deeper into old family stories, I discovered that my mom had long been infuriated by any display of injustice. She glared back at white people who stared at her while she walked in public with my father in the early 1960s. Sometimes she’d say, “You act like you ain’t never seen people before.” She and my father trashed a bar when the bartender refused to serve them. Once, I heard my mom say she had been arrested as a young woman. For what, I inquired. “For opening my big fat mouth,” she said with a wide grin.\n\nEven her illness couldn’t erase her spirit of defiance. I hated visiting her group homes. Some were run by good people who treated my mom with compassion, but many seemed designed to crush whatever humanity was left of those consigned there. Unscrupulous caretakers stole from or bullied people in their care. Some confined them to squalid, roach-infested rooms. When I came in to greet my mom, I’d often see heavily medicated residents sitting on couches, staring zombie-like at soap operas on television. Most of them hadn’t received a visitor in years. There were few smiles or genuine laughter in these environments. But my mom could somehow bring light into the most desolate places.\n\nPatrick sneaked into a group home to surprise our mom one morning, only to be shocked by what he saw: our mother bopping and weaving down a “Soul Train” dance line as the group home staff and residents cheered her on. Any gifts we sent her quickly disappeared because, we discovered, she gave most of them away to other group home members who she said needed them more. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, her caretaker had to buy a separate living room chair for my mom to enforce social distancing rules. All of the group home members wanted to sit near her.","summary":"\"My father... didn’t think I could handle [the truth] until I became a young man.”\n\nView Entire Post &rsaquo;","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnblake/schizophrenia-mental-health-stigma-broken-family-essay-sc","image":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2025-06/23/18/thumb/VDzUrFByy.jpg?crop=2542:1695;229,152&resize=1250:830&resize=1200:*","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:21:02","author":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,John Blake","authors":["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about","John Blake"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.089},{"id":381370202,"title":"Alarm in Georgia—Qcells cuts salaries and suspends production due to solar components being held up at the","text":"The economy continues to hit Americans hard. Qcells, the US solar manufacturing subsidiary of the South Korean Hanwha Group, announced the temporary suspension of 1,000 employees at its Georgia factories. The main reason is that shipments of essential components from abroad are being routinely held up by US customs officials.\n\nThe company stated that delays have limited its ability to maintain production lines at full capacity\n\nThe news is clear: solar energy company Qcells will temporarily reduce the pay and working hours of approximately one-third of its employees in this area of ​​northwest Georgia. The company stated that delays have limited its ability to maintain production lines at full capacity. Qcells has committed to investing $2.5 billion to build a complete solar panel supply chain in the United States to compete with China. The reduced hours are expected to affect about 1,000 employees at Qcells plants in Dalton and Cartersville, where U.S. customs authorities have detained imported components used in the manufacture of solar panels.\n\n“It’s creating a sort of vacuum effect at the beginning, so people can’t get the supplies they need”\n\nRegarding this, Carl Gabrini, interim assistant dean of the Wright School of Business at Dalton State College, said, “It’s creating a sort of vacuum effect at the beginning, so people can’t get the supplies they need.” Qcells manufactures solar cells in Malaysia and South Korea, which are then imported for assembly into panels. In addition to temporary layoffs, the company confirmed plans to lay off approximately 300 employees.\n\nIn 2023, Qcells, a leading solar module manufacturer, announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its operations in Georgia\n\nThis announcement comes months after the company reported that some of its solar cell shipments had been detained at U.S. ports under a 2021 law banning imports from China’s Xinjiang region due to concerns about forced labor. Later, in 2023, Qcells, a leading solar module manufacturer, announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its operations in Georgia. “Qcells expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months. Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains strong,” Qcells spokeswoman Marta Stoepker said in a statement.\n\nBack in 2023, following Qcells’ investment, Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Dalton plant and called it “the largest community solar investment in our nation’s history.” Now, Qcells has implemented temporary reduced hours and furloughs for approximately half of its manufacturing employees at its Cartersville and Dalton, Georgia, plants. Jesse Lee, senior advisor to the clean energy organization Climate Power, stated that the decision represents a setback for the community and the clean energy sector as a whole. Meanwhile, Marta Stoepker has also said, “We will soon be back up and running with our full team in Georgia, delivering American-made energy to communities across the country.”\n\n“It’s a real shame they’ve had their support withdrawn in this way”\n\n“They were laying the groundwork for the United States to become competitive in the clean energy and solar power sector,” Lee stated. Qcells is currently finalizing a $2.3 billion plant in Cartersville to manufacture ingots, wafers, and solar cells—the building blocks of finished solar modules. However, Lee made it clear that “it’s a real shame they’ve had their support withdrawn in this way.”\n\nFinally, as mentioned in previous paragraphs, a company spokesperson confirmed that while most of the delayed shipments are now clearing customs, the significant delays necessitated reducing production capacity and implementing workforce actions to improve operational efficiency. Stoepker added that shipments that had been held are now being released by customs authorities, but the delays have forced the company to reduce production. Regarding the temporary layoffs, affected workers will retain all benefits, and the company expects to resume full production and bring back the suspended staff “in the coming weeks and months.”","url":"https://eladelantado.com/en/qcells-cuts-salaries-suspends-production/","image":"https://eladelantado.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/qcells-georgia-employe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 20:00:22","author":"Diana Elizabeth Orozco","authors":["Diana Elizabeth Orozco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"es","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":381358366,"title":"Karine Jean-Pierre's party registration revealed ... as her book touted her 'independence'","text":"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declared herself an 'independent' and wrote an entire book about it.\n\nBut she forgot one important step in leaving the Democratic Party. \n\nDespite having misgivings about her party since last July, she didn't change her voter registration until just before the book was coming out - and there's currently no record of that change on file. \n\nIn a voter profile report obtained from the Maryland State Board of Elections by the Daily Mail, Jean-Pierre's registration is listed as 'active' and her party is listed as 'Democratic.' \n\nThe report, compiled on October 27, 2025, said that Jean-Pierre last voted with a provisional ballot in the general election last year. \n\nA source familiar told the Daily Mail that the former press secretary changed her registration by mail, so she could properly indicate she wanted no party affiliation, and did so in late September or early October of this year.\n\nHer book was released on October 21.\n\nThe source also pointed out that there were no important elections in Maryland this year.\n\nJean-Pierre first registered in the state in 2014 and has been an active voter since.\n\nShe even took the time to vote in Maryland's May 2024 Democratic primary, when her boss, President Joe Biden, was a shoo-in, as Representative Dean Phillips, who appeared on the Maryland ballot, had already dropped out, and the president was only running against self-help guru Marianne Williamson. \n\nJean-Pierre wrote in Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines that she started thinking about leaving the Democratic Party on the heels of Biden dropping out of the presidential race in July 2024. \n\n'You know what?

Tim Walz, who was on board in Kamala Harris’ catastrophically failed 2024 presidential bid for her party, already is “drowning” in fraud. “Billions in taxpayer dollars have been stolen during the administration of Governor Tim Walz alone. Democratic state officials, overseeing one of the most generous welfare regimes in the country, are asleep at the switch. And the media, duty-bound by progressive pieties, refuse to connect the dots,” the report said.\n\nThe new, and major, fraud scheme “has allegedly been perpetrated by members of Minnesota’s sizeable Somali community,” the research explained. “Federal counterterrorism sources confirm that millions of dollars in stolen funds have been sent back to Somalia, where they ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab.”\n\nThe report noted one source confirmed, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.”\n\n“If you were to design a welfare program to facilitate fraud, it would probably look a lot like Minnesota’s Medicaid Housing Stabilization Services program. The HSS program, the first of its kind in the country, was launched with a noble goal: to help seniors, addicts, the disabled, and the mentally ill secure housing. It was designed with ‘low barriers to entry’ and ‘minimal requirements for reimbursement.’ Nonetheless, before the program went live in 2020, officials pegged its annual estimated price tag at $2.6 million,” the research charged.\n\nBut costs in 2021 alone totaled $21 million, and since then annual totals have been $42 million, $74 million, $104 million.\n\nState officials there noticed the “credible allegations of fraud, and decided to shut it down, and just weeks ago, acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Joe Thompson confirmed criminal fraud indictments against Moktar Hassan Aden, Mustafa Dayib Ali, Khalid Ahmed Dayib, Abdifitah Mohamud Mohamed, Christopher Adesoji Falade, Emmanuel Oluwademilade Falade, Asad Ahmed Adow, and Anwar Ahmed Adow.\n\nSix of those are in the state’s Somali community.\n\n“Thompson made clear that this is just the first round of charges for HSS fraud that his office will be prosecuting,” the report said.\n\n“Most of these cases, unlike a lot of Medicare fraud and Medicaid fraud cases nationally, aren’t just overbilling. These are often just purely fictitious companies solely created to defraud the system, and that’s unique in the extent to which we have that here in Minnesota,” Thompson confirmed.\n\nHe said many schemes operate out of rundown offices with perpetrators targeting people out of rehab and putting them on government benefits for services the companies have no intention of providing.\n\n“What we see are schemes stacked upon schemes, draining resources meant for those in need. It feels never ending,” Thompson said. “I have spent my career as a fraud prosecutor and the depth of the fraud in Minnesota takes my breath away.”\n\nAlready, there have been 56 people who admitted gjuilt in a $250 million “Feeding Our Future” fraud, the report confirmed.\n\nThat purportedly was to provide daycare assistance, but it used “fake meal counts, doctored attendance records, and fabricated invoices” to demand reimbursement of nearly $200 million.\n\n“In reality, the money was being used to fund lavish lifestyles, purchase luxury vehicles, and buy real estate in the United States, Turkey, and Kenya,” the report confirmed.\n\nDavid Gaither, a former state lawmaker warned that the legacy media, “alongside Minnesota’s Democratic establishment, have long turned a blind eye to fraud within the Somali community.”\n\nThat allows problems to explode in size.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @RK_Thorpe and I have new reporting on America’s Somali fraud rings, which have stolen billions in taxpayer funds—and sent some to Islamist terrorists back home.\n“The Largest Funder of Al-Shabaab Is the Minnesota Taxpayer.”https://t.co/RDgnKXAnyP\n— Christopher F.

It didn’t matter, prosecutors suggested, if a child did not have an autism diagnosis: Hassan would facilitate a fraudulent one,” the report confirmed.\n\nIn fact, prosecutors charge, “To drive up enrollment, Hassan and her partners paid monthly cash kickback payments to the parents of children who enrolled. These kickback payments ranged from approximately $300 to $1500 per month, per child. The amount of these payments was contingent on the services DHS authorized a child to receive—the higher the authorization amount, the higher the kickback. Often, parents threatened to leave . . . and take their children to other autism centers if they did not get paid higher kickbacks.”\n\nThe report cited autism program costs in Minnesota: $3 million in 2018, then up to $54 million, $77 million, $183 million, $279 million, and $399 million in 2023.\n\n“These massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money. Each case we bring exposes another strand of this network,” Thompson charged.\n\nAnd the report revealed, “At least 28 fraud scandals have surfaced since Walz was elected governor in 2019. Most of the large-scale fraud rings, according to two former FBI officials who spoke with City Journal, have been perpetrated by members of the Somali community.”\n\nAnd where did the money go?\n\n“The Somali fraud rings have sent huge sums in remittances, or money transfers, from Minnesota to Somalia. According to reports, an estimated 40 percent of households in Somalia get remittances from abroad. In 2023 alone, the Somali diaspora sent back $1.7 billion—more than the Somali government’s budget for that year,” City Journal said.\n\nAnd the report added, “Our investigation reveals, for the first time, that some of this money has been directed to an even more troubling destination: the al-Qaida-linked Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab. According to multiple law-enforcement sources, Minnesota’s Somali community has sent untold millions through a network of ‘hawalas,’ informal clan-based money-traders, that have wound up in the coffers of Al-Shabaab.”\n\nConfirmation came through Glenn Kerns, a retired detective who worked on a federal Joint Terrorism Task Force, who said the Somalis’ money network routed huge amounts of cash to hawala networks in Somalia, with one getting $20 million in a single year.\n\nAnother investigator, who was cited anonymously, said, “Every scrap of economic activity, in the Twin Cities, in America, throughout Western Europe, anywhere Somalis are concentrated, every cent that is sent back to Somalia benefits Al-Shabaab in some way. For every dollar that is transferred from the Twin Cities back to Somalia, al-Shabaab is . . . taking a cut of it.”\n\nThe Gateway Pundit lauded the work of reporters Ryan Thorpe and Chris Rufo, explaining, “This is insane.”","summary":"'Every scrap of economic activity, in the Twin Cities, in America, throughout Western Europe, anywhere Somalis are concentrated, every cent that is sent back to Somalia benefits Al-Shabaab in some way'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/11/billions-stolen-report-charges-biggest-funding-source-somali/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Al-Shabaab.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-21 19:03:22","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.487}]}
