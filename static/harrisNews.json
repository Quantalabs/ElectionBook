Midterm elections are often viewed as a measure of voters' response to the sitting president's policies.\n\nAfter a year of aggressive deportation practices, a withdrawal from the international arena and economic upheaval, 2026 has begun with the Trump administration abducting a foreign leader and launching offensives on foreign nations.\n\nRepublicans will seek to maintain a 218-213 majority in the House, following the death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., announced on Tuesday, and three-seat majority in the Senate while Democrats hope to make gains and offer a check on Trump's power. The results will signal approval or disapproval of how the country is being run and will set the landscape for the final two years of Trump's presidency.\n\nRetirements to bring changes to Senate\n\nNine senators have announced they are retiring from the chamber in 2026, including one of the most senior lawmakers.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving Senate party leader in history, will end his 40-year career at the end of the current term. He is one of four Republicans retiring from the Senate.\n\nSix Republicans launched campaigns to succeed McConnell last year, along with eight Democrats. Kentucky has been a firmly Republican-leaning state, voting more than 65% for Trump in 2024.\n\nAlabama voted similarly in 2024, with about 64% of votes going to Trump. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., is ending his time in the Senate to run for state governor.\n\nLike Tuberville, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., will leave the Senate to run for governor of their respective states. Bennet has been a senator since 2009 while Blackburn entered the chamber in 2019.\n\nOf the senators not running for re-election, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is leaving open a seat that is considered to be the most competitive. Ernst has been a senator since 2015.\n\nRepublicans are backing Rep. Ashley Hinson to take Ernst's seat. Hinson was elected to the U.S. House in 2020.\n\nThree candidates are in the Democratic primary seeking to challenge Hinson in November: state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek and Nathan Sage, a military veteran.\n\nWahls was the youngest Iowa Senate Democratic Leader, serving in that role from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe race for an open seat in North Carolina features former Gov. Roy Cooper on the ticket for the Democratic Party. Cooper served two terms as governor.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley has earned the endorsement of Trump but he is being challenged in the primary by Michele Morrow. She ran an unsuccessful campaign for North Carolina's superintendent of public instruction in 2024 and has never held public office.\n\nNorth Carolina has historically been a tightly contested state. Trump earned about 50% of the vote there in 2024. Prior to that, the last time a presidential candidate received 50% of votes was 2012 when Mitt Romney received 50.4%.\n\nNorth Carolina's Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 2014. Kay Hagan was a state senator from 2009 to 2015 before being succeeded by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Tillis is retiring at the end of the term.\n\nThe Democratic Party has tapped former Sen. Sherrod Brown to attempt a return to the chamber in 2026 after he lost a bid for re-election in 2024 to Republican Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown has launched a campaign to challenge Sen. Jon Husted, the Republican who was appointed to fill Vice President JD Vance's seat that he vacated when Trump was elected president.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., is running for re-election in a state won by Trump in 2024. Three Republicans have entered their party's primary to challenge Ossoff: Rep. Buddy Carter, Rep. Mike Collins and former college and pro football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has given Dooley his endorsement.\n\nGeorgia's 6th Congressional District re-elected Democrat Lucy McBath to the House in 2024 by nearly 50 points over her Republican challenger. Democrats hold both of the state's Senate seats.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, will be challenged in 2026 but who will be on the other side of the ticket will not be known until the Democratic primary in June. Collins represents a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried by about seven points in 2024.\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills and military veteran Graham Platner are campaigning in the Democratic primary.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn is running for re-election but will first have to win a contested Republican primary. Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has been a key figure in Texas' redistricting battle and often opponent to Biden administration policies, will challenge Cornyn, along with Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nIn another battleground state, the retirement of Democratic Sen. Gary Peters will leave the race for a Michigan Senate seat open.\n\nFormer congressman Mike Rogers is expected to be on the ticket for Republicans after receiving an endorsement from Trump. Three candidates have entered the Democratic primary: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and physician Abdul El-Sayed.\n\nCongresspeople seeking new offices\n\nSeveral members of Congress are running for different offices outside of the House chambers, including 11 running for governor. Meanwhile 18 members of the House are retiring, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans running for governor in their respective states include Iowa Rep. Randy Feenstra, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace.\n\nRep Chip Roy, R-Texas, will not run for re-election as he will try to succeed Paxton as his state's attorney general.\n\nNew Mexico's 2nd Congressional District is held by Democrat Gabriel Vasquez but was won by Trump in 2024. New Mexico has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 2008.\n\nVasquez faces a challenge from Republicans Greg Cunningham, a veteran of the U.S. Marines and former Albuquerque police officer. Cunningham ran for a seat in the state legislature in 2024 and lost.\n\nArizona's 6th Congressional District seat, held by Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, had several Democrats looking to challenge Ciscomani in November.\n\nSome candidates have begun dropping out of the Democratic primary as 2026 has arrived. JoAnna Mendoza, a military veteran, and engineer Chris Donat remain in the race. Mendoza has vastly outraised Donat, tallying $1.9 million in receipts compared to Donat's $21,061, according to Federal Elections Commission data.\n\nTrump won Arizona in 2024 with about 52% of the vote.\n\nColorado's newest seat, District 8, is held by Republican Rep. Gabe Evans. He represents the district located in the northern Denver area after flipping the seat for Republicans in 2024.\n\nEvans has a new challenger in the Republican primary as of November with former Air Force cadet and current Colorado Army Reserve Capt. Adam DeRito filing to run against him.\n\nDeRito has been in a long legal battle with the U.S. Air Force which expelled him hours before he was set to graduate in 2010. He was denied a diploma for allegedly violating academy rules by fraternizing with a subordinate. DeRito claims these allegations were retaliation for him reporting sexual assaults at the academy.\n\nThe Democratic primary is set to feature five candidates, former state legislator Shannon Bird, state lawmaker Manny Rutinel, Marine veteran Evan Munsing, Denis Abrate and self-proclaimed former Republican John Francis Szemler.\n\nMichigan is one of the biggest battleground states in 2026 with three seats expected to feature close races, along with an open Senate seat.\n\nDistrict 7, held by Republican Tom Barrett, has flipped in consecutive elections. Barrett, a U.S. Army veteran, will seek re-election with seven Democrats declared for their primary. He assumed the seat after Democrat Elissa Slotkin ran for and was elected to the Senate.\n\nAmong the Democrats vying to challenge Barrett is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, Michigan State professor Josh Cowen and William Lawrence, the founder of nonprofit environmental advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement.\n\nDistrict 10 will feature an open election as Rep. John James, a Republican, enters the state gubernatorial race.\n\nFEC campaign data shows a field of six Democrats seeking their party's nomination. Eric Chung, a former U.S. Department of Commerce official under the Biden administration, has raised the most out of any candidate, followed by Republican Robert Lulgjuraj, a former county prosecutor.\n\nAfter some delay, District 4 Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican, announced last month that he will seek re-election. Four Democrats have filed to appear in the primary, including state Sen. Sean McCann.","summary":"The 2026 midterm elections are coming later this year with 33 seats in the U.S. Senate and all 435 House seats on ballots across the country.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2026/01/06/2026-midterm-elections-house-senate-preview/4231767711258/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4231767711258/2026/1/9539d9099f4e7c96c8b6bab19a90912e/v1.5/2026-midterm-preview-Key-races-in-US-House-Senate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 17:35:28","author":"Joe Fisher","authors":["Joe Fisher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":391604266,"title":"George Conway joins race for Jerry Nadler's House seat","text":"Jan. 6 (UPI) -- Vocal Trump critic George Conway officially announced his run for the House of Representatives as a Democrat in New York for the seat being vacated by Rep.

He is a former Republican.\n\n\"We have a corrupt president, a mendacious president, a criminal president whose masked agents are disappearing people from our streets, who's breaking international law, and he's running our federal government like a mob protection racket,\" Conway said in his video.\n\nConway is a formerly conservative lawyer who rose to widespread fame when his then-wife, Kellyanne Conway, became an adviser to President Donald Trump in his first term. Despite his wife's position, he was an outspoken voice against the president. They divorced in 2023.\n\n\"I know how to fight these people. They are corrupt, amoral people,\" Conway said. \"They will stop at nothing to rig the system for themselves. I've been fighting Trump for years, and nothing will stop me.\"\n\nNadler, D-N.Y., announced in September that he would retire from Congress. The 78-year-old Nadler said he wanted to make room for a younger generation. He represents New York's 12th District, which includes Midtown and the Upper West and Upper East sides of Manhattan.\n\nThe 12th District voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by 64 points in 2024.\n\nThe field for that primary is crowded.

At his Mar-a-Lago press conference on Saturday, the president stated plainly, \"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" He added that members of his national security team standing behind him would oversee the effort and did not rule out \"boots on the ground.\" Hours later, speaking aboard Air Force One, he sharpened the message further: \"We’re going to run it, fix it.\" The strategic logic is easy to understand. Venezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven oil reserves and has become a hub for narcotics trafficking, corruption and malign outside influence. The administration’s December 2025 National Security Strategy explicitly embraces what it calls a \"Trump Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine — pledging to deny non-hemispheric competitors such as China, Russia and Iran control over strategically vital assets in the Americas. In that framework, Venezuela is not merely a humanitarian tragedy; it is a test case. RUBIO DEFENDS VENEZUELA OPERATION AFTER NBC QUESTIONS LACK OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR MADURO CAPTURE But this is precisely where experience should sober ambition. The first problem: Who is actually in charge? A central contradiction now confronts Washington. How does the United States \"run\" Venezuela when its constitutionally designated vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, has already been sworn in domestically as interim president following Maduro’s removal? JONATHAN TURLEY: MADURO OPERATION WAS LEGAL, BUT TRUMP MAKES IT COMPLICATED Rodríguez’s claim to authority—backed by Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice and regime-loyal institutions—is rejected by Washington as illegitimate. Yet in practical terms, ministries, security forces and regional authorities inside Venezuela remain staffed by officials loyal to the old system. That means the United States is not governing Venezuela in name, law or day-to-day administration—even as presidential rhetoric suggests otherwise. This disconnect between declared authority and actual control is where post-conflict operations often fail. Lessons written in blood: Iraq and the cost of improvisation I learned that lesson firsthand. In 2002 and 2003, I served as a member of then–Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s Military Analyst Group. We were given extensive access — briefings, travel and candid discussions with officials planning both the Iraq invasion and what would follow. KAMALA HARRIS BLASTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA’S MADURO AS ‘UNLAWFUL AND UNWISE’ In early 2003, several of us met with retired officers outlining postwar governance plans. We asked basic but essential questions: Who would secure ministries? How would local governance function? How would electricity, water and fuel distribution be restored? The answers were often vague, more aspirational than operational. After the invasion, I visited Baghdad and met with Coalition Provisional Authority officials under Ambassador Paul Bremer. Again, the gaps were obvious. We had removed a regime but had not built the machinery needed to prevent the vacuum that follows. One decision still echoes: the CPA’s order dissolving Iraq’s security institutions, including the Ministry of Defense. RAND’s official history records that the order was issued with little objection at senior levels, even as misunderstandings were masked by apparent consensus. The result was predictable—security collapsed, insurgency surged and the U.S. presence expanded far beyond its original scope. FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: 3 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM TRUMP'S PUSH TO PUT US OIL FIRMS BACK IN VENEZUELA Venezuela now risks a similar mistake. Capturing Maduro may prove to be the easy part. Governing what comes next is the hard part—and the part America has too often improvised. Panama is the wrong analogy Some have compared Venezuela today to Panama in 1989, when U.S. forces captured Manuel Noriega and quickly installed Guillermo Endara as president. The comparison is tempting—and deeply misleading. UN AMBASSADOR WALTZ DEFENDS US CAPTURE OF MADURO AHEAD OF SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING Panama was small, U.S. forces were already present and a recognized successor government was ready to assume power. Venezuela, by contrast, has 30 million people, no broadly accepted transitional authority and entrenched military-criminal networks embedded throughout the state. What worked in Panama cannot simply be scaled up to Caracas. \"Not day-to-day governance\"— what that really means Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since clarified that the United States does not intend to govern Venezuela \"day-to-day.\" That clarification matters—but it raises its own questions. If Washington is not running ministries, courts, budgets or police forces, what does that leadership look like? MARCO RUBIO CLASHES WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ON VENEZUELA LEADERSHIP IN HEATED EXCHANGE In real terms, it appears the administration is signaling a model of indirect control rather than occupation. The primary lever is economic, especially oil. Venezuela’s political and military elites survive on access to oil revenues. Whoever controls export permissions, sanctions relief, insurance access and dollar-denominated transactions controls the real center of gravity. Conditioning access to those revenues—while freezing assets abroad and coordinating sanctions enforcement with allies—offers Washington leverage over the top of the system without governing the country outright. That approach amounts to influence without occupation: pressure without American administrators running Caracas. VENEZUELA STILL OWES US ENERGY COMPANIES BILLIONS AS TRUMP CALLS FOR NEW INVESTMENT A narco-state is not a one-man show There is also a dangerous illusion at work—that removing Maduro dismantles the regime. Maduro sat at the apex of a narco-state and was indicted in U.S. courts on charges of drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. But he did not act alone. His power rested on a network of generals, intelligence chiefs, judges, energy officials and cartel intermediaries who enriched themselves under the existing system. Many of those figures remain in place today. TRUMP'S MADURO TAKEDOWN RESETS THE GLOBAL CHESSBOARD AND REASSERTS AMERICAN POWER They are unlikely to surrender quietly. Some will seek accommodation; others will resist through bureaucratic sabotage, violence or the manipulation of public fear. Without a credible transitional framework anchored in Venezuelan civil society and supported by international legitimacy, the system Maduro built may survive him. The questions that must be answered — now If the administration wants to avoid repeating Iraq, it must answer several questions publicly and soon.

And it's no longer good enough for me to sit and lob things in from the spectator seats,” Conway told The Independent. \n\nThe self-described “recovering lawyer,” a Republican for most of life, who was once married to one of Trump’s closest first-term advisers, has thrown his hat into the ring for the House seat in New York’s 12th district that will be left open by the retirement of Rep. Jerry Nadler after this Congress. \n\nConway, 61, filed to run in the solidly Democratic district last month, shortly after he leased an apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, where he currently lives with his nearly four-year-old corgi, Clyde. \n\nHe formally announced his campaign Tuesday — the anniversary of the January 6 attack on the Capitol — with a video message pledging to “not be an ordinary Member of Congress” because this is “no ordinary time.”\n\n“We need a majority in a Democratic Congress who is that is absolutely laser focused on protecting and saving our democracy and our Constitution,” Conway said, because “it's going to hard to see anything really good and lasting change in terms of how to help people's lives happen until this disease of Trumpism is gone.”\n\nThe ex-corporate litigator is now the 10th person running for the seat, joining a field that includes candidates half his age, including anti-gun activist Cameron Kassky, lawyer, writer and Kennedy family scion Jack Schossberg, 26-year-old Democratic organizer Liam Elkind, plus several members of the New York State assembly.\n\nThe fact that the 12th Congressional District seat won’t have an incumbent running is largely a function of the ongoing fallout from former president Joe Biden’s disastrous decision to run for re-election at age 80 before having to exit the race after his somnolent, rambling and often incoherent June 2024 debate performance against Trump. \n\nIncumbent Jerrold Nadler, who at 78 had been in the House since 1992 and had never faced a serious re-election challenge, announced his retirement last year amid calls for Democrats to bring in younger voices to push back against Trump.\n\nConway, born just months before the assassination of Schlossberg’s grandfather — President John F. Kennedy — will be eligible to collect Social Security in September. While he’s new to electoral politics as a candidate, he’s not the sort of fresh face for which activists were clamoring after Trump’s re-election romp last year. \n\nIn an interview with The Independent ahead of his campaign’s launch, Conway said the dire circumstances of current American politics have compelled him to get off the sidelines after years of being a thorn in Trump’s side, first as a high-profile critic, then as a founder of the Lincoln Project anti-Trump PAC, then as a megadonor who dropped eye-watering sums of his own cash into former vice president Kamala Harris campaign and his own PAC.\n\nHe described the country as being saddled with a “criminal president” — a fact given Trump’s 2024 conviction in New York Supreme Court — who “is committing more crimes each as we speak” while simultaneously defying the law and believing he is the law.\n\nConway also decried the way Trump is running the U.S. government “like a mob operation … for his own personal benefit” since he returned to the White House nearly a year ago, characterizing it as “government of the boss, by the boss and for the boss, instead of government of the people, for the people and by the people.”\n\nConway, a Yale University Law School graduate who argued — and won — a 2010 securities law case in front of the Supreme Court, told The Independent he never planned on running for office and thought people who chose to do so were “f**king crazy” before a conversation with his now girlfriend, a psychologist, who asked them during one of their first meetings why he never considered it despite his years of high-profile activism against the president.\n\nHe said he received similar urging from another longtime friend, the writer and MSNOW political contributor Molly Jong-Fast, who he quipped was now “responsible for inflicting me upon the body politic.”\n\nBut the more Conway thought about it, he said he came to see the 12th District as the right place to make his first run for office.\n\nAlthough he has spent most of the Trump era living in Washington, D.C. and a nearby suburb, Bethesda, Maryland, he explained how he spent most of his adult life living and working in the place he hopes to represent in Congress - New York City. \n\nIn addition to the three decades working in the district at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz — a white-shoe law firm headquartered on Park Avenue and later on West 52nd Street — Conway spent years living at 845 United Nations Plaza, better known as Trump World Tower. \n\nHe also noted that all four of his children were born in New York City — with two of them being born at NYU Langone hospital, which is also firmly within the 12th District.\n\n“It left an indelible mark on me, and left an overwhelming pride at having lived there and living there once again,” he said. \n\nAsked how he’d respond to claims that his recent move back to the city for the purpose of his campaign makes him a carpetbagger, Conway quipped that he may well have been “living, working, paying taxes and voting” in the 12th Congressional District “before some of these people running were even born.”\n\nHe also stressed that the threat Trump poses requires Democrats to elect lawmakers to Congress who can fight back effectively in favor of the rule of law against what he called “end-stage Trumpism” — and work to prevent a resurgence of it in the future.\n\nConway explained that eliminating “Trumpism” requires two things. The first, he said, is “accountability” in the form of impeachment — not just for Trump but for “his cronies, his Cabinet officials, [and] all of these people who are violating laws and basically pillaging the public fisc and profiting and extorting money from law firms and companies and indicting people who they consider political enemies.”\n\n“There have to be investigations, hard-nosed investigations by a Democratic Congress, and impeachment for people who are violating their oaths of office each and every day,” he said. \n\nHe said the second step would be “passing legislation within the four corners of the Constitution, that will help protect this from ever happening again.”\n\n“It requires good lawyering on the House Judiciary Committee for investigating, on the House Oversight Committee for investigating and for impeachment, and then to pass these laws that make sure things don't happen again as they have,” he said. \n\nHe added that he sees himself as a “special-teams player” who could help with those things — and then leave Congress when the job is done. \n\n“I'm not going to be like other people who want to live their lives in Congress or the state legislature. I can't do that, and I won't do that,” he said. \n\nConway’s return to New York and his late-in-life launch of a political career marks the latest turn in what has been a tumultuous decade for the former corporate litigator. \n\nAt this time 10 years ago, he was living in New Jersey with his then-wife, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, their four children — Claudia and George Jr., Charlotte, and Vanessa — and a pair of corgis, Bonnie and Skipper. \n\nBut that was before the summer 2016 Trump campaign shakeup that saw Kellyanne elevated to manage the last months of Trump’s madcap, misfit campaign against Hilary Clinton that ended with him claiming the presidency — and George being photographed on election night overwhelmed with pride as his wife became the first woman to ever manage a winning presidential campaign.\n\nThe Conways moved to Washington, where Kellyanne joined the Trump White House and George, who’d given up his lucrative law firm partnership, was set to be nominated as the Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice Civil Division. \n\nShe became one of Trump’s most vociferous — and infamous — defenders over the next three years, often running afoul of federal ethics laws and clashing with reporters during frequent combative exchanges in the White House driveway following innumerable appearances on Fox News and other Trump-aligned channels. \n\nBut George stayed out of the administration after becoming unsettled by Trump’s attacks on the department where he’d been preparing to serve — particularly after the president fired then-FBI director James Comey. \n\nHe also told The Independent in a 2024 interview that he’d been deeply disturbed by an encounter he and Kellyanne had with Trump at then-treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin’s 2017 wedding, where the president had gone on what Conway described at the time as a “crazy nonsensical rant” about then-attorney general Jeff Sessions, who’d recently recused himself from the department’s probe into alleged ties between the Trump 2016 campaign and the Russian government.\n\nAround the same time, George began tweeting, which given his connection to the administration, began attracting attention from reporters — and from Trump himself, who by March 2019 was attacking his close adviser’s spouse in his own tweets as a \"stone cold LOSER & husband from hell.\"\n\nHis political commentary shifted into a higher gear in July 2019 when The Washington Post published an op-ed he wrote slamming Trump as “racist” after the president called for a quartet of non-white Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to the “countries” they “originally came from.” It grew from there as his criticism and political activism against Trump became his new calling card. \n\nConway joined with anti-Trump GOP operatives Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt and Stuart Stevens to form The Lincoln Project, the anti-Trump Super PAC that became a massive thorn in Trump’s side during his failed 2020 election bid with viral ads that mocked him in highly personal terms. Wilson, an infamous ad-maker who helmed some of the GOP’s most devastating TV spots over decades before leaving the party over Trump, told The Independent in a phone interview that Conway “has a chance to play a role … that would be very valuable” in the fight against Trumpism if elected. \n\nDemocrats, he said, “want people that are going to be effective in the fight, and that fight is now, at this moment, very much against Donald Trump and Trumpism and Trump's enablers.”\n\n“I think George has a chance to play a role there that would be very valuable in a contest like this … Democrats understand right now that Congress isn't going to be … about like large, complicated policy bills … we’re a long way from that world,” he said. \n\n“George will go in there and go, he'll kick the shit out of people, which is kind of what you want right now. You want somebody who's going to be, you know, going in there and being an aggressive advocate against Trump and Trumpism.”\n\nAs Trump’s first term rolled on into the Covid pandemic and through the 2020 election, George’s increasingly higher profile as an anti-Trump activist continued to cause tensions with Kellyanne, who later wrote that George had been “cheating by tweeting” during Trump’s first term. \n\nIn August 2020, George announced that he was leaving the Lincoln Project to focus on his family. Kellyanne left the White House that same month. \n\nBut his tweeting — and his anti-Trump advocacy continued, and the Conways announced they would divorce in March 2023 after more than two decades of marriage. Asked to weigh in on her ex-husband’s entry into electoral politics, Kellyanne Conway declined to comment in a text message to The Independent. \n\nHis history as a Republican who attacked Clinton and helped in the effort to impeach him — plus Conway’s support for Trump during the 2016 campaign his then-wife managed — could serve as fodder for Conway’s Democratic primary opponents who want to cast him as a Johnny-come-lately to the party and question whether he can be trusted.\n\nBut liberal journalist Joe Conason, whose 2000 book The Hunting of the President chronicled Conway’s anti-Clinton legal work, told The Independent he did not think George’s politics were ever “as far-right” as his ex-wife’s.\n\n“I think he was conservative on some issues, certainly economic issues, for sure, and some legal issues. I don't think he was ever a, you know, imperial presidency type of authoritarian character at all,” he said. \n\nConason also said Conway and many of the anti-Clinton types he got to know “now see their hostility towards the Clintons is somewhat quaint” given Trump’s conduct over the last decade. \n\nFor his part, Conway said his work against Clinton — much of which took place before some of his primary opponents were even born — wasn’t a function of sheer partisanship as much as it was a passion for the rule of law that has also informed his anti-Trump activism four decades later. \n\nHe told The Independent he would welcome questions over his Clinton-era work because it would demonstrate his consistency — not his partisanship.\n\n“My position on presidential immunity and the responsibilities of a president, that a president is not a king, and that a president is subject to the laws just like everybody else, remains the same as it was in 1998, and my position on abusing women remains exactly the same,” he said before pointing out how he’d also helped writer E. Jean Carroll find counsel for a pair of defamation and sexual abuse lawsuits against Trump that have resulted in juries awarding her tens of millions in damages from the president.\n\nConway noted that he’d commented publicly about the Carroll case after the writer accused Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf-Goodman department store dressing room decades ago by penning a June 2019 Washington Post op-ed calling out the GOP for attacking Carroll years after they venerated a group of women who’d similarly accused Clinton of sexual misconduct.\n\n“I put it to Republicans, if you are all upset about Juanita Broderick and Paula Jones and Kathleen Wiley, then you ought to be really upset about this, because she was [allegedly assaulted] in a department store, and there are witnesses who she talked to immediately after, who confirmed that's what happened,” he said. \n\n“For presidents who abuse power and who abuse women, I think it's wrong either way. That's where I am. I just hate corrupt politicians, period. Full stop.”","summary":"As George Conway launches his campaign for New York’s 12th Congressional District, he tells Andrew Feinberg about his motivations and explains his political evolution a decade after he celebrated Donald Trump’s first election victory","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/george-conway-donald-trump-house-campaign-democrat-b2894973.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/03/08/20/george%20conway.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uzEg6kPp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-06 10:34:03","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.043},{"id":391598346,"title":"Maduro’s arrest is good news for all Americans and leaves Democrats looking foolish","text":"By arresting Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, President Donald Trump has again thrown America’s enemies — and his critics — into disarray. His continued bold defiance of convention and expectations reminds the world he will stop at nothing to protect America’s interests. The fallout from the U.S. military attack on Venezuela and the extraction of one of the globe’s most dangerous drug lords is still spooling out, but there are three likely outcomes that are underappreciated, and may prove consequential. 1) First, the law enforcement and military operation could determine who succeeds President Trump as the GOP contender in 2028. The controversial event showcases an ongoing divide, not only in the MAGA movement, but also in the White House. Trump announced the arrest of Maduro flanked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. JD Vance was nowhere to be seen. DEMOCRATS LABEL TRUMP'S VENEZUELA OPERATION AN 'IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE' The vice president was at his Cincinnati home the day of the Venezuela operation. Did Vance’s absence indicate that isolationist MAGA types disapproved of the Venezuelan incursion? Some of the more vocal members of that group, like Candace Owens and Marjorie Taylor Greene, lambasted the attack. Could this be the issue that determines the Trump succession battle? 2) The arrest of Venezuela’s chief drug lord could trigger a massive political shift throughout Latin and South America. Cuba depends on Venezuela for oil and funds, providing tens of thousands of security personnel in exchange. Without that support, Cuba may fail, opening the door to a more pro-U.S. government. Colombia, currently led by hard-left President Gustavo Petro, whose administration has been tarred by scandal and low approval ratings, could move back to the right in next May’s election with inspiration from neighboring Venezuela. Just weeks ago, Chile elected José Antonio Kast, a hardline conservative who ran on secure borders and safer streets and won 58% of the vote over his Communist Party rival. Argentina made the move two years ago, electing right-wing Javier Milei, who has brought inflation down from 211% to 30% and produced the first budget surplus in 14 years. Remember that former VP and \"border czar\" Kamala Harris pretended she would stem President Joe Biden’s illegal immigration surge by addressing what she called its \"root causes.\" How ironic it would be if Trump’s engagement with governments to the south actually relieved the immigration flow to our country. It could happen. 3) Lending American expertise to Venezuela’s oil industry could help keep global oil production high and prices low, weakening Iran and Russia. The country, which boasts the largest proven oil reserves in the world, has seen production decline since the industry was nationalized under Hugo Chavez. In 2000, Venezuela produced roughly 3.2 million barrels per day; more recently, output dropped below 1 million barrels per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, \"Much of Venezuela’s crude oil production capacity and infrastructure has suffered from prolonged lack of access to capital and regular maintenance.\" Though it will take some time, renewed investment in Venezuela’s oilfields will boost production and, along with higher output from the U.S. and other sources, keep a lid on oil prices. Consequently, the White House will be free to crack down more strenuously on the sanctions imposed on Russian or Iranian oil exports, without pushing prices higher. As the dramatic events in Caracas were reported, I cannot have been alone in wondering where JD Vance was. Not only was the vice president notably absent from the daylong TV coverage, which was dominated by President Trump, he was also curiously quiet on social media. On Saturday, Vance issued but two comments on X; in the first, he seemed to defend the arrest of Maduro, posting that the dictator had been \"offered multiple off ramps but…the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned.\" He also hailed \"the brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation\" and re-Xed Trump’s post announcing the raid. In the second post, Vance defended the legality of the action, noting that Maduro had been indicted for narco-terrorism. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio was front and center, both at the initial press conference and on the Sunday talk shows, providing persuasive explanations for why the White House chose to act, and reviewing the choices offered Maduro. He was clearly all-in with the mission. Vance and Rubio are widely considered frontrunners for the 2028 nomination. The president has more than once, in response to reporters, failed to endorse his VP, instead lofting both candidates as highly qualified for the job. He has even suggested the two could share the ticket. Prediction markets recently gave Vance the lead, with 48% odds of winning the nomination, with Rubio only receiving 12%. Polling also shows Vance with a substantial advantage in New Hampshire, site of the first GOP primary. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But we’re three years out, and voters are not as familiar with Rubio as they are with Vance. A recent Economist poll indicates a full 27% did not know enough about him to rate his record, compared to only 13% who failed to rate Vance. That gives Rubio an opportunity to brand himself as a Trump loyalist and ally. That he certainly did over the weekend as he aggressively argued the case for arresting Maduro. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Rubio does not share Vance’s isolationist tendencies. He is a hawk, and as someone with Cuban heritage, he is especially well suited to lead the charge in pursuing American interests in Latin and South America. He will be extremely visible in attempting to restore order and install a more pro-American government in Caracas; should he succeed, his stock will rise. If Venezuela descends into anarchy, Rubio is at risk. Democrats are reflexively outraged that Trump had the temerity to arrest Maduro. They look foolish, especially since a year ago President Biden offered a $25 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the indicted drug lord. It’s almost as though they are not serious people.","summary":"Political fallout from alleged Venezuela action may determine 2028 Republican nominee as Vance and Rubio take different foreign policy approaches.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/maduros-arrest-good-news-all-americans-leaves-democrats-looking-foolish","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/cilia-flores-nicolas-maduro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 10:00:02","author":"Liz Peek","authors":["Liz Peek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":391581996,"title":"Former VP hopeful Walz drops governor re-election bid","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will not seek a third term in office, saying he will instead focus on allegations of ‍fraud in the state&apos;s welfare system that have become a crisis after mounting pressure and attacks from US President Donald Trump&apos;s administration. Walz, a 61-year-old former teacher and coach, became governor of ​the midwestern state in 2019, and gained national prominence in 2024 as the running mate of then-vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate who lost to Trump. Recently, the Trump administration has ⁠singled out Walz and Minnesota, including its large population of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants, over allegations of fraud, dating to 2020, by some non-profit groups that administer the state&apos;s child care and other social services programs with support from federal funding. At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022, under Trump&apos;s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. In his announcement on Monday, Walz referred to the fraud scandal as a crisis, and said he wanted to \"let others worry about the election while I focus on the work\". He also criticised Trump and other ‌Republicans for what he called bad-faith attacks. \"For the last several years, an organised group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state&apos;s generosity,\" Walz said in his statement to reporters. \"And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organised group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\" ​Trump shared a statement on social media insulting Walz and Democratic governors of other states, calling them corrupt and \"dishonest and incompetent\". The Trump administration, which has vowed to deport ​more immigrants than any prior administration, has singled out Minnesota for investigations and in social media posts, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by non-profit groups serving immigrants in the welfare ‍system. In 2022, federal prosecutors brought charges against the non-profit group Feeding Our Future, accusing it of fraud over COVID-19 pandemic relief funds intended to provide meals to children. Most of those who have pleaded guilty so far are Somali Americans, although the founder of the non-profit is a white American woman, who was convicted in 2024 of ​fraud charges. The prosecutions have continued under Trump, and he and other administration officials ​have frequently criticised the state&apos;s Somali communities, as well as Walz. Although the scandal came to light more than three years ago, the Trump administration has returned to it in recent days thanks in part to a video posted on social media on December 26 by pro-Trump influencer Nick Shirley.

The motive given was that Ms Hortman had voted against her party to strip taxpayer-funded health care coverage for illegal immigrants shortly before her death.\n\nThe evidence given by the original social media user was a letter, written by Boelter and mailed to FBI director Kash Patel. In the document, Boelter claims that Mr Walz instructed him to kill senator Amy Klobuchar, among some other redacted names.\n\nBoelter, a former employee of Mr Walz’s, alleged that the governor would “hurt my family” if he did not “play ball”.\n\nHe also details an alleged meeting, organised by the governor, in which he met with a woman referred to as “Mel”.\n\nToday's News in 90 Seconds, Tuesday, January 6 \n\nAccording to Boelter, he carried out a double shooting shortly after.\n\nPoliticians maintain that Boelter first attempted to murder John Hoffman, a member of the Minnesota Senate, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter, Hope.

He was caught two days later in the biggest manhunt in Minnesota state history.\n\nCurrently, he faces six federal charges in relation to the case, including stalking, murder and attempted shooting.

He has also condemned the president for sharing the conspiracy theory on social media.\n\n“Dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States,” Mr Walz wrote. “In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this.”\n\nSophie Hortman, Colin’s sister, wrote that the post promotes a “false narrative”.\n\n“The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved [dog] Gilbert,” she added, in a statement.

In 2025, our team bet big on independent journalism. We believe that you were tired of talking points TV, you were tired of the stale predictable formats on Sunday, and that you were open to something new.\n\nA recent Gallup poll reinforced our reporting. It found less than 30 percent of Americans are confident the media covers the news fully, accurately, and fairly. I experienced this myself as a CBS News Senior Investigative Correspondent assigned to the Hunter Biden probe.\n\nAfter I left, I wanted to be transparent about the blocks I faced at CBS News. At that time, CBS News was under different management and did not comment. I think one of the obvious questions is why am I sitting here talking about my time at CBS News?\n\nI've always had deep respect for my former employers, but in this case, I've had so many questions about my time at CBS. I'm taking a pause and a moment here to try and answer those questions. I think it's better to hear it from me than to hear it from someone else.\n\nI'd wanted to work at CBS News as long as I can remember. The first time I thought about CBS News was when I was an intern at ABC News in London and I was surrounded by so many experienced foreign correspondents. Some of them had been in Vietnam.\n\nSome of them had worked at CBS News. It just seemed that CBS was a place for independent enterprise reporting. I never imagined that I'd be working at 60.\n\nGetting a job at CBS at 55, to me, was an acknowledgment that the industry was really changing and that it was recognizing women who were deeply sourced and deeply experienced in national security. I was let go in February of 2024. We knew layoffs were coming.\n\nI was not expecting to be laid off. I don't think it was a function of my performance at CBS News. I'd been part of an Emmy-winning team.\n\nI'd had multiple Emmy nominations. We'd won a top environmental prize for our reporting. I'm very proud of that reporting still.\n\nIt impacted a million veterans and expanded their benefits. That morning, there was an email, a company-wide saying, there are going to be layoffs. Literally, within maybe six or seven minutes, I had a text message, text message or email from my bureau chief, Mark Lima, saying, I need you to hop on a Zoom call.\n\nMy husband said to me, what are you doing today? I said, I think I'm getting laid off. And I got on the Zoom call, the human resources person was there, and they told me that my job was being terminated and that I was locked out of the office, locked out of my emails, and they would get my personal effects to me sometime down the road.\n\nI felt a little numb when it happened. What was more surprising to me is that CBS News seized my reporting files. In October of 2020, I was asked by a senior CBS News executive, Ingrid Cyprian-Matthews, to get confirmed reporting about the Hunter Biden story.\n\nSo I brought to her several records where I had done due diligence. I'd done a lot of research. I was highly confident that this was confirmed reporting from the laptop.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that it would have been standard practice for the investigative unit to be tasked with digging deeper into that story to develop our own reporting, and that didn't happen. And that was disappointing to me. It was disappointing because I felt this was an opportunity for CBS News to really lead, to separate itself from the other networks.\n\nBut we missed that opportunity. That was not my call. It was frustrating for me.\n\nI did my part. I got the records like I was asked, but a decision was made somewhere higher up within CBS just not to pursue it at that time. When I saw the 60 Minutes report with Lesley Stahl and she says to President Trump, we can't verify it, I just felt a little sick because I knew that I had been able to authenticate, confirm a handful of documents.\n\nAnd it told me there was a lot more there. And if you put a lot of reporting muscle behind it, you could verify a lot of those records. I don't know if it was a case of the left hand in the news division not knowing what the right hand at 60 Minutes was doing.\n\nI can't answer that question. When Nora O'Donnell was asking then-candidate Biden about it, about the laptop and whether it was a Russian information operation, this senior executive, Ingrid Cyprian-Matthews, she writes, Nora, looking for all confirmed reporting. Do you have all your confirmed reporting on Hunter's story in a note?\n\nAnd I respond, yes. I tell her what it is. Nora, looking for all confirmed reporting.\n\nIs there a Hunter connection to these documents? Yes, all of them in your inbox. And then I texted the documents and it was the million dollar retainer.\n\nAnd it looks like some additional text messages from Hunter Biden to a family member. So when Nora O'Donnell had that question, I thought, did this information never reach her? I was asked to get confirmed reporting for her.\n\nI don't know what happened there. I never asked her. I didn't feel that it was a welcome question.\n\nThere was no evidence that I had come across in October of 2020 that indicated that this was a Russian information operation. The former intelligence officials, several dozen, said in their statement that it had all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation. They kind of hedged their words, but there didn't seem to be any evidence of that.\n\nAll of the records that I was working with, that I was validating, that I was doing due diligence, I didn't see that. Everything was lining up, in fact. And what bothered me about the letter from the 50 plus former intelligence officials is it just seemed to be this very dangerous intersection between the intelligence community and the political cycle.\n\nBecause I felt that it was sort of stepping over a line and that their actions had diminished the stature of their old jobs as CIA director or as the top intelligence official, the director of national intelligence. I'd never seen anything like this before, and I don't think we've seen anything like it since. I was assigned the Hunter Biden story by the very top of CBS.\n\nGeorge Cheeks said to me on multiple occasions that this was a story of the highest priority for the network and that it was a high priority for his boss, Shari Redstone. So I took on that assignment and I did it to the best of my ability. Cheeks said to me, we want to have accountability, speak truth to power on both sides of the aisle, and that really sit well with me.\n\nSo I went after it the way I would go after any of these investigations. It was a very hard assignment. There were corners of support in the company for it, and there were corners of support who understood the value of investigating the Hunter Biden story.\n\nBut there were some elements within CBS News that were just resistant to it. It didn't matter what the facts of the case really were. And this bothered me as a journalist a lot.\n\nAnd I wrestled with it a lot. And people might say, well, then why didn't you leave? Why didn't you quit?\n\nAnd the answer is, I felt I had an obligation to the senior executives at CBS to carry out their directive, to do my very best to run down that story, even if there were internal blocks that I faced. We eventually broadcast a story about the Hunter Biden laptop after the midterm elections in 2022. We commissioned a forensic review.\n\nI got a copy of the laptop data. I have it here still. I went to a lot of effort to get the cleanest copy of the laptop data, the same data that was provided to the FBI, because I didn't want to have any professional journalistic risk for CBS News.\n\nI wanted this to be totally locked down. When we did the story, we did it after the midterms. I argued against that because it was ready before the midterms.\n\nAnd my training is that you should always do the story when it's ready to go. You should not be dictated by the political cycle. Once we got the laptop story on the morning news, I felt that there was so much there that we could still do.\n\nFor example, in the text messages, there's unfortunately the use of the N-word, the liberal use of the N-word. I thought this was worthy of a story, but I was told that it was not something that interested CBS News. Then I asked for a forensic review of the laptop, and we found that there were more than half a dozen emails that were likely used by Joe Biden.\n\nI thought that was a story. But the answer that came back was, well, we need to know what the content is of the emails. But that was going to be a years-long process.\n\nSo there were a lot of reasons I was told not to do it, not to pursue it. I spent a lot of my time at CBS following the Hunter Biden story. And one of the things that really struck me is this kind of disconnect.\n\nI didn't understand how a senior executive like George Cheeks could tell me that this was a high priority for the network and for his boss, and yet the executives at CBS News, show producers, anchors, could refuse that. I came to the conclusion that they must have felt that they were more powerful than George Cheeks, which was astonishing to me. I'd never worked at a place where a directive from the top would be so defied.\n\nI had conversations with some of the reporters connected to the Twitter files, and I was, in my head, thinking that there might be an opportunity to tell that story on CBS News. We had a number of topics under discussion. They didn't go as far as we had hoped.\n\nBut at the end of the day, this opportunity to interview Elon Musk was developing. So I went to the CBS executives, and I said, this is the opportunity that we have. He's saying, I want to do it live and on my platform.\n\nHe's one of the most influential human beings on the planet. And the reaction from the executives was, well, we can't do it live. And I was like, what do you mean we can't do it live?\n\nHe's like, well, we don't know what he's going to say. I was like, well, I'm thinking, isn't that the point of journalism? You don't know what the person's going to say?\n\nWell, you know, it has to be taped. We have to have the ability to edit it. It has to be on our platform.\n\nWe have to control the platform. We talked at one point about whether we could do it sort of like a simulcast between the streaming network and maybe X. But everything just got shut down.\n\nIt's one of the biggest interviews you could ever have. I felt so ashamed, frankly, that I never went back to Elon Musk and said, listen, they want to do it, but they've set all these conditions on it. I couldn't do that.\n\nThis is someone whose DNA is free speech. And how do you tell someone who's committed to free speech that your network can only do it taped and only if they edit it and it can only be on their platform? I just I couldn't go back to him with that.\n\nWell, if you're an investigator, you always look at things through an investigative lens. And when my job was terminated at CBS, I took a look into the one sheet. This is a document they give you that outlines the terms of your separation.\n\nAnd I went into the the metadata. And what I saw in the metadata is that my one sheet was created on February 9th at 515 p.m. And that is a Friday. And it is one day after I covered special counsel Robert Herr's investigation and final report into President Biden.\n\nI reported the facts of that investigation, that it was highly critical of the president, that it described him as sort of a nice old man with a bad memory, and that he couldn't be prosecuted for that reason, among others. So I found the timing of that pretty significant. On top of the fact that I was given an assignment that was very difficult internally, but I was fully committed to.\n\nAnd I did everything I could to put CBS first on a story that was not popular among a lot of people in that network. The day my job was terminated, I sent an email to George Cheeks, who's the head of CBS, and Wendy McMahon, she's head of sort of CBS News and Stations. I had a relationship with both of them.\n\nAnd I said, I would rather work for the months that are left on my contract for a handful of reasons. First and foremost, we had just done a story on veterans who had been denied benefits due to their toxic exposure after 9-11. And we were so close to getting benefits for these veterans.\n\nA whistleblower had come forward. It was really finally within reach for 15,000 veterans. And the answer that came back was, if you can get that story done, Catherine, in two days, then you can do it.\n\nOtherwise, we're just dropping it. And I felt this was such a disservice to America's veterans, 15,000 and their families. We had worked for four or five years on this investigation.\n\nWe'd been able to move forward legislation. And we were this close to getting benefits for them. And then the curtain was pulled down by the CBS News executives.\n\nI was so determined not to let go of that story, that a general I know connected me with Jon Stewart. And Jon Stewart is a great human being. And he picked up the baton, and he said he would help me get it over the finish line.\n\nAnd recently, we saw an expansion of the benefits for these veterans. And I feel a little choked up saying it, because it was such a victory for them. And the fact that CBS really abandoned these veterans was a tremendous disappointment to me.\n\nWhen I look at the situation at CBS News and 60 Minutes and the Kamala Harris interview, to me, it just begs for transparency. My training has always been that when you sit down with a major newsmaker, you have a special responsibility. You need to be asking questions over a broad range of topics.\n\nAnd then you need to release the transcript, because you hope that other news organizations pick up the headlines and run with it beyond what you put on your network broadcast. I was also taught that releasing the transcript is about accountability and transparency, and the correspondent, the producers, the editors, the crews, standing by the integrity of the final product. I think this is especially so when you have a candidate who is running to be president of the United States.\n\nAnd for all of those reasons, I've said it's an imperative, I've been very open about this, that releasing the transcript is about accountability and transparency. And there's a precedent for doing this at CBS News. When I interviewed then President Trump at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I advocated for, and they agreed to post the entire transcript on their website.\n\nSame treatment for then Attorney General Bill Barr. And more recently, 60 Minutes posted the full unedited interview of their sit-down interview with Jerome Powell, the Fed chair. So there's plenty of precedent for CBS News to release the full unedited transcripts.\n\nAnd I think that given the questions about the internal edits in the Kamala Harris interview, it just makes sense to me to release them and to clear the air and to stand behind the integrity of your report. I took some time after I lost my job to educate myself about the marketplace. And I was really surprised at how much the marketplace had changed in the last five years.\n\nThere's just been a tremendous erosion of the audience with the network newscasts, also with cable news. And there's just been this explosion of smaller independent newsrooms on the platforms like X, like Instagram, like YouTube. And I made a decision that I would work independently, that I would tell the stories that I couldn't tell before.\n\nAnd there's something very freeing about that. I feel that this chapter in my career, there are a lot of stories that I want to get finished before I retire. And so I've made those a primary focus.\n\nIt's a whole new way of doing business. But I come back to the idea that content is king, and that the journalism matters. And that's my focus now, that the facts have a power all their own.\n\nAnd we are taking these investigations on X, we're doing a newsletter, the writing skills, these are muscles I haven't used in this way for a long time. So it's kind of exciting to do that again. And then to have that kind of direct feedback, almost like the direct consumer feedback from your audience, which I didn't feel I had at a big corporate entity.\n\nI grew up in corporate media. Corporate media will always have an important place at the table. There's no question in my mind.\n\nBut what's exciting now is that we have a diversity of voices through independent journalists like myself, and then these smaller digital newsrooms. There's no question that X is the platform with the greatest reach. And when I say the greatest reach, it's not just the numbers, but it's the individuals that you can have this contact with, whether it's people who are very senior in politics, major business leaders.\n\nWe were super thrilled when Elon Musk subscribed to our account. That was a huge compliment. So it's not just the size of the audience, it's the diversity of the audience, and it's being able to reach out to a lot of different types of people, the powerful, the decision makers, but then also the everyday consumers of information.\n\nI feel like on X, the people who are following the account are a lot more engaged in the news. They're super consumers of information. You can't argue with the numbers.\n\nI had a conversation with our bureau chief in Washington, Mark Lima, and we were talking about interviews on X. And there was one in particular, I think it was like 35 or 40 million views. And he said to me, that's not a real number.\n\nAnd I said, well, neither is 4.5 on the evening news. But if I had to choose, I would take the 40 million views on X over the 4.5 million views on the evening news, because that's where the growth is. That's where sort of the diverse audience is.\n\nAnd I feel like this is the next chapter for media. After I lost my job, and I had my file seized, I was then held in contempt of court. And I tell people that the crisis has really been transformative in many, many ways.\n\nAnd free speech, the protection of confidential sources, they really are my North Star now. It was all over the media, the fact that CBS News seized my records. That is not a standard practice in this business.\n\nEverywhere else I have left, the custom is for the reporter to take their records with them, not for the corporation to seize them. My position has always been that I was grateful for the work at CBS News. If they don't want me to work there anymore, that is their call.\n\nBut taking my reporting records crossed a red line that should never be crossed again in the future. These files, I had calls from sources I had worked with for years, who wanted to know whether the seizure of my records by CBS News was going to put their identities in jeopardy. I wanted to tell them it was not possible, but I could no longer offer that assurance.\n\nNothing is more sacred than the pledge of confidentiality to your sources. I'm fighting in the courts right now for that. And I'm not here to litigate this, but I can tell you that source protection, the First Amendment, a free press, these are my North Star.\n\nOne of my concerns is that when a corporation takes your reporting records, it makes it harder for you to work in the future. And that shuts down journalism. And if you believe journalism is at the foundation of our democracy, that is a position that just cannot stand.\n\nThis may look very glossy and highly produced, but I've got to emphasize, this is a small ragtag team that really makes it possible every week. So thank you to everyone behind the cameras and thank you to everyone who's handling these edits. In 2026, you can expect more of Straight to the Point with Newsmaker Interviews.\n\nWe have total respect for people who sit down with us because we take on tough topics with direct questions. Not everyone can handle it. Second, more investigations.\n\nThat's about real people, real problems, and real accountability. Actually demanding the government institutions keep their end of the deal and that they have the back of our service members, our spies and our diplomats. And then finally, more whistleblower investigations.\n\nWhistleblowers, they're so special. I feel like this is the part of my work that I'm so grateful for, because they are coming forward for something bigger than themselves. And we are so grateful that they trust us here at Straight to the Point.\n\nAnd we are so grateful that you have trusted us in 2025. And here's to more in 2026.

It was after midnight on January 5 when Secret Service agents heard a loud noise at the Vance home and found DeFoor had broken a window with a hammer and was trying to get into the house. According to the officials, the suspect had also vandalised a Secret Service vehicle on his way up the driveway.\nThe incident occurred at Vance’s Ohio home, which is located in the East Walnut Hills neighbourhood on William Howard Taft Drive. Vance and his wife, Usha, purchased the home for about $1.4 million (Rs 12.63 crore) in 2018.\nOfficials inspect broken windows and other property damage at Vice President JD Vance’s Ohio home in eastern Cincinnati, Ohio.

However, as per protocol, some of the US Secret Service personnel was present at the premise.\nImages from Vance’s house showed a number of shattered windows at the residence. According to a news release from the US Attorney’s Office in Cincinnati, the strikes caused damaged to the “enhanced security assets” on each window, valued at more than $28,000 (Rs 25.28 lakh).\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD After being arrested, the suspect, identified as Defoor, has been charged with vandalism, obstruction of an official business and criminal trespass. However, the motive behind the attack remains unknown.\nWho is William DeFoor? Why did he attack Vance’s house? Now, in custody, the man behind the attack has been identified as 26-year-old William DeFoor. He is the son of a prominent millionaire family and is a Cincinnati native himself.\nWhile it’s not clear if he’s a transgender, Defoor has been going by the name “Julia” in recent weeks. DeFoor, it appears, had created a recent Facebook page under the name of Julia a month ago, and included a transgender wellness centre among the page’s likes.\nInvestigations reveal the 26-year-old grew up in a $1.3 million home in the affluent Hyde Park neighbourhood with two younger siblings, the child of a surgeon father, William, and a paediatrician mother, Catherine, who are both registered Democrats. As per a Daily Mail report, DeFoor’s father is a supporter of Democratic causes; he donated more than $11,600 to Kamala Harris’ campaign. He also donated to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in 2020.\nWilliam DeFoor is charged with vandalism, obstruction of an official business and criminal trespass, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff’s office. Image Courtesy: Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office As per the Facebook page, DeFoor graduated from high school in 2018 before attending the University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music. The suspect did not appear to have finished the course and enrolled at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College last year.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD DeFoor is also a registered voter in Ohio. However, no party affiliation has been made public.\nPaediatric urologist William DeFoor (right) and Catherine DeFoor, William’s parents. Image Courtesy: @bob_defoor/Threads While DeFoor is been charged with vandalising Vance’s house, this isn’t his first brush with the law. Last year, DeFoor was charged with vandalism after windows at a business in Hyde Park were broken, according to court records. That case was referred to a mental health docket, and DeFoor was granted “treatment in lieu of conviction”. That treatment was still ongoing, according to court documents.\nEarlier, in 2023, DeFoor was charged with trespassing at the US Health psychiatric emergency services and held on a $10,000 bond — but a judge determined he was not mentally competent to stand trial and the counts were dismissed later that year.\nWhat does Vance say about the attack? Vice President JD Vance heaped praise on law enforcement officials in Ohio following the incident. In a post on X, the US vice president wrote: “I appreciate everyone’s well wishes about the attack at our home. As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows. I’m grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly.”\nUS Vice President JD Vance thanked law enforcement officials after the vandalism at his house, saying he believed it was a “crazy” person. File image/AP He then slammed the media for covering the incident. “One request to the media: we try to protect our kids as much as possible from the realities of this life of public service. In that light, I am sceptical of the news value of plastering images of our home with holes in the windows.”\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The vandalism at Vance’s Ohio residence on Monday evokes memories of an incident that occurred last March. At the time, Vance claimed that he was chased by pro-Ukraine protesters in Ohio’s Cincinnati when he was out on a walk with his three-year-old daughter, leaving her “anxious and scared” by their shouts. He then decided to talk to the protesters — which resulted in a “mostly” respectful conversation.\n“I decided to speak with the protesters in the hopes that I could trade a few minutes of conversation for them leaving my toddler alone. (Nearly all of them agreed),” Vance wrote on X at the time. “It was a mostly respectful conversation, but if you’re chasing a three-year-old as part of a political protest, you’re a s–t person.”\nWith inputs from agencies","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-vice-president-jd-vance-house-vandalised-william-defoor-charged-motive-13965803.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/vance1-2026-01-453d88235151d8899ad4f9390d485938.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 03:29:15","author":"Fp Explainers","authors":["Fp Explainers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":391552080,"title":"Monday's Final Word","text":"The tab police, they live inside my head ...\n\nJUST IN: Reporters audibly furious after Governor Tim Walz abruptly ends and bolts from his press conference after announcing he was dropping out of the 2026 race.Reporter 1: \"Are you s... wait what??\"Reporter 2: \"Wow!

Why didn't you?\"\n\nEd: Need we ask? He and Kamala Harris avoided the press as much as possible. Turns out that it wasn't just Harris who won't talk to the media. Looks like Governor JazzHands McSnitchLine doesn't much like accountability on his own. And that works in Minnesota, where the Minneapolis Star-Tribune is practically allergic to reporting in general, and specifically reporting on Democrats.\n\nMatt Margolis at PJM: Reporters were confused. If you watch a clip of the end of the press conference, it’s clear they were also a bit angry that they didn’t get to answer questions.\n\n“You said you were gonna take questions,” a reporter can be heard asking. “Why didn't you?”\n\nSo Walz enticed the media to cover his press conference by saying he’d answer questions, then didn’t. Talk about gutless. He wanted to get his story out without any pushback, plain and simple, and the worst part is, he couldn’t be bothered to write a unique speech; he just regurgitated a previously published statement. By bailing on questions, Walz ensured that the only version of events on the record that day was his own. For a governor claiming to put Minnesota first and politics second, it was a telling decision.\n\nEd: It was an entirely expected decision, in keeping with Walz' character. He's running away from politics because he made the monumentally stupid choice to turn himself into a national figure, and in doing so made himself and Minnesota a story that the Strib can no longer keep covered up. \n\nI ENDED TIM WALZ— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) January 5, 2026\n\nEd: Nick deserves a ton of credit for this. He's also clearly posting this with tongue in cheek. Let's also remember, though, that the Power Line folks built the platform for dealing with fraud in Minnesota, without which Shirley wouldn't have been there. I'm happy to spread credit among all of the folks who participated in that effort ... including our own David Strom and Mitch Berg, who have been attempting to expose this in their own ways for years on AM1280 The Patriot, even before contributing here. \n\nAxios: State of play: The buzz about a Klobuchar bid comes on the heels of Walz's Monday announcement that he is scrapping plans to run for an unprecedented third consecutive term.\n\nReports that the two top Democrats met privately over the weekend — and the registration of several website domain names such as Klobucharforgovernor.com — further fueled the speculation.\n\nWhat we're hearing: Klobuchar is actively weighing a gubernatorial bid, sources told Axios.\n\nOne source familiar with her thinking said a final decision hadn't been made. Another source indicated she is likely to jump into the race.\n\nEd: Let's be straight about this – if Klobuchar gets into the race, she clears the DFL primary field and wins the general election without breaking a sweat. The question is whether A-Klo really wants this. Right now, she's one of 100 legislators with no real executive responsibilities. Does she want to become an executive who will immediately be responsible for the conduct of a corrupted government, while operating mainly outside of the national media arena unless she screws up? I think she'll do it, but I'm not sure of it yet. \n\nSUBMITTED: Minneapolis Craigslist post in search of child actors for daycare site where funding was “cruelly ripped away without cause.”“To help hurry this state vetting process, we are looking to hire 20 child actors for 3 days while state is present on site.”$1,500/day… pic.twitter.com/vvhDCR235g— Liz Collin (@lizcollin) January 4, 2026\n\nEd: That's $90,000. Someone is spending big money to attempt to protect fraud. If these childcare centers were legit, there would be no need to hire crisis actors for video of \"normal\" operations. The ad got pulled down, but it's not clear whether it was because of the exposure, or because they hired all the actors they needed. \n\nIsaac Schorr, Mediaite: In a few representative examples of the progressive reaction to Operation Absolute Resolve, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) decried Trump’s “reckless” decision and declared that her city would “continue to stand for peace, democracy, and diplomacy”; her newly-minted Big Apple counterpart Zohran Mamdani (D) submitted that “unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law”; and The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur, as is his wont, perceived the Maduro operation as a nefarious Zionist plot.\n\nWhat painful distortions of the facts these are. ...\n\nFor both those invested in the world order underwritten by America, the relegation of Maduro from axis henchman to New York City inmate is a monumental victory notable for both its strategic and principled significance. His boot has been removed from the throat of his people, and the axis has been stripped of a foothold in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAbsolute Resolve wasn’t a mistake borne of might-makes-right thinking, but a masterstroke in which might was exercised in service of right. Three cheers for its clear-eyed architects and the brave men and women who carried it out.\n\nEd: Is it possible that this could go sideways? Sure. But we've been trying everything else for 27 years while Chavez and Maduro allowed Hezbollah to set up a terror-trafficking network for Iran's benefit in the Western Hemisphere. It was time to try something new. \n\nMADURO: “I’m a decent person!”Also MADURO: https://t.co/mh5Ib2t45h pic.twitter.com/pqfgyE5qGS— Bree A Dail (@breeadail) January 5, 2026\n\nEd: Is this why Bass, Mamdani, and other progressives are defending Maduro?

Appearing on “Finnerty,” Newsmax host Rob Finnerty asked Jennings whether he plans to seek elected office. Jennings did not commit to a run, but he also did not shut the door to the idea.\n\n“Do you plan on running for office, maybe in Kentucky, which seems like an interesting state? You’ve got Rand Paul, Thomas Massie, Mitch McConnell. Your governor is a Democrat, Andy Beshear. Do you plan on ever getting into politics?” Finnerty asked Jennings.\n\n“Possibly. I get a lot of encouragement. Not in the near term, certainly, but in the medium term? We’ll see. I get a lot of encouragement, both from in the state and from around the country. But, truthfully, I’m very happy with my life right now,” Jennings said.\n\nJennings pointed to his expanding media footprint as a reason to stay put.\n\n“I’ve got a great platform at CNN. The book is doing well. We made the New York Times bestseller list. I have a radio show on the Salem network that’s now two hours. That started today. We’re in 300 and something radio stations across the country,” Jennings said. “So [I’m] sort of focused on using my voice to fight the Libs and make the best case I can for conservatives across this country. And we’ll see what the future holds, but I certainly haven’t ruled it out, and I’m extremely interested.”\n\nJennings served in key roles for former President George W. Bush’s 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns and later became Special Assistant to the President for Political Affairs in the Bush White House. He has worked as a senior advisor on numerous Republican Senate, congressional, and local political campaigns, including long-standing work with Republican Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and other GOP figures.\n\nJennings has publicly aligned himself with President Donald Trump, saying on “The PBD Podcast” that he has voted Republican his entire life and came to see Trump as the clear, common-sense choice over Democratic alternatives. (RELATED: 5 Times Scott Jennings Duked It Out With The Left In 2025)\n\n“Well, I’ve voted Republican my whole life. And I did vote for him three times. But like everybody else, I didn’t get it. I mean, I readily admit I did not get it. I did not understand it,” Jennings said. “I did not get how this guy who hadn’t been a Republican was coming along to take over the Republican Party. I just — I did not get it. And so over time, I began to realize what he was doing. And I also began to realize the choice. And in 2024, for me, there was no — I mean, [former Vice President] Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump?

But Donald Trump proposing to ‘run’ Venezuela without a coherent long-term plan beyond an oil grab is dangerous for America. The path forward must be democracy, human rights, and stability,” Newsom said in a statement reported by The Hill.\n\nFrom California to Congress, other Democrats lined up to slam the commander-in-chief, labeling Maduro’s capture as a distraction to problems at home and a blatant oil grab.\n\nFormer VP Kamala Harris, who recently took a pass on running for Newsom’s soon-to-be-vacant seat, chimed in with a similar refrain. She accused Trump of playing a “regional strongman” to secure Venezuela’s oil reserves. “There is no exit plan,” Harris said, claiming the move was about “Trump’s desire,” not the American people.\n\nNot to be outdone, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took to X to accuse Trump of launching a “war for regime change” to hide a “failing economy.”\n\n“The American people don’t want to ‘run’ a foreign country while our leaders fail to improve life in this one,” Buttigieg wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, AOC said, “It’s not about drugs,” in a nod to Trump’s recent pardoning of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. “It’s about oil and regime change,” she wrote on X. “And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nWhile the progressive wing screams “illegal war,” some moderate dems are also struggling to keep their balance. Sen. Mark Kelly acknowledged Maduro as a “brutal, illegitimate dictator” who belongs in a cage, but didn’t praise the mission, citing Iraq war flashbacks.\n\nHis fellow Arizonan, Sen. Ruben Gallego, was far more blunt: “No matter the outcome we are in the wrong for starting this war in Venezuela.”\n\nDespite the hand-wringing, Maduro and his wife are being fitted for a jumpsuit in NYC facing narco-terrorism charges.","summary":"While many Venezuelans across California are celebrating the moment, Governor Gavin Newsom is trashing President Trump after the arrest of Nicolas Maduro.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/05/us-news/gavin-newsom-slams-donald-trump-for-nicolas-maduro-arrest/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/118349925.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3JVKwiaE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-06 02:08:08","author":"Bianca Heyward","authors":["Bianca Heyward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.063},{"id":391547082,"title":"Venezuela's new interim leader Delcy Rodríguez 'hates the West,' ex official warns","text":"Nicolás Maduro’s interim replacement now leading Venezuela in the wake of his arrest represents a continuation of the same regime, and with a woman who \"hates the West\" at the helm, a former Venezuelan official has warned.

Born in Caracas, Rodríguez is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla leader Jorge Antonio Rodríguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League. He was arrested in connection with the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F.

Rodríguez’s tenure as foreign minister was also marked by controversy, the source claimed, including allegations that Venezuelan passports, birth certificates, and nationalities were illegally sold abroad, according to reports. At the 2016 United Nations General Assembly, Rodríguez said the allegations were untrue. \"There were some passports being sold in Iraq, and they were giving birth certificates to terrorists,\" the source claimed. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Rodríguez, citing her role as a senior official in the Maduro government. Those sanctions remain in place.

Gov. and progressive Democratic Senate candidate Peggy Flanagan is taking criticism, including from inside her own party, for her leadership during what has been described as the nation's largest COVID-era fraud scheme. Along with Democrat Gov. Tim Walz, Flanagan, who has helped lead the state as lieutenant governor since 2019, has come under fire for allowing the fraud scheme to grow under her watch. A Minnesota Democratic operative told Fox News Digital that Flanagan \"could absolutely lose to a Republican given all the fraud that took place during her time as Lt. Governor.\" \"Today is the day Peggy's Senate race effectively ended,\" said the Democratic operative. FRAUD FALLOUT FORCES DEMOCRATIC GOV. TIM WALZ TO ABANDON MINNESOTA RE-ELECTION BID \"Here are the facts, Peggy Flanagan was already a bad general election candidate, and this has made it even worse,\" the operative went on, adding, \"she owes the voters answers about what she knew and when.\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., whose district includes the Twin Cities suburbs, told Fox News Digital that \"Peggy Flanagan is just as much of a failure as Tim Walz.\" He noted that Flanagan’s primary opponent, Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, \"isn’t much better.\" \"Both of these candidates sat idly by while billions were stolen from hardworking taxpayers in Minnesota. And just like Tim, they ought to reconsider their candidacy,\" said Emmer. Walz, who served as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024, announced on Monday that he was withdrawing from seeking a third term as governor in light of the fraud scandal. \"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,\" Walz wrote in a statement. \"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.\" OVER 1,000 ARRESTED IN ‘MASSIVE’ MINNESOTA OPERATION, INCLUDING MURDERERS, RAPISTS, PEDOPHILES \"So, I’ve decided to step out of this race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work in front of me for the next year,\" the governor added. Flanagan is running to replace outgoing Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, who is retiring from the Senate. She has been endorsed by the likes of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Though she is considered a frontrunner, Flanagan’s response to the scandal has garnered criticism. She was recently seen on a Somali TV station wearing a hijab at a mall to signal her support for Minnesota’s Somali community as the federal government cracks down on the fraud scheme. This comes as more than 90 people, most from Minnesota's large Somali community, have been charged since 2022 in what has been described as the nation's largest COVID-era scheme. How much money has been stolen through alleged money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. But the U.S. attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion. In response to the criticisms, Lexi Byler, a spokesperson for Flanagan’s campaign, told Fox News Digital that \"the Lt. Governor has made clear that the amount of fraud that is acceptable is zero and anyone who steals from taxpayer dollars should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law – which is exactly what's happening in Minnesota, where 98 people have been charged and 62 convicted so far.\" TRUMP FLIPS DEMOCRATS’ ‘NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW’ MANTRA AFTER WALZ DROPS RE-ELECTION BID Byler added that \"what’s hard to take seriously is Republicans talking about accountability while Donald Trump has pardoned 27 corporate fraudsters and fired the Inspectors General whose job it is to police fraud,\" adding that \"Republicans are going to have to answer for that.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP On her campaign website, Flanagan touts her record as lieutenant governor, including expanding Minnesota’s paid family and medical leave program and investments in education, healthcare and housing. The Minnesota primary is on August 11. Fox News Digital also reached out to Walz and Craig for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"Minnesota Lt.

Yet that is the allegation now fuelling a fast-moving case in Cincinnati, after police say a hammer-wielding suspect targeted Vice President JD Vance's property while the family was out of state.What has pushed the story beyond a straightforward arrest is the swirl of personal, political, and identity details now attached to the suspect. Investigators allege the accused comes from a wealthy local family, while online activity suggests he had recently been using the name 'Julia'.A Midnight AttackThe suspect, William DeFoor, 26, was arrested early Monday after allegedly shattering four windows at Vance's home. Police said that DeFoor was attempting to break into the home around midnight. The Vances were not in Ohio at the time; they had moved into the vice president's official residence in Washington, DC, after the inauguration.The 'Julia' DetailIt's unclear whether DeFoor identifies as transgender or nonbinary, but he recently appeared to be posting under the name Julia DeFoor. Police listed the suspect's name as William, and his gender as male. In his mugshot, DeFoor has an unkempt, matted mullet – and a dead-eyed stare.The 'Julia' detail has become a point of intense online discussion, partly because it introduces uncertainty at the exact moment the public wants clarity.Son of a Prominent Doctor and Democratic DonorDeFoor's father, also named William, is a successful Harvard University graduate. He boasts a decades-long history as a pediatric urologist in Cincinnati and works as a professor at the University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine. The family lives in a £1.0 million ($1.3 million) house in the city's wealthy Hyde Park neighbourhood.The elder DeFoor donated thousands to Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign in 2024 after years of small contributions to a PAC that lobbied for urologists, according to federal records. He is also a longtime Democratic supporter, according to his public contributions. He donated upwards of $5,000 to former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris' respective campaigns in 2020 and 2024.A History of Mental Health StrugglesThe younger DeFoor appeared to have a fall from grace after graduating from the Summit Country Day School in 2018, where he was hailed as a candidate for the US Presidential Scholars Program. He had a brief two-year stint at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music, but appeared to drop out in 2020, according to his Facebook.The alleged vandal has a tricky mental health history, including a 2024 sentence for two counts of vandalism at a local interior design company. Instead of a standard conviction, DeFoor was sentenced to two years of mandatory mental health treatment, which is still ongoing, according to court documents obtained by Cincinnati.com.In April 2023, DeFoor was charged with trespassing at UC Health psychiatric and emergency services. He was originally held on a £7,900 ($10,000) bond—but a judge determined he was not mentally competent to stand trial and the counts were dismissed in an 8 November filing that year.DeFoor is charged with obstructing official business, criminal damaging or endangering, criminal trespass, and vandalism, according to Hamilton County jail records.His first court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/jd-vance-home-vandal-suspect-tied-wealthy-family-father-backed-kamala-harris-records-show-1768531","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780488/jd-vance-vandal-now-custody-has-revealing-background.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9e0b910a9b06711cfe9fea445afc8489","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:45:03","author":"Daniel Joshua Flores","authors":["Daniel Joshua Flores"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.017},{"id":391548416,"title":"Governor ‘Tampon Tim’ Walz Faces Ultimate Political Downfall: The Untold Story","text":"At the Minnesota State Capitol, Tim Walz made a poignant announcement, declaring the end of his political journey. As he spoke, it seemed as though emotion might overtake him.\n\nFollowing his speech, Walz quietly exited the stage without fielding questions, while his wife, Gwen, appeared visibly emotional, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.\n\nPerhaps their thoughts wandered to an alternate reality where Walz and Kamala Harris had claimed victory in the 2024 elections. Instead of residing in the Vice President’s abode at the US Naval Observatory, Walz now steps away from the political spotlight after what can only be described as one of the most tumultuous episodes in recent political history.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty of his future, it remains unclear where Tim and Gwen Walz will settle following his departure from the governor’s office next January. Back in July 2019, Walz sold his personal residence for $304,000, opting for a state-provided residence, despite still owing $250,000 on the initial mortgage.\n\nUltimately, Walz’s political downfall can be attributed to the Minnesota welfare scandal, which has recently captured national attention with greater impact than his 2024 campaign ever did.\n\nThis past Monday, Walz officially withdrew from the gubernatorial race for a third term, taking responsibility for the fraud that occurred during his tenure, acknowledging, “the buck does stop with me.”\n\nWalz conceded: ‘For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity.’\n\nHowever, when it came to his own downfall, he refused to take responsibility, instead blaming ‘conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers’ and the White House.\n\nHe accused President Trump of ‘demonizing our Somali neighbors,’ which was ‘disgusting and dangerous,’ he said.\n\nThe reaction from Republicans was mixed, with Walz’s demise being regarded as long overdue. However, he was also seen as one of the easiest and most useful political punching bags on the Democratic side.\n\nAmid the ongoing scandal, Walz has been summoned to appear before a congressional committee on Wednesday, and the Trump administration called it ‘one of the largest frauds in American history and probably the largest theft of public welfare dollars’.\n\nFederal charges have been filed against 98 people accused of embezzlement of public funds and, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants are ‘of Somali descent’. Minnesota has the largest Somali population in America.\n\nFifty-seven people, most of them Somali, have already been convicted in the scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children, according to prosecutors.\n\nThose involved are accused of faking invoices, attendance records and meal deliveries, and spending the money on items including Lamborghinis, Porsches, and property in the Maldives.\n\nRepublicans accused Democrats in Minnesota of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the scandal involved the state’s Somali community, the largest in the country, with around 80,000 members.\n\nThe case first became public in 2022 but was injected into the national consciousness over the recent Christmas period after YouTuber Nick Shirley released a viral video focusing on day care centers in Minnesota.\n\nThat video was watched 127 million times on X and the Trump administration responded by surging fraud investigators to Minnesota and freezing federal child care payments to the state.\n\nWalz has found himself at the center of the storm, and it is far from the first time.\n\nFrom the moment Harris made the fateful decision to select him, the 61-year-old has been mired in gaffes and scandal. \n\nHarris’s aim was to appeal to Midwestern voters, with Walz touting his status as a gun owner and hunter.\n\nHowever, when he invited the media to follow him on a pheasant hunt through long grass, it ended in farce.\n\nSocial media commentators accused Walz of ‘staging’ the event because other men with him had orange vests on but no guns.\n\nVideo showed him struggling to load his shotgun and he reportedly did not fire a single shot during the three-hour hunt.\n\nWhile most politicians on a presidential ticket have a major controversy to deal with, he had at least half a dozen.\n\nPerhaps the most damaging involved questions over why, as a national guardsman, he did not deploy to Iraq with his unit in 2006, having retired the year before.\n\nBut there were also accusations that he inflated his resume as a high school football coach.\n\nIn a huge embarrassment, Walz himself admitted ‘misspeaking’ after claiming to have been in Hong Kong when the Tiananmen Square massacre took place in Beijing in 1989.\n\nBut he had been to communist China dozens of times, and a congressional investigation was launched into his links to the communist country.\n\nIn a further humiliation, Republicans nicknamed him ‘Tampon Tim’ for signing a 2023 law requiring that Minnesota schools provide menstruation supplies in boys’ restrooms.\n\nHis economic record in the state was quickly trashed, and his own financial competence was called into question.\n\nExperts had been surprised when Harris picked him over the frontrunner, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and her aides indicated it was due to personal chemistry.\n\nBut Walz proceeded to engage awkwardly in public with Harris, and commentators described some of their early appearances together as stilted.\n\nIn one social media video he shared with Harris his recipe for ‘white guy tacos’.\n\nThen, in his big moment, Walz was widely seen to have been outclassed by JD Vance, a younger man with much less political experience, in the vice presidential debate.\n\nOne influential pollster told the Daily Mail it was the moment Vance made his mark with the public, and Walz allowed him to do so.\n\nWalz licked his wounds and returned to Minnesota, any dreams of running for the White House himself in 2028 dashed.\n\nIn retrospect, his downfall had begun the moment Democrats appeared to inflate his football coaching resume at the party’s Chicago convention in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe tale went that, in 1999, Walz had turned around Mankato West High School’s football team from 0-27 into state champions in an underdog triumph for the ages.\n\nPlayers for the team were brought on stage and Amy Klobuchar, who ironically may now run to replace him as governor, told the crowd: ‘In Minnesota, we trust a coach who turned a team that was 0-27 into state champions.’\n\nIn fact, the head coach of the all-conquering side known as the ‘Scarlets’ was a man named Rick Sutton.\n\nWalz, a social studies teacher, had been one of several assistant coaches under Sutton, working primarily with the defensive players.\n\nScrutiny then fell on Walz’s trips to China in the days when he was a teacher.\n\nOf particular note was his claim to have been in Hong Kong on June 4, 1989 – the day when the Chinese authorities massacred pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.\n\nSpeaking to a 2009 hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to mark the 20-year anniversary of the massacre, Walz recalled his trip.\n\nHe said: ‘Twenty years ago today, I was in Hong Kong preparing to go to Foshan to teach. To watch what happened at the end of the day on June 4 was something that many of us will never forget, we pledge to never forget, and bearing witness and accurate telling of history is absolutely crucial for any nation to move forward.’\n\nWalz made this claim on more than one occasion, but newspaper reports of the time place him nowhere near Hong Kong or China.\n\nIn an excruciating moment during the vice-presidential debate, watched by millions of voters, Walz conceded that he had ‘misspoken’ and said: ‘I’m a knucklehead at times.’\n\nBut perhaps more damaging to his reputation was the controversy over his military record.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nIn a 2018 video advocating for stricter gun-control laws, he said: ‘We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.’\n\nThe phrase ‘that I carried in war’ was taken by many to suggest that Walz had served in a combat zone.\n\nHowever, Walz was only ever deployed to Italy in 2003 to provide security at a US military base that was involved in supporting the ongoing Afghanistan war effort.\n\nTo address the matter, the Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement to say that Walz ‘misspoke’ – again.\n\nBut Walz himself seemed reluctant to admit a mistake.\n\nIn a joint CNN interview with Harris, he was asked to confirm that he had misspoken, but his answer appeared evasive.\n\n‘My wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct,’ he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he was lambasted by members of his own former unit for his decision to retire from the National Guard shortly before they were deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nVance, who served with the US Marines in Iraq, called that decision ‘absolutely shameful’.\n\nIt also emerged that Walz, in campaign literature for a 2006 bid to represent Minnesota in the House of Representatives, was described as a ‘retired command sergeant major’.\n\nThe same description was used on the Harris-Walz website in 2024.\n\nHowever, even though Walz did briefly serve as a command sergeant major, he did not keep that title after retirement.\n\nInstead, he retired as a lower-ranking ‘master sergeant’, having never completed the coursework required to retain the more senior title.\n\nThe mother of Kye Miller, a Minnesotan who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq on June 29, 2006, slammed Walz at the time.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: ‘To publicly present false prestige of his unearned rank, an inaccurate representation, is a falsehood of who he truly is.’\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign was forced to edit its website to correct the mistake.\n\nIt was far from the first scandal Walz had been through.\n\nBefore his political career, when he was a teacher, he was stopped by police while driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone near Chadron, Nebraska.\n\nA blood test showed his alcohol level was above the state’s legal limit, and his lawyer admitted in court that he had been drinking.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving, lost his license for 90 days, and paid a fine of $200.\n\nA decade later, when he ran for Congress, the incident emerged and his team claimed that he had not been drinking.\n\n‘The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: it wasn’t true,’ his team said.\n\nThey claimed that Walz had only failed a sobriety test because of hearing loss he incurred while serving in the National Guard – and that he had been allowed to drive himself to jail.\n\nThe full truth later emerged – that he had been drinking and was driven to the police station in the back of a police car.\n\nHaving survived such a litany of scandals, Walz came within reach of the office of vice president.\n\nOn Monday, as he announced he would not run for Minnesota governor again, he said he had ‘zero sadness and zero regret’.\n\nLike some of his other statements, that one was a little hard to believe.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAt the Minnesota State Capitol, Tim Walz made a poignant announcement, declaring&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Governor &#8216;Tampon Tim&#8217; Walz Faces Ultimate Political Downfall: The Untold Story first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/governor-tampon-tim-walz-faces-ultimate-political-downfall-the-untold-story/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tampon-Tim-Walzs-final-humiliation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:38:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":391552144,"title":"Tim Walz drops bid for 3rd term as Minnesota governor; another prominent Dem mulls run","text":"St Paul, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into the state’s child care programs and its Somali community.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,” making it impossible for him to serve full time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,” Walz said at the state capitol. ”So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the Republican president’s attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nWalz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he’d found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. But the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video’s creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor’s decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that Walz was not running “because he was caught, REDHANDED” with “stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars,” an accusation against the governor that lacked evidence despite widely acknowledged fraud problems. The president said Walz “has destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nWalz’s exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats hold 24 of 50 governor’s seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota’s, on the ballot this year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris’ defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz’s announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.” Walz’s guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, was more succinct, issuing a statement that said only: “Good riddance.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and said the state’s next Democratic candidate “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz stood by his stewardship, saying “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable” and insisting that his administration has been working diligently to address the problem.\n\nA look at Walz’s time as governor\n\nDuring his two terms, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd’s death but stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youths and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar after she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.","summary":"Walz was the Democrats' 2024 candidate for vice president.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2026/01/tim-walz-drops-bid-for-3rd-term-as-minnesota-governor-another-prominent-dem-mulls-run.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/7M35C37PRNFQPDSGX2JBHLOQGQ.jpg?auth=7503c66f9ccbb4d8dd78aa5181ff03517366b33f4d47715b73a2f76e43be17d6&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:43:57","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":391538572,"title":"Non-Shocker of the Day: JD Vance Home Attacker Was Transgender","text":"As PJ Media previously reported, someone vandalized Vice President JD Vance’s Cincinnati home. Local police arrested a suspect after the incident, and there were no reported injuries. The Vances were not there at the time of the incident.\n\n“I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home. As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows. I'm grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly,” Vance said in a statement on X. “We weren't even home as we had returned already to DC.”\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service confirmed the incident in a statement to ABC News, saying, “An adult male was taken into custody by the Cincinnati Police Department after being detained by U.S. Secret Service personnel for causing property damage, including breaking windows on the exterior of a personal residence associated with the Vice President.”\n\nThe suspect was later identified as 24-year-old William DeFoor. And in a twist that should surprise no one, he is a male who “identifies” as a woman, with wealthy doctor parents who are also Democrat donors.\n\nA Facebook page created just last month suggests the suspect had already begun reshaping his public identity before the alleged home invasion. On the page, he calls himself Julia DeFoor, with the first profile photo appearing on December 15. Other than that, the details are limited.\n\nBREAKING: JD Vance home attacker William DeFoor confirmed to be transgender and goes by the name “Julia”Both parents are registered as Democrats, donating over $11,000 to Kamala Harris in 2024.They also donated to Joe Biden.There it is. pic.twitter.com/DSZjzgJvsy— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) January 5, 2026\n\nBeyond that rebranding effort, the account reads like a record of drifting commitments. DeFoor claims to have graduated from Summit Country Day in 2018 before enrolling at the University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music that fall. By 2020, he had left the program, and the profile lists no degree.\n\nThe profile highlights DeFoor's graduation from Summit Country Day in 2018 and attendance at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music beginning in August that year.According to the profile, DeFoor left the music conservatory in 2020, suggesting that a degree was never completed. His 19-year-old brother Alex, an aspiring musician who shares his songs on social media, currently studies at that very conservatory.DeFoor then enrolled at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College last year. It is unclear what he was studying.The Facebook profile also highlighted his liked pages, including the Heartland Trans Wellness center, which aims to provide resources for transgender patients in the Greater Cincinnati area.\n\nFederal Election Commission records reviewed by the Daily Mail show that his father, William, has been a reliable donor to Democratic causes. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, William contributed more than $11,600 to Kamala Harris’s campaign and to the Democratic Party fundraising platform ActBlue. He also donated to Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nICYMI: Democrats Demanded Maduro’s Ouster… Before Trump Delivered. And We Got the Receipts!\n\nDeFoor himself is a registered voter in Ohio.

Adityanath also met BJP national president JP Nadda and working president Nitin Nabin. Notably, Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak was also in Delhi, and he met Nadda and Nabin separately during the day. The expansion of the UP Cabinet has been on the cards since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP won fewer seats than the Opposition Samajwadi Party. While state BJP leadership stated that the Cabinet expansion was “inevitable”, it justified the delay, saying it would take place after the election of the state unit president. With Assembly elections in the state less than two years away, the BJP last month anointed Maharajganj MP and Union minister Pankaj Chaudhary, an OBC, as the state BJP chief. Outgoing state unit president Bhupendra Chaudhary, who was a cabinet minister in the first term of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, is a frontrunner for a cabinet post, sources in the party said. “The discussion over Cabinet expansion is yet to reach a concluding state, and many more sittings are required. Today's meetings of the UP CM with top party leadership were to discuss important government and policy-related issues,” a senior BJP leader said, adding the CM's visit to Delhi was “not planned”. At present, there are 21 Cabinet ministers, including the CM and two deputy CMs, 14 Ministers of State with Independent Charge, and 19 Ministers of State. Yogi gifts Modi a Ram Temple replica in Gulabi Meenakari Chief Minister Adityanath on Monday presented Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a replica of Ram’s temple crafted in Gulabi Meenakari. The replica, prepared by craftsman Kunj Bihari Singh on the occasion of the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, has been created using 2 kilos of silver and gold, with diamonds embedded in the structure. The replica consists of 108 individual parts and was completed over a period of 108 days. “Throughout its creation, continuous chanting of Ram Dhun was carried out for all 108 days,” the government said. “The symbolic design elements include a golden depiction of Shri Ram, lotus motifs and the bow and arrow, diamonds embedded on the four spires, and an internal lighting arrangement. Together, these elements vividly reflect the spiritual significance of the number 108 in the Sanatan tradition,” an official said During his visit to the United States in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had presented a Gulabi Meenakari chess set to the then US Vice President Kamala Harris. —ENS","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/yogi-meeting-bjp-top-brass-in-delhi-and-buzz-of-lucknow-cabinet-expansion-10457409/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-meets-Uttar-Pradesh-CM-Yogi-Adityanath-in-New-Delhi-on-Monday.-ANI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:30:03","author":"Bhupendra Pandey","authors":["Bhupendra Pandey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.263},{"id":391548394,"title":"Trump lands a knockout punch on Walz","text":"One thing America has always known about President Donald Trump: If you take a swing at him, he punches back twice as hard.\n\nMinnesota Gov.

(EPA Images pic)\nWASHINGTON: Former US vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz announced Monday he was ending his bid for a third term as Minnesota governor, bowing out amid mounting political headwinds and renewed scrutiny over fraud in state programs.\nWalz, a Democrat who rose to national prominence as Kamala Harris's running mate in 2024, made the call just months after launching his reelection campaign.\nIn a statement, Walz said the storm over fraud allegations - and the partisan fights they have fueled - made it impossible to campaign effectively while governing.\n\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" he said.\n\"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"\nThe governor has faced intensified Republican attacks tied to probes into a scandal around the misuse of pandemic-era aid programs, including a sprawling federal case involving the nonprofit Feeding Our Future.\nAs of late December, 92 people were charged in connection with the scandal, out of which 62 have been convicted.\nMany defendants in those ongoing cases are of Somali descent - a detail that President Donald Trump seized upon to launch verbal attacks against Minnesota's Somali community.\nTrump accused Walz of being \"corrupt\" and alleged baselessly that he had stolen billions of dollars of public funds, in a Truth Social post on Monday that grossly mischaracterized the facts of the case.\n\"I feel certain the facts will come out, and they will reveal a seriously unscrupulous, and rich, group of 'SLIMEBALLS,'\" he said.\nState officials say many claims have been exaggerated or debunked, but the controversy has weighed on Walz's approval ratings and rattled Democrats heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\nMinnesota has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2006, and party leaders remain bullish about holding the governorship.\nStill, Walz's vulnerabilities had drawn a growing field of potential Republican challengers and prompted quiet calls among Democrats for a reset.\nHis exit clears the way for a crowded Democratic contest. US Senator Amy Klobuchar is widely viewed as a possible contender, alongside state Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota's Secretary of State Steve Simon, though none has formally declared.\nFor Walz, a former teacher, National Guard veteran and union ally, the decision caps a meteoric rise from state politics to the national stage - and leaves Minnesota Democrats to chart their next chapter without one of their most recognizable figures.","summary":"The Democrat said a storm over fraud allegations made it impossible to campaign effectively while governing.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2026/01/06/ex-us-vp-nominee-tim-walz-ends-minnesota-reelection-run","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13623107-Tim-Walz.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 22:47:28","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":391541516,"title":"Corrupt Amy Klobuchar Mulls Campaign to Replace Walz as Governor of Minnesota","text":"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is reportedly considering a run for Minnesota governor after Gov. Tim Walz (D) announced the end of his reelection campaign, but her track record is a mess of political scandals.\n\nWalz, who was the Democrat party’s vice-presidential candidate just over a year ago, dropped out of the race in shame with a Monday morning statement whining over the growing Somali fraud scandal, Breitbart News’s John Nolte detailed. \n\nShortly after the news broke, the New York Times reported that Klobuchar is weighing a bid for gubernatorial office in Walz’s place. \n\nThe senator confirmed her interest in succeeding the governor when the pair met in Minnesota on Sunday to discuss plans, sources told the publication. \n\nIt has also been reported that part of the plan may be for Klobuchar to help keep Walz in public office, as she could make him a U.S. senator if she becomes governor. \n\nAccording to Townhall’s Dustin Grage, the same sources who helped predict Walz’s rise to becoming former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate said “the plan is to clear the way for Amy Klobuchar, so she can appoint him to the U.S. Senate.”\n\nKlobuchar, who is not up for reelection until 2030, can still remain in the Senate if she loses a bid for governor. \n\nWhile Walz’s fraud-related scandals have been widely reported and garnered the ire of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, Klobuchar’s own controversies have largely been pushed to the media cycle’s backburner. \n\nWhile reporting for the Daily Caller in 2012, Matthew Boyle revealed that she helped keep a multibillion-dollar Ponzi schemer, Tom Petters, out of prison when she was the top prosecutor in Hennepin County in the late 1990s.\n\nPetters, who was later convicted of numerous counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and more when a federal prosecutor picked up the case, “presided over companies whose employees gave Klobuchar $8,500 for her re-election campaign, and would later contribute more than $120,000 toward her U.S. Senate run.”\n\nDocuments obtained by the Daily Caller showed that Klobuchar had enough evidence in 1999 to prosecute Petters — years before the federal government unraveled his criminal activities. \n\nBoyle further detailed the depths of the corruption, revealing ties between the companies and the Democrat party:\n\nOne of those companies’ vice presidents was Ted Mondale, a former state senator and son of former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale. Before taking office as Hennepin County Attorney, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minneapolis law firm of Dorsey & Whitney, where Walter Mondale has practiced law since 1987.\nPerhaps because of the lure of Petters’ campaign cash or his deep connection to Minnesota Democratic politics, Klobuchar used the power of her office in 1999 to ensure Petters was not charged with financial crimes. And despite significant evidence against him, she cleared the way for Petters to build his multibillion-dollar illegal empire by prosecuting only his early co-conspirators.\n\nOne of those co-conspirators, Richard Hettler, told the Daily Caller that Klobuchar was aware of what Petters was doing, and still accepted campaign contributions from Petters’ company and its employees.\n\n“She took Ponzi money to get elected,” he said.\n\nAccording to Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, “When [Tom Petters] finally got arrested by the FBI, one of the first calls he made was to Amy Klobuchar, who recommended the lawyer that he ended up hiring.”\n\n“It ended up being the second-largest — after Bernie Madoff — Ponzi scheme in U.S. history,” he noted on Breitbart News Daily in 2020. \n\nPetters is currently serving a 50-year prison sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth in Kansas.\n\nKlobuchar was also the “driving force” behind efforts to secure a handout for Democrat media cronies through the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA) in 2022, Breitbart News’s Allum Bokhari detailed.\n\nIn addition to years of playing dirty, Klobuchar has painted herself as a moderate when she is really a far-left progressive.\n\nAs detailed in Profiles in Corruption, Klobuchar has voted with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 88 percent of the time as of 2020 — and she happens to be one of the top recipients of corporate campaign donations in all of the U.S. Senate.\n\n“There are numerous examples where, you know, a particular company or, you know, a smaller industry — the executives will get together and she’ll get a couple dozen donations from a company over a two or three day period,” Schweizer explained. “And then within a couple of weeks, she’ll introduce legislation that specifically benefits that corporation. That’s one of the reasons she’s been such a prolific fundraiser.”\n\nKlobuchar has yet to publicly comment on the reports that she is eyeing Walz’s office. \n\nOlivia Rondeau is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in Washington, DC.

Amy Klobuchar wants the nod — but if she gets it and then wins in November, her vacated Senate seat will present another opportunity for the GOP in a special election next year.\n\nMinnesota’s other senator, Tina Smith, has already opted not to run for re-election this cycle, and her seat’s up in November.\n\nThat leaves Walz’s Democrats — technically the “Democratic-Farmer-Labor” party in Minnesota — facing a tough series of tests at the ballot box in the next few months, with the jaw-dropping scale of the Somali scandal threatening to overshadow everything.\n\nAnd ironically, even Somali-American voters in Minnesota have started souring on the Democrats: The Harris-Walz ticket actually lost ground with voters of Somali descent in 2024.\n\n“In the Somali American hub of Cedar-Riverside, support for Harris dropped 14 percentage points” compared to Joe Biden’s 2020 tally, according to a post-election report in the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\n“Votes for Harris also dropped in precincts in the Seward neighborhood and along West Lake Street by 9 and 12 percentage points,” the newspaper noted.\n\nBiden-Harris policies toward Israel and Gaza were one consideration; another was that Somali Muslims aren’t entirely comfortable with the modern Democratic Party’s progressive social stances.\n\nThe Harris-Walz ticket still wound up garnering the support of about 80% of the Somali community, however. \n\nIf the Democrats’ grip on Minnesota is slipping, it’ll be more traditional constituencies who bring about the break — perhaps those who question how well the “farmer” and “labor” legs of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor coalition have been served by a Democratic Party defined nowadays by its manias for mass immigration and extreme identity politics.\n\nWalz never was a middle-American Democrat, though.\n\nHe was just a bland-looking white guy whose politics were as far-out as those of anyone else in his party.\n\nAnother Walz won’t win Democrats white, male or rural voters, even if he’s scandal-free.\n\nThe Democrats’ problem isn’t with the way their candidates look or sound — it’s what they believe and do. \n\nAnd there won’t be a Democrat who can match the appeal of Republican populism until there’s one who dares take the populist side on immigration and cultural norms.\n\nThat kind of Democrat, if he or she exists at all today, would be the opposite of Tim Walz.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.","summary":"Walz’s departure has his party facing a tough series of tests at the ballot box, with the jaw-dropping scale of the Somali scandal threatening to overshadow everything.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/05/opinion/tim-walz-jumps-ship-and-leaves-fraud-scarred-minnesota-dems-in-big-trouble/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-holds-118333807-e1767651212895.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 22:38:24","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":391519730,"title":"Dems against Trump’s Maduro capture: Letters to the Editor — Jan. 6, 2026","text":"The Issue: Democrats criticizing the United States’ capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThose saying President Trump capturing Nicolás Maduro was unconstitutional are either being disingenuous or don’t know what is in the Constitution, nor do they understand the Monroe Doctrine and other historical precedents giving the president authority to do exactly what Trump did (“Don disses doubters,” Jan. 4).\n\nThe people who were chanting “no kings” are now defending a ruthless dictator who’s killed thousands of Americans by sending drugs into our country.\n\nDemocrats don’t like anything Trump does, no matter if it’s in our best interest or not.\n\nCharles Sitero\n\nOrmond Beach, Fla.\n\nMany Democrats are vehemently criticizing Maduro’s capture, a move authorized by Trump.\n\nI have this hypothetical question: If Trump were president during the early 1940s and authorized and carried out a successful capture of Adolf Hitler, would the Democrats have been opposed to that as well?\n\nJonathan Dzik\n\nAny person with common sense who’s not afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome will agree with removing the notorious narco-criminal from Venezuela and bringing him to America to answer in a court of law for his deliberate dumping of illegal drugs that harmed many young people in our country.\n\nProof of the president’s wise decision can be seen in the joyful reaction among the citizens of Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed from what was illicit power.\n\nFrank Olivieri\n\nNorth Ft.

Tim Walz has ended his reelection bid amid mounting pressure over a fraud scandal that has engulfed his administration in recent weeks.\n\nThe move comes days after a handful of Republican state lawmakers asked Walz to leave office, citing reports from a U.S. attorney that at least half of the $18 billion paid through Minnesota's 14 Medicaid waiver programs since 2018 could be fraudulent and after Republicans in Congress called on Walz to testify about his failure to address the scandal.\n\nWalz, the former vice presidential candidate on Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, spoke about his decision at a news conference Jan. 5, citing the growing pressure as one of the reasons for his decision to leave the race and pushing back on claims that his administration failed to combat fraud.\n\n\"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,\" he said, reading from a previously published statement. \"I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"\n\nHe was seeking his third term as governor.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, head of the Democratic Governors Association, commended Walz's leadership and reasserted his confidence that \"no matter who decides to run,\" Democrats would win the state in the 2026 governor's race.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan group that analyzes state, federal and presidential elections, labels the Minnesota outcome \"likely Democrat.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, is said to be considering a run for governor, according to multiple media reports.\n\nMinnesota fraud scandal\n\nSince 2022, the Justice Department has charged more than 70 people, many of them U.S. citizens of Somali descent, with siphoning hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars from Minnesota's child nutrition program in what it described as the \"largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson announced charges against five people accused of defrauding the Medicaid-funded Housing Stabilization program in late December and suggested that more than $9 billion may have been stolen from more than a dozen Medicaid-funded programs in Minnesota, though he did not say how authorities came to that figure. The $9 billion exceeds the amount people charged so far have been accused of stealing.\n\nWalz, 61, applauded the arrests on social media at the time, describing them as \"strong action we need from prosecutors to put fraudsters behind bars.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers accuse his administration of mishandling the program. A viral video published at the end of 2025 by conservative influencer Nick Shirley only added fuel to the growing outcry over the abuse. In the video, which has garnered more than 100 million views on social media, Shirley visited multiple day care centers in Minnesota that he alleged were abandoned despite having state licenses to serve children.\n\nIn response, FBI Director Kash Patel said his agency had \"surged\" resources to the state to investigate. The federal Department of Health and Human Services said it was pausing child care payments to the state amid the controversy. Congress has called Walz to testify; the House Oversight Committee has scheduled an initial hearing for Jan. 7.\n\nIn his statement, Walz defended the actions his administration has taken to thwart and prosecute fraud and accused Republicans of politicizing the scandal.\n\n\"For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis,\" he wrote.\n\nHe argued his administration sought \"tools to combat fraud,\" fired officials and jailed people found stealing from the state, among other actions.\n\n“There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate,\" Walz said. \"But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.\"\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann","summary":"Tim Walz drops out of Minnesota governor's race amid fraud scandal  USA Today","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/05/tim-walz-exits-mn-governors-race/88028467007/","image":"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/05/USAT/88028494007-usatsi-27910829.jpg?crop=5615,3159,x0,y292&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 22:09:00","author":"Karissa Waddick","authors":["Karissa Waddick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":391534682,"title":"David Spade Predicts George Clooney Will Become Less Political After ‘Bailing’ to France: ‘He Got Out’ | Video","text":"David Spade thinks George Clooney’s days as a political commentator might be behind him. \n\nFollowing the news last week that the Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker is relocating to France with wife Amal and their two children, Spade and his “Fly on the Wall” podcast co-host Dana Carvey agreed that he’ll probably become less vocal about American politics.\n\n“He gets political, which is fine, but I wonder if he will get political in France or he will keep — he did say something even the other day, after he announced this, and it feels like if he tapped out of here,” Spade said in Monday’s episode while running through news items from the holiday break. “He doesn’t need the stress of the politics of America anymore.

Namely, in the helpless desire of many to take the downside on any 80/20 issue involving President Trump, this time they were acting in opposition to themselves.\n\nWe will start with the impacted minds at The Lincoln Project. Yes, we are well aware they are hardly considered the most sober of thinkers, but they do typify much of the thinking on the Left, and in this case, set the hypocritical stage for this discussion. If Trump does anything, the TLP braintrust will react accordingly – even if it means defying their own past positions. And as expected, with ringleader Rick Wilson, as they say, “There is always a tweet.”\n\nThen, with a sense of buildup, we turn to former Biden administration official Pete Buttigieg. Not to suggest he was ever a voice worth listening to with any degree of seriousness, but he is emblematic of what has been heard from his party the past few days. What is remarkable to witness is how these strident voices of opposition can arrive without a dose of reflection taking place. How does one take a firm stance on an issue and have abject amnesia on where they stood and have spoken about previously?\n\nNext, to take things to a more current position, we turn to Congress, where we have Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) caterwauling consistently about the forced acquisition of the Venezuelan leader. However, his earnest-sounding words on the arrest are again belied by his previous earnest-sounding words on the matter. His about-face on the case of restoring democracy to that country was so obvious that even reliable Democratic Party sycophant Dana Bash had to dredge up his past words and have him try to explain his change of — well, we’ll say “heart,” despite a lack of evidence.\n\nContinuing our climb up the ladder of importance, we next have Murphy’s boss, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who also could not refrain from shuffling in front of the cameras to voice his displeasure that President Trump…had enforced the very action that Schumer had called for. \n\nREAD MORE: Whoops: Schumer's 'Open Mouth, Insert Foot' Moment as Dems' Hypocrisy Hits Hyper Drive on Venezuela\n\nThat Schumer is out there spilling the contents of classified intelligence conversations is but the start. (How DARE they not share details of a secret mission with the codger who is willing to belch out sensitive intel?!) He is bawling about the dangerous mission that was just completed — with no loss of life on the side of our military — and demanding that a longer process of seeking permission from Congress should have been followed. This would have not only extended the mission timeframe but also alerted Maduro of our intent, giving him ample time to flee, shore up his defenses, and make a mission far more risk-intensive.\n\nBut beyond this impacted thinking, Schumer crying about the move to oust Maduro is, once again, words in defiance of his own words. There was Chuck, during the first Trump term in the White House, lambasting the president for not taking any action to remove the authoritarian and deliver democracy to the Venezuelan people.\n\nAnd now, let us move to the very top of the Hypocritical Party. The Biden administration was certainly big on the concept of having Maduro removed from office, with a stress on the word “concept.” It was all words.\n\nOnce again, we have criticisms hurled about Trump not taking proper action then, as he is now being scorched for doing the very things they were demanding to take place. Basically, Joe Biden’s stance was that, rather than giving Venezuelans their country back to the citizens, he planned to open our doors and allow all Venezuelans into our country, including the violent gangs. \n\nAnd speaking of words, the verbal Salad Shooter herself, former Vice President Kamala Harris, came out with her blathering on the mission, suggesting that we went into Venezuela for empire building. Or for oil. She is not too solid on the cause, but she is certain it was not to stem the drug trade that Maduro was operating. You know, even though it was the very thing he had been charged with and brought to the U.S. to face in court. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio noted this very reality. And it completely blasts any manufactured talking points from the Democrats into confetti.\n\nREAD MORE: Rubio Destroys the Dem Narrative on Venezuela, Mocks Kamala Harris in the Process\n\nAll of this illustrates what the Democratic Party is about: They want to take the upper hand on talking points, without ever having to actually take action.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Amy Klobuchar considers running","text":"ST PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into the state’s child care programs and its Somali community.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,” making it impossible for him to serve full time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,” Walz said at the state capitol. “So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the Republican president’s attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nWalz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he’d found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. But the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video’s creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor’s decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that Walz was not running “because he was caught, REDHANDED” with “stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars,” an accusation against the governor that lacked evidence despite widely acknowledged fraud problems. The president said Walz “has destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nWalz’s exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats hold 24 of 50 governor’s seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota’s, on the ballot this year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris’ defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz’s announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.” Walz’s guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, was more succinct, issuing a statement that said only: “Good riddance.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and said the state’s next Democratic candidate “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz stood by his stewardship, saying “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable” and insisting that his administration has been working diligently to address the problem.\n\nA look at Walz’s time as governor\n\nDuring his two terms, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd’s death but stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youths and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar after she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/05/tim-walz-drops-bid-minnesota-governor/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Election_2026_Minnesota_Governor_10331-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 21:38:39","author":"Bill Barrow,Steve Karnowski","authors":["Bill Barrow","Steve Karnowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":391516270,"title":"Minnesota Gov.

In two weeks, Donald Trump will have wrapped up year one of his second four-year stint as president of the United States, and after the events of this past weekend alone, the only thing that's lame is the alliance of elected Democrats, their allies in Resistance Media, and Stage Four Never Trumpers who think every day that Donald Trump wakes up is a bad day. I'd like to think I had a fairly productive weekend. I took down all the Christmas lights and decorations (parts of two days), saw Avatar 3, the Stranger Things 5 finale, and reorganized the garage. By comparison, Donald Trump removed an international drug trafficker holding his country hostage through illegitimate rule, served a 6-year-old arrest warrant in person backed by the might of U.S. Special Forces, and locked him and his wife up in New York City awaiting trial. He also has economically squeezed the mullahcracy in Tehran so tight that protests have entered their ninth consecutive night. And as of last night, the protesters are approaching near parity with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in weapons and overwhelming them in numbers. The people have armed themselves, are fighting for their country, and Trump is giving them rhetorical cover. In short, the President didn't reorganize the garage. He took great steps to reorganize the world to ensure this will once again be the American century. On March 26th, 2020, Donald Trump's Justice Department indicted Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan strongman, on multiple charges of narco‑terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Four-plus years later into the Joe Biden regency, Maduro rigged the presidential election in Venezuela and claimed he would never leave power. The Biden regency called the election fraudulent, and by January of 2025, when Biden was out to lunch and out the door, the regency behind him called Maduro's rule illegitimate and refused to recognize it. So did the rest of the international community, with the exception of China, Russia, and Cuba. But that's as far as Biden was willing to go. All mumble, no rumble.The difference between Trump's administration and Biden's? Biden claimed to be respected in the world once again, specifically because we wouldn't do anything to enforce our will on the world stage. Trump showed yet again he is a man of action. The final week of Never Trump, Inc.'s 2025 began with full-throated defense for Somali fraud all over the country, scorn at the journalism exposing the fraud, and defense for drug runners getting blown up by land and by sea. The first weekend of 2026 brought a virtual hydra of responses to the Maduro raid and capture. 'It was an act of war' (it wasn't), 'Trump didn't get prior Congressional approval' (he didn't have to), 'the arrest was illegal' (he was Mirandized), 'he was poorly treated while transferred to U.S. soil' (he was treated better than the Americans he took hostage late last week), 'the additional hit on the Hugo Chavez mausoleum was just gratuitous' (I wonder if his remains smelled like sulfure afterwards?), 'it's all just about oil (I'd rather have it than China and Russia), and my favorite - 'okay, well, why you were there, why didn't you arrest every terrorist drug runner working for Maduro?' Let's work our way through how the media covered the surprise raid and arrest of Maduro, because honestly, the story and related clips are just fun for the whole family. On Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, the MVP of the first year of the Trump administration by far, Secretary of State/National Security Advisor/National Archivist/USAID director Marco Rubio easily countered the charge the raid was a naked theft of another country's oil reserves. \n\n🚨 HOLY SMOKES. In an incredible moment, Sec. Marco Rubio declares the Western Hemisphere is OURS, Russia, China and Iran must GET OUTWELKER: Why does the US need Venezuelan oil?!RUBIO: \"Why does CHINA need their oil? Russia? Iran? This is the West, THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE.\"🔥… pic.twitter.com/ZJU6L2BkNo— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 4, 2026\n\nKeep in mind that in the afternoon, before U.S. forces pulled off an operation that literally no other country in the world could pull off, a handful of Communist Chinese Party diplomats met with Maduro to negotiate future oil shipments. I'm not entirely certain they had left the country to return to Beijing before discovering that the paper they had in their hands was now null and void, thanks to Donald Trump and U.S. Armed Forces. This one operation alone accomplished: \n\nNarco-trafficking, which had been constant for the last decade, essentially ends.CCP Secretary-General Xi Jinping loses a foothold in the Western Hemisphere, with roughly $110 billion dollars in loans to Venezuela that were secured by oil as collateral. Those loans are now worthless. The United States, for all intents and purposes, now has a seat in OPEC with the regime change ultimately leading to a more U.S.-friendly government.This raid serves as a double blow to Vladimir Putin in Russia. Venezuela had recently signed an extension to develop and deliver oil to Russia through 2041. That, in all likelihood, is over. In addition, the billion-plus dollars Russia committed to Cuba for infrastructure is heavily dependent upon Venezuelan oil powering it. That's also gone. \n\nWe'll get to what comes next for Venezuela in a bit, because that's very fluid. But back to the media's Trump treatment, we next go to Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation, who must have had Bari Weiss banging her head against a wall after this exchange with Sec. Rubio.\n\n.@SecRubio: \"It is not easy to land a helicopter in the middle of the largest military base... kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter... and you're asking me why we didn't do that in five other places at the same time!?\" pic.twitter.com/Pm9Jy1AKp3— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) January 4, 2026\n\nMargaret is a lefty. No doubt about it. And honestly, she's not an idiot. She was openly hyper-partisan in the pre-Weiss era at CBS, and then suddenly began to relearn her journalism chops at times once the new boss moved in. But this exchange? I've got no defense. I don't seem to recall Brennan asking Obama officials why they didn't just kill off all the other jihadi terrorists, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, when Navy SEALs dispatched Osama bin Laden. As I said on X, this is the journalistic equivalent of Clark Griswold's father-in-law coming out in the cold Chicago winter to see the Christmas lights finally work in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and noting, disgustedly, that the little lights aren't twinkling. Filling the willfully obtuse lane on the Sunday shows was George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week. Rubio explained to him three times what we did and why we did it, and poor George just couldn't summon the brain cells to rub together and understand it all. \n\nABC’s George Stephanopoulos attempted to trip up Secretary of State Marco Rubio by asking the same question about Venezuela three different times.“What is the legal authority for the United States to be running Venezuela?”And three times, Rubio shut him down.RUBIO: “I… pic.twitter.com/HaXJH2AyOv— Overton (@overton_news) January 4, 2026\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos was a special assistant to President William Jefferson Blythe Clinton when the U.S. fought the Battle of Mogadishu during the Somalia crisis. You'll be surprised to learn that A) Clinton did not seek, nor was he granted, Congressional approval to do so, and B) no one had to explain the 'why' to George. About a year later, after another election that was rigged, Clinton intervened in Haiti to do regime change. Again, on staff, Stephanopoulos didn't seem to have a problem with Clinton's actions, but can't comprehend Trump's actions. He's not that dumb. He's just a partisan hack doing partisan hackery masked as journalism. One way to ascertain how much of a lame duck the current President is, is to investigate what was said about this past weekend by the even lamer duck, the one that Trump beat a year ago. Ten days before Trump took the oath of office, the Biden-Harris administration put out a $25 million dollar bounty on the head of Nicolas Maduro. Nearly a year later, after he was arrested, Harris has had a change of heart.\n\nDonald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable.That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise.

About the toughest thing Harris has to negotiate these days is how to pierce the top of a box of Sauvignon Blanc with a straw. Chuck Schumer, presumably the leader of the Democratic Party in the United States Senate, was a fierce critic of Donald Trump in 2020 because Trump had failed to act to remove Maduro from power. \n\n2020.

The same media and political left in this country that has been wrong about Donald Trump with Swiss precision accuracy will undoubtedly get it wrong again. International hearts are for Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner from 2025 (beating out Donald Trump). She probably did win the 2024 Venezuelan elections, but was cheated out of it by the fraudulant Maduro. Donald Trump and the U.S. military went in and rescued her weeks ago. She would otherwise be the sentimental favorite, except the reality on the ground in Caracas is that the military never respected her, and probably wouldn't respect her now. If she can't control the military, she's not going to control the country, and Trump, Rubio et al. know it. So the plan seems to be to force the next in line to fall in line. That's Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez. Rodriguez is every bit the Marxist whackjob Maduro is, but has shown in the last 48 hours to be as pliable as a paper clip. After the spectacular raid and capture of Maduro and his wife, leaving Russian surface-to-air-defense systems in smoldering piles of scrap metal just like they were in Iran when we took out the nuclear program at four sensitive sites, Rodriguez' initial reaction, from Russia where she was previously dispatched for meetings, was defiance. \n\n“We will never be the colony of any empire,” said Delcy Rodríguez. “What is being done to Venezuela is barbaric.” She is the vice-president whom Donald Trump described as “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again” https://t.co/tv71fEhUKo— The Economist (@TheEconomist) January 4, 2026\n\nShe also continued in the antisemitic traditions of her ideological grandfather, Hugo Chavez. It's the Joos' fault this happened. \n\nIt took only a few hours for Delcy Rodríguez—Venezuela's vice president—to fabricate an antisemitic conspiracy linking Zionists to the U.S. operation that captured Nicolás Maduro.

Seizing and pouncing is not just a Republican skill set. 'Trump's adventurism isn't going to result in any meaningful change,' you could sense would be the line of attack. And that may have been the case with any other president not named Donald John Trump. Instead, it took one telephone interview with the Atlantic to make its way around the world. \n\nIn a telephone interview this morning with The Atlantic, President Donald J. Trump issued a threat against Venezuela’s Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, saying that, “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” adding that… pic.twitter.com/2xR8kE38ey— OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) January 4, 2026\n\nA price higher than the one Maduro is paying? He's alive, awaiting trial. Trump just showed that America can strike anywhere they want, when they want, on their terms. They had an arrest warrant for Maduro and acted on it, destroying Venezuelan defenses in the meantime. There will be no warrant this time for Rodriguez, and weaker defenses. She'll just get killed, and there's really not anything she can do to stop it if she doesn't play ball. Less than a day after that threat went public, Marco Rubio was suddenly on the phone with a very compliant Rodriguez, pledging total cooperation. \n\nBREAKING: Interim Venezuelan leader Delcy Rodríguez on Sunday night invited U.S. President Donald Trump “to collaborate” and said she seeks “respectful relations” in a newly conciliatory message. https://t.co/kPq8vZ3dwF— The Associated Press (@AP) January 5, 2026\n\nMind you, the Trump administration is not endorsing Rodriguez for any long-term assignment running the country. She's a stopgap for stability, preventing the need for American forces to go in and become peacekeepers. But she's on a short leash and knows it. One of the jerks on her new collar is going to be calling for a new election shortly, and let Venezuelans decide freely and fairly who will govern them next. If it's Machado, so be it. Regardless, the days of the Marxists running the country seem to be limited. It's worth reminding what signal this sends to adversaries of the United States, large and small, around the globe. How soundly do you think despots and dictators are sleeping these days, knowing Trump has three years left and a very cold heart when it comes to those internationally who mean to do Americans harm?Kim Jung Un in North Korea had begun to make noise in late 2024. Heard him rattling any sabers lately? How does Miguel Diaz-Canel in Cuba feel? What about Khamenei? There's a school of thought that believes Trump's action this weekend all but green-lights Xi's desire to go in and take Taiwan. It's a wrong school of thought, but it's certainly a take. Xi has been knocked back in the Middle East. He's just been defeated in South America. And even he does not know if his military and navy, albeit with a quantity advantage, are ready to match up with a resurgent American Armed Forces. The bottom line is this. If you're a bad guy, Trump is out there at the other end of the equation, and thus far, after only a year in, bad guys have gotten the short end every single time. And when Trump does engage kinetically, the new Axis of Evil – Russia, China, North Korea, Iran – is not there to lend a hand. Thus far, whether in Nigeria, Syria, Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, or now Venezuela, being an adversary of the U.S. is a very lonely business. The friends you think you have aren't going to be there when you need them. This is the very heart of America First. The United States is the world's big dog once again after four years of self-doubt caused by a feeble nincompoop and his incompetent word salad of a number two at the helm, and we are safer for it.

Tim Walz would not seek re-election as a sweeping fraud scandal rocks his state. \"Governor Walz has destroyed the State of Minnesota, but others, like Governor Gavin Newscum, JB Pritzker, and Kathy Hochul, have done, in my opinion, an even more dishonest and incompetent job. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!\" Trump posted to Truth Social Monday afternoon. The message followed Walz announcing Monday that he was withdrawing his re-election effort to continue serving as governor. Walz was first elected the state's top leader in 2018 in a political career that also included him campaigning coast-to-coast in 2024 as former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. \"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,\" Walz wrote in a statement. \"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.\" KEVIN MCCARTHY SAYS MINNESOTA'S 'ENTIRE DEMOCRAT ADMINISTRATION' WILL HAVE TO RESIGN OVER FRAUD SCANDAL Minnesota has come under fierce scrutiny in recent weeks as a sprawling fraud scandal that has led to dozens of arrests, mostly from the state's large Somali community, since 2022 comes to light. Minnesota was allegedly home to a massive COVID-era scheme that allegedly involved money laundering operations related to fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services, according to investigators. The Minnesota fraud is still being tabulated, with local officials speculating it could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion. NICK SHIRLEY GLOATS HE 'ENDED TIM WALZ’ AFTER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR SCRAPS RE-ELECTION BID AMID FRAUD SCANDAL Trump's use of the phrase \"no one is above the law\" follows years of Democrats employing the same rhetoric against him as he faced a barrage of charges and court cases in between his first and second administrations. \"No one is above the law,\" President Joe Biden said after Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsified business records in a Manhattan court in May 2024. Trump faced four criminal indictments, which resulted in accusations of \"lawfare\" on the national stage as Trump maintained his innocence and slammed the cases as efforts by the Democratic Party to hurt his political chances for re-election in 2024. DAVID MARCUS: TIM WALZ'S WHITE GUILT FINALLY ENDS HIS CAREER AS MINNESOTA’S FRAUD EXPLODES \"As I’ve said before, no one is above the law, including Donald Trump,\" then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in 2023 after the Biden administration's Department of Justice announced Trump had been indicted on 37 counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Even during Trump's first administration, Democrats championed the phrase as they combated MAGA Republicans and Trump policies. \"Everybody wants the president to be held accountable in the most serious way,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of Trump in 2019 amid a discussion at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, underscoring that Democrats believe \"no one is above the law.\" \"And everybody believes, now I'm talking on the Democratic side, that no one is above the law, especially the president of the United States.\" \"We must be clear: no one, not even the president, is above the law,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement in 2019 when introducing articles of impeachment against Trump. COMER WARNS WALZ ABSENCE AT MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING WOULD BE 'ADMISSION TO GUILT' BY GOVERNOR Upon his victory over the Harris–Walz presidential ticket in 2024, Trump has taken a victory lap for allegedly snuffing out the weaponization of government. \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out?\" he said during his joint address to Congress in 2025. \"Not too good. Not too good.\" Trump added in his Monday Truth Social post that \"Minnesota’s Corrupt Governor will possibly leave office before his Term is up,\" and that he's confident the fraud investigations \"will reveal a seriously unscrupulous, and rich, group of 'SLIMEBALLS.'\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson added in comment to Fox Digital on Monday afternoon when asked about the Truth Social post: \"It shouldn’t take an education from the Quality Learing Center for Democrats to understand this: Tim Walz and his Somali friends have been caught ripping off hardworking Minnesota taxpayers and now they will face the consequences. President Trump is right, no one is above the law.\" Walz has taken ownership of correcting the fraud. He said his administration had been taking action to stop some suspected fraudulent payments over the summer and that his office referred some for prosecution. The governor, however, has said that multibillion figures were \"sensationalized\" by Republicans.

Tim Walz announced Monday that he is ending his re-election campaign for a third term.\n\nIn a statement, Walz, who ran with Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee during her 2024 presidential bid against Donald Trump, cited allegations of fraud in the Minnesota government and “political gamesmanship” by Republicans, which he said intended to cause division among state residents, as his reasons for bowing out of the race.\n\nDespite announcing in September that he would run for a record-breaking third term, the state governor said he could no longer give his all to a political campaign.\n\n“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said.\n\n“So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”\n\nWalz claimed in his statement that scammers have acted deceitfully within the state government, a problem he said he and fellow lawmakers are working to address while fending off hostility from the federal government.\n\n“For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis,” Walz said, before accusing President Trump of stoking the fire.\n\n“I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbours,” he said, citing the federal government’s recent freezing of tax dollars allocated to fund child-care services following allegations of fraud and of demonizing immigrant communities, specifically Somali nationals residing in Minnesota.\n\nIn December, Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage,” claiming they were too reliant on U.S. social safety nets and gave nothing back to the country.\n\n“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“Their country is no good for a reason. Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country,” he added.\n\nTrump ramped up his attacks on Somalis last month when Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist, published unsubstantiated allegations in a magazine called City Journal, citing unnamed sources that money stolen from Minnesota state programs had gone to al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked militant group that controls parts of Somalia.\n\nMinnesota’s Department of Children, Youth, and Families said on Friday that investigators found child-care facilities accused of fraud were operating “as expected” and legally, NBC News reported.\n\nIn 2022, 47 suspects were indicted for defrauding a federally funded Minnesota-based child nutrition program of more than $250 million. Some of the criminal cases related to the alleged scheme are still open, according to the U.S. outlet, and several of the defendants are of Somali descent.\n\nWalz, who acknowledged that fraud within state government needs to be remedied, reiterated that many changes had been made to curb unlawful activity, including firing people who were not doing their jobs and jailing bad actors who stole from the state.\n\nHe called Trump’s targeting of Somali people “disgusting and dangerous,” and said he will not tolerate a single taxpayer dollar being lost to fraudulent activity.\n\n“We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.”\n\n“The buck stops with me,” he said. “My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.”\n\nWalz’s unexpected resignation from the race sent a political shockwave through the state. The former vice-presidential nominee faced no serious primary threat to his tenure and was touted to secure a third term. It is unclear who will run in his place.\n\nWalz’s announcement bookends months of violent political tumult in the northern U.S. state, including the murders of former Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, who were killed by gunfire inside their home in June. On the same night, John Hoffman, a Minnesota lawmaker, and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, were critically wounded after being shot 17 times between them. Both of them survived.\n\nWalz concluded on Monday by thanking Minnesota residents and reaffirming his commitment to his role as governor.\n\n“I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the president. Not on my watch.”\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"Despite Tim Walz announcing he would run for a record-breaking third term as Minnesota governor, he says he can no longer give his all to a political campaign.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11599616/tim-walz-not-seeking-reelection-governor-race-minnesota/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CP175576749.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:54:12","author":"Rachel Goodman","authors":["Rachel Goodman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":391510438,"title":"Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz drops third-term bid","text":"ST PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into the state’s child care programs and its Somali community.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,” making it impossible for him to serve full time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,” Walz said at the state capitol. ”So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the Republican president’s attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nWalz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he’d found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. \n\nBut the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video’s creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor’s decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that Walz was not running “because he was caught, REDHANDED” with “stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars,” an accusation against the governor that lacked evidence despite widely acknowledged fraud problems. The president said Walz “has destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nWalz’s exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats hold 24 of 50 governor’s seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota’s, on the ballot this year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris’ defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz’s announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.” Walz’s guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, was more succinct, issuing a statement that said only: “Good riddance.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and said the state’s next Democratic candidate “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz stood by his stewardship, saying “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable” and insisting that his administration has been working diligently to address the problem.\n\nA look at Walz’s time as governor\n\nDuring his two terms, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd’s death but stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youths and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. \n\nWalz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar after she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.\n\nBy STEVE KARNOWSKI and BILL BARROW Associated Press.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2026/01/05/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-drops-political-bombshell-bows-out-of-third-term-bid/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/7UQUXDSNU5A2JBHF5RQIPBE7KE.jpg?auth=0d0742762844eb94b86653f070eca38c83910ef0126b8a28a706a21fa41da18f&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:41:39","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":391497484,"title":"Eric Adams torches Harris, Dems for blasting Maduro arrest as Mamdani fumes ‘act of war’","text":"Just two days after posting a social media video signaling his freedom from government office, former New York Mayor Eric Adams slammed fellow Democrats over their response to President Donald Trump’s operation to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. Adams previously posted a video of himself with a cigar and what appeared to be bourbon, smiling as he lambasted the government as \"slow as s---\" filled with people trying to throw \"sand in the gears\" and predicting an \"unforgettable, bada--, no bull---- 2026\" – before issuing a starkly different message on Maduro than his mayoral successor. By the weekend, Adams followed through, openly weighing in by thanking Trump for \"hit[ting] the cartels where it hurts\" through Maduro’s detention and sharply criticizing former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden’s approach to the Venezuelan strongman. \"I have seen firsthand how Nicolás Maduro destroyed Venezuela and turned it into a narco-state. Millions fled. Thousands landed in New York City,\" he said. GREGG JARRETT: NO, TRUMP'S ORDER TO SNATCH MADURO WAS NOT ILLEGAL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL \"Now in U.S. custody, the man who helped flood our streets with fentanyl is finally being held accountable. American lives were destroyed because of him.\" Turning to those in his party, Adams said that days before Biden and Harris left office, they increased the bounty on Maduro to $25 million from an Obama-era $10 million. Harris had said that Trump’s detaining of Maduro \"do[es] not make America safer\" and that the despot being an \"illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise … The American people do not want this, and they are tired of being lied to.\" LAWMAKERS RIP BIDEN AFTER TRUMP-MADURO TAUNT RESURFACES – CALL IT BASELESS AND POLITICALLY CHARGED \"Public safety is not a political game,\" Adams replied to Harris. \"You do not label someone a narco-dictator one year and then pretend he is no longer a threat the next simply because a different president is in office – that is cynical and irresponsible,\" Adams said, citing Harris’ lengthier critique of the overnight operation. Adams went on to cite real-life cases of fentanyl deaths in New York as proof of Maduro’s dangerous reach, including a two-year-old Bronx boy named Nicholas Feliz-Dominici whom he said was poisoned while in daycare. UN AMBASSADOR WALTZ DEFENDS US CAPTURE OF MADURO AHEAD OF SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING \"America is safer today because Maduro is no longer in power,\" the former NYPD officer turned mayor said. \"Welcome to New York, Nicolás.\" Adams’ comments also directly contradicted the position of his successor, socialist Zohran Mamdani, who told reporters he personally telephoned Trump to \"register my opposition.\" \"I was briefed this morning on the U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City,\" Mamdani said in a statement.

His wife Gwen seemed close to tears.\n\nPerhaps they were thinking of what might have been had Walz and Kamala Harris triumphed in 2024. Instead of sitting in the US Naval Observatory, the home of the Vice President, he now leaves public life after one of the most calamitous cameos of modern times.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't even immediately clear where the couple would live after Walz's final day in office as Minnesota governor next January. Walz sold his own house in July 2019 for $304,000 and moved into a state-funded home. There was still a $250,000 mortgage on it at the time. \n\nIn the end, Walz was a casualty of the Minnesota welfare scandal that has exploded onto the national stage in recent days, with much more of a bang than he himself did in the 2024 campaign.\n\nOn Monday, he ended his bid for a third term as governor, admitting that the fraud happened 'on my watch' and that the 'buck does stop with me.'\n\nWalz conceded: 'For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity.'\n\nHowever, when it came to his own downfall, he refused to take responsibility, instead blaming 'conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers' and the White House.\n\nHe accused President Trump of 'demonizing our Somali neighbors,' which was 'disgusting and dangerous,' he said.\n\nThe reaction from Republicans was mixed, with Walz's demise being regarded as long overdue. However, he was also seen as one of the easiest and most useful political punching bags on the Democratic side.\n\nAmid the ongoing scandal, Walz has been summoned to appear before a congressional committee on Wednesday, and the Trump administration called it 'one of the largest frauds in American history and probably the largest theft of public welfare dollars.'\n\nFederal charges have been filed against 98 people accused of embezzlement of public funds and, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants are 'of Somali descent'. Minnesota has the largest Somali population in America.\n\nFifty-seven people, most of them Somali, have already been convicted in the scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children, according to prosecutors.\n\nThose involved are accused of faking invoices, attendance records and meal deliveries, and spending the money on items including Lamborghinis, Porsches, and property in the Maldives.\n\nRepublicans accused Democrats in Minnesota of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the scandal involved the state's Somali community, the largest in the country, with around 80,000 members.\n\nThe case first became public in 2022 but was injected into the national consciousness over the recent Christmas period after YouTuber Nick Shirley released a viral video focusing on day care centers in Minnesota.\n\nThat video was watched 127 million times on X and the Trump administration responded by surging fraud investigators to Minnesota and freezing federal child care payments to the state.\n\nWalz has found himself at the center of the storm, and it is far from the first time.\n\nFrom the moment Harris made the fateful decision to select him, the 61-year-old has been mired in gaffes and scandal. \n\nHarris's aim was to appeal to Midwestern voters, with Walz touting his status as a gun owner and hunter.\n\nHowever, when he invited the media to follow him on a pheasant hunt through long grass, it ended in farce.\n\nSocial media commentators accused Walz of 'staging' the event because other men with him had orange vests on but no guns.\n\nVideo showed him struggling to load his shotgun and he reportedly did not fire a single shot during the three-hour hunt.\n\nWhile most politicians on a presidential ticket have a major controversy to deal with, he had at least half a dozen.\n\nPerhaps the most damaging involved questions over why, as a national guardsman, he did not deploy to Iraq with his unit in 2006, having retired the year before.\n\nBut there were also accusations that he inflated his resume as a high school football coach.\n\nIn a huge embarrassment, Walz himself admitted 'misspeaking' after claiming to have been in Hong Kong when the Tiananmen Square massacre took place in Beijing in 1989.\n\nBut he had been to communist China dozens of times, and a congressional investigation was launched into his links to the communist country.\n\nIn a further humiliation, Republicans nicknamed him 'Tampon Tim' for signing a 2023 law requiring that Minnesota schools provide menstruation supplies in boys' restrooms.\n\nHis economic record in the state was quickly trashed, and his own financial competence was called into question.\n\nExperts had been surprised when Harris picked him over the frontrunner, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and her aides indicated it was due to personal chemistry.\n\nBut Walz proceeded to engage awkwardly in public with Harris, and commentators described some of their early appearances together as stilted.\n\nIn one social media video he shared with Harris his recipe for 'white guy tacos.'\n\nThen, in his big moment, Walz was widely seen to have been outclassed by J.D. Vance, a younger man with much less political experience, in the vice presidential debate.\n\nOne influential pollster told the Daily Mail it was the moment Vance made his mark with the public, and Walz allowed him to do so.\n\nWalz licked his wounds and returned to Minnesota, any dreams of running for the White House himself in 2028 dashed.\n\nIn retrospect, his downfall had begun the moment Democrats appeared to inflate his football coaching resume at the party's Chicago convention in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe tale went that, in 1999, Walz had turned around Mankato West High School's football team from 0-27 into state champions in an underdog triumph for the ages.\n\nPlayers for the team were brought on stage and Amy Klobuchar, who ironically may now tun to replace him as governor, told the crowd: 'In Minnesota, we trust a coach who turned a team that was 0-27 into state champions.'\n\nIn fact, the head coach of the all-conquering side known as the 'Scarlets' was a man named Rick Sutton.\n\nWalz, a social studies teacher, had been one of several assistant coaches under Sutton, working primarily with the defensive players.\n\nScrutiny then fell on Walz's trips to China in the days when he was a teacher.\n\nOf particular note was his claim to have been in Hong Kong on June 4, 1989 – the day when the Chinese authorities massacred pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.\n\nSpeaking to a 2009 hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to mark the 20-year anniversary of the massacre, Walz recalled his trip.\n\nHe said: 'Twenty years ago today, I was in Hong Kong preparing to go to Foshan to teach. To watch what happened at the end of the day on June 4 was something that many of us will never forget, we pledge to never forget, and bearing witness and accurate telling of history is absolutely crucial for any nation to move forward.'\n\nWalz made this claim on more than one occasion, but newspaper reports of the time place him nowhere near Hong Kong or China.\n\nIn an excruciating moment during the vice-presidential debate, watched by millions of voters, Walz conceded that he had 'misspoken' and said: 'I'm a knucklehead at times.'\n\nBut perhaps more damaging to his reputation was the controversy over his military record.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nIn a 2018 video advocating for stricter gun-control laws, he said: 'We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.'\n\nThe phrase 'that I carried in war' was taken by many to suggest that Walz had served in a combat zone.\n\nHowever, Walz was only ever deployed to Italy in 2003 to provide security at a U.S. military base that was involved in supporting the ongoing Afghanistan war effort.\n\nTo address the matter, the Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement to say that Walz 'misspoke' - again.\n\nBut Walz himself seemed reluctant to admit a mistake.\n\nIn a joint CNN interview with Harris, he was asked to confirm that he had misspoken, but his answer appeared evasive.\n\n'My wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he was lambasted by members of his own former unit for his decision to retire from the National Guard shortly before they were deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nVance, who served with the US Marines in Iraq, called that decision 'absolutely shameful.'\n\nIt also emerged that Walz, in campaign literature for a 2006 bid to represent Minnesota in the House of Representatives, was described as a 'retired command sergeant major.'\n\nThe same description was used on the Harris-Walz website in 2024.\n\nHowever, even though Walz did briefly serve as a command sergeant major, he did not keep that title after retirement.\n\nInstead, he retired as a lower-ranking 'master sergeant', having never completed the coursework required to retain the more senior title.\n\nThe mother of Kye Miller, a Minnesotan who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq on June 29, 2006, slammed Walz at the time.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: 'To publicly present false prestige of his unearned rank, an inaccurate representation, is a falsehood of who he truly is.'\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign was forced to edit its website to correct the mistake.\n\nIt was far from the first scandal Walz had been through.\n\nBefore his political career, when he was a teacher, he was stopped by police while driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone near Chadron, Nebraska.\n\nA blood test showed his alcohol level was above the state's legal limit, and his lawyer admitted in court that he had been drinking.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving, lost his license for 90 days, and paid a fine of $200.\n\nA decade later, when he ran for Congress, the incident emerged and his team claimed that he had not been drinking.\n\n'The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: it wasn't true,' his team said.\n\nThey claimed that Walz had only failed a sobriety test because of hearing loss he incurred while serving in the National Guard – and that he had been allowed to drive himself to jail.\n\nThe full truth later emerged - that he had been drinking and was driven to the police station in the back of a police car.\n\nHaving survived such a litany of scandals, Walz came within reach of the office of vice president.\n\nOn Monday, as he announced he would not run for Minnesota governor again, he said he had 'zero sadness and zero regret.'\n\nLike some of his other statements, that one was a little hard to believe.","summary":"Walz could not survive the Minnesota welfare scandal that has exploded on to the national stage in recent days.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15436435/Tim-Walz-final-humiliation-excruciating-unraveling-Tampon-Tim-filled-gaffes-excuses-calamitous-VP-cameo.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/05/18/105250473-0-image-a-28_1767638348640.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/17/1967700321714749393/1024x576_MP4_1967700321714749393.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:24:48","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":391515440,"title":"Here’s How Trump Brought Accountability to MN – and Torched Tim Walz’s Political Career in the Process","text":"When Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D) made the blockbuster announcement Monday that he would not be seeking reelection, he focused his ire squarely in one direction: at President Donald Trump. It was Trump, said Walz, who wanted to \"make our state a colder, meaner place\" by \"attacking our neighbors.\"\n\nBy \"neighbors,\" Kamala Harris's running mate, of course, means the Somali community to which the Democrat Party can't seem to pander enough. It's this very community that has brought the failures of Walz and his fellow Minnesota Democrats into sharp focus as the Trump administration takes action to uncover the extent of the fraud being committed in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nDEEP DIVE: It's Official – Tim Walz Won't Seek Reelection As His Political Career Goes Down in Flames\n\nThe Trump/Bondi DOJ Is Aggressively Pursuing Multiple Fraud Investigations in MN; Here Are the Details\n\nAnd, to Walz's point, the administration is taking decisive and comprehensive action to, in the words of the White House, \"crush Minnesota’s fraud epidemic.\" It all starts with the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is \"engaged in multiple active, ongoing, and extensive investigations into the fraudulent activity that has occurred in various Minnesota programs, including the state’s Feeding Our Future, Housing Stabilization Services, Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention programs, and Evergreen Recovery.\"\n\nThere have been 98 defendants charged by the DOJ in fraud-related cases – the majority of those charged are from the Somali community – with 64 convictions already secured. Furthermore, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating dozens of Minnesota's health care and home daycare providers who are accused of fraud, and who possibly have links to elected officials and terrorist financing.\n\nThese efforts by the DOJ and the FBI are just the beginning, with the Department of Homeland Security going door-to-door investigating suspected fraud sites and ramping up immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota. And the Department of Health and Human Services has frozen federal childcare payments to the state and is investigating its Head Start programs over allegations of fraud being committed by illegal aliens.\n\nIn addition, several other departments and agencies are taking action to ensure accountability:\n\nThe Small Business Administration has halted all annual grant program payments to Minnesota. The agency also suspended 6,900 borrowers in the state for approximately $400 million in suspected fraudulent activity — banning the individuals from all further loan programs, including disaster loans.The Department of Housing and Urban Development has dispatched a team to Minnesota to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into possible public housing assistance fraud.The Department of Labor is currently conducting a targeted review of Minnesota’s Unemployment Insurance program.The Department of Agriculture has demanded Minnesota conduct recertification for its SNAP recipients to ensure the program complies with eligibility requirements — a commonsense move inexplicably challenged in court by state officials.\n\nAll of the federal attention being paid to his state, it seems, was simply too much for Tim Walz, who said Monday, “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nDespite Tim Walz's efforts to frame this as a political hit on him and Minnesota, what's actually happening here is a Trump-sized dose of accountability, something that was long overdue. And Walz is bailing, hoping to quietly exit stage right instead of letting the voters decide his fate. It's clear the Trump administration has other plans.\n\nEditor’s Note: Help us continue to report the truth about corrupt politicians like Tim Walz.\n\nJoin RedState VIP and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your membership.","url":"https://redstate.com/terichristoph/2026/01/05/heres-what-the-trump-administration-is-doing-to-crush-minnesotas-fraud-epidemic-n2197780","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/351/14a3323c-2d28-4449-a33c-7af6ccb1a3e8.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:21:54","author":"Teri Christoph","authors":["Teri Christoph"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.109},{"id":391491776,"title":"Will Amy Klobuchar run for Minnesota governor? Buzz around senator’s future after Tim Walz’s shock decision to bow out of race","text":"Sen. Amy Klobuchar is said to be seriously considering a run for Minnesota governor now that incumbent Gov. Tim Walz has abruptly decided to bow out of the race. \n\nWhile it’s unclear when she will make a final decision on whether to run, the four-term senator is believed to have been getting some encouragement to jump into the race to succeed Walz (D), who dropped out amid a firestorm over a massive welfare fraud scandal that ensued under his watch.\n\n“Governor Walz made the difficult decision to focus on his job and the challenges facing our state rather than campaigning and running for reelection,” Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in response to Walz’s announcement. \n\n“He has always dedicated his career to delivering for Minnesota — from providing school breakfast and lunches to our kids to passing gun safety legislation to maintaining our state’s AAA bond rating. He is a true public servant.”\n\nBefore publicly announcing his shocking decision, Walz had privately met with Klobuchar on Sunday, CNN reported. Details of their discussion aren’t clear. \n\nWalz had launched his reelection bid last September, seeking to become the first incumbent Minnesota governor to notch a third consecutive term since terms were expanded to four years in 1963.\n\nBut on Monday, Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ veep pick in the 2024 race, abruptly withdrew.\n\n“As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” he said in a statement.\n\n“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”\n\nThe decision came as prosecutors have slapped charges against roughly 90 individuals for swindling Minnesota taxpayers. \n\nWhile estimates of the total theft vary, it is thought to be at least $1 billion, with First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson claiming late last year that the fraud could be $9 billion or more. \n\nThe swindling of taxpayer dollars was largely perpetrated by members of Minnesota’s Somali population, where people set up bogus nonprofits to get state funding to provide services to the homeless, hungry, and individuals in need of daycare for their children. \n\nThe Trump administration has stepped up scrutiny of Minnesota in response. More charges over the sweeping Minnesota fraud scandal are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nSeemingly clearing the way for a Klobuchar bid for governor, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan confirmed that she intends to remain in her race to succeed retiring Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), rather than vie for governor.\n\n“Since his time as a teacher, Governor Walz has led with decency and compassion,” she said in a statement. “Today’s decision reflects who he has always been — someone who puts Minnesotans first.”\n\n“I am proud to call him a friend and proud of all the work that has been done to make Minnesota the best place to raise a family.”\n\nPrior to her ascension to the Senate in 2007, Klobuchar served as the County Attorney of Hennepin County. She also vied unsuccessfully for the Democratic nod for president in 2020. \n\nIf she were to enter the gubernatorial race, Klobuchar would join three of her Senate peers in running for governor: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Michael Bennet (D-Col.)\n\nKlobuchar has won all of her Senate bids by double digits.","summary":"Sen.

You think this guy was just going to voluntarily give up? He clearly was not. He was getting into bed with the Cubans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, even Hezbollah, as I understand.

KAMALA HARRIS BLASTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA’S MADURO AS ‘UNLAWFUL AND UNWISE’ Lawmakers on the left have mostly criticized the president and his officials, accusing them of illegal actions that ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Some progressives have even said Trump could be guilty of impeachable offenses. The majority of GOP lawmakers praised Trump’s move as a necessary law enforcement action to get rid of a hostile actor threatening both the U.S. and the region writ large. Haridopolos is no different, pointing out that the operation was carried out with no U.S. fatalities and relatively few among Maduro supporters in Venezuela. He said his district is home to a number of Venezuelan refugees who were elated by President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Caracas and capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Although initially intended to be short-term, the closures were repeatedly extended through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, according to Ballotpedia. For the following school year, Walz gave districts some flexibility, but his guidance generally favored remote or hybrid learning. Minnesota schools remained in limited in-person instruction significantly longer than many Republican-led states.\n\nIn July 2020, Walz implemented a statewide mask mandate in another executive order, requiring face coverings in most indoor public spaces. The mandate, issued under his March 2020 declaration of a peacetime emergency, remained in effect for roughly ten months before being lifted in May 2021.\n\nIn August 2020, the Upper Midwest Law Center filed suit on behalf of 16 Minnesota residents, small businesses and churches, challenging Walz’s mask mandate as an overreach of his emergency powers. The lawsuit alleged conflicts with state law, constitutional violations, and unworkable enforcement burdens on businesses.\n\nThat same year, Walz issued Executive Orders 20-94 and 20-95, granting schools additional time to prepare for distance and hybrid learning, discouraging teachers from juggling in-person and remote instruction simultaneously, and extending remote learning options further into the school year.\n\nThe legal battle over Walz’s emergency powers dragged on for years. Lower courts initially dismissed the lawsuit or deemed it moot after the mandate expired, but in 2023, the Minnesota Supreme Court partially reversed the mootness ruling and remanded the case for review on whether the Emergency Management Act permitted peacetime emergencies for public health crises. The Court of Appeals ruled in July that Walz had acted lawfully, a decision the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in 2024 — upholding the state’s broad emergency powers while rendering challenges to the expired mandate moot.\n\n On Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate Minnesota’s transgender community and recommit to standing up for our neighbors in the face of hatred.

In March 2023, he signed Executive Order 23-03 to safeguard access to “gender-affirming” health care in Minnesota. The following month, he signed HF 146, positioning Minnesota as a “sanctuary” or “refuge” state for transgender individuals, including those fleeing states where such care faces restrictions or bans. (RELATED: ‘It’s All Bullsh*t’: Tim Walz Goes On Anti-Second Amendment Rant)\n\nIn May 2023, Walz signed HF 44 into law, requiring public and charter schools to provide free menstrual products to all “menstruating students” in grades 4-12. The gender-neutral statute mandates availability “in restrooms regularly used by students,” accommodating biologically female students regardless of which bathroom they use.\n\nOn the 2024 campaign trail, after being selected as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, Walz’s past statements about his military service, teaching career, and time in China resurfaced under renewed scrutiny.\n\nVice President JD Vance and other Republican critics accused Walz of “stolen valor,” claiming he exaggerated his service by implying combat experience and noting that he retired before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nThe Harris campaign had shared a video in which Walz, supporting a weapons ban after the 2018 Parkland shooting, said he wanted to ban the weapons he “carried in war.” Vance argued the statement overstated Walz’s combat role and alleged that Walz left the National Guard ahead of his unit’s Iraq deployment, implying he abandoned his fellow soldiers, NPR and PBS reported.\n\n Gov. @Tim_Walz: I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt.

He later acknowledged in the vice presidential debate that he had “misspoke” about the timing.\n\nMost recently, Walz has been embroiled in a massive fraud scandal.

Tim Walz ended his bid for a third term as Minnesota governor Monday — seeming to cap a political career that sent the former teacher and National Guard veteran all the way to national stage when he was named Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024.\n\nThat year he joined Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale as Minnesotans to be on a national ticket.\n\nWalz, a Democrat, got involved in politics during the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign. He was first elected to Congress in 2006, defeating incumbent U.S. Rep. Gil Gutknecht, a Republican, in Minnesota’s 1st District. The largely rural district covers much of the southern portion of the state and is seen as fairly conservative.\n\nWhile in Congress Walz was on the Agriculture, Armed Services and Veteran Affairs committees.\n\nIn 2017, Walz announced he was running for governor. He was elected the next year, defeating GOP candidate Jeff Johnson. He and running mate Peggy Flanagan at the time chalked up their victory to their theme of “One Minnesota,” a relatively centrist message that they would seek common ground across the state. Walz won re-election in 2022 defeating Dr. Scott Jensen.\n\nA hunter, Walz was something of a moderate and even had the endorsement of the NRA early in his career. However, after becoming governor he would sign a number of gun-control bills.\n\nPandemic, riots\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020 Walz ordered all nonessential workers to stay at home and called for the closure of schools and banned large public gatherings. During the pandemic he directed hundreds of millions of dollars in state and federal relief funds to local governments, food shelves and food banks.\n\nAlso in 2020 George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer sparking riots in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Walz activated the National Guard in response though critics said it should have happened sooner.\n\nIn an interview with the Pioneer Press months afterward, he noted the challenges of that time.\n\n“I’m not going to make the case that every decision we made was correct, but I can assure people that we made it with the best data at the time, with the best interests of Minnesota at heart,” Walz said.\n\n2023 Legislature, 2024 campaign\n\nThe 2023 Legislature — under DFL control — passed a $72 billion budget that Walz and DFLers called the “One Minnesota” budget.\n\nIt included bills to create $1.5 billion in new child tax credits, boost funding for education by $2.2 billion and provide free public college tuition to people from families earning $80,000 or less each year. It also provided free meals to Minnesota students regardless of income.\n\nGOP critics point to billions in new taxes in the budget despite the state’s historic $17.5 billion budget surplus. And, they disputed Walz’s “One Minnesota” characterization, saying the bills had minimal input from the minority — which represents districts containing just under half of the state’s population.\n\nWalz was named as Harris’ running mate in 2024 after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. He didn’t hesitate to paint his political opponents in a negative light.\n\n“These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,” Walz said in a TV interview during the campaign.\n\nWhile Harris seemed to think Walz would help shore up her campaign in the Midwest, the ticket went on to lose to Donald Trump and JD Vance. Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — once part of the so-called “Blue Wall” — went for the Republican ticket.\n\nNew fraud cases\n\nNews of fraud in state-run Medicaid programs has garnered significant attention in recent months, but before that came the $250 million Feeding Our Future scandal.\n\nIn that case, the now 78 defendants have been accused of claiming reimbursement from the state education department for meals they never served in a federal pandemic children’s food program. More than 50 have been convicted.\n\nAt a news conference last month announcing charges against six individuals who authorities say defrauded the state of millions in various schemes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said he believed “a significant amount” of the $18 billion paid out by 14 “high-risk” Medicaid-funded programs since 2018 was lost to fraud — possibly half or more.\n\nThe governor has made efforts to address the fraud. Last year, he directed the creation of a fraud investigation unit at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\n\nAnd, the Department of Human Services moved to shut down a Medicaid-funded housing stabilization program beset by fraud after news emerged in July of a federal investigation into several providers. Walz also recently named Tim O’Malley, former superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension under Gov. Tim Pawlenty, to serve as director of program integrity, essentially fraud-prevention czar.\n\nBut the moves haven’t stemmed the criticism, particularly from the GOP, that he reacted too late and hasn’t done enough on the issue.","summary":"Walz, a Democrat, got involved in politics during the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/05/tim-walzs-decision-not-to-seek-3rd-term-may-end-lengthy-mn-political-career/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walz20170327.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 19:52:04","author":"Pioneer Press","authors":["Pioneer Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":391588058,"title":"Minnesota Governor Walz will not seek third term, to focus on welfare fraud scandal - Reuters","text":"SummaryWalz, a Democrat, says state's welfare system is in crisisSays Trump, Republicans trying to make state 'colder, meaner place'\n\nJan 5 (Reuters) - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will not seek a third term in office, he announced on Monday, saying he would instead focus on allegations of fraud in the state's welfare system that have become a crisis after mounting pressure and attacks from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nWalz, a 61-year-old former teacher and coach, became governor of the Midwestern state in 2019, and gained national prominence in 2024 as the running mate of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate who lost to Trump.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueReport Ad\n\nRecently, the Trump administration has singled out Walz and Minnesota, including its large population of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants, over allegations of fraud, dating back to 2020, by some nonprofit groups that administer the state's childcare and other social services programs with support from federal funding.\n\nAt least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors started to bring charges in 2022, under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nIn his announcement, Walz referred to the fraud scandal as a crisis, and said he wanted to \"let others worry about the election while I focus on the work\".

Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Democrat, is considering seeking the office, two people briefed on conversations between the two politicians said.\n\nWalz and Klobuchar met Sunday in Minnesota, where he informed her of his plans, and she confirmed her interest in running to succeed him. For Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2024 election, the departure caps a brief rise in national politics.\n\nWalz said a widening scandal over fraud in social services programs in Minnesota had persuaded him to drop out of the race. He had been criticized for his administration’s oversight of the programs and its failure to prevent widespread fraud.\n\n“I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” Walz said in a statement he read aloud during a news conference today. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”\n\nKlobuchar did not respond to requests for comment this morning.\n\nWalz’s decision jolts a race that had drawn an unusually large and strong slate of Republican candidates, including the speaker of the Minnesota House, Lisa Demuth, and Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and an ally of President Donald Trump. Republicans have not won a statewide race in Minnesota since 2006, but they have expressed confidence that this year’s governor’s race would be different.\n\nDemocrats in the state had voiced concern in recent weeks that Walz’s presence on the ticket might hurt other Democrats in November.\n\nWalz’s exit comes amid national scrutiny of his handling of the welfare fraud scandal, which Trump and other top Republicans have assailed him for in recent weeks.\n\nA former public school teacher who served in Congress for 12 years before becoming governor, Walz, 61, had signaled ambivalence last year about seeking a third term. During the summer, shortly before announcing he would run again, the governor said in an interview that he had been trying to gauge whether Minnesotans wanted him to stay in office.\n\n“I think you need to think through: Well, do you have the ability to do the job? Have you done well?” Walz said, describing questions he was wrestling with.\n\nIn September, Walz announced that he did intend to run again. At the time, he said he was proud of a legacy that included passing numerous bills that pushed the state to the left in 2023, when Democrats had majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature.\n\nSoon after that announcement, the fraud scandal began dogging his candidacy.\n\nLater that month, federal prosecutors announced that an investigation into fraud in a COVID-19 program meant to feed children had broadened to include other safety net programs administered by Walz’s administration. Federal prosecutors have asserted that as much as $9 billion may have been stolen over a period of years when Walz’s administration was overseeing state programs.\n\nMore than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases to date and at least 60 have been convicted. The vast majority of defendants are of Somali origin.\n\nRepublicans accused Walz and fellow Democrats of failing to respond forcefully to red flags about theft in state-run programs in part because Somali Americans are an influential voting bloc for Democrats.\n\nWalz has called that accusation baseless but has acknowledged that fraud had become a pervasive problem in the state, and he announced a series of measures to improve oversight.\n\nAs the scandal continued to make national headlines, providing Republicans a powerful line of attack, Democrats began expressing worry that the scandal would hobble Walz’s campaign.\n\nThe leading Republicans running for governor have made combating fraud their signature issue.\n\n“Even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis,” Walz said in the statement announcing he was dropping out.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly focused on the fraud scandal and threatened to cut funding for Minnesota safety net programs, arguing that Democrats in the state could not be trusted to prevent taxpayer funds from being stolen.\n\nOver the weekend, the White House announced that the Department of Justice was sending additional personnel and resources to Minnesota to “crush Minnesota’s fraud epidemic.”\n\n“These complex criminal networks didn’t build themselves overnight on Tim Walz’s watch, and rooting them out completely requires thorough, methodical work to build cases that secure convictions and recover taxpayer dollars,” a statement from the White House said.\n\nInterest in the fraud scandal grew in the past week, following a viral video created by Nick Shirley, a conservative content creator. In the video, Shirley purported to have exposed rampant fraud in government-subsidized day care centers run by Somalis in the Minneapolis area.\n\nThe video — which did not conclusively prove malfeasance — drew praise from top officials in the Trump administration and Minnesota Republicans.\n\nRepublicans today in the state suggested that they would continue to focus on the fraud issue even with Walz out of the race.\n\n“Minnesota’s fraud epidemic extends well beyond any one individual,” said Harry Niska, a Republican state representative. “It is the result of nearly two decades of Democrat governors, backed by their legislative allies, creating a culture of complacency that has cost Minnesotans and their families billions of dollars.”\n\nKlobuchar, 65, a former state prosecutor, has long held ambitions beyond her Senate seat. She ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and has not given up her desire to hold executive office.\n\nShe has won each of her four Senate terms by at least 16 percentage points in a state that Democrats have controlled for more than a decade but often has close statewide elections. Should Klobuchar become the governor, she would appoint her own replacement who would serve until a special election is held to complete the remainder of her term, which ends in 2030.\n\nShortly after Walz announced he was suspending his campaign, Klobuchar praised him in a statement that did not shed light on her own plans.\n\n“Governor Walz made the difficult decision to focus on his job and the challenges facing our state rather than campaigning and running for reelection,” Klobuchar said. “He has always dedicated his career to delivering for Minnesota.”\n\nFor Walz, the decision to forgo a third term puts a cap on a rapid rise from being a little-known Midwestern governor to his party’s vice-presidential nominee to someone mentioned as a potential top presidential candidate on his own.\n\nWalz spent years carefully building his profile behind the scenes before he emerged as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris before she chose him last summer. But his turn on the national stage quickly turned rocky.\n\nQuestions emerged about inconsistencies in his personal biography. Democrats panned his debate performance, and Harris wrote in her campaign memoir that he wasn’t her first choice.\n\nHis supporters today said the governor’s decision exemplified Walz’s dedication to the state. Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said, “Today’s decision is entirely consistent with who Tim is.”\n\nMartin, who is from Minnesota and formerly served as the chair of the state party, added, “Tim has always believed that leadership isn’t about preserving your own power — it’s about using it to make a difference for as many people as possible.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2026 The New York Times Company","summary":"ST.

His wife is a general pediatrician at a St. Elizabeth Physicians primary care facility in Kentucky.\n\nThe DeFoor family appears close with both William and Catherine having just last year paid visits to their youngest children's universities, social media posts show.\n\nThe accused home attacker does not appear to have graduated from a traditional four-year university despite having excelled as a high schooler at The Summit Country Day School, a prestigious private school in Cincinnati.\n\nDeFoor, then known as Davis, graduated in 2018 after being named a National AP Scholar. He was also active in the school's drama department and even played the piano for a musical written, produced and directed by a friend.\n\nThe suspect appears to have created a Facebook page reflecting his new identity - transgender woman Julia DeFoor - just last month.\n\nDeFoor's first profile picture was posted on December 15, but overall the account offers few details about the alleged home invader. \n\nThe profile highlights DeFoor's graduation from Summit Country Day in 2018 and attendance at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music beginning in August that year.\n\nAccording to the profile, DeFoor left the music conservatory in 2020, suggesting that a degree was never completed. His 19-year-old brother Alex, an aspiring musician who shares his songs on social media, currently studies at that very conservatory.\n\nDeFoor then enrolled at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College last year. It is unclear what he was studying.\n\nThe Facebook profile also highlighted his liked pages, including the Heartland Trans Wellness center which aims to provide resources for transgender patients in the Greater Cincinnati area.\n\nHis father William has supported a slew of Democratic causes, including donating more than $11,600 to Kamala Harris's campaign and the Democratic Party political action committee ActBlue in the lead up to the 2024 election.\n\nHe also donated to Joe Biden's presidential campaign in 2020, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the Daily Mail. \n\nDeFoor is a registered Ohio voter, although a party affiliation was not publicly available. He appears to have last voted in the 2020 election. \n\nIt is unclear how close DeFoor is with his parents, despite his last known address being the family home.\n\nWilliam has not recently posted photos with his eldest child.\n\nThe pediatric urologist and Harvard University alumnus shared snaps online of his visit to Alex's university last fall, a European vacation with his wife, and photos from artist Libby's graduation from the University of Iowa in May last year. \n\nBut noticeably absent from William's publicly accessible social media pages was his eldest child.\n\nDeFoor is accused of attacking Vance's home in Cincinnati's East Walnut Hills neighborhood, located roughly 3.5 miles from the DeFoor family home.\n\nSecret Service agents heard a loud noise at the home around midnight and spotted the suspect running from the home, which is the secondary residence for Vance, his wife Usha and their three young children.\n\nDeFoor was detained by agents shortly after, a Secret Service spokesman told the Daily Mail. He was then taken into custody by the Cincinnati Police Department. \n\nThe vice president and his family were out of town at the time of the attack.\n\nWhen an officer informed the suspect of his rights, DeFoor responded: 'I don't know,' according to the arrest report.\n\nHe had also allegedly vandalized a Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home's driveway. \n\nNo motive has been released.\n\nDeFoor has been accused of trashing property before.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in April to two counts of vandalism after causing more than $2,000 worth of damage to an interior design company, court records show.\n\nHe was sentenced to treatment at a mental health facility for two years and was required to pay $5,550 in damages.\n\nDeFoor is set to be arraigned at Hamilton County Municipal Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe Daily Mail's calls to the DeFoor family went unanswered. \n\nFollowing the break-in, footage was released showing large holes in the windows of Vance's home as cops patrolled the scene and recorded evidence of the damage.\n\nThe luxurious East Walnut Hills property overlooks the Ohio River and spans 2.3 acres. The Vance family purchased the home for $1.4 million.\n\nAfter taking the vice presidential oath of office in January 2025, Vance and his wife Usha have lived with their three children at the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC.\n\nThe couple also own a property on Capitol Hill.\n\nVance posted on X: 'I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home.

Good Riddance.","text":"With dark clouds gathering over his previously sunny reelection bid, Tim Walz has had enough. Minnesota's Democratic governor announced Monday he would abandon his pursuit of a third term following widespread negative publicity due to his mishandling of welfare fraud allegations.\n\nWalz has not been accused of personal wrongdoing, but the buck stops here, as they say. Walz was the man in charge while fraudsters stole millions, or perhaps billions, of taxpayer dollars by setting up fake charities, ransacking the medical system, and operating dubious child care services. The sheer amount of plunder has attracted national media attention in recent weeks, with even The New York Times throwing Walz under the bus.\n\nThe governor's response has not reassured his critics that he is laser focused on restoring credibility to these programs and mercilessly prosecuting thieves. It is fine to insist, as Walz has, that the entire Somali diaspora not be smeared for the criminal behavior of some community members, but the governor has made a habit of trying to redirect blame to other groups, such as white men. This is unpersuasive, since the accusations against the Somalis are about proportionality, not absolute levels of crime. Moreover, saying that we must be color-blind with respect to the ethnicities of the fraudsters while also calling for more white men to be held accountable is totally incoherent.\n\nUnfortunately, this incoherence is broadly representative of the Walz persona. This is a man who was elevated to national prominence by Vice President Kamala Harris when she picked him to be her 2025 running mate. In Walz's own clumsily-worded telling, she picked him because he could \"code talk to white guys\" like himself. He saw his job as reassuring his own identity group that they could vote for a black woman for president. It's a reductive and extremely flawed notion of what makes for a relatable presidential ticket; Harris underperformed with men—particularly young men—of all racial backgrounds, not specifically white guys. Walz likes football and fixing trucks, so vote Harris/Walz 2024! This is identity politics at its most vacuous.\n\nBut it's not just that Walz's vibes are off. His governance in the state of Minnesota has been disastrous, even apart from the fraud scandal. Indeed, Walz has achieved a record as hostile to human liberty as virtually any other currently seated governor. He was, first and foremost, a COVID-19 tyrant who zealously enforced social distancing and mask requirements, including by setting up a coronavirus snitch hotline: Citizens were encouraged to report their neighbors to the government for failing to abide by COVID-19 rules. He also spent coronavirus relief money on pet projects and political kickbacks that were obviously outside the scope of what the money ought to have been used for: state workers' parking costs, teaching women and minority owned businesses how to apply for state contracts, and the Minneapolis zoo.\n\nFor supporters of individual liberty, Walz's various pronouncements on policy issues were like nails on a chalkboard. He said that misinformation was not protected by the First Amendment. (It is.) He said socialism was just \"neighborliness.\" (He should take that attitude to New York City, where it belongs, unfortunately.) He said it was \"not a mistake\" to send sick COVID-19 patients back to nursing homes. (Even former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has dropped that point.)\n\nA year ago, Walz was seen as a potential 2028 vice presidential candidate. His decision not to run for reelection—an explicit acknowledgement of the toll the fraud scandal has taken on his reputation—seems like the end for Walz's political career. At least he will have plenty of time for football and trucks.","summary":"Once a 2028 hopeful, the Minnesota Democrat is one of the most unlibertarian governors in the country.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/05/tim-walz-drops-out-of-minnesota-governor-race-good-riddance/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1-5-26-v1-a-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 19:10:16","author":"Jacob Sullum,Robby Soave","authors":["Jacob Sullum","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.296}]}
