{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":369,"news":[{"id":329176828,"title":"How Democrats Can Stop Alienating Young Men: Some Unsolicited Advice","text":"Last November, Donald Trump soundly defeated Kamala Harris among young men 18 to 29 years old, racking up about 56% of their votes according to the Associated Press. That represents a huge decline from 2008, the climax of the Barack Obama coalition, when the Democrat candidate won 62% of the young male vote against GOP challenger John McCain.\n\nClearly, Democrats have a young man problem—and they’ve vowed to do something about it. Accordingly, the party is spending $20 million on a special multiyear effort called “Speaking With American Men: A Strategic Plan.” The project, The New York Times recently reported, will “study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.”\n\nYes, really. Hold your laughter.\n\nIt’s true that leading Democrat figures could use some help on the “syntax” and “language” fronts. They might begin to right the ship, on that score, by ditching the infamous gobbledygook “gaffes” of Joe Biden and the “unburdened by what has been” word salads of Harris. But the rubber will meet the road for Democrats when it comes to the critical, elusive third category of concern for their new young male outreach effort: content.\n\nTo paraphrase a venerable saying, one can put lipstick on a pig, but the pig, at the end of the day, is still a pig. And something big has to change for the Democrats. Nor is their problem limited to young men; the party’s overall favorability ratings, in recent months, have hit record lows in public polling.\n\nHere, Democrats, is some (entirely) unsolicited advice on steps you might consider taking to become less catastrophically unpopular with young men—and many other Americans too.\n\nOn the issue of sexuality and the human person, you might consider beginning your vaunted young male outreach efforts by deigning to properly define what exactly a “man” is—and, by extension, what a “woman” is as well. Indeed, your party’s most recent Supreme Court nominee publicly struggled to crack this case. It is probably best, before attempting to devise pro-young-man public policy ideas, to familiarize yourselves with your target audience. The definition of “man” as it has existed since the Garden of Eden is a pretty good place to start.\n\nAfter successfully defining “man” and “woman,” you might consider not indulging recurring grievances levied against so-called toxic masculinity. It is generally a good idea, in political outreach, to not hold in dripping disdain the demographic group you are trying to reach. Sure, men have been killing each other since Cain slew Abel, but many of them have also been doing some pretty good things for humanity since around that same time period. One key to publicly rejecting misandry will be ditching support for “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives, which, along with also now being illegal, invariably take a pretty dim view of the heterogametic sex.\n\nOn the issue of immigration, you might consider not opening up America’s borders to, well, pretty much the whole world—but especially young males in search of economic opportunity in the land of the free and the home of the brave. Democrats might not have gotten this impression from the Harvard faculty lounge, but over half of Americans these days live paycheck to paycheck. Far too many young men struggle to provide for their families; indeed, many delay marriage in the first place because of finances. Flooding the zone with more wage competition may please the wokerati, but it won’t help you regain credibility with American breadwinners.\n\nOn the issue of environmentalism, you might consider not so conspicuously sacrificing American energy on the altar of climate alarmism. The young male voter simply wants a fair shot to make a decent living and provide safety and security for his family. The ham-handed restriction of hydrocarbon extraction does more than anything else to spike the price of every good or service. You might think that Trump’s tariffs are a threat to price stability, but you’d be wrong—at least so far. The real threat to the fiscal well-being of the median American comes from the price of energy, from which all other prices flow. Maybe, just maybe, don’t sacrifice all that on the altar of “Mother Earth”?\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that there is a lot of potential upside from their efforts to reach young men. The bad news for Democrats is the same: There’s so much to gain precisely because of how unpopular they currently are with that cohort.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Obviously there's a lot going on in our country right now.\n\n'To be able to be a representation of people that look like me in America who maybe don't feel as supported during this time period, and so just being that reflection of hope and light for those people.\n\n'I remember after the election and everything, it kind of felt like a down period. My mom told me during Riyadh (the WTA Finals in November, which Gauff won), \"Try to win the tournament to give something for people to smile for\". So that's what I was thinking about today when holding the trophy.\n\n'And seeing the flags in the crowd means a lot. Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic, but I'm definitely patriotic and proud to be American. I'm proud to represent the Americans that look like me and people who kind of support the things that I support.'\n\nGauff has a keen social conscience and has always used her platform to raise awareness about issues over which she feels strongly. \n\nCoco Gauff drops to her knees after winning the French Open women's singles title on Sunday\n\nGauff - still only 21 years old - is now a two-time Grand Slam champion and the world No 2\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nCoco Gauff triumphs over Aryna Sabalenka in epic French Open final to win second Grand Slam title\n\nWhile not explicitly political she has made it very clear where her sympathies lie, saying before last year's US Open it was 'inspiring' to see Kamala Harris running for president. \n\nAfter Donald Trump won his second term, she tweeted: 'Allow yourself to feel how you feel during tough times... especially today. Just lean on God with your concerns. He is the highest power. Remember that.'\n\nIn the past few days, Trump's second term has reached ever more bizarre heights, after the president began an ugly, and very public, feud with Elon Musk.\n\nMusk - the richest man in the world and previously Trump's right-hand man in charge of DOGE - has left the government and is strongly opposing the new 'big, beautiful bill', which includes tax cuts and increased border spending.\n\nMusk even took to X to claim that Trump is 'on the Epstein list', and Trump has also threatened Musk's federal contracts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Paris, the first person Gauff celebrated with after her victory was filmmaker Spike Lee, who was courtside.\n\n'That was the first time I really met him,' said the world No2. 'I've seen him at my matches at US Open.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' has made headlines around the world this week\n\nAryna Sabalenka gets emotional as she speaks to the crowd in the wake of her final defeat\n\nGauff went straight to Spike Lee in the crowd after she secured the victory over the world No 1\n\n'Then the camera panned to him in the gym when I was warming up. I was, like, \"Oh, my gosh, Spike Lee is there.\"\n\n'Then when I saw him on the court, I'm like, \"If I win this match, the first person I'm going to tap up is Spike Lee.\"\n\n'So once I won the match, I went on the ground and everything, then I headed straight to Spike Lee. I wanted to tell him, I had to do it, that even though the Knicks didn't win, I gave him something to cheer for.\n\n'That was pretty cool.

In three consecutive presidential elections in the United States. In the latest polls in Britain, where the 2016 Brexit referendum was the first notable outbreak. In France’s most recent national election and in Germany’s. In Canada’’ election last month. And maybe in Poland and South Korea last weekend.\n\nThe pattern can be summarized in a simple formula. M+M versus H. Or, increasingly and to the discomfort of established politicians and press personnel, M+(1-x)M<H+xM.\n\nThe first M stands for “metropole,” the dominant governmental, media and cultural center of each country. London and Paris in Britain and France, obviously, with 16% to 20% of the nation’s population and practically all its elites. In the U.S., metro New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In Canada, Toronto and Anglophone Montreal. In South Korea, Seoul.\n\nThe second M stands for “minorities,” racial and ethnic. In Britain, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Muslims in industrial cities. In the U.S., the various peoples, bracketed by the Census Bureau ukase, as blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Francophone Canadians. Peoples whose experiences have set them apart as alien and potentially adversary to the dominant society.\n\nI first discerned the M+M vs. H patterns in June and November 2016. As I wrote in 2019, in the Brexit referendum, 60% or more of voters in metro London and Scotland voted against leaving the European Union, but Brexit won because 57% in England outside London voted for it.\n\nSimilarly, in the U.S, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump 65% to 30% in the NY/DC/LA/SF metropole, which is 15% of the nation, but Trump won 49% to 45% in the heartland in between. Key electoral votes came from 2012 Obama voters switching to Trump in the nonmajor metropolitan half of the Midwest.\n\nThe heartland doesn’t always lose. Joe Biden’s November 2020 victory over Trump is one example of that. The ouster of pro-Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson in summer 2022, and the Labour party victory in the July 2024 general election, is another.\n\n2022 saw incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron, who in the first round ran behind a leftist in the metropole and just four points ahead of the populist anti-mass-immigration Marine Le Pen in the heartland. Macron won the runoff but by only half the margin of four years before.\n\nThe elites have fought back. Johnson was ousted following an ethics complaint, and a French court barred Le Pen from running for five years on a flimsy rationale. European Union elites removed the candidate who led the first ballot in Romania from the runoff and have threatened to bar Germany’s AfD party, the second-place finisher in the February election, from future contests.\n\nYou can see the similarities with the lawfare attacks on Trump and the kangaroo court prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nElites justify these moves by invoking the tragic history of the first half of the 20th century. But objecting to having economic policies set by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels is not undemocratic. And barring or limiting the uncontrolled influx of often culturally hostile immigrants is not the moral equivalent of murdering 6 million Jews.\n\nPreventing voters from exercising their free choice is a funny way of “saving democracy.” And not a very effective way. Le Pen’s deputy Jordan Bardella is running well in polls, and Labour in Britain polls way behind Nigel Farage’s Reform party by 362 to 136 seats at present, with nearly 40% of the party’s seats in metro London.\n\nAnd Donald Trump’s 2024 victory seems to have produced a realignment in his direction. The metropole-minorities alliance is fading, as Hispanics, Asians and, to a lesser extent, blacks have trended Republican. Kamala Harris’ 61-36 margin in the NY/DC/LA/SF metropole is notably less than Hillary Clinton’s 65-30, while in the heartland beyond, Trump increased his 49-45 plurality in 2016 to a 52-46 majority in 2024.\n\nA brilliant New York Times graphic shows that Trump has gained percentages in each of the last three elections in 1,433 counties with 42 million people, while his Democratic opponents have gained percentages three times in only 57 counties with 8 million people.\n\nAs Jewish Insider’s Josh Kraushaar noted on X: “For years, the belief was Democrats have had demographic destiny on our side. Now, the inverse is true.”\n\nOne corollary of this largely unpredicted movement of minorities away from metropole attitudes and toward the heartland is that the young, for minorities tend to be younger than average, are moving that way too.\n\nPerhaps that helps account for the victory of Karol Nawrocki, who was trailing in preelection polling and even in the exit poll in Poland. There’s polling evidence that young voters switched from the center-left in 2020 to the Right this time. Nawrocki may have been helped, or at least wasn’t hurt, by his May 1 Oval Office visit or by elite efforts to disqualify populist candidates in Romania and Germany.\n\nAt the same time, the map of last weekend’s Polish election results looks almost identical to those from 2005 to 2020. And they’re correlated with historic patterns. The center-right party wins areas within the pre-1914 tsarist Russia empire, minus the large cities of Warsaw and Lodz. The center-left wins those areas within pre-1914 Germany. The strongest right areas are in southeast Poland, along the Ukrainian border, which were in pre-1914 Austria, the only one of those multi-ethnic empires with a Catholic monarch.\n\nAll of which is to say that the “metropole plus minority versus heartland” pattern does not apply everywhere, and history still has its claims on many voters. But we’re watching some new electoral history being made, with no clear end in sight.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The modern feminist movement began as a cry for liberation—yet in recent years, it seems to have circled right back to restriction. The script has flipped, and instead of championing real choice, mainstream feminism is now dictating which choices are acceptable, rewarding women not for excellence but for optics. \n\nMany women today feel pressured to conform to a political checklist—where individuality is erased in favor of identity boxes, be it by chasing a seat in the boardroom or posting about sourdough on Instagram. But quietly, a new form of femininity is rising. One that reclaims true power through merit, integrity, and earned opportunity. One that doesn’t shout—but instead leads with real talent. \n\nThis new approach is well exemplified by the current White House administration. President Donald Trump’s appointment of Karoline Leavitt as the youngest-ever White House press secretary is more than a historic move but a blueprint for this new approach to empowering women. At just 27, Leavitt is not only a trailblazer in her role in politics, but also a new mother—a dual role that has been championed and assisted by the White House and Leavitt’s family support system. \n\nShe now works alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, forming what many are calling the most female-led administration in modern political history, with one-third of Trump’s senior leadership team being women. And notably—they weren’t chosen to fulfill quotas but have robust careers qualifying them for these positions of power. \n\nIn his Women’s History Month address this year, Trump confirmed that this administration has “more women in our cabinet than any Republican president in the history of our country.” \n\nThis is what some are calling Opportunity Feminism—a cultural and political response to modern feminism that champions women’s advancement not through mandates, but through merit. Originally articulated by Karin Lips, founder of Network of Enlightened Women, it’s not about pushing men aside or checking boxes. It’s about placing capable women in positions of influence because they can, not because they must. \n\nContrast this with the Biden administration’s 2021 Executive Order mandating DEI benchmarks across all federal agencies. While intended to promote inclusivity, critics argue that these mandates have had the opposite effect—prioritizing identity over ability, as characterized by Kamala Harris’ drastic defeat. When representation becomes the end goal rather than the result of a fair process, women’s unique talents are often overlooked and in turn, demeaned. The original effort of giving women equal opportunity gets squashed. \n\nTake California’s SB 826, which required every corporate board to include at least one woman. On the surface, it sounded empowering. But in 2022, the law was ruled unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court, as it was found to violate the equal protection clause. The aftermath? Many women on boards were quietly labeled “diversity hires,” undercutting their contributions and feeding the very stereotype feminism was supposed to dismantle. Today, women occupy 32.75% of board seats in California—proving that many women rise without government mandates. \n\nGovernment intervention has too often become a crutch rather than a catalyst when it comes to modern feminism. Instead of opening doors for women, it’s built with artificial scaffolding—one that many women don’t want or need. And worse, it often fails to account for the real needs of working women. \n\nOver 41.4% of self-employed workers in the U.S. are women, yet many face regulations that prevent them from working at home or launching cottage-based businesses, despite the Home-Based Business Fairness Act. City licensing laws, zoning restrictions, and outdated labor codes conflict with this act and disproportionately impact mothers trying to raise families while contributing economically from home. Where’s the modern feminist outrage for them? \n\nThis is where fourth wave feminism has run its course and true empowerment lies—not in a headline, but in the everyday freedom to choose what kind of life a woman wants to build. As a small-business owner working from home, I may still face governmental barriers that hold me back, like occupational licensing laws that restrict job mobility, and others like me face regulations that prevent home-based businesses from thriving. And it’s not just a boardroom issue. It’s a kitchen table issue. A side-hustle-at-naptime issue. A build-a-legacy-on-your-own-terms issue.\n\nSo no, the future isn’t feminist in the way pop culture might define it. Instead, it’s fair, by allowing women to be truly valued for their contributions, not just the benchmark they meet. This not only allows for women to be recognized, but inspired to be called higher, no matter their passions or season of life-—whether that’s running a campaign, a company, or a kitchen. \n\nTrump’s countercultural approach to empowering women, by selecting women like Leavitt, Bondi, and Wiles based purely on merit, has the potential to create a ripple effect nationally. This differing approach to feminism should inspire legislation nationwide and allow for women to have thriving opportunities to support themselves and their families. In turn, women will aid in boosting our economies and nurturing future generations simultaneously, like only we can. \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

A major reason is that employers pocketed workers’ fair share of productivity increases. Wages used to rise when productivity did; if that had continued, workers’ wages would be 43% higher than they are today. \n\nYou won’t hear about this from President Trump. Instead, his villain is foreign trade, and his solution is to use tariffs to bring back blue-collar jobs. But tariffs won’t work quickly, because onshoring means building new factories, which takes years. And it may never happen. \n\nMeanwhile, tariffs threaten to take away the only real benefit workers got from globalization: cheap Nikes, T-shirts, and party favors. To add to that, the Trump administration is DOGE-ing away stability at the Veterans Administration and Medicaid, which middle-class and rural Americans rely on. \n\nIn short, the right isn’t doing right by Lunchpail Joe and Jane.\n\nBut neither is the left. Instead, it’s obsessing nonstop about Trump’s flouting of democratic norms — that’s all progressives want to talk about. Defense of democracy was a top priority for those who voted for Kamala Harris, but way, way down for those who voted for Trump.\n\nThe left also wants to talk about how DOGE is firing government workers, making professionals’ jobs unstable and nerve-wracking. \n\nWelcome to our world, say non-college voters. Thirty years ago, sales personnel at Macy’s had full-time jobs with benefits. Today, associates worry constantly about whether they will accrue enough hours to pay the rent, in jobs that typically lack health insurance. \n\nAs a result, many workers without degrees are working all kinds of hours. \n\nA 38-year-old construction worker described the impact on family life: “People can’t get or stay married because it takes so much effort to survive. My ex-fiancée said, ‘You’re never around.’ But I was working to get a better life for us. No one has time for their kids. It’s the American Nightmare.”\n\nDOGE is placing college-educated professionals where workers without degrees have been for decades — worried sick about how they’re going to support their families. Don’t expect workers to care. \n\nIn earlier eras, the left was focused on good jobs for blue-collar workers and universal programs to ensure stability for the middle class, like Social Security, Medicare, and VA home loans and college benefits. In the 1970s, the focus changed to prioritize issues of greater concern to liberal college grads: environmentalism, racism, and sexism.\n\nAs political priorities changed, so did “feeling rules” that set the parameters of our heartstrings. A good lefty should feel angst about climate change, the poor, LGBTQ+, racism, and immigrants. But blue-collar Americans who vote for Trump? They’re deplorable. \n\nIf you care deeply about people disadvantaged by race, gender, and country of origin — but ignore class disadvantage — then people disadvantaged by class will seek solace by flocking to those who channel their anger. In both Europe and the US, those who flock to the far right are middle-status voters in routine jobs, holding on for dear life and just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nA reality check: Democrats have generally done better for working people than Republicans. Obamacare is only the most recent example. \n\nThe Trump administration has cut funding to programs that underlie the stability of middle-class Americans, like the VA and Social Security, creating overly lengthy wait times. \n\nThis is what the left should be focusing on, not the defense of democracy. Americans who feel they’ve been screwed for the last 40 years feel democratic institutions haven’t delivered for them.\n\nIf Democrats are seen as defending the status quo, they won’t win over non-college voters who feel like the status quo isn’t working for them. And nearly two-thirds of Americans lack college degrees. Without them, Democrats can’t win elections.\n\nHere’s the bottom line. My message for Republican powers-that-be is a question: Does the current business climate, rife with chaos, instability, and the corrosion of both democratic norms and the US credit rating, really work for you? If you’d prefer a more orderly political and business climate, you need to deliver a stable, middle-class future for Americans without college degrees.\n\nMy message for Democratic powers-that-be is also a question: Do you want to win elections? If you do, you need to change policies and feeling rules to deliver both economic stability and respect for non-college voters. Because if you don’t, what you now see is what you’ll get. \n\nThere’s your coalition out of this mess. \n\nJoan C.

He referenced 10 to 20 specialist physicians.”\n\nBut the tests did not include any neurocognitive work, nor did Biden submit to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as Trump did in his first term, a two-minute screening comprising around 30 questions to test for signs of dementia, according to Obama’s ex-physician.\n\n“I have no doubt that President Trump aced it,” he said of the test, but said the current White House, in the interest of full transparency, should also release CT scans that were taken after the assassination attempt against the Republican candidate in Butler, Pa., last July.\n\nKuhlman added the Montreal Cognitive Assessment isn’t adequate to determine more serious mental slippage, one of the three main areas that medical professionals should be considering when evaluating the president, along with cancer and cardiovascular issues.\n\nMemory, reasoning, speed of processing and spacial visualization all begin to decline around the age of 60, he also said.\n\nO’Connor served as Biden’s doctor during his vice presidency, overlapping with Kuhlman in the White House medical unit.\n\nKuhlman said he “respects” O’Connor’s “medical judgment,” but also told The Washington Post: “Sometimes those closest to the tree miss the forest.”\n\nIn apparently his only media interview during Biden’s term, O’Connor insisted to The Post in July 2024 that the president’s cognitive health was “excellent” — days after being forced out of a re-election bid and replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris due to a dismal debate performance June 27.\n\nIn a break from his predecessors, Biden’s doctor never answered questions from the press in the White House briefing room but submitted annual physical reports that noted some physical ailments without addressing the president’s mental acuity, other than to say he was “fit for duty.”\n\n“The president doesn’t need a cognitive test,” claimed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a February 2024 briefing following what would be Biden’s final physical as commander-in-chief. “He passes a cognitive test every day.”\n\nWhite House visitor logs show the oldest-ever president did submit to evaluation from an expert in Parkinson’s disease and 20-year veteran of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Dr. Kevin Cannard, but O’Connor said the January 2024 meeting was part of Biden’s annual physical.\n\n“If somebody turns up a report that Kevin Cannard said he has Parkinson’s,” said Kuhlman, “then that’s a completely different story, but we have 14 years of Kevin Cannard evaluating him and that’s who I would trust.”\n\nO’Connor said that was part of his annual physical and ruled out a Parkinson’s diagnosis, though other doctors expressed skepticism.\n\n“I could’ve diagnosed him from across the Mall,” neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts told NBC in July 2024, pointing to Biden’s “rigidity,” “shuffling gait” and “slow movement.”\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Hur, who determined that Biden “willfully” hoarded classified documents after leaving the Obama White House, chose not to bring charges months earlier that year in February, in part because a jury would view the president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\nThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed O’Connor on Thursday to appear for questioning about the former president’s mental abilities on June 27.\n\nOversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) in a cover letter accompanying the subpoena suggested the doctor’s past “financial relationship with the Biden family” may have “contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden’s fitness to serve from the American people.”\n\nJean-Pierre, who left the Democratic Party and is publishing a tell-all book about the “broken” Biden administration, is also expected to be hauled in for testimony.\n\nDays before a book was set to be published alleging a vast cover-up of his decline during his last two years in the White House, Biden announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\nThe book, “Original Sin,” notes that O’Connor was reluctant to administer a cognitive test, according to co-authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.\n\nKuhlman said O’Connor had conducted tests for that kind of cancer between 2009 and 2014 when they served together in the White House, but it may not have been “worth doing in the next 10 years” based on the findings of that final exam, known as a PSA, in the vice presidency.\n\n“I hope that Kevin O’Connor had that conversation every year with his patient, Joe Biden, and documented that in the medical record,” he said. “If he did the PSA and chose not to release it, I don’t agree with that.”","summary":"\"Any

Lack of Scrutiny of Biden’s Mental Decline","text":"Piers Morgan Uncensored\n\nPIERS MORGAN: The presidential scandal on many sides is the biggest in United States history, Richard Nixon's role in the infamous Watergate break-ins. However, the shocking details revealed in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book on President Biden's cognitive decline whilst in office and the conspiracy to cover it all up, could now well rival it, or as I believe, even worse. Here's what Tapper himself said when I pressed him on it on Uncensored.\n\nJAKE TAPPER: It is a scandal. It is without question and maybe even worse than Watergate in some ways, um, because Richard Nixon was in control of his faculties when he wasn't drinking.\n\nMORGAN: Well, in this special edition of Uncensored, we've assembled some real political, academic and media heavyweights to debate the question, Biden or Nixon, who scandalized the US presidency more?\n\nChuck Todd, let me start with you. You've covered a lot of scandals in your time, a lot of presidencies in your time. I was genuinely fascinated when I pressed Jake Tapper, because there's a line at the end of the book, I'm sure you've read it, where they, they talk about this is not a Watergate. And they, they kind of leave it floating as whether they think it's better or worse. Jake actually conceded to me that actually he thinks it probably is worse. What is your view?\n\nCHUCK TODD: Well, I think we have to have proof that there was a belief of cognitive decline and intentional cover up, right? We're still not there. There's certainly plenty of evidence that he wasn't really up to doing the job, that he was going to struggle to have a second term, that his behavior in the first term was indicative of somebody that couldn't handle the modern rigors of the presidency. So if you look at the damage Donald Trump is doing to our current economy or the current relationships around the world, uh, do you hold Biden accountable for that? \n\nI know plenty of Democrats who do, right? So it's almost like every piece of bad information. That or bad decision making that Donald Trump makes only ratchets up the anger among some on the left at Joe Biden and his family's selfishness, but more importantly, the staff around, right?\n\nTo me, the scandal is the Democratic Party and the staff because you know who was screaming at the top of their lungs that they wanted different choices for presidents, the voters. They were ignoring the polling. They were ignoring what voters were actually saying, you know, to me that was the original sin of this mess. \n\nBut to equate it, look, I actually think the worst scandal of any president is, is what is Teapot Dome and Harding, although we, we may yet have any something that rivals both Watergate and Teapot Dome when this crypto thing collapses on the Trump family, but for now I'm not ready to say it's Watergate, but inside the Democratic Party, biggest scandal in their history, arguably in the modern era.\n\nMORGAN: And do you accept, Chuck, as Jake pretty much did and Alex did. The mainstream media in America, both television, cable, and newspapers and so on, just collectively massively dropped the ball with this, and that one of the reasons is that there clearly has been an inherent bias against Trump and pro pretty much anyone that might stop him pervading through the mainstream media, so there wasn't the intent perhaps to go looking for the real story as there might have been had it been Trump.\n\nTODD: Well, look, I always try to divide it in half because I don't accept the premise that a cable host is a journalist, right? And there was one cable host in particular that would attack members of the press, attack any columnist that came out and said, Joe Biden doesn't have it, he shouldn't run again.\n\nAnd so, but I accept the premise. Look, where I think the ball was dropped was the White House press corps in that building, right? That's where, you know, this is the conversation Jake and I have had, you know, and we've been in those chairs, you know, that's where you, sort of notice these things. Where's the president today? How come he's not coming to talk to us? That missing relentlessness.\n\nAnd I think that, you know, I, I joke Trump derangement syndrome is something that a lot of people have, right? It's not just people that are Trump opponents that have it. Trump fans sometimes have it, right? They think there's mystical powers in in sort of Trump derangement syndrome. But I do think there are a lot of people in that Biden White House and then some in sort of the intelligentsia of the press, not the day to day journalists who were looking at like, well yeah, Biden is struggling, but Trump's crazy, so the choice is kind of impaired Biden versus crazy Trump.\n\nSo it became sort of a, it was that became the rationalization. I'm not saying it was the right rationalization, but I don't think it was like a collective cover up more than it was sort of almost human response to geez, I have a bad idea over here and a worse one over there, which do I choose?\n\nJEFFERSON MORLEY: But Piers, maybe, maybe your question is, you know, which is the bigger scandal in terms of the president? Well, what's, which is the bigger scandal in terms of the press? You know, the press distinguished itself in Watergate and the press did not distinguish itself in this, so for the press, this is a bigger scandal than Watergate. \n\nPIERS: But this comes in the backdrop also, Chuck, of page 85 of the book, “a long time Biden aide, he just had to win that he could disappear for 4 years, he'd only have to show proof of life every once in a while.”\n\nI found that the most shocking thing I read in the whole book, and there were a lot of candidates. Just the fact that a long time Biden aide basically saying he could be a zombie, that we just shook into life with an electric bolt everywhere.\n\nTODD: Look, Pierce, I'm gonna, I'm gonna defend some members of the press in this because look, I was somebody that spoke out early questioning whether this was the case. I was interviewing Dean Phillips when other people at the organization that I was at was trying to get him unbooked from the shows when he was challenging basically on the entire premise this guy's not up to the job, right? That was the entire premise of the campaign.\n\nBut let's remember – I, I really think that the attempt to make this a media scandal is usually by folks who are trying to promote their own media. This is a scandal of the Democratic Party and this is where I do think that any Democrat that served in the Biden administration, should answer for this, should have to answer for this, and I think it's gonna have a hard time answering for this.\n\nI mean, I think this is a moment and, and what it is is you have a party that went three straight elections that they did not let their voters decide who the nominee was. The voters didn't make the decision in 16, Barack Obama did. The voters didn't make the decision in 2020, Jim Clyburn did. The voters didn't make the decision in 2024. Essentially Joe Biden did by giving, by giving the party Kamala Harris. \n\nSo this is a party that had a leadership atrophy and at the same time those that were sort of almost behaving like the old Soviet Union, which is, you know, the leader dies and everybody wants to keep their power and keep their influence. So I do think this scandal should be more laser focused on the Democratic Party.\n\nI think the press is again, I always look at the criticism of the press here. Um through the person that's making the criticism and I think in some ways there's a, there's almost an eagerness to blame the press without looking at actual who should be blamed here and it's the leadership and frankly the members of the Biden administration and the leadership of the Democratic Party who they're the ones that lied.\n\nLook, at the end of the day, no journalist is as good as their sources. The end of the day, the Democratic Party lied to the American people. The leadership of the party lied to the American people, and that's where the scandal should be centered.\n\nPIERS: Yeah, I largely don't disagree with you. I, I kind of think the bigger villains are the people in the White House who obviously knew for a fact what was actually going on with Biden. I, I do think the media are culpable too, and I do think if it had been Trump, there would have been an absolute frenzy. To get to the bottom of any cognitive issues if he was face planting left, right, and center.\n\nTODD: Is there a frenzy now though, Piers? We've got a president. If I told you a president doesn't sleep at night and instead tweets crazy stuff in the middle of the night, would you wonder if there was cognitive decline? Would you say, are they correctly covering this guy's manic behavior, because his behavior in office-\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nPIERS: Don't not talk at once. I would say to that I've known Trump 20 years and he's behaved in this kind of way for the entire time I've known him in various, he used to behave like-\n\nTODD: I’ve heard that defense for Biden, Piers. “I've known Biden 20 years. He's always been misspeaking and stuff,” so I'm just saying, well, I\n\n[Crosstalk]\n\nPIERS: I’m not saying there’s a difference. Here’s the difference, Chuck, I would day is that Trump makes himself always available. He's always doing two hour rally speeches. He's doing endless,huddles with the press, endless interviews. He's making himself-\n\nTODD: But if the words are crazy, does that make it better?\n\nPIERS: I think it's a, I think it's a different kind of thing. You could say that Trump's a bit crazy, but I don't think you see evidence of cognitive decline. There's not a lot of difference between Trump now than there was first time round in 2016-2017. To me, watching him, I just think he's the same guy. \n\nTODD: He’s a little slower, but yeah.","summary":"Former President Biden’s health decline had been an obvious issue throughout his presidential term, but more concerns have been raised for why the media didn’t cover it enough.

The behind-the-scenes documentary follows Trump's return to the White House - and in one scene, Brian can be seen alongside the then president-elect in a VIP box at the Army-Navy game. On that occasion, Brian book a photo with Trump and confessed to a group of surprised women in the box that he had voted for the Republican. At that point, the women asked him: \"You mean, you're not voting for Kamala ?\" to which he replied: \"I just can't do that.\" Brian explained: \"And then, one of them leaned in further, and said, 'Are you voting for Trump?' And I said, 'I am. I swear!'\" As part of the series, the producer, known for working on films such as A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13, confessed the reaction he received made him feel like he was \"getting cancelled.\" The New York Times reported that Brian explained his Trump vote by saying: \"As a centrist, it was because I could feel and see Biden's deterioration and the lack of direction in the Democratic Party at that time.\" The second season of Art of the Surge, produced by former Tucker Carlson Tonight executive producer Justin Wells, is currently streaming on Fox Nation. Before voting for Trump, Brian reportedly donated to Kamala Harris in the past, and also raised money for other Democrats. After his confession emerged, fans took to Reddit to share their reactions - and while some agreed with his thought process, others said the fact that he no longer agreed with the direction of Democrats doesn't justify voting for Republicans, as there are \"other choices\" too.

Big publishers generally consider taking on only writers already represented by agents, which makes literary agencies a front line of sorts. As the person opening the mail, I was the front line of the front line. I saw the true democratic range of the slush pile, full of pitches that no one had vouched for and, for the most part, that no one ever would.\n\nOne thing I learned: There’s a lot of writing out there that you, the reader, just don’t need in your life. Some of it is inaccurate. Some of it is self-serving. Above all, a lot of it is just not interesting enough to find many readers: generic, predictable, telling you something you’ve already heard. Editorial gatekeepers get a bad name, but from another point of view, they are heroically holding back a tidal wave of crap while, ideally, letting the good stuff through.\n\nThat early lesson in the value of editorial judgment came back to me this week, when The New York Times reported on an effort taking shape at The Washington Post under its owner, Jeff Bezos, and its publisher, Will Lewis. Through a project internally called Ripple, Post executives intend to dramatically expand opinion writing at the paper, creating an offering outside the paywall that will include content from partner news organizations and Substack. More controversially, a final phase of the plan will employ an AI writing coach called Ember to assist “nonprofessional writers” in submitting op-eds.\n\nThis effort was not exactly news to me. Until January, I was a senior editor at the now almost completely hollowed-out Opinions section of the Post. Along with others from across the organization, I’d participated about a year ago in a brainstorming session on what would become Ripple. At that point, it was clear already that Bezos was interested in massively scaling up the output of our section, perhaps on the model of Amazon—which had scaled up and up for years before turning a profit. It had also become clear that the way to management’s heart was to cite artificial intelligence as the means to any end, a special technological sauce to be drizzled on everything.\n\nAlthough I’d started out skeptical, by the end of the session, I was convinced that the Post did have the potential to reach a larger audience. Readers want locally relevant news, but local outlets are succumbing one by one to the dynamics of a centralized online market for both content and advertising. If we were so determined to scale up, why couldn’t the Post partner with existing local news sources, offering them a tech back end, a network effect, and a cut of resources while tapping a much larger pool of locally written and edited work?\n\nSome elements of those ideas seem to have trickled into the Ripple project. But another vision was presented at the brainstorm too, the spark of what is now called Ember. The concept seemed to be that anyone could write a good op-ed, if only they had coaching from an AI editor. As a newsroom AI strategist explained the premise to the members of the group—most of whom had never faced an inbox of op-ed submissions—I felt filled with dread, because the content that this program would yield sounded dreadful.\n\nWhen you consider pitches, as an editor of opinion content, you look for surprise: insightful analysis of new information, diagnosis of and perhaps solutions to an unappreciated problem, a personal tale told in a way that makes you laugh or tear up, an original way of experiencing something familiar. Generative AI based on large language models, by contrast, is optimized to produce writing with the opposite qualities. It is a predictability machine, operating by asking what word is most likely to come next in a sentence based on all the other text that has fed into its training data. This doesn’t mean that AI can’t be a useful tool for certain kinds of writing and editing, but it does mean that an AI editor will probably exacerbate exactly the qualities that make the opinion slush pile so slushy in the first place. What Ember seems likely to produce, in other words, is the kind of writing I have spent my whole career trying to hold back.\n\nThere are good uses for AI at a newspaper, which is why it’s so puzzling that everyone keeps trying to make AI do not those tasks but the ones it is bad at, the ones that we humans most want to keep for ourselves. Just to take one example, much of the Washington Post archive is inaccessible via search; why not use AI to crawl, tag, and make discoverable this huge body of work?\n\nMaybe because that’s not showy enough. Everyone these days seems to want to make AI the writer, the editor, the creator, the star. But within media, at least, that’s not the best use case for this technology. Instead, we should be using these powerful tools for scut work, data crunching, even brainstorming—not as a substitute for the editorial judgment and critical thought that make writing worth reading.\n\n“The values of The Post do not need changing,” Bezos wrote when he bought the newspaper, in 2013. “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.” That declaration became harder to trust last year, when Bezos blocked the Post editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, on the pretext that he had suddenly decided that making presidential endorsements gave the impression of bias—only to cheer the “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory” of Donald Trump just a few weeks later.\n\nThe proposed use of Ember casts doubt on the commitment to readers too. If Bezos is really interested in scaling up opinion writing beyond the scope of human editors, what he’s essentially doing is either starting a social blogging network—something like Medium, Reddit, or Substack—or a contributor platform of glorified press releases, such as the one abandoned in 2018 by HuffPost as a drag on its brand. As the New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen wrote on X, “When I was editor of HuffPost we shut down our contributor platform because it was bad for our journalism and it did not contribute significant traffic or revenue.” If Bezos wants to run a social network, perhaps to compete with Elon Musk for clout, that’s fine. But let’s not pretend that it’s journalism, or that it’s good for the Post and its readers.\n\nAs recently as 2021, when the paper had already been under Bezos’s ownership for years, the Post was touting a plan to add 41 new editors to the newsroom. “This expansion demonstrates anew that The Washington Post is an ascendant news organization, with boundless ambitions and a growing capacity to meet them,” wrote then–Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and her team.\n\nThat memo might as well be from another universe. Today, the Post’s owner seems to have lost track of those ambitions, or replaced them with other ones. But if the journalistic or commercial health of the paper as an institution still matters to him, I hope he will realize that using AI to scale up the slush pile is a poor idea. If that’s really Bezos’s dream for the nation’s readers, he should pursue it separate from the Post, rather than risk undermining the editorial tradition that has made the paper great.","summary":"Reducing the role of human editorial judgment is the last thing opinion journalism needs.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/washington-post-ai-opinion/683064/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3NyILIeUVw0CuiSrVeiCa217U9A=/0x169:4994x2770/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/2025_06_06_Wapo_Slushpile/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 13:30:00","author":"Amanda Katz","authors":["Amanda Katz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":329081646,"title":"JD Vance stays silent as Musk and Trump clash publicly — could he be the ultimate winner in this feud?","text":"JD Vance silence on Musk feud raises big 2025 questions — is this the most Game of Thrones move in US politics?- JD Vance, the vice president under President Donald Trump, is quietly navigating a political storm that’s pitting two of the most powerful figures in America—Trump and Elon Musk—against each other. And while their public fallout has grabbed headlines, Vance’s calculated silence is drawing just as much attention. Known for his combative defense of Trump, Vance is now choosing diplomacy over drama, fueling speculation that his endgame might involve much more than just loyalty. Let’s break down what’s going on—and why it matters for the future of the Republican party, the tech elite, and the White House. Why is JD Vance staying silent in Trump vs Musk feud? JD Vance’s quiet response to the Trump vs Musk feud is out of character. The Ohio senator-turned-vice-president has a history of jumping into political fights—especially when Trump is under fire. But when Musk unloaded harsh criticism on Trump on May 23, calling him ungrateful and even connecting him to the late Jeffrey Epstein, Vance didn’t rush to defend the president. For a man who once told Vice President Kamala Harris to “go to hell” over Afghanistan and criticized Pope Francis indirectly over deportation policies, this unusually calm tone raised eyebrows. Is JD Vance taking orders—or playing his own game? According to The Independent, there may be a simple reason: Trump asked Vance to stay diplomatic when it comes to Musk. That would explain his low-key tone. But insiders believe there’s more at stake here than just loyalty to his boss. Vance’s political career has been closely tied to the tech billionaire circle, especially Peter Thiel, who backed his 2022 Senate campaign with $15 million. Thiel also reportedly introduced Vance to Trump. Elon Musk and David Sacks, part of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” were also instrumental in promoting Vance’s rise in Republican circles. The same trio allegedly lobbied for Vance to become Trump’s running mate in 2024. So when Musk publicly endorsed the idea of impeaching Trump and replacing him with Vance, replying “Yes” to a tweet suggesting the switch, it wasn’t just political noise—it was a signal. And it placed Vance in a tight spot. Could JD Vance really replace Donald Trump? That’s the big question. In today’s political climate, Elon Musk’s influence in the Republican party is stronger than ever. He spent $395 million backing Republicans during the 2024 election cycle. If Musk throws his full weight behind Vance, it could fast-track the vice president’s path to the top job—especially if Trump stumbles legally or politically. Vance’s critics argue he’s always been a man with two faces: a former Trump critic who once called him noxious and reprehensible, now his most loyal second-in-command. But loyalty in Washington has a short shelf life. And Trump, known for firing even his closest allies, may not appreciate someone who’s seen as too close to the billionaire tech elite now turning on him. Is Vance’s silence a calculated climb to power? Political observers are comparing Vance to Petyr Baelish, better known as Littlefinger from Game of Thrones—a man who saw chaos not as danger, but as opportunity. “Chaos is a ladder,” Littlefinger said. And Vance may be climbing it. By staying quiet, he avoids alienating Musk, who publicly supports him, while still appearing loyal to Trump. It’s a risky game, but one that could pay off if Trump falters and the Republican party needs a fresh face to take over. This approach also keeps him out of direct conflict—something that could damage his chances in the long run. For now, he’s simply letting Trump and Musk fight it out while maintaining ties with both. What’s next for JD Vance and the Republican party? It’s clear that JD Vance is more than just a vice president. He’s a central figure in a high-stakes power struggle between traditional Trump loyalists and a new wave of tech-aligned libertarian conservatives. His silence may seem passive, but it could be strategic. Trump has spent years eliminating “traitors” from his inner circle. If Vance wants to stay in the game—and maybe even win it—he needs to walk a careful line. So far, he’s doing just that.FAQs: Q1: Why is JD Vance silent on the Trump-Musk feud? JD Vance may be staying quiet to balance loyalty to Trump and support from Elon Musk. Q2: Could JD Vance replace Trump as president? Elon Musk’s public support hints Vance could be a future presidential pick if Trump stumbles.","summary":"JD Vance silence on Musk feud is turning heads as the vice president chooses not to defend Donald Trump in his explosive clash with Elon Musk. Known for fiercely backing Trump, Vance’s quiet stance suggests a deeper strategy—possibly eyeing future power. With ties to Musk, Peter Thiel, and the “PayPal mafia,” his silence may be a bold political move. As Musk publicly signals support for Vance, Trump may see betrayal.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk traded barbs on their respective social media websites on Thursday and into Friday, as social media users happily looked on. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before Trump and Musk, who are not known for making and keeping allies, had a spectacular falling out. The inciting incident turned out to be Musk’s criticisms of the Trump-backed “Big Beautiful Bill,” the House’s spending bill that slashes the safety net in order to provide $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts to the rich. \n\nAt first, Musk’s comments were mild, saying the bill doesn’t reduce the deficit and “undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.” But he went fully nuclear on Thursday. Musk, who already claimed he won the election for Trump, posted to X to accuse the president of being in the “Epstein files,” or a list of people with suspicious associations with the financier, who died in jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. (Trump and Epstein socialised in the 1980s and 1990s, but Trump has denied ever being on his private plane or island, where some of the alleged sex crimes took place.) Trump, in turn, suggested on Truth Social he would cut Musk’s government contracts, while the president’s allies even started talking about deporting Musk.\n\nAt this point, it seems clear that the once-budding bromance is toast.\n\nMany people reacted with schadenfreude to the world’s weirdest celebrity breakup. But it also had a few Democrats seeming ready to slide into Musk’s DMs. \n\n“We should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,” Representative Ro Khanna (Democrat, California) told Politico on Thursday. “A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.”\n\nOther Democrats also signaled that the rift could benefit their party. “I’m a believer in redemption, and he is telling the truth about the legislation,” Representative Ritchie Torres (Democrat, New York) said, while still cautioning that Musk’s slashing of the federal government is still an open wound. “There are Democrats who see his decimation of the federal workforce and the federal government as an unforgivable sin.”\n\nMaking the enemy of your enemy your friend is not always an outlandish idea. There have been multiple reports that even some in the Trump administration were fighting with Musk behind the scenes, making it seemingly feasible to build a new alliance between him and Democrats. And Musk is known for dumping truckloads of money into politics when he’s on your side. He was, by far, the largest Republican donor in the 2024 cycle, contributing more than $290 million to Trump’s campaign. Then in April, Musk made a Wisconsin Supreme Court race the most expensive judicial race in US history by spending $25 million to boost Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate. (Schimel lost by 10 points.) \n\nBut there are strange bedfellows, and then there’s extending an olive branch to someone as toxic as Elon Musk.\n\nFor one thing, Musk is deeply unpopular with basically everyone. An April ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that Musk only had a 35% approval rating nationwide. It was even worse among the people who the Democratic Party represents — just 4% of those voters approve of Musk’s works. In fact, he’s so disliked that it seems likely Trump can spin their very public split into a good thing for him politically.\n\nAnd when you boil it down further, nearly everything Musk has done as a part of the Trump campaign, and later, the Trump administration, is anathema to what Democratic voters believe. \n\nMusk’s purchase of Twitter, which he renamed to X, in 2022 began the South African billionaire’s journey to becoming Trump’s closest ally and biggest donor. When a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man attempted to assassinate Trump in July 2024, Musk solidified his support by officially endorsing him. Musk appeared at Trump rallies and spent the final weeks of the campaign spreading conspiracy theories and throwing money around in order to send Trump back to the White House. \n\nThen at Trump’s second inauguration, Musk was widely condemned for doing a Nazi-like salute while speaking to supporters. This didn’t stop Trump from giving him a semi-official role in government, with the power to set up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and hire a cadre of inexperienced employees to ostensibly cut waste from the government. DOGE staffers accessed private data, fired critical employees and were named in multiple lawsuits — many of which are still ongoing today.\n\nMusk has repeatedly shared antisemitic posts on social media, including claiming “Hitler didn’t murder millions of people.” He’s a proponent of a racist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims that people of colour are executing an intentional plot to eliminate white people. While the Trump administration has ramped up deportations, blocked migrants from receiving asylum and used ugly rhetoric about immigrants in general, Musk was able to convince the president to admit white South Africans as refugees, claiming there is a “white genocide” happening in South Africa. \n\nThen there’s the fallout from the cuts his team at DOGE has made across the federal government. Musk spearheaded the effort to cut funding for essential agencies, impacting everything from the IRS to HIV prevention to natural disaster response to Social Security. The entire US Agency for International Development was effectively dismantled, which led to the deaths of children abroad and put millions of lives at risk. Across the federal government, everyday people, including Trump supporters, were thrust into unemployment as DOGE officials decided their roles weren’t important. \n\n“I want a big tent party too, but Elon’s primary policy goals don’t fit within the tent,” Democratic pollster Evan Roth Smith of Slingshot Strategies told HuffPost. “There’s nothing around Social Security or Medicare cuts that fits within the tent of the Democratic Party at all.”\n\nOver the last five months, Musk has hardly signalled that he’s ready to pivot to liberalism. In fact, up until this week, he remained by Trump’s side, appearing at Cabinet meetings (despite not being a Cabinet member), irritating those in Trump’s inner circle and parading around the White House with one of his children. Musk’s time at the White House was scheduled to come to an end at the end of May when his 130-day “special employee” status expired. \n\nThe Democrats are in a bit of a political wilderness, and it can be tempting to look for a powerful new ally.\n\nAfter losing to Trump, the infighting has been continuous, with many placing the blame on former President Joe Biden for failing to step aside sooner, with others pointing at former Vice President Kamala Harris for running a campaign that wasn’t capable of defeating Trump.\n\nBut Democrats should remember that their attempts to reach across the aisle and find common ground are not what their base is asking for. \n\nA March NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats did not want the party to compromise with Trump — even if it means getting nothing done in Congress.\n\n“There’s no reason to take Elon back,” Roth Smith said.\n\nKevin Robillard contributed reporting.","summary":"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, left, and President Donald TrumpThis article is part of HuffPost’s biweekly politics newsletter. Click here to subscribe.\n\nAfter months of political bliss, it seems as if the president and the world’s richest man are ready to call it quits.

According to the Pride Pulse Poll from Gravity Research, “senior corporate leaders are recalibrating both their public and internal strategies as pressure from the GOP and conservative activists grows.”\n\nThese adjustments are a result of both President Donald Trump’s win and the Republican congressional majority. As stated in its key findings, “39% of companies plan to reduce Pride-related engagement in 2025. Notably, no respondents reported plans to increase engagement. [And] 61% of executives cite the Trump administration as the top reason for rethinking Pride strategies, with conservative activists and GOP policymakers close behind. Employee pressure, once a key influence, has waned.” \n\nThe fact that nearly 40% of companies are reducing Pride-related engagement points to a significant cultural change. The corporate push over the past decade or more has been conspicuous in its overreach. Customers and clients have been inundated with Pride Month observations to the point to where it alienates those who don’t readily partake in its celebration. Companies can’t afford to sustain that, no matter the industry.\n\nWhat’s more, Trump’s reelection was a clear indication that a majority of Americans didn’t want to move in a progressive direction, as former Vice President Kamala Harris would have done. As noted in the poll results, right-leaning activists and legislators also influenced the shift. Notably, employee pressure to deliver a more robust Pride Month expression appears to have gone down. All of these are positive trends.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Pride and its accompanying celebrations and corporate cheerleading will ever go away. But the idea of demanding allegiance to a particular social cause is weakening. By and large, Americans don’t care if Pride celebrations exist. We just don’t want to feel strong-armed into vocal acceptance or participation. And we want children to be left alone. In fact, leaving all of us alone sounds preferable. But far too many times, corporate desires to appease a vocal portion of the consumer base mean we are not left alone. \n\nCompanies and the LGBT community as a whole would do well to pay attention. Consumers are choosing not to involve themselves in Pride Month. The electoral victories of last November remain a clear indication of where the country prefers to go, at least for the foreseeable future. If companies and the LGBT community choose to ignore these indications, it will harm their separate goals.\n\nCorporate Pride Month pullbacks are a step in the right direction.

Control of its governorship, its Legislature, its congressional delegation and its presidential electoral votes had shifted back and forth as the mood of voters oscillated.\n\nHowever, by the turn of the century, Democrats had captured all the levers of political power. And over the last 25 years their dominance has grown ever stronger, interrupted only by the performative seven-year governorship of action film actor and nominal Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe disappearance of inter-party competition means Democrats have been free to implement their responses to multiple issues spawned by the state’s economic and cultural complexity — such things as erratic water supply, low-performing public schools, homelessness, housing shortages, and chronically high levels of unemployment and poverty.\n\nIn general, Democratic governors and legislators have believed that throwing money — lots of it — at those and other problems would result in tangible improvement. An obscure chart in the state budget reveals how much money.\n\nIn 2000, the state’s population was 34 million and has since grown by 15% to just over 39 million. According to the state Department of Industrial Relations, California’s consumer price inflation has been close to 100% in that period.\n\nHowever, California’s general fund — which pays for the state’s core programs, such as education, health care and prisons — has tripled from $78 billion during Democrat Gray Davis’ governorship to $229 billion in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget. The increase has been financed largely by taxing Californians’ personal incomes, which also have tripled from $1.14 trillion to $3.5 trillion.\n\nGeneral fund spending per capita is 2.5 times what it was in 2000, rising from $2,296 to $5,835. And the number of state employees — 311,239 in 2000 — is now 40% higher at 436,435.\n\nAnyone would be hard-pressed to argue that those increases by Democratic officeholders have produced breakthroughs on the state’s most-pressing issues. Shortages and the costs of housing, homelessness, low academic scores and other existential issues continue to plague the state.\n\nIf the effectiveness of governance has not improved during the last quarter century of one-party dominance and high levels of spending, California’s economic and civic ails may reflect something else, perhaps a lack of creativity or cohesive civic leadership, or maybe a governance structure based on a 19th century model that doesn’t suit a 21st century reality.\n\nThe current blame shifting and finger pointing between state officials, especially Newsom, and city and county governments over accountability for homelessness may be a clue that something is lacking. It’s as if everyone knows they can’t fix the problem so they have resorted to face-saving.\n\nThe process of choosing a successor to Newsom will kick off with the June 2026 primary designating two finalists for the general election four months later.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, six of the self-proclaimed candidates for governor — four Democrats and two Republicans — answered questions about how they would govern in a forum sponsored by the state Chamber of Commerce at its annual economic summit.\n\nTheir polite banter revealed overall agreement on what some of California’s issues are — particularly the state’s high living costs — but was short on concrete proposals. The event, known in the political trade as a beauty contest, also was overshadowed by former Vice President Kamala Harris’ absence and coyness about running for governor.\n\nWhether she’s in or out, the next governor will have a full plate of unresolved issues that need different approaches if California is to be — despite evidence to the contrary — still governable.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Party's 21st century governors and legislators believed throwing money at problems would result in tangible improvements.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/07/walters-how-much-california-government-has-exploded-under-democrats-control/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SJM-Z-OPED-MATHEWS-1119-2.jpg?w=1024&h=727","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 10:45:59","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":329050928,"title":"FLASHBACK: Musk accused Trump, GOP leaders of not wanting to cut spending — here's where they said they would","text":"Elon Musk’s fiery feud with President Donald Trump spilled onto the top Republicans in Congress, where the tech billionaire questioned if their zeal to cut spending had disappeared. Musk launched into a social media assault this week against Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill,\" and accused Republicans of crafting a \"disgusting abomination\" full of wasteful spending. What started as a rant against the bill turned into pointed attacks against Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. 'HE'S NOT A BIG FACTOR': TRUMP'S SENATE ALLIES DISMISS ELON MUSK'S CALLS TO 'KILL THE BILL' The tech billionaire and former head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lamented the bill as not cutting deep enough into Washington’s spending addiction. The House GOP’s offering, which is now being modified in the Senate, set a goal of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Musk set a benchmark of finding $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse to slash with his DOGE initiative, but fell far short, hitting only $160 billion in his four-month stint as a special government employee. ELON MUSK WARPATH AGAINST TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' RATTLES HOUSE GOP Still, he came with receipts, questioning whether Trump, Thune and Johnson were actually committed to making deep cuts. Below are moments from the campaign trail and recent months compiled by Fox News Digital where the trio affirmed their commitment to putting a dent in the nation’s nearly $37 trillion debt. Trump on the trail in 2024: 'We will stop wasteful spending' A common theme for Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign was to go after the Biden administration, and his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for \"throwing billions of dollars out the window.\" The then-presidential candidate vowed that should he win a second term, his incoming administration would halt wasteful spending. \"We will stop wasteful spending and big government special interest giveaways, and finally stand up for the American taxpayer, which hasn't happened since I was president,\" he said. \"We stood up. Our current massive deficits will be reduced to practically nothing. Our country will be powered by growth. Our country, will be powered by growth, will pay off our debt, will have all this income coming in.\" GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT Thune renews promise to cut spending with Trump's 'big, beautiful bill': 'It does everything we set out to do' Thune has agreed with his colleagues in the House GOP that the tax cut package needs to achieve steep savings, and believes that the Senate GOP could take those cuts a step further. After the bill advanced from the House last month, the top Senate Republican re-upped his vow to slash federal funding. \"It does everything that we set out to do. It modernizes our military, secures our border, extends tax relief and makes permanent tax relief that will lead to economic growth and better jobs in this country, and makes America energy dominant, coupled with the biggest spending reduction in American history,\" he said. \"So those are our agenda items, and that's what we campaigned on. That's what we're going to do.\" Johnson after the House's passage of the budget plan: 'What you're going to see is a continuing theme of us identifying waste, fraud and abuse in government' Johnson had to strike a balancing act in the House to cobble together enough support behind the legislation, and struck deals and satisfied concerned lawmakers across the spectrum of the House GOP while still setting a goal of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Rooting out waste, fraud and abuse has been a continued mantra of the speaker and his allies.

They’re scaring their audiences into believing that the “country is in peril” because Trump is taking America down an “authoritarian path” that will keep him in “power for life.”\n\nThis past month saw CBS 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley scare students during a commencement address as he told them the “country was in peril,” as the “rule of law,” and “freedom of speech” were “under attack” from the Trump administration.\n\nMSNBC’s Rachel Maddow insisted that the President wanted to “stay in power for life.” NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker actually asked Trump to his face if he was leading America down an “authoritarian path.” \n\nCelebrities also cursed Trump, some even did it from overseas. Singer Bruce Springsteen blasted the “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration” from a concert stage in England. Rosie O’Donnell (who fled to Ireland) took to her TikTok account to warn that Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” was going to kill “millions.”\n\nThe following are the most obnoxious outbursts from leftist journalists and celebrities over the last month:\n\nKristen Welker to Trump: Are You Taking the Country Down an “Authoritarian Path?”\n\n“People who have lived in countries like the Philippines, Hungary, Russia, they look at some of your actions, going after civil service, going after universities, law firms, the media, they say it’s out of an authoritarian playbook. What do you say to those who believe you are taking the country down an authoritarian path?”— Moderator Kristen Welker to Donald Trump as aired on NBC’s Meet the Press, May 4. \n\nTrump Trying to “Stay In Power For Life?”\n\n“He [Donald Trump] doesn’t think there should be elections and they are consolidating power, they’re disempowering Congress, ignoring Congress, defunding agencies or closing agencies. That’s Congress’s job, that’s not the President’s job. When they are defying court orders, that’s them saying the courts don’t have authority over the president, that’s consolidating all the power in one man, that’s authoritarianism, and that’s what you do when you don’t ever want to have an election because you want to stay in power for life, and that is what they are trying.”— MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, May 7. \n\nScott Pelley Scares Students: “Our Country Is In Peril” from Trump\n\n“Our sacred rule of law is under attack. Journalism is under attack, universities are under attack, freedom of speech is under attack. An insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak in America....In a moment like this, when our country is in peril, don’t ask the meaning of life. Life is asking, what’s the meaning of you?”— CBS’s 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley during a commencement speech at Wake Forest University, May 19. \n\nAre We “Living In a New McCarthy Era” of “Fear and Repression?”\n\n“Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to be one of the adults in the room. He has failed at that miserably, as you saw there from Senator Van Hollen saying he regrets voting for him. Do you share his sentiment, given everything that has happened in this country, that we are living in a new McCarthy era where fear and repression are out there right now in our society?”— Host Aymen Mohyeldin to Rep. Greg Casar (D) on MSNBC’s The Weekend:Primetime, May 24.\n\nChristiane Amanpour: “I Literally Prepared to Go to America” As If It Was “North Korea”\n\n“When I went to Harvard to give this speech, and it was just a few days ago, last week. I must say I was afraid. I’m a foreigner, I don’t have a green card, I’m not an American citizen, I’m fairly prominent, and I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea.”— PBS host Christiane Amanpour on her podcast Christiane Amanpour Presents: The Ex Files with Jamie Rubin, June 3.\n\n“The Blood” of Terror Attack Is “On the Hands of Donald Trump” \n\n“You just round up all the people who you think look like threats. That is remigration. That is ethnic cleansing. That is Donald Trump’s presidency. And that, because you no longer bother to look for people who are guilty or who might be planning heinous acts, you just look for their skin tone and their names, that is why the blood of Boulder, Colorado, is on the hands of Donald Trump.”— Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann on his Countdown podcast, June 3.\n\nTrump’s “Fundamental Attack On Our Constitution” \n\n“I think what the President is doing, it is a fundamental attack on our Constitution, on the foundation of this country.….When you have a President of the United States who is making it his mission to attack the free press, we should all be concerned, whether we are at PBS or whether we are at MSNBC, because he’s focused on us too.”— Washington Post associate editor/PBS contributor Jonathan Capehart on PBS’s News Hour, May 2. \n\nDefiant David Brooks: What News Organization is More “Straight Down the Line” Than PBS? \n\n“If you think the PBS is biased, compared to who? Name one news organization in America — and I shouldn’t be defending us. I get paid by PBS. But I’m going to do it — who’s more straight down the line than we are.”— New York Times columnist/PBS contributor David Brooks on PBS’s News Hour, May 2.\n\nDonald Trump Has Turned GOP Into a “Kleptocracy”\n\n“The Republican party right now is a kleptocracy. He [Donald Trump] has not turned the country into a kleptocracy yet....This is worse than Teapot Dome. This is worse than Watergate.”— Former NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd on CNN Saturday Morning Table for Five, May 10. \n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos Never Said This About Biden Family Inc.\n\n“The scale is staggering. President Trump and his family are making hundreds of millions, potentially billions of dollars, as Trump and his administration take official actions that benefit contributors and investors….This unprecedented money-making by a sitting president and his family summarized by critics like The Atlantic’s David Frum. ‘Nothing like this has been attempted or even imagined in the history of the American presidency….The brazenness of the self-enrichment resembles nothing seen in any earlier White House. This is American corruption on the scale of a post-Soviet republic or a post-colonial African dictatorship.’”— Moderator George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week, June 1. \n\nJonathan Capehart: Shouldn’t We Be Worried About Trump’s “Mental Acuity?”\n\n“If President Trump is mentally anguished over the editing of a television [60 Minutes with Kamala Harris] interview, why shouldn’t I be concerned about his mental acuity in the office right now and all the crazy stuff he’s doing?” — Washington Post associate editor/PBS contributor Jonathan Capehart on MSNBC’s The Weekend, June 1. \n\nJeffrey Goldberg: It’s Not that We Covered-Up for Biden, It’s That the Audience Is Stupid\n\n“I don’t understand how this narrative is developed….that the media was covering for Biden. I think what might be going on here is a lack of understanding about how reporting works.”— Host Jeffrey Goldberg on PBS’s Washington Week with The Atlantic, May 23.\n\nTrump Released Biden Memory Lapse Tape to “Distract” From “Disastrous First 100 Days”\n\n“It’s clear to me that President Trump released the [Special Counsel Robert Hur/President Joe Biden] tape because he’s trying to distract from his disastrous — unprecedented disastrous first 100 days.” — CBS News political contributor/former VP Kamala Harris communications director Ashley Etienne on NBC’s Meet the Press, May 18.\n\nKatie Couric: “There’s No Such Thing as True Objectivity”\n\n“Pointing out the facts and what is really happening is automatically interpreted as being biased, right? And, and of course, I think there’s no such thing a true objectivity, but having said that, — you know I really struggle with that.”— Former NBC’s Today show co-host and CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric on Next Question podcast, May 15. \n\nHow Can American Catholics Support a President Who is “Antithetical” to “Teachings of Jesus Christ?”\n\n“What do American Catholics do when they have an American pope who speaks - you know - the teachings of Jesus Christ….and yet they’ve been supporting a man [Donald Trump] who is antithetical to all of those things?” — Washington Post associate editor/PBS contributor Jonathan Capehart on PBS’s News Hour, May 9. \n\nDavid Brooks Likens Musk to Pol Pot, Mao & Stalin: His “Legacy” Is “Millions” Dead \n\n“There are mass murderers in the world, Pol Pot, Mao Zedong, Stalin. We don’t have anybody on the list from America. And I don’t think it’s the same as committing the kind of genocide they did. But by taking away that [USAID] agency and being at least semi-responsible for the deaths of probably, by the end of this, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, that’s Elon Musk’s legacy.”— New York Times columnist/PBS contributor David Brooks on PBS’s News Hour, May 30.\n\nSunny Hostin: Elon Musk’s Cutbacks Took “300,000 Lives” Mostly “Children”\n\n“The damage that he did was just really incredible. He slashed 250,000 federal employees, more than 8,500 contract, more than 10,000 grants and his cutbacks on medical research cost the live – for the foreign aid, cost 300,000 lives mostly children. That’s the damage that Elon Musk did.”— Co-host Sunny Hostin on ABC’s The View, June 4. \n\nWhoopi: Why is It “Important to Know” About Biden’s Decline Now?\n\n“So should anonymous sources who talked to [Jake] Tapper have spoken up about their concerns while he [Joe Biden] was in office - while he was in still in office? And my other question is, why is this important to know now?”— Co-host Whoopi Goldberg on ABC’s The View, May 20.\n\nDean Obeidallah: “They Want Trump As a Dictator”\n\n“This really is a push and pull between two competing visions of America. One that we believe in is freedom. The United States of America with due process and their vision, which is an autocracy and that really — what we’re dealing with, or easier than that, a dictatorship. They want Trump as the dictator of the United States, and we all have to bow down to him.”— Comedian/MSNBC contributor Dean Obeidallah on MSNBC’s Velshi, May 24.\n\nBruce Springsteen Bashes Trump’s “Treasonous Administration” \n\n“In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.”— Singer Bruce Springsteen live from the Co-Op Live stage in Manchester, England on May 14.\n\nRosie O’Donnell: “Millions” Are Going to “Die Early” from Big Beautiful Bill\n\n“Millions of people are gonna go hungry. Millions of people are gonna die early for not getting their medication. Millions of people are going to suffer as a result of the big, beautiful bill….This is the most blatantly corrupt thing that Mango Mussolini has ever come up with.”— Comedian/former ABC’s The View co-host Rosie O’Donnell on her TikTok account, May 27.\n\nLeslie Jones Rants Against “Racist” and “Evil” “Trump Folks” \n\n“I got a problem with these Trump folks….It’s not that they’re corrupt, although they are. It’s not that they’re evil, although they are. It’s not that they are women-hating, racist, unqualified dickheads, who couldn’t run a Dunkin’ Donuts without burning it down. No, my problem is these people are goofy-ass mother[bleep]! I thought, I thought Reagan was bad, but at least he knew how to talk. I thought Bush was bad, but at least he has a hilarious name! But what do we have now? JD Vance, RFK Jr., and Elon Musk. I cannot believe America is going to be ended by these [bleep] loser incels!”— Comedian and former Saturday Night Live cast member Leslie Jones on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, May 14. \n\nKen Burns: PBS “Puts the Us in the U.S.”\n\n“The enrichment that PBS has brought to my life, to our collective lives is just undisputable. I think PBS is part of the pursuit of happiness machine….This is the Declaration of Independence applied to broadcasting….It’s just one of our crown jewels, like higher education that you mentioned at the beginning, like our national parks. This is who we are. It puts the us in the U.S.”— Documentarian Ken Burns on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, May 2.\n\nTrump “Might Try to Destroy the World” Before He Dies\n\n“I do think it’s a reasonable theory that Donald Trump is not unlike the spouse of someone who leaves him, perhaps for another. Who then murders their former partner because if they can’t have her, nobody can. And I think Donald Trump and his solipsism may have that relationship with the world. And that this destruction is in part a power play. And also a literal intention of his final out.…I think he might try to destroy the world before he ages out of life.”— Actor Sean Penn on the Jim Acosta Show podcast, May 1.","summary":"Leftist journalists remain in a constant state of absolute hysteria over President Donald Trump.

Elliot Crossan asks: does this mark the beginning of the end for Trump 2.0? And might we hope for the same fate to befall the NZ Coalition Govt?\n\nJanuary 2025. The richest man in the world walks into the White House as advisor to the newly-elected President of the United States. A right-wing demagogue with an axe to grind and a tech billionaire who so desperately wants people to like him. Together, with Musk’s vast fortune and Trump’s fanatical base of supporters, they could remake America in their image. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nTrump is no stranger to dramatic fallings-out with officials and advisors. His first term featured a rotating cast of characters who would come and go at a dizzying rate. The President takes glee running his administration like a reality show, knowing that the whole world has no choice but to watch.\n\nThe over-inflated egos of Trump and Musk can both be seen from space. Both are used to getting what they want, and both throw very public tantrums when they can’t get it. Trump encouraged a fascist mob to overthrow the US government when he lost the 2020 election; Musk appears to be utterly incredulous about the amount of backlash his political actions have generated, unable to comprehend the idea that other people disagree with him. Two egomaniacs trying to share the spotlight is never a good idea.\n\nYet just a couple of months ago, this relationship seemed too big to fail. It cannot be overstated how much firepower Musk’s backing leant to Trump’s electoral prospects; to a man worth hundreds of billions of dollars, throwing millions upon millions at election campaigns is as easy as buying a new coat. Musk spent an eye-watering $277 million on Trump’s successful bid for a second term, and very much believes he is responsible for Republican victories in 2024 congressional elections as well as the presidential race.\n\nWhilst ultra-wealthy elites usually prefer to manipulate politics from the shadows, the Tesla CEO was enthusiastically outspoken in his support for the Republican nominee. Musk’s endorsement came in the immediate aftermath of the attempted assassination of Trump in July, and the South African-born billionaire later joined the once-and-future President at a series of campaign rallies. Musk was seen jumping around the stage in excitement and openly handing out bribes to voters in swing states.\n\nOnce Trump was back in the White House, Musk’s financial heft became a threat hanging over every Republican Senator and Member of Congress: thinking of disobeying the White House’s agenda? Musk will throw millions at your primary challenger in the midterm elections. Trump’s cult-like following among the Republican faithful already makes it very difficult for any GOP lawmaker to oppose the President; liberal hopes of “sensible Republicans” reigning Trump in rarely materialise in reality. Republican majorities in the House and Senate may have been small going into 2025, but the combination of Musk’s war-chest and Trump’s base appeared to quash any threats to party unity. Add into the mix a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and the President was empowered to act in open defiance of the usual checks-and-balances built into the US Constitution.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of June, and the unholy alliance of Donald Trump and Elon Musk is dead in the water. The prelude to this catastrophic breakdown in relations began in early April when Musk cautiously distanced himself from the President’s tariff regime. Around the same time, Trump stopped constantly name-dropping Musk in press conferences and Truth Social posts. Then at the end of May, Musk left his role as a White House advisor due to the 130-day limit on special government employees not appointed by Congress. An amicable press conference was held to mark the end of Musk’s tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAfter departing the administration, Musk abruptly turned on Trump and launched a scathing attack on the President’s proposed budget legislation — which is officially entitled “One Big Beautiful Bill.” This budget reconciliation bill is the lynchpin of Trump’s domestic economic agenda, and will require approval from 50 out of 53 Republicans to pass through the Senate. The President hopes to have it on his desk ready to sign by the Independence Day celebrations on 4 July. Musk labelled the bill a “disgusting abomination” and pointed out that it will explode the federal deficit.\n\nYesterday, this feud exploded into the headlines. Musk escalated his criticisms of the Big Beautiful Bill by digging up and retweeting Trump’s comments from 2012-2013 about the need to balance the federal budget. Trump responded by claiming that Musk knew the details of the bill before he left the administration and didn’t object until he found out that tax credits for electric vehicles were being cut; the President then threatened to cut subsidies to Musk’s companies in order to reduce the deficit. Trump expressed disappointment in Elon; Musk claimed responsibility for Trump’s 2024 victory and called his former ally ungrateful. Trump retorted that he had asked Elon to leave the White House as he was “wearing thin;” Musk then dropped “the really big bomb” (his words) — that the reason the Epstein files haven’t been made public is because Trump is mentioned in them. Musk did not seem to realise the implication of his own statements — that he was directly responsible for the election of a sexual predator.\n\nMusk asked his followers if America needed “a new political party” representing “the 80% in the middle,” and called for Trump to be impeached. The latter option would pave the way for Peter Thiel protégée JD Vance to take over as president; Vance’s ascension would represent an unprecedented coup on behalf of the Silicon Valley elite.\n\nThe Tesla CEO appeared to calm down later in the evening. When fellow billionaire Bill Ackman tweeted that Trump and Musk are “stronger together than apart” and urged them to make peace, Musk replied “you’re not wrong.” Perhaps he should have considered this before picking a fight with the famously prickly, petty, vindictive President.\n\nThere were rumours today that Musk wanted a phone call with the President. A peace offering. Trump doubled down on the feud. “You meant the man who has lost his mind?” was the President’s response when asked about potential reconciliation with the Tesla billionaire. “I’m not even thinking about Elon. He’s got a problem. The poor guy’s got a problem.” The White House confirmed that Trump plans to sell his Tesla Model S — the very same car he showed off in a press conference in March. It remains to be seen whether or not the President will retaliate directly against Musk’s companies; but it is never wise to pick a fight with an authoritarian leader obsessed with asserting his own dominance over others.\n\nTesla stocks fell sharply on Thursday as a result of this falling out, but recovered somewhat on Friday. Trump’s political capital, already bruised by his humiliating u-turns over trade policy, has also taken a major blow. Ackman is pointing out the obvious — neither side wins from this Big Beautiful Break-up. However, initial reports suggest that the Republican Party on the whole is falling in line behind its President rather than taking the side of the richest man in the world.\n\nTwo events in early April foreshadowed the breakdown of the Trump-Musk alliance. Both may spell further danger on the horizon for the MAGA project as a whole.\n\nMusk Humiliated in Wisconsin\n\nThe first of these events was a Supreme Court election in the state of Wisconsin, which became the most expensive judicial race in American history after Musk and other right-wing billionaires poured in millions behind the campaign of conservative candidate Brad Schimel. Musk alone contributed $25 million, with a total of nearly $100 million being spent in the race, the majority favouring Schimel. Musk resorted to open bribery just as he had done during the presidential election, handing out two $1 million checks to voters and claiming that the “future of civilisation” was at stake. There had been a liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court prior to the election; Tesla’s business interests in the state were reliant on this majority being overturned.\n\nThe results came in on 1 April, and pundits were surprised by the wide winning margin — 55-45% in favour of liberal candidate Susan Crawford. Shockwaves reverberated throughout the Republican Party as a dawning realisation struck: in spite of giving him a colossal funding advantage, Musk’s public support of Schimel ended up hurting the conservative nominee rather than helping him.\n\nThe world’s richest man had become a toxic brand. His favourability numbers in opinion polls were falling sharply; Tesla sales were in trouble, particularly in Europe and Canada; voters in red states as well as blue states were furious at the attacks on social programmes and consumer protections unleashed by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk was suddenly so unpopular that his support was costing Republicans elections; as a result, his ability to blackmail every Republican in Congress by funding primary opponents became a paper tiger.\n\nThis embarrassing blow undermined Musk’s bargain with Trump significantly. It also demonstrated a growing trend that the left across the world must take note of: billionaires buying elections is not popular. Railing against corporate greed and taking on the billionaire oligarchy is popular.\n\nPerhaps it finally dawned on Musk why his fellow billionaires prefer to fund political campaigns from the shadows, through dark money that is untraceable to the source. People don’t like their future being dictated by a tiny elite who are openly rigging the system in their own interests.\n\nCampaign donations by wealthy individuals and corporate investors increased dramatically in the 2023 NZ election, overwhelmingly favouring the three right-wing parties that would go on to form the Coalition. Labour and other opposition parties have two choices. One is to bend over backwards in an effort to appease the top 1%, trying to out-compete National, ACT and NZ First for a share of campaign contributions. The Democrats and the US and the Labour Party in the UK have tried this — they have sold out to the rich and are deeply unpopular as a result.\n\nThe other option is to overtly campaign against the corruption inherent in an electoral system where the rich can buy elections; to fight back, and to call for an end to the corporate domination of our society. Musk’s humiliation in Wisconsin proves that this strategy is viable in America, where the campaign financing system is orders of magnitude worse than it is here in Aotearoa.\n\nWe must fight back before we allow this country to go further down the same path. With the Coalition imposing austerity on public services, US-style privatisation threatening our health sector, corporations openly bribing ministers for favourable fast-track approvals, and David Seymour attempting to overhaul our regulatory system in the interests of multinational corporations, we are already on a slippery slope.\n\nA Band of Warring Brothers\n\nThe second event that spelt the beginning of the end for Musk and Trump’s love-in was the fallout from the Liberation Day tariffs. Trump’s declaration of a global trade war initiated a rapid stock market crash, and the run on US Treasury bonds that followed caused panic across the world. Signs of Musk’s displeasure emerged within the week. He called for a free trade zone across Europe and America, and labelled White House trade advisor Peter Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks.”\n\nIn my April essay regarding Liberation Day, I argued that there was method to Trump’s madness. The tariffs may have been a massive blunder, but to dismiss Liberation Day as a random act of idiocy with no plan behind it was foolish. The trade war was part of a chaotic strategy to reorder the world economy in the interests of the US empire and its corporations.\n\nThe fatal flaw inherent in this strategy has already emerged. To reorder the world economy by creating short-term pain and instability would have required committed buy-in from the dominant sections of the US ruling class. Trump and his officials massively overestimated the support they held amongst the Silicon Valley oligarchy.\n\nMusk was the most vocal of the tech billionaires in his support for the President, and is now the most vocal in turning against him. Yet it wasn’t only Musk who broke with tradition by aligning themselves with Trump — Amazon mogul Jeff Bezos, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and the CEOs of Apple, Google and other tech giants lined up together at the President’s 2025 inauguration ceremony. While Musk now openly denounces Trump’s agenda, no doubt the rest of the tech oligarchy is similarly questioning the wisdom of the administration which has deliberately threatened their global supply chains and tanked the stock values of their companies as part of a grand strategy that does not appear to be working.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to convince capitalists to forego short-term profits for any cause. Even in this instance, when the cause is to try and reassert the dominance of US corporations in the face of increased competition from China, it’s a hard sell for Trump to make to CEOs and shareholders when their bottom lines are threatened. The ruthless competition imposed by the market makes it hard for individual capitalists to sacrifice immediate advantage even to advance their shared interests in the long-term.\n\nKarl Marx described the ruling class as “a band of warring brothers.” In times of political, social and economic crisis, the internal rivalries within the ruling elite can threaten the stability of their entire system.\n\nIn 2025, the US empire is entering the worst crisis of legitimacy in its history. The dollar-based global financial system that has been the backbone of the world economy since 1944 has been imperiled by Trump’s recklessness. The run on US Treasury bonds in the wake of Liberation Day was unprecedented. A “sell America” trend developed on global stock markets, threatening the safety of what was once the safest asset in the world. Trump responded to market madness a week after Liberation Day with his 90-day pause to some tariffs; yet the signs of investor panic have not gone away.\n\nTrump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” has been labelled a “big beautiful bribe” by many. It is an attempt to buy the loyalty of the capitalist class by extending the historic tax cuts implemented in 2017 by the first Trump administration. These tax cuts — which overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy — are set to expire at the end of 2025 if the President’s budget reconciliation fails to pass.\n\nThe bill in its current form will throw millions more Americans into poverty thanks to cuts to food stamps and Medicaid. Clean energy subsidies are set to be cut during a climate crisis. Despite these spending cuts, the combination of the tax cut extension alongside an additional $150 billion in defence spending means that the bill will add an estimated $2.6 trillion to the US national debt. With a sell-off of US Treasury bonds already increasing borrowing costs for the most powerful nation on earth, the passage of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” may threaten to send the country into a full-blown debt crisis.\n\nWhen an empire is in deep crisis, a stabilising figure is required to try and steady the ship. A leader who can unite rival factions of the ruling class behind their agenda, rally confidence in the system and placate the population at large, with concessions to popular demands if necessary. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the perfect example of such a figure — he served as President from 1933 until 1945, led America through the Great Depression and World War II, and staved off the threat of working class resistance with his New Deal policies which created jobs and a welfare system to support those in need.\n\nAdmittedly, in the Roosevelt era American power was yet to reach its height, and FDR was a product of an ascendant US empire. American political, economic and military dominance were already on a downward trajectory before Trump rose to power, and were likely to continue trending down regardless of the actions of any president. Nobody can hold back the tide of history. Trump is the product of terminal American decline.\n\nThe Trump-Musk alliance entered office and immediately launched an historic attack on the remnants of the New Deal. The administration’s policies have both destabilised the world economy and caused greater hardship for working people across America who were already suffering from a cost-of-living crisis. Neither the capitalist class nor the working class benefits from the economic mayhem being unleashed by the combined effects of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Liberation Day tariffs and the spectre of the Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nTrump and Musk’s partnership lasted less than five months. The two most powerful men in America are already at each other’s throats. This is no accident — it is merely the most blatant example of ongoing strife within the American ruling class.\n\nThe Democrats are showing no signs of producing a figure able to unify the American nation and stabilise the global capitalist system underpinned by US hegemony. Anemic and unable to offer anything except increasingly desperate calls to return to the status quo of the 1990s, the official opposition to the Trump administration looks no more capable of resolving this crisis.\n\nIts strategy may be fatally flawed, and its flailing actions are clearly worsening the situation, but at least the Trump administration is willing to take radical measures to try and solve the problems faced by the US empire. The Democrats on the other hand ruthlessly bludgeoned Bernie Sanders’ 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, and in doing so shot down any hope of meaningful reform that would benefit the American working class. Their priority was to defend the status quo at all costs, in the interests of the more cautious sections of the ruling class.\n\nBoth parties went into 2024 headed by geriatric old men who were utterly out of touch with reality. President Biden only ended his reelection campaign — with great reluctance — once his rapid cognitive decline became obvious through his excruciating debate performance against Trump. Once Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic presidential nominee, she ran a campaign that completely ignored the concerns of working class voters and paved the way for Trump’s return to power.\n\nOut-of-touch elites fighting amongst themselves. Working class discontent going ignored by the powers that be. The rise of a authoritarian demagogues. Increased competition from emerging powers. Failed attempts to win overseas conflicts. This is how empires fall.\n\nWill the Coalition Experience Its Own Break-up?\n\nThere are some parallels to the Trump-Musk dynamic within the right-wing Coalition which currently governs Aotearoa. Winston Peters has always been a nationalistic demagogue, and whilst he used to be fairly tame by Trump’s standards, he is increasingly moving away from the centre-ground ‘kingmaker’ role he used to play and towards overtly right-wing populist politics. His vicious personal attacks on Green and Te Pāti Māori MPs are part of a strategy which relies on transphobia and race-baiting. NZ First second-in-command Shane Jones has been just as bad, lashing out at climate activists who oppose the mining and fossil fuel industries. The recent polling increase for NZ First, with Peters also surging in the Preferred Prime Minister stakes, is a warning sign that this strategy is paying off — especially in comparison to the usual trend of NZ First falling below the 5% threshold after entering government.\n\nOn the other hand, David Seymour and the ACT Party adhere to libertarian ideology championed by Musk and the Silicon Valley oligarchy. The Ministry for Regulation and the Regulatory Standards Bill represent attempts to take a chainsaw to supposed bureaucracy and “red tape,” just as Musk tried to do. Like Musk, the ACT Party are staunch advocates for free trade and fiscal conservatism; Musk and Seymour both oppose tariff barriers on principle and wish to radically reduce government spending and government debt.\n\nPeters began his political career as an acolyte of Robert Muldoon, the Prime Minister whose protectionism, deficit spending, authoritarianism and demagoguery made him Aotearoa’s very own Trump back in the day. Yet NZ First has not kicked up much of a fuss against the Coalition’s agenda of austerity and free trade.\n\nToday’s National Party is much more aligned with free market philosophy than it is with the legacy of Muldoon. National remains the most moderate of the right-wing parties and is the largest by far; Luxon and Willis appear quite happy to let Seymour’s more radical party behave as the advance guard for their shared agenda of cuts, privatisation and a redistribution of wealth towards the super-rich.\n\nWe cannot rely on a homegrown repeat of the Trump-Musk feud to bring down this government. The ruling class of this country remains united in its support for free trade, free markets and fiscal conservatism. There is no support base at this stage for NZ First to embark on a Trump-style offensive championing protectionism and deficit spending.\n\nWhilst there will be increased attempts by ACT and NZ First to differentiate themselves from National and from each other in the lead up to the 2026 election, none of the three Coalition partners benefit from bringing down the government early or triggering a snap election. For Peters or Seymour to have a motive to take such radical action, they would need good reason to believe that making a major gamble was the only way to either maintain their positions of power going forward, or gain significantly more power from the fallout. The situation would have to change markedly for either scenario to become plausible.\n\nIf we want to bring down this government, we must fight them. The Coalition might collapse of its own volition, but we cannot rely on that possibility. Fighting the Coalition means fighting their agenda of cuts and privatisation, and it means pointing the finger squarely at the corporations and wealthy individuals who profit from these policies at the expense of the vast majority of the population.\n\nResisting the rise of oligarchy, in both America and Aotearoa, is the only way forward.\n\nElliot Crossan is a socialist writer and activist from Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland.

He reiterated his intention to investigate multiple contracts involving Musk.\n\n‘We’ll take look at everything,’ Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ‘It’s a lot of money.\n\nHe continued: ‘It’s a lot of subsidy … so we’ll take a look… only if it’s fair… only if it’s to be fair for him and the country… ‘\n\nTrump’s focus on subsidies indicates that he intends to challenge tax credits for electric vehicles like those from Musk’s company, Tesla. This stance is part of the discussions in the House-approved “big, beautiful bill.”\n\nSince their conflict began, Trump and his supporters have suggested that Musk opposed the bill because it reduces these subsidies. However, Musk has claimed he does not rely on them.\n\nAt another point Trump disavowed knowledge of calls for probes of Musk – after his longtime ally Steve Bannon, a Musk adversary, said Musk should be probed or even deported.\n\n ‘I had no idea there were any… I’ll let them speak for themselves … I have no idea,’ Trump said. \n\nIt had been 24 hours since he addressed his extraordinary break with his former ‘first buddy’ who used to accompany him to Mar-a-Lago and who Trump invited to cabinet meeting and hosted the office along with Musk’s child, ‘little X.’ \n\nAt times Trump appeared to want to tamp down the talk of the feud – despite escalating it with threats and ignoring advice to set up a phone call to settle it.\n\n‘Honestly I’ve been so busy working on China… working on Russia… working on Iran.. I’m not thinking about Elon musk .. I just wish him well,’ Trump said.\n\nAnd he won’t be demanding Musk return the gold colored key he presented him with in the Oval Office just days ago.\n\n‘No I don’t take things back,’ Trump said.\n\nHe dodged a question about dumping his new $80,000 Tesla. ‘I hope he does well with Tesla,’ Trump answered. \n\nTrump held his events – including signing an executive order on drones in the U.S. – behind closed doors. Then, he toured a golf course at Joint Base Andrews in a golf cart while trailed by aides and Secret Service agents.\n\nHe ignored shouted questions about his relationship with the world’s richest man while leaving the White House. \n\nIt wasn’t until he boarded Air Force One en route to his Bedminister, New Jersey golf club that he finally spoke about the simmering feud that has driven down Tesla’s stock price and prompted speculation about big changes in the space industry as well as talk that Musk’s billions in government contracts could be under threat. \n\nOn Thursday Trump and Musk took part in a spectacular public spat, which included cameos by dead serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and anti-Semitic rapper Kanye West. \n\nThe fallout between Trump and Musk – who were political allies for a little less than a year – started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans’ ‘big, beautiful bill,’ arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, on Thursday, when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, he was asked about Musk’s recent criticism. \n\nFrom there the dam broke. \n\n‘Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more, I was surprised,’ Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry – not over the bill ballooning the deficit – but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX’s government contracts.\n\n‘And you know, Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they’re having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,’ Trump said. ‘I know that disburbed him.’ \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX. \n\n‘He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I’m sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn’t think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,’ Trump continued. ‘We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don’t have to appoint a Democrat.’ \n\nMusk posted to X as Trump’s Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n‘Whatever,’ the billionaire wrote. \n\n‘Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,’ he advised. \n\n‘In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!’ Musk continued. ‘Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.’ \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world’s richest man – him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican’s campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk’s help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn’t choose the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, ‘I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.’ \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n‘Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,’ Musk claimed. \n\n‘Such ingratitude,’ the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n‘Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,’ Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went ‘CRAZY!’\n\n‘Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!’ Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla’s government contracts. \n\n‘The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!’ Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n‘This just gets better and better,’ he wrote. ‘Go ahead, make my day …’\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would ‘begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.’\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station – and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n‘Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,’ West wrote.\n\nAnd Musk threw the Epstein bomb. \n\n‘@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,’ Musk wrote. ‘Have a nice day, DJT!’ \n\nEpstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n‘Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,’ Musk added. \n\nTrump didn’t directly respond to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk’s Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: ‘This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.’\n\n‘The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,’ Leavitt added. \n\nTrump didn’t directly respond to Musk’s Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the ‘big, beautiful bill.’ \n\n‘I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,’ Trump wrote. ‘This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.’ \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk’s Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nA source familiar pointed out to the Daily Mail that ‘everyone knows President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club.’\n\n‘The Administration itself released Epstein files with the President’s name included. This is not a new surprise Elon is uncovering. Everyone already knew this,’ the source continued. \n\nThe source also mused, ‘If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hangout with him for 6 months and say he “loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?”‘ \n\nIt was less than a week ago that Trump gave Musk a golden key and a DOGE send-off from the Oval Office.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump addressed questions regarding his ongoing public dispute with Elon&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Comments on Growing Tensions with Elon Musk and Hints at Possible Action first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-comments-on-growing-tensions-with-elon-musk-and-hints-at-possible-action/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-breaks-silence-on-escalating-feud-with-Elon-Musk-and.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 08:38:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":329049194,"title":"Trump orders investigation into Biden administration's autopen use","text":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when Biden administration staff used an autopen to sign the former president's name on official documents, alleging that Biden might not have known or approved of their actions.\n\nThe inquiry represents an escalation in Trump's animosity toward and legal action against former President Joe Biden, who vehemently denies the allegations that he didn't know what executive orders or pardons were signed during his term.\n\nSIGN UP HERE to get PhillyVoice's newsletters delivered to your inbox \n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Biden wasn't fully cognizant during the end of his administration.

Not just by the talent and energy the 75-year-old poured into a three-and-a-half hour set at Anfield. \n\nBut his unflinching humanity, uncompromising principles, undying passion for the underdog, and unquenchable optimism in his fellow humans. All articulated in his utter despising of Donald Trump.\n\n“The America I love and have sung to you about for so long, a beacon of hope for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration. Tonight we ask all of you who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices, stand with us against authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.”\n\n That was how he opened the show, and throughout it, to much cheering and applause, he peppered his rousing back catalogue with fierce attacks on “an unfit President ” and a “demagogue”. \n\nIt felt more like a political rally than a pop concert, and, magnificently, it has truly riled the demagogue. After similar rhetoric in Manchester last month, the Great Man-Child called Springsteen “a pushy, obnoxious JERK” and accused him of treachery, wailing “this dried-out prune of a rocker ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the country”.\n\nThankfully he won’t. And it’s a joy to behold. Rather than phoning in his greatest hits and soaking in adulation as his bank account swells, he is channelling raw anger and urging his audience to join in his joyous rage.\n\n I only wish some of Britain’s musical legends like Sir Mick, Sir Rod, Sir Elton and Sir Macca were equally as bold and used their platform to challenge Establishment injustices, instead of bathing in the reflected glory of -knighthoods and not rocking the boat. \n\n Springsteen’s stance takes real courage, exemplified in the kickback he is facing from sections of his blue-collar fanbase. Last week, in his home state of New Jersey, a Springsteen tribute band called No Surrender was dropped by a venue for fear of a MAGA backlash. His critics say it’s cheap posturing. That he’s a bad loser who, like the man he attacks, refuses to accept the will of the American people. That he should take a look at all the luvvies who came out for Kamala Harris last year and realise that celebrity endorsements are now dead.\n\nBut they are wrong. Anyone who hears Bruce express his pain over what is happening to his beloved country knows it’s genuine. Besides, he’s been sticking up for the underdog all of his career. During the 1985 miners’ strike he anonymously handed over a cheque for $20,000 to a support group.\n\nAs for those questioning his loyalty to America, what can be more patriotic than calling out the fake -patriotism of a phoney President who has never cared about anyone but himself?\n\nA chancer whose real aim as CEO of the US is to spread his brand to every corner of the world and redistribute wealth further towards his billionaire backers at the expense of the poor.\n\nTrump and his people, The Boss told us on Wednesday, “have no concern or idea what it means to be deeply American. Despite its faults it is a great country. And we will survive this moment”. With true patriots like Springsteen around, America has a chance.","summary":"A Springsteen concert felt more like a political rally than a pop concert, Brian Reade says, with his fierce attacks on Donald Trump.

Another 28 percent said they were unsure.\n\nDuring Thursday's dust-up, Musk suggested he had more political staying power than Trump, pointing out the president had just three and a half more years in office. \n\nMusk also said he backed Trump being impeached - and replaced by 40-year-old Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nOn Thursday Trump and Musk took part in a spectacular public spat, which included cameos by dead serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and anti-Semitic rapper Kanye West. \n\nThe fallout between Trump and Musk - who were political allies for a little less than a year - started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans' 'big, beautiful bill,' arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, on Thursday, when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, he was asked about Musk's recent criticism. \n\nFrom there the dam broke. \n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX's government contracts.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disturbed him.' \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX. \n\n'He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I'm sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,' Trump continued. 'We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat.' \n\nMusk posted to X as Trump's Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote. \n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised. \n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued. 'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.' \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man - him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican's campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk's help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.' \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n'Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,' Musk claimed. \n\n'Such ingratitude,' the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n'Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,' Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went 'CRAZY!'\n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts. \n\n'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.

'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station - and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n'Broooos please noooooo.

One by one, tech billionaires close to Musk who had either backed Democrats or avoided the political scrum put their money and their time behind the former president's bid to reclaim the White House. But the meltdown of the relationship between Trump and Musk on Thursday has thrown that cosiness into question. In the coming days, the billionaires who followed Musk to Washington may be forced to decide whose side they are on in this suddenly personal fight. For Silicon Valley, what appeared to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to team up with decision-makers in Washington is looking precarious. Musk was the keystone of the tech industry's relationship with the Trump administration. Without him, it could be up to lesser-known figures, such as venture capitalist David Sacks, a close friend of Musk who has become the Trump administration's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, to maintain those ties. This is a tale as old as time, said Venky Ganesan, a partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. Like Icarus, Elon is finding out that if you fly too close to the sun, your wax melts and you crash. Even before Musk announced that he was leaving Washington, there were growing questions about what exactly the tech industry's embrace of the Trump White House was accomplishing. The yearslong attempt by the Justice Department to break up Google? Still on track. The Federal Trade Commission's pursuit of Meta, Facebook's parent company? That just wrapped up in a Washington courtroom and is now in the hands of a federal judge. Tariffs on imported goods that could hurt device makers like Apple? Trump seems more determined than ever to see them through. Much better to be aligned with principles than personalities, Ganesan added. A lesson tech titans might want to learn. Representatives for the White House and Sacks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk did not return an email request seeking comment. Throughout 2024, many of the tech industry's boldface names threw their support and hundreds of millions of dollars behind Trump, mainly because he promised to back away from regulating the cryptocurrency industry and keep the federal government's hands off artificial intelligence. Venture capitalist partners Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz surprised many when they announced they were supporting Trump, though Horowitz changed his mind when former Vice President Kamala Harris, a personal friend, entered the race. (He said, however, that their venture firm still endorsed Trump.) Many of their colleagues, such as the tech mogul hosts of the popular All-In Podcast, which includes Sacks, also endorsed Trump. For them, Trump has kept up his end of the bargain. He has not only pushed for the deregulation of crypto markets, his family's company has jumped headfirst into them. And Trump's domestic policy bill that angered Musk even contains a provision that would block states from regulating AI. Other tech industry leaders have not had as much luck. At Trump's inauguration, Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Musk formed a Mount Rushmore of tech bosses in the crowd behind the new president. Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder who once raced to the airport in San Francisco to protest the travel restrictions of Trump's first administration, was also there. So was OpenAI's Sam Altman, a fellow travel restriction protester. Jensen Huang, CEO Nvidia and relative newcomer to presidential circles, did not attend the inauguration but traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to talk AI chips. Their results have been mixed. For a while, Cook appeared to have talked Trump out of the tariffs on Chinese imports that would have badly hurt Apple. But Trump changed his mind and created a different set of tariffs that directly targeted Apple. Huang has been blocked from selling chips to China over national security concerns but was awarded a license to sell hundreds of thousands of chips in the Middle East in data centre deals that also brought Altman's company to the table. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told a room of AI leaders, lobbyists and lawmakers this week that the administration would invite foreign investment into AI data centres, reversing Biden administration restrictions. He was speaking at an event hosted by Washington AI Network and sponsored by Meta, Amazon, OpenAI, Microsoft and TikTok, where he announced the administration would rename the U.S. Safety Institute to the centre for AI Standards and Innovation to emphasize growth of the industry over regulation. America must lead in AI, and that means embracing innovation while securing our infrastructure, Lutnick said. The new centre for AI Standards and Innovation will help ensure developers have clear, trusted guidelines -- without unnecessary regulation -- so we can stay ahead in the global AI race. But if Musk's all-out hostility toward Trump continues, it is difficult to say how Trump will treat Musk's companies and Silicon Valley. Until this past year, Trump showed more interest in old industries like steel and cars and was critical of the tech industry's biggest companies -- as well as a few of the smaller ones. Many Trump supporters are still suspicious that Silicon Valley's peacemaking is just opportunism, and would be happy to see him become more hostile. Musk's rift with Trump could directly affect efforts in Washington to benefit his companies. At the Federal Communications Commission, SpaceX has intensely lobbied for more access to spectrum for its Starlink satellite wireless service. FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a vocal supporter of Musk's satellite strategy and his business. At a SpaceX launch in November, Carr posted a photo of the launch with the words, It's time to unleash America's space economy. Musk saw an opportunity after his Starlink satellite service was shut out of the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program created during the Biden administration, which favored fiber internet service over satellite in hard-to-reach rural areas. Now much of that is up in the air, and Trump has threatened to target the many government contracts held by Musk's companies. This has escalated very quickly, so this rupture absolutely could matter, said Blair Levin, of New Street Research and a former chief of staff to the FCC. Musk's satellite ambitions are tied up in policy debates in federal agencies, Levin said, and politically it is very easy to tweak things in ways that are very unhelpful to Musk. In an update on the social platform X on Thursday afternoon, Musk posted a video of Trump standing next to a bright red Tesla, parked in front of the White House.

Historically, only about one third of United Nations member states have ever had a woman serve as head of government.\n\nAccording to UN figures, women hold just 23% of ministerial positions globally in 2025. The same study notes women are more often assigned portfolios related to social affairs, while defence, foreign affairs, and finance remain predominantly the purview of men.\n\nIn terms of wealth, women constitute approximately 13.3% of the world’s billionaires. According to Forbes’ rich list published this year, out of 3,028 billionaires globally, only 406 are women.\n\nLet’s put the diversity, equity and inclusion argument to one side for a moment. Clearly, that was beyond our abilities to properly implement, probably because it was men responsible for it.\n\nPerhaps we don’t even need to try that hard. Perhaps we should just seek to put the best people in the jobs with the most power. Perhaps, after many millennia of evidence, men are not those people. Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out.\n\n“Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.

However, she endures in my mind as the antithesis of what we have come to expect from Trump, Putin, Biden, Boris Johnson, Churchill, Blair, Kennedy, Clinton, Netanyahu, Musk, Bezos et al.\n\n If we flipped it entirely, we should really let the children be in charge.\n\nWe’d eat nothing but Nutella with every meal, but you’d be guaranteed wars would quickly end, the hungry would be fed, and there’d be no such thing as genocide.\n\nWhat is absolutely certain is that they could not do any worse.","summary":"Perhaps the best people to be in power are those who do not seek it out, writes Colin Sheridan","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-41646655.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9305/4652506_5_seoimage1x1_a3405101438743348c3060dbc4e420db.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-07 00:00:00","author":"Colin Sheridan,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Colin Sheridan","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":328916196,"title":"Trump breaks silence on escalating feud with Elon Musk and teases his next move","text":"President Donald Trump finally took questions on his stunning public feud with Elon Musk, after laying low for most of Friday – while repeating his threat to probe a litany of Musk contracts.\n\n'We’ll take look at everything,' Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. 'It’s a lot of money.\n\nHe continued: 'It’s a lot of subsidy … so we’ll take a look… only if it’s fair… only if it’s to be fair for him and the country… '\n\nThe line on subsidy suggests Trump will continue to push to go after tax credits for electric cars such as the Musk-owned Tesla. That language features in the House-passed 'big, beautiful bill.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of their feud, Trump and his allies have said Musk turned on the bill because it cuts the subsidies. Musk has said he doesn't need them anyway.\n\nAt another point Trump disavowed knowledge of calls for probes of Musk – after his longtime ally Steve Bannon, a Musk adversary, said Musk should be probed or even deported.\n\n 'I had no idea there were any… I’ll let them speak for themselves … I have no idea,' Trump said. \n\nIt had been 24 hours since he addressed his extraordinary break with his former 'first buddy' who used to accompany him to Mar-a-Lago and who Trump invited to cabinet meeting and hosted the office along with Musk's child, 'little X.' \n\nAt times Trump appeared to want to tamp down the talk of the feud – despite escalating it with threats and ignoring advice to set up a phone call to settle it.\n\n'Honestly I’ve been so busy working on China… working on Russia… working on Iran.. I’m not thinking about Elon musk .. I just wish him well,' Trump said.\n\nAnd he won't be demanding Musk return the gold colored key he presented him with in the Oval Office just days ago.\n\n'No I don’t take things back,' Trump said.\n\nHe dodged a question about dumping his new $80,000 Tesla. 'I hope he does well with Tesla,' Trump answered. \n\nTrump held his events – including signing an executive order on drones in the U.S. – behind closed doors. Then, he toured a golf course at Joint Base Andrews in a golf cart while trailed by aides and Secret Service agents.\n\nHe ignored shouted questions about his relationship with the world's richest man while leaving the White House. \n\nIt wasn't until he boarded Air Force One en route to his Bedminister, New Jersey golf club that he finally spoke about the simmering feud that has driven down Tesla's stock price and prompted speculation about big changes in the space industry as well as talk that Musk's billions in government contracts could be under threat. \n\nOn Thursday Trump and Musk took part in a spectacular public spat, which included cameos by dead serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and anti-Semitic rapper Kanye West. \n\nThe fallout between Trump and Musk - who were political allies for a little less than a year - started in recent weeks when the billionaire started resisting Republicans' 'big, beautiful bill,' arguing that the spending wiped out DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. \n\nThen, on Thursday, when Trump was supposed to be hosting the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, he was asked about Musk's recent criticism. \n\nFrom there the dam broke. \n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump told reporters. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX's government contracts.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disburbed him.' \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX. \n\n'He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I'm sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn't think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,' Trump continued. 'We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat.' \n\nMusk posted to X as Trump's Q&A with reporters was ongoing. \n\n'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote. \n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised. \n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued. 'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.' \n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man - him.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million of his fortune into the Republican's campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nTrump said in the Oval that he likely still would have won Pennsylvania without Musk's help and because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris didn't choose the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the ticket, Trump claimed, 'I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.' \n\nMusk said that was laughable. \n\n'Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,' Musk claimed. \n\n'Such ingratitude,' the billionaire added.\n\nThe 53-year-old Musk also asserted he had more staying power than the 78-year-old president.\n\n'Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,' Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. \n\nTrump asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said the billionaire went 'CRAZY!'\n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts. \n\n'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!' Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n'This just gets better and better,' he wrote. 'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nThe Dragon is how NASA astronauts currently travel to the International Space Station - and how supplies make it there. \n\nAs the fight continued, Tesla shares plummeted.\n\nAnti-semitic rapper Kanye West even got involved. \n\n'Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much,' West wrote.\n\nAnd Musk threw the Epstein bomb. \n\n'@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nEpstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019. \n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain. \n\n'Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,' Musk added. \n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.' \n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.' \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk's Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nAsked for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.'\n\n'The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,' Leavitt added. \n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.' \n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.' \n\nLater he ignored shouted questions from reporters on Musk's Epstein charge as he hosted the National Fraternal Order of Police executive board in the State Dining Room.\n\nA source familiar pointed out to the Daily Mail that 'everyone knows President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club.'\n\n'The Administration itself released Epstein files with the President's name included. This is not a new surprise Elon is uncovering. Everyone already knew this,' the source continued. \n\nThe source also mused, 'If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hangout with him for 6 months and say he \"loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?\"' \n\nIt was less than a week ago that Trump gave Musk a golden key and a DOGE send-off from the Oval Office.","summary":"The president stayed out of the public eye Friday amid the stunning feud with Elon Musk, only speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to his New Jersey golf course.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14789033/Trump-breaks-silence-feud-Elon-Musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/06/23/99127245-0-image-m-44_1749249468218.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/06/5857904361905016685/1024x576_MP4_5857904361905016685.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-06 22:56:22","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":328931592,"title":"Stephen A.

But a week into June, many of its heroes have yet to post about it on X. \n\nNine superstars of the Left, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and former President Barack Obama, have not posted about Pride Month on X. When June rolled around in previous years, these Democrats did not hesitate to issue statements in support of their gay and trans constituents. \n\nThe Obamas and Clintons have been mute as well. Both couples poured in the effort campaigning against President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, catering particularly to LGBTQ+ groups. But neither the former presidents nor their politically involved wives have publicly acknowledged Pride Month on their X accounts, either personal or official. \n\nThe same can be said of former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden. The former president, despite his health problems, has posted multiple times on X in June, but not about Pride Month. On June 4, Biden wished his wife a happy birthday, and on June 2, he posted about the tragic terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado. \n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was prompt to post a June 1 message the last two years. Her 2024 post featured a picture of Warren wearing a large, rainbow feather boa that she proudly acknowledged, saying, “This month, we celebrate the progress we’ve made toward building a more inclusive nation for our LGBTQ+ community and we renew our fight to create a world where everyone is truly equal. And yes – this is a new boa!” \n\nBut the progressive who regularly posts about reproductive rights and has been lauded a “gay icon” by those on the Left has failed to make any acknowledgment on social media of the biggest celebration of the LGBTQ community. \n\nAnother strange absence is Pete Buttigieg. Under Biden, Buttigieg served as the first openly gay Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate in U.S. history. But the staunch advocate for LGBTQ rights has been silent, both on X and Instagram. \n\nOther prominent left-wing figures, however, have taken to X about Pride Month. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., all posted about Pride Month on June 1 or 2. AOC posted a promotional video on X featuring drag queens and gay couples, who made comments like, “Trump has to go down, man. We got to do everything in our power to stand up and show that we are all in solidarity.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris posted on June 6.\n\nThe list of prominent Democrats who have not posted about Pride Month, despite a history of doing so more quickly in years past, is indicative of a broader vibe shift. Major corporations have also de-emphasized their support for Pride Month.

The post on X, his social media platform, landed fast and took off like one of Musk's rockets: \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\"Musk—once ridiculed by Trump for leading companies that made \"driverless cars that crash\" and \"rocketships to nowhere\"— slapped a red MAGA hat on his profile photo, lit up X with pro-Trump memes, and used his platform's reach to carpet-bomb swing states with political propaganda dressed as engagement. By sundown, Trump's digital war room was headquartered on X, and Musk looked like the unofficial campaign manager.Ten months later, he detonated that alliance in real time.Every political strategist in Washington could see it coming. Musk, the richest man in the world, doesn't share power. Trump, the most unrelenting figure in American politics, doesn't forgive disloyalty. Their mutual dependency—money for clout, platform for power—was a high-speed arrangement that seemed destined for a crash.For almost three years, Musk used X, formerly Twitter, to help rebuild Donald Trump's public image and support his 2024 presidential run. He reinstated Trump's account that had been banned after January 6, shared meme after meme mocking Democrats, chatted with MAGA influencers and hosted live conversations with Trump and others. Within months, Musk had reshaped the platform's algorithms to favor a content ecosystem that amplified Trump's message, according to social media researchers.\"A lot of the far right returned to Twitter because all of a sudden it looked like a safe space,\" said Giulio Corsi, a researcher at the University of Cambridge in Britain who has been studying X's recommendation system.His findings were blunt: inflammatory posts, particularly those containing false or misleading links, surged in reach. \"Tweets expressing right-leaning political bias see heightened amplification compared to the baseline model,\" Corsi wrote in a case study examining 2.7 million posts on X in early 2023.But the platform's bias wasn't just anecdotal. A Wall Street Journal analysis found that new users interested only in non-political topics were still bombarded with Trump-aligned content, and that pro-Trump accounts appeared twice as often as those favoring Vice President Kamala Harris during last year's presidential election.The Washington Post also reported that Republican congressional accounts received billions more views than their Democratic counterparts, further illustrating Musk's platform as a potent, asymmetric political tool.Blurred LinesMusk's hands-on management of X's internal mechanics blurred the line between owner and political actor. During the 2024 election cycle, Musk took his control to new political heights, according to Hamed Qahri-Saremi, associate professor of information systems at Cleveland State University.\"We are seeing social media platform owners as active political actors, not just neutral hosts that used to be the norm,\" Qahri-Saremi told Newsweek. \"Musk's influence on social media primarily stems from two channels: his structural control as the owner of X, which gives him gatekeeping power over policies, algorithms, and norms—and his personal activity, where he promotes specific narratives and amplifies particular users.\"It worked—for a while. After Musk endorsed Trump on X last summer, the platform's energy shifted almost immediately in MAGA's favor. Posts praising Trump surged. Once Joe Biden bowed out, content attacking Kamala Harris—including a viral AI-generated image of her in communist regalia—wasn't just allowed; it was spread by Musk himself.That shift was reinforced by Musk's overhaul of how information is verified on the platform. He ended Twitter's partnerships with professional fact-checkers, replaced them with \"Community Notes\"—a crowdsourced system run by anonymous users and algorithms—and removed the traditional verification badges that once signaled a user was who they claimed to be. As a result, misinformation and political propaganda spread more easily, especially from verified accounts who could pay for reach.\"Other major platforms, such as Meta, subsequently adopted similar practices earlier this year, resulting in significant shifts in fact-checking content on social media platforms,\" Qahri-Saremi said. \"Third-party, professional fact-checking does not exist on these platforms as it once did.\"Pull The Plug?He hasn't muted Trump—not yet. But if Elon Musk wanted to, he could do it with a keystroke.As the biggest account on X, with more than 220 million followers, Musk's reach is immediate and absolute. His posts fill the feeds of users who do not follow him. Some who have actively blocked him report that they still see his musings. His Thursday barrage of attacks on Trump—accusing him of lying, reposting calls for impeachment, and floating a Jeffrey Epstein connection over the course of about 40 posts—racked up tens of millions of impressions in a matter of minutes. On X, that means they were likely seen by the majority of active users, whether they followed him or not.That scale matters. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, 59 percent of X users say they rely on the platform as their primary source of news. With a global user base exceeding 500 million, that gives Musk a direct pipeline to shaping how vast swaths of the internet experience political reality.And unlike Trump—who posts mainly on Truth Social, where the reach is narrower and engagement smaller—Musk controls not just the content, but the code. He can dial engagement up or down, signal boosts with a single retweet, or let critics vanish into algorithmic limbo without ever banning them outright.\"He has structural control,\" said Qahri-Saremi. \"That gives him gatekeeping power over speech norms, algorithms, and who gets seen.\"It wouldn't be the first time Musk reprogrammed the ground beneath his rivals' feet. Kamala Harris began her sprint toward the general election last fall, her campaign claimed posts supporting her began vanishing from timelines. Pro-Harris accounts reported sudden drops in engagement, unexplained suspensions and disappearing trending topics.Musk did not answer their questions at the time. He has denied manipulating the algorithm for political reasons, but now that X is a private company under his full control, that algorithm is a black box visible only to him and the coders who work for him. The code itself remains perhaps Musk's most potent weapon for control of the modern attention economy — should he decide to use it against the sitting president.","summary":"Musk used X—formerly Twitter—to help rebuild Trump's public image and support his presidential run.

Johnson told RadarOnline.com it may be tough for Trump to move forward with a lawsuit.\n\nHe explained: \"Defamation of character must be based on a false public comment that has a detrimental effect that can be quantified by way of legal damages. \n\n\"A public figure can only sue if there is actual malice in the mind of the person making the defamatory remarks. Simply put, it cannot be a mistake but has to be knowingly false, which, many times, is a tough standard to overcome.\"\"It would be unprecedented if a sitting president filed suit for defamation while in office,\" Johnson added.\n\nThe battle between the two egos erupted after Musk called out Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" noting it will increase the debt and branding it a \"disgusting abomination.\"\n\nMusk then posted 2013 tweets from Trump, in which the reality star criticized Republicans, the budget, and the country's balance.\n\n\"Where is the man who wrote these words?\" Musk asked. \"Was he replaced by a body double!?\" The 53-year-old then claimed: \"The Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!\"Musk Destroys Trump On XThe billionaire also claimed Trump would have failed to beat Kamala Harris in the November election \"without\" him.\n\n\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election,\" he wrote. \"Dems would control the house and Republicans would be 51-49 in the senate... such ingratitude.\"\n\nTrump admitted he was \"disappointed\" with their fallout, \"because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people.\"\n\nHe added while in the Oval Office: \"He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the (electric vehicle credits) mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair.\"Friendship Over?Musk then accused Trump of lying, and raged: \"False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"\n\nAny hopes of a reconciliation between the two were dashed by Trump, as a senior White House official revealed he is \"not interested in Elon call,\" especially after Musk suggested a \"new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.\"\n\nTrump hit back on Truth Social, and claimed: \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave. I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\"\"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!\" he added.\n\nThe pettiness between the pair has not subsided as Trump is not only being encouraged to seize control of SpaceX from Musk, but is said to be getting rid of his Tesla.","summary":"Donald Trump may have a case for a defamation lawsuit after his former friend Elon Musk accused him of being in the Epstein files.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-elon-musk-defamation-lawsuit-crazy-epstein-files-rant/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/qyUt6q8HI/0x0/trump-musk-1749234480597.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 19:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":328879694,"title":"High-profile Paul Weiss attorney defects to Big Law firm fighting Trump","text":"Damian Williams, one of the most prominent federal prosecutors in the country, is walking away from the law firm that struck a deal with Donald Trump — and joining one that's suing him.Williams is leaving Paul Weiss five months after returning to the firm to work for Jenner & Block, a law firm actively challenging the Trump administration in court.Jenner & Block announced the move Friday. Williams will serve as co-chair of both the firm's Litigation Department and its Investigations, Compliance, and Defense Practice. The high-profile defection is a blow for Paul Weiss, an elite law firm that was the first to broker an agreement with President Donald Trump in March. As part of the deal, Paul Weiss said it would devote $40 million in pro bono hours toward Trump's political priorities. After it was announced, Trump rescinded an executive order that would have, among other sanctions, stripped Paul Weiss employees of security clearances and cut off government contracts.Eight other firms have since made similar deals with the White House. Four — including Jenner & Block — opted to sue instead. All four have won court rulings blocking Trump's orders.\"Jenner & Block fearlessly advocates for its clients and provides outstanding strategic counsel through their most difficult challenges,\" Williams said in a press release. \"I've seen firsthand how this firm expertly tackles the toughest cases and lives its values.\"\"I'm excited to join a team with an extraordinary depth of legal talent that doesn't shy away from hard fights — and delivers results that matter,\" his statement continued.Williams isn't the only notable attorney to leave Paul Weiss in recent weeks.

Williams brought criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and now-former Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey.Before that, Williams worked at Paul Weiss between 2009 and 2012 and clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens on the US Supreme Court and Merrick Garland on the federal appeals court in Washington, DC.In Paul Weiss' January announcement about his return, Williams praised the firm's \"devotion to pro bono.\"\"Damian is a transcendently talented lawyer who has led many of the government's highest-profile prosecutions and investigations,\" Paul Weiss's chair Brad Karp said at the time. \"He will be an exceptional addition to our already outstanding team of white collar and regulatory lawyers and a leader in the national legal community.\"A representative for Paul Weiss didn't respond to a request for comment Friday.","summary":"Damian Williams was at Paul Weiss for just five months before joining Jenner & Block, which won a court ruling blocking a punitive Trump order.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-weiss-attorney-damian-williams-defects-for-jenner-block-2025-6","image":"https://i.insider.com/6843340085e81483682b9fa7?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 19:17:58","author":"Jacob Shamsian","authors":["Jacob Shamsian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.075},{"id":329031818,"title":"Why Trump probably can’t cut Musk loose","text":"Breaking up is hard to do — especially when one party is a billionaire with near-unassailable dominance of the nation’s ability to launch things into space, and the other is a president who has staked a significant portion of his legacy on wildly ambitious space-based projects. \nAs President Donald Trump and his erstwhile financial backer and former DOGE boss Elon Musk traded blows on social media Thursday, the president at one point posted, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” \nThis prompted Musk to announce that he was decommissioning SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, used to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, though he later backed down from the threat.\nTrump may soon find, however, that canceling Musk’s contracts is a lot harder than selling his Tesla, particularly if he wants to pursue goals like his much-vaunted Golden Dome missile defense project. \nTo get to space, the US needs SpaceX\nDuring President Joe Biden’s administration, concerns were indeed raised about Musk’s lucrative government contracts as well as his access to classified defense information, given his partisan political activities (unusual for a major defense contractor), communications with foreign leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, and ties to the Chinese government. \nBut as Vox reported last year, unwinding the government’s relationship with Musk’s companies is a near impossibility right now, particularly when it comes to SpaceX. The company is simply better at launching massive numbers of objects into space than any of its competitors, and it’s not close: SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was responsible for 84 percent of all satellite launches last year, and the constellation of more than 7,000 Starlink communications satellites accounts for around 65 percent of all operational satellites in orbit. \nThe reusable Falcon 9 has become the space launch workhorse of choice for a US military and intelligence community that is ever more dependent on satellites for communications and surveillance.\n“If one side or the other severed that relationship, which I don’t think is practical, you would very quickly see a backlog of military satellites waiting for launch,” said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow and space defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute. Ambitious plans like the National Reconnaissance Office’s ongoing project to launch a constellation of intelligence and surveillance satellites for military use would come to a “screeching halt,” said Harrison.\nThe US military is also increasingly reliant on SpaceX for mobile internet connectivity via a specialized military-only version of Starlink known as Starshield.\nFor NASA, the situation is, if anything, even more dire, as shown last March when two US astronauts returned, months late, from the International Space Station on a SpaceX Dragon capsule when problems were detected on the Boeing craft that brought them into orbit on its first ever flight. \nLosing SpaceX “would basically just end the US participation in the space station,” said David Burbach, an associate professor and space policy expert at the Naval War College. \nNASA’s space shuttle program shut down in 2011. Boeing’s Starliner is probably years from being a viable alternative, and going back to relying on Russian rockets — as the US did for nearly a decade between the end of the Space Shuttle and the advent of Dragon — would probably be a tough sell these days.\nBurbach, speaking in his personal capacity, not as a representative of the US military or war college, said such a break “would be the kind of thing that could trigger something truly drastic” such as the White House using the Defense Production Act to take control of the program. It’s not surprising Musk quickly backed down from the threat. \nNASA’s ongoing Artemis program, which aims to eventually return humans to the Moon and establish a permanent lunar space station, is also heavily dependent on SpaceX’s Starship launch vehicle, as are longer term plans for a mission to Mars. These are (or at least were) priorities for the White House: The moon and Mars missions are the only parts of NASA’s budget that were increased in the president’s recent budget request and the president mentioned planting “the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars” in his inaugural address. \nMars is, to put it mildly, something of a fixation for Musk, and it’s hard to imagine an ongoing US program to get there without his involvement. \nTrump’s golden dreams may require Musk\nA true Trump-Musk rift would also have implications for “Golden Dome,” the ambitious plan to “protect the homeland” from ballistic missiles, drones, hypersonic cruise missiles, and other aerial threats. \nPlans for Golden Dome are still a little vague and no contracts for its construction have been awarded yet, but SpaceX is reportedly a frontrunner to build a constellation of hundreds of new satellites to detect missile launches and determine if they are headed toward the United States, and possibly even intercept them from space. \nAccording to Reuters, SpaceX is bidding for portions of the project in partnership with Anduril and Palantir, two other defense tech companies also led by staunch Trump backers. SpaceX’s vision for the satellite network reportedly envisions it as a “subscription service,” in which the government would pay for access, rather than owning the system outright, a model that would presumably give Musk much more leverage over how Golden Dome is developed and deployed. \nCritics of the program charge that it is little more than a giveaway to Musk and his allies and Democratic members of Congress have raised concerns about his involvement. \nAdvocates for the program, including the Heritage Foundation, which called for investments in ballistic and hypersonic missile defense in its Project 2025 document, have cited SpaceX’s success with Starlink and Starshield as proof-of-concept for their argument that deploying a layer of hundreds or thousands of satellites for missile defense is more practical today than it was in the days of President Ronald Reagan’s “Star Wars” project.\nEven if Golden Dome could be effective, which many doubt, Trump’s stated goal of having it operational with “a success rate close to 100 percent” in “less than three years” for around $175 billion (the Congressional Budget Office projects half a trillion dollars) is eyebrow-raising. The Pentagon had already backed away from the three-year timeline even before the president began feuding with the only person in the world who’s built anything close to this. \n“Even for SpaceX, it would be challenging,” said Burbach. “I don’t think any other company has the capability. They’re really out in the lead on assembly line satellite capability.”\nSome experts think Golden Dome could be reconfigured with a greater role for land-based radar and interceptors, but this would almost certainly put it short of Trump’s expansive vision. As nuclear expert Ankit Panda succinctly put it on Thursday, “Golden Dome is cooked.”\nIs there an alternative?\nIf anyone had a good day on Thursday, it was Musk’s fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. In January, Bezos’s space company Blue Origin carried out its first successful launch of New Glenn, a reusable rocket meant to compete with SpaceX’s game-changing Falcon for contracts including military launches. The company has also begun launching satellites for its Kuiper communications network, a potential competitor to Starlink. \nBoth projects have suffered from long delays and have a long way to go to catch up with Musk’s space behemoth, but it’s still presumably good news for the company that their main competitor is no longer literally sleeping feet from the White House.\nFinding ways to at least encourage competition with Musk, if not cut him loose entirely, would likely have been a priority for a Kamala Harris administration, and may now be one for Trump as well. In response to Vox’s questions to the White House about the future of SpaceX’s contracts, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded in an emailed statement, “President Trump is focused on making our country great again and passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.” SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. \nThough the two may no longer be speaking, Trump is likely to find it harder than he thinks to get out of the Elon Musk business entirely.","summary":"Breaking up is hard to do — especially when one party is a billionaire with near-unassailable dominance of the nation’s ability to launch things into space, and the other is a president who has staked a significant portion of his legacy on wildly ambitious space-based projects.&#160; As President Donald Trump and his erstwhile financial backer [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/415780/musk-trump-spacex-nasa-starlink-golden-dome","image":"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-2185632992.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 19:05:00","author":"Joshua Keating","authors":["Joshua Keating"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.009},{"id":328990512,"title":"Trump once opened the door to the LGBTQ+ community. Now activists say he’s their top threat","text":"By CHRIS MEGERIAN and JILL COLVIN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.\n\nYears earlier, he overturned the rules of his own Miss Universe pageant to allow a transgender contestant to compete. He said Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom at Trump Tower that she wanted. And he was the first president to name an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.\n\nBut since returning to office this year, Trump has engaged in what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community. The threat from the White House contrasts with World Pride celebrations taking place just blocks away in Washington, including a parade and rally this weekend.\n\n“We are in the darkest period right now since the height of the AIDS crisis,” said Kevin Jennings, who leads Lambda Legal, a longtime advocacy organization. “I am deeply concerned that we’re going to see it all be taken away in the next four years.”\n\nTrump’s defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes.\n\n“He’s working to establish common sense once again,” said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.\n\nHarrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, “the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.”\n\n“The president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,” Fields said.\n\nPresidential actions were widely expected\n\nTrump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January.\n\nHis rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military. Trump has since banned them outright from serving. And although June is recognized nationally as Pride month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Trump has “no plans for a proclamation.”\n\n“I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” she added, making no mention of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nWilliams described Pride activities as a progressive catch-all rather than a civil rights campaign. “If you’re not in the mood to protest or resist the Trump administration,” he said, “Pride is not for you.”\n\nTrump declined to issue Pride Month proclamations in his first term, but did recognize the celebration in 2019 as he publicized a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality headed by Richard Grenell, then the U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the highest-profile openly gay person in the administration. (Grenell now serves as envoy for special missions.)\n\n“As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,” Trump posted on social media.\n\nTimes have changed where Trump is concerned\n\nThis time, there is no celebrating.\n\nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump named himself chairman of after firing members of the board of trustees, canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer’s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., at one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.\n\nTrump, who indicated when he took up the position that he would be dictating programming, had specifically said he would end events featuring performers in drag. The exterior lights that once lit the venue on the Potomac River in the colors of the rainbow were quickly replaced with red, white and blue.\n\nMultiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues.\n\nInside the White House, there’s little second-guessing about the president’s stances. Trump aides have pointed to their decision to seize on culture wars surrounding transgender rights during the 2024 campaign as key to their win. They poured money into ads aimed at young men — especially young Hispanic men — attacking Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for supporting “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” including one spot aired during football games.\n\n“Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” the narrator said.\n\nJennings flatly rejected assertions that the administration hasn’t been discriminatory. “Are you kidding me? You’re throwing trans people out of the military. That’s example No. 1.”\n\nHe points to the cancellation of scientific grants and funding for HIV/AIDS organizations, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s “petty and mean” order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which commemorates the gay rights activist and Navy veteran.\n\nJennings also said it doesn’t help that Trump has appointed openly gay men like Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to high-profile positions: “I would call it window dressing.”\n\nLess tolerance for the issues as time passes\n\nCraig Konnoth, a University of Virginia professor of civil rights, compared the U.S.’ trajectory to that of Russia, which has seen a crackdown on gay and lesbian rights after a long stretch of more progressive policies. In 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism.\n\nWilliams said Trump has made the Republican Party more accepting of gay people. First lady Melania Trump, he noted, has hosted fundraisers for his organization.\n\n“On the whole, we think he’s the best president ever for our community. He’s managed to support us in ways that we have never been supported by any administration,” Williams said. “We are vastly accepted within our party now.”\n\nTrump’s approach to LGBTQ+ rights comes amid a broader shift among Republicans, who have grown less tolerant in recent years.\n\nWhile overall support for same-sex marriage has been stable, according to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who think marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized as valid with the same rights as traditional marriage dropped to 41% this year. That’s the lowest point since 2016, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and a substantial decline from a high of 55% in 2021.\n\nThere’s been a similar drop in the share of Republicans who say that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, which has dropped from 56% in 2022 to 38% this year. Democrats, meanwhile, continue to overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and say that same-sex relations are morally acceptable.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from May also found that Trump’s approach to handling transgender issues has been a point of relative strength for the president. About half (52%) of U.S. adults said they approve of how he’s handling transgender issues — a figure higher than his overall job approval (41%).\n\nDouglas Page, who studies politics and gender at Gettysburg College, said that “trans rights are less popular than gay rights, with a minority of Republicans in favor of trans rights. This provides incentives for Republicans to speak to the conservative side of that issue.”\n\n“Gay people are less controversial to Republicans compared to trans people,” he said in an email, “so gay appointees like Secretary Bessent probably won’t ruffle many feathers.”\n\nColvin reported from New York.

The discovery, which has not been previously reported, raises questions about the timeline of China’s foothold in the American communications industry.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the matter and an unclassified report seen by Bloomberg News, the investigators found that malware used by Chinese state-backed hacking groups had been present on the company’s systems for seven months, starting in the summer of 2023. The report, sent to Western intelligence agencies, does not name the compromised telecommunications company.\n\nThe 2023 intrusion predates the well-publicized Salt Typhoon campaign, which the US government has attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. In the Salt Typhoon breaches, hackers infiltrated multiple major US telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon Communications, siphoning personal data of millions of Americans and targeting the phones of high-profile individuals such as then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe malware used in the 2023 breach, known as Demodex, is a rootkit that provides hackers with deep and secretive access to infected machines. Several cybersecurity companies have linked Demodex to Chinese hacking groups targeting telecommunications companies and governments in Southeast Asia. The malware has also been tied to the Salt Typhoon attackers and other hacking groups.\n\nIn the 2023 breach, hackers gained access to the computers of IT administrators at the targeted U.S. telecommunications company. The investigation revealed that the malware remained on the firm’s systems until late winter of 2024. Demodex is designed to leave few digital traces, making it challenging to determine the full extent of the hackers’ activities once inside the breached machines.\n\nThe Chinese government embassy in Washington emphasized the difficulty of determining the origins of hacks and accused the US and its allies of being responsible for cyberattacks on China. The embassy spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, called on the relevant party to “stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.”\n\nRead more at Bloomberg here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"Corporate investigators have reportedly discovered evidence that Chinese hackers infiltrated an American telecommunications company in the summer of 2023, suggesting that China's attackers penetrated the U.S. communications system far earlier than publicly known.\n\n\nThe post Report: Chinese Hackers Breached U.S. Telecoms Earlier than Previously Known appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/06/06/report-chinese-hackers-breached-u-s-telecoms-earlier-than-previously-known/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Chinese-hackers-at-work-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 18:51:39","author":"Lucas Nolan","authors":["Lucas Nolan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":328870568,"title":"Trump’s Past Support for the LGBTQ+ Community Turns to Perceived Threat, Activists Claim","text":"WASHINGTON – When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.\n\nIn previous years, he altered the guidelines of his own Miss Universe contest to permit a transgender participant.

Why?","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has directed his administration to investigate his predecessor Joe Biden’s actions as president, including whether any orders or pardons he signed with an autopen are valid amid recent reporting that has raised questions around Biden’s “cognitive decline.”\n\nThe move is the boldest yet in Trump’s campaign against his political rivals and the quest by Republicans to overturn Biden’s legacy, which has been marred by growing questions about his ability to run the country that Trump is further amplifying.\n\nTrump on Thursday called Biden’s alleged use of an autopen without his knowledge “the biggest scandal” in American political history, without providing any evidence.\n\n“It’s a very bad thing, very dangerous,” Trump said in the Oval Office, arguing that, “essentially, whoever used the autopen was the president.”\n\nPolitical experts say Trump’s investigation, which was ordered in a memorandum signed Wednesday, is baseless and breaks with decades of legal precedent.\n\n“There’s no evidence that any of the moves that (Biden) made as president, in legislation or negotiations with other countries or military actions or anything, were affected by cognitive decline,” said Matthew Lebo, a political science professor at Western University.\n\nBiden responded in a statement Wednesday night after Trump’s directive was issued: “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”\n\nAn autopen, a tool that automatically generates signatures, has been used by U.S. presidents dating back to Thomas Jefferson in the 1800s. Trump has used it himself, but said Thursday that he limits its use to personal correspondence.\n\nThe Justice Department under Democratic and Republican administrations has recognized the use of an autopen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades, and the president’s absolute pardon power is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 2005, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush’s presidency found that “the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it within the meaning of” the constitution after conducting a review of the autopen’s legality.\n\nTrump’s memorandum suggests Biden’s aides “abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline and assert” presidential authority.\n\nIt adds that there are “serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden’s awareness” of the executive orders, memorandums, judicial appointments, and pardons and commutations signed during Biden’s presidency.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice, told Global News in an email that “the issue is authority, not the physical act of signing or an ink signature.”\n\n“As long as President Biden authorized the use of the autopen, documents signed with an autopen are legally valid,” he said.\n\n“Trump or others who are challenging the pardons will have to establish that Biden did not authorize the autopen signatures or the pardons themselves. This would be difficult to do without Biden himself saying the pardons were unauthorized.”\n\nBiden pardoned several of Trump and Republicans’ top political targets, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, in the final days of his presidency.\n\nTrump has presented no evidence that Biden was unaware of the actions taken in his name. He said Thursday that he witnessed Biden’s decline first-hand at their sole debate of the 2024 election last June.\n\n“I was in a debate with the human mind, and I didn’t think he knew what the hell he was doing,” he said.\n\nThat disastrous debate performance pushed questions about Biden’s age and mental acuity to the forefront, ultimately leading him to withdraw from the presidential race three weeks later. He was replaced on the ticket by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Trump.\n\nThe debate came months after U.S. special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden’s handling of classified documents, concluded in a final report that a jury wouldn’t convict Biden because they would see him as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\nTrump’s memorandum cites that report, and further directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate any actions by Biden’s aides and White House staff to “cover up his inability to discharge his duties” and shield him from the public.\n\nRepublicans are also asking Biden’s top aides to testify about the final days of the last administration and “who was calling the shots,” the head of the U.S. Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, said in a statement Wednesday. Comer on Thursday subpoenaed Biden’s White House physicians to testify.\n\nSince the election, a growing number of Democrats have come forward to acknowledge Biden had declined in the final years of his presidency, and that his closest aides hid that fact from lawmakers, donors, party leadership and voters.\n\nIn a recently released book titled Original Sin, authors Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios wrote, “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.”\n\nBiden’s White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, who fiercely defended him against questions about his fitness for office, is set to release a new book in October that her publisher says will examine what led up to Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nLebo said questions about Biden’s decision-making still pale in comparison with Trump’s actions in the White House.\n\n“Biden had gaffes, but Donald Trump’s gaffes become policy,” he said.\n\n“It’s part of the authoritarian playbook to challenge everything done by the opposition as illegitimate.”\n\n— with files from Global’s Reggie Cecchini and The Associated Press","summary":"The move is the boldest yet in Trump's campaign against his political rivals and the quest by Republicans to overturn Biden's legacy.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11214663/trump-biden-investigation-autopen/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2194358329.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 18:34:37","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":328886060,"title":"Trump once opened the door to the LGBTQ+ community. Now activists say he's their top threat - AP News","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — When he first ran for office, Donald Trump appeared to be a new kind of Republican when it came to gay rights.\n\nYears earlier, he overturned the rules of his own Miss Universe pageant to allow a transgender contestant to compete. He said Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom at Trump Tower that she wanted. And he was the first president to name an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.\n\nBut since returning to office this year, Trump has engaged in what activists say is an unprecedented assault on the LGBTQ+ community. The threat from the White House contrasts with World Pride celebrations taking place just blocks away in Washington, including a parade and rally this weekend. \n\n“We are in the darkest period right now since the height of the AIDS crisis,” said Kevin Jennings, who leads Lambda Legal, a longtime advocacy organization. “I am deeply concerned that we’re going to see it all be taken away in the next four years.”\n\nTrump’s defenders insist the president has not acted in a discriminatory way, and they point to public polling that shows widespread support for policies like restrictions on transgender athletes. \n\n“He’s working to establish common sense once again,” said Ed Williams, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents LGBT conservatives.\n\nHarrison Fields, the principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said, “the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people.” \n\n“The president continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,” Fields said. \n\nPresidential actions were widely expected\n\nTrump made anti-transgender attacks a central plank of his campaign reelection message as he called on Congress to pass a bill stating there are “only two genders” and pledged to ban hormonal and surgical intervention for transgender minors. He signed an executive order doing so in January. \n\nHis rally speeches featured a spoof video mocking transgender people and their place in the U.S. military. Trump has since banned them outright from serving. And although June is recognized nationally as Pride month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Trump has “no plans for a proclamation.”\n\n“I can tell you this president is very proud to be a president for all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed,” she added, making no mention of sexual orientation or gender identity. \n\nWilliams described Pride activities as a progressive catch-all rather than a civil rights campaign. “If you’re not in the mood to protest or resist the Trump administration,” he said, “Pride is not for you.”\n\nTrump declined to issue Pride Month proclamations in his first term, but did recognize the celebration in 2019 as he publicized a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality headed by Richard Grenell, then the U.S. Ambassador to Germany and the highest-profile openly gay person in the administration. (Grenell now serves as envoy for special missions.)\n\n“As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,” Trump posted on social media.\n\nTimes have changed where Trump is concerned\n\nThis time, there is no celebrating.\n\nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which Trump named himself chairman of after firing members of the board of trustees, canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer’s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., at one of the nation’s premier cultural institutions.\n\nTrump, who indicated when he took up the position that he would be dictating programming, had specifically said he would end events featuring performers in drag. The exterior lights that once lit the venue on the Potomac River in the colors of the rainbow were quickly replaced with red, white and blue.\n\nMultiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. \n\nInside the White House, there’s little second-guessing about the president’s stances. Trump aides have pointed to their decision to seize on culture wars surrounding transgender rights during the 2024 campaign as key to their win. They poured money into ads aimed at young men — especially young Hispanic men — attacking Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for supporting “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” including one spot aired during football games.\n\n“Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” the narrator said.\n\nJennings flatly rejected assertions that the administration hasn’t been discriminatory. “Are you kidding me? You’re throwing trans people out of the military. That’s example No. 1.” \n\nHe points to the cancellation of scientific grants and funding for HIV/AIDS organizations, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s “petty and mean” order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which commemorates the gay rights activist and Navy veteran.\n\nJennings also said it doesn’t help that Trump has appointed openly gay men like Grenell and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to high-profile positions: “I would call it window dressing.”\n\nLess tolerance for the issues as time passes\n\nCraig Konnoth, a University of Virginia professor of civil rights, compared the U.S.’ trajectory to that of Russia, which has seen a crackdown on gay and lesbian rights after a long stretch of more progressive policies. In 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism.\n\nWilliams said Trump has made the Republican Party more accepting of gay people. First lady Melania Trump, he noted, has hosted fundraisers for his organization.\n\n“On the whole, we think he’s the best president ever for our community. He’s managed to support us in ways that we have never been supported by any administration,” Williams said. “We are vastly accepted within our party now.”\n\nTrump’s approach to LGBTQ+ rights comes amid a broader shift among Republicans, who have grown less tolerant in recent years.\n\nWhile overall support for same-sex marriage has been stable, according to Gallup, the percentage of Republicans who think marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized as valid with the same rights as traditional marriage dropped to 41% this year. That’s the lowest point since 2016, a year after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, and a substantial decline from a high of 55% in 2021. \n\nThere’s been a similar drop in the share of Republicans who say that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, which has dropped from 56% in 2022 to 38% this year. Democrats, meanwhile, continue to overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and say that same-sex relations are morally acceptable.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from May also found that Trump’s approach to handling transgender issues has been a point of relative strength for the president. About half (52%) of U.S. adults said they approve of how he’s handling transgender issues — a figure higher than his overall job approval (41%). \n\nDouglas Page, who studies politics and gender at Gettysburg College, said that “trans rights are less popular than gay rights, with a minority of Republicans in favor of trans rights. This provides incentives for Republicans to speak to the conservative side of that issue.”\n\n“Gay people are less controversial to Republicans compared to trans people,” he said in an email, “so gay appointees like Secretary Bessent probably won’t ruffle many feathers.”\n\nColvin reported from New York.

Additionally, the mining plan is expected to extend the life of the mine by nine years, generate $1 billion in profit and pave the way to provide the fuel to key allies, including Japan and South Korea, according to the DOI.\n\n“This is what energy leadership looks like,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By unlocking access to coal in America, we are not only fueling jobs here at home, but we are also standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies abroad.

Around 250 workers are employed at the mine, and the project is expected to benefit the national and local economies, according to the DOI.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden moved to block new federal coal mining leases in a coal-rich region of Montana and Wyoming in May 2024, an action that Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte condemned as a move meant to “appease the demands of far-left activists.”\n\n“Today’s approval of Signal Peak’s latest permit for the Bull Mountain Mine is a long-awaited victory for Montana coal miners,” Gianforte said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “In the last four years under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we witnessed an all-out war on American energy as they drug their feet and jeopardized our job-creating coal mines across the country. Without today’s action, our energy security and the jobs of over 250 hardworking miners were at risk.”\n\nTrump signed an executive order on April 8 to revive the coal industry, and the administration moved to exempt dozens of coal-fired power plants from Biden-era regulations shortly thereafter.\n\n“This decision reflects our commitment to balancing economic prosperity, national security, and environmental responsibility,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Adam Suess. “The Bull Mountains project is proof that we can meet urgent energy needs, work with local communities and uphold strong environmental standards.”\n\nThe DOI, the Japan and South Korean embassies and Signal Peak Energy, LLC did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
