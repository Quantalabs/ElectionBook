If Trump is Superman, Newsom is Lex Luthor; if Trump is Hulk Hogan, Newsom is Andre the Giant; and if Trump is American Airlines, consider Newsom to be punctuality.\n\nWhy does Newsom want to frame himself as the anti-Trump? Because it’s been beneficial to his political survival, that’s why. He’s like a cruise ship magician, with one really good trick.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nConsider this, a Public Policy Institute of California poll from earlier this month showed a dramatic decline in support for Governor Newsom, with only 44 percent of Californians approving of Newsom’s job performance, down from 52 percent in February.\n\nAdditionally, a majority thought California was going in the wrong direction. In other words, Newsom and his leadership were about as popular in California as Pete Hegseth is in Iran right now.\n\nThen, all hell broke loose in Paramount and Los Angeles, after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started rounding up illegal aliens for deportation.\n\nNewsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass took the position that despite officers being assaulted, Waymos being set ablaze, motorists being pelted with chunks of concrete, and buildings being vandalized, the “protests” were mostly peaceful and the Los Angeles Police Department had things “under control.” Right. Kind of like how Congress has spending under control.\n\nNewsom’s objections were laughable. In fact, they were a real riot.\n\nTrump didn’t buy it, and sent in hundreds of National Guard troops to protect federal property and agents – all against Newsom’s objections, of course.\n\nNewsom embraced the conflict like it was Randi Weingarten at a DNC meeting, and at one point even challenged Trump administration “Border Czar” Tom Homan to arrest him. Not fake-arrest like Greta Thunberg. Newsom wanted real handcuffs and everything…making Newsom the first Democrat in history to ask a border agent to arrest anyone.\n\nThere is no question Newsom ended up benefiting from the face-off.\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult survey taken June 13-15, as the LA protests were fizzling out, 11 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would back Newsom in a 2028 primary, up from 5 percent who said the same in March.\n\nThose results put Newsom in second place, behind former Vice President Kamala Harris, who garnered the support of 34 percent of Democrats.\n\nIn response John Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College told The Hill newspaper, “He’s doing really well among Democrats, both in California and throughout the nation. He’s getting a boost in 2025.”\n\nBy nationalizing what was essentially a California story, the deeply unpopular Newsom was able to regain his standing among Democrats, in a state where the Dems outnumber Republicans by a two-to-one margin.\n\nIf the focus is on Newsom’s performance on crime, homelessness, the budget, the insurance crisis, The French Laundry, wildfires, or any number of other California catastrophes, Newsom loses. However, if the framing is one of a typical partisan food fight, with Newsom branded as the leader of the Democratic resistance, he wins.\n\nHowever, in politics you always have to worry about the law of unintended consequences. While it’s true that Newsom benefits from nationalizing every level of politics, the Democratic Party largely doesn’t: particularly, Senate Democrats.\n\nIn the pages of Split Ticket, Lakshya Jain, Harrison Lavelle, and Armin Thomas conclude that this type of partisanship is the real reason Democrats have been shut out from nearly half of the nation’s Senate seats. “The decline in ticket splitting means they [Democrats] can no longer overcome structural coalitional differences as easily as they once did,” they explain.\n\n“In 2012, they were winning Senate races in states like North Dakota and West Virginia, even as Barack Obama lost them by more than 20 points. But virtually no modern candidate achieves that type of overperformance now,” they conclude.\n\nIn short, Democrats benefit from ticket splitting a lot more than Republicans do.\n\nIf voters take Newsom’s cue and nationalize all aspects of politics, including down ballot races, the Democrats can say goodbye to the U.S. Senate for good.\n\nNone of this is any big surprise to those of us in California — we know that like everything with Newsom, as long as he personally benefits, he’s all in.\n\nAs we Californians say of people like Newsom: It’s his movie, we’re just in it.\n\nSo, enjoy those seats while you can, Senate Democrats. The rest of the country is in for a real treat.\n\nJohn Phillips can be heard weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. on “The John Phillips Show” on KABC/AM 790.","summary":"If voters take Newsom’s cue and nationalize all aspects of politics, including down ballot races, the Democrats can say goodbye to the U.S. Senate for good.  ","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/30/nationalizing-politics-benefits-gavin-newsom-but-hurts-senate-democrats/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24187703140415.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 01:39:12","author":"John Phillips","authors":["John Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":336901162,"title":"Oasis kick off rehearsals in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour after last-minute change","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBryan Kohberger accepts plea deal in Idaho murders case after prosecution drops death penalty\n\nWoman killed in Spain jet ski accident named as wife of football club chairman\n\nMajor blow for savers as Reeves is set to slash tax-free Isa allowance\n\nROBERT JOBSON: A senior courtier told me what Harry and Meghan did to the heartbroken Queen.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:01:51 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:55 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nOasis have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans.\nBrothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reunite on stage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Friday - in their first gig in 15 years.\nThe iconic Britpop band will perform stadium shows across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and North, Central and South America, where it will conclude with a show at São Paulo's Estádio do Morumbi on November 23. \nAnd on Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside. \nIt has also been revealed the brothers have enlisted new bandmates for the tour, with drummer Joey Waronker and guitarists Andy Bell, Gem Archer and Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs on board.\nA source told The Mirror: 'With a new lineup and it being such a huge first show, the boys will do some songs inside the venue too. \n\nOasis have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans\n\nBrothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reunite on stage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Friday - in their first gig in 15 years (Seen in Cardiff in 1997)\n'Some tours would start with a smaller show or take a week or two to get into the groove again- but there is no time for that, and also Liam and Noel want every night to be massive. \n'This is such a huge comeback show, and they are taking it very seriously, it all points to it being an incredible comeback tour.'\nFans have since reacted to hearing rehearsals for the Gallagher brothers' gig kicking off in Wales, taking to social media.\nOne fan shared a clip saying: 'Hello, so it is Monday, the gig is this weekend and you can probably hear it behind me already - the sound check is happening. \n'I'm not sure what song it is but it defintiely sounds like Oasis. There was just instruments earlier but now there is vocals so they seem to be in Cardiff already. Which is very early for a sound check. '\nMeanwhile sharing other clips, people said: 'Oasis soundcheck in Cardiff just now, @liamgallagher sounding biblical,'; \n'THEY'RE IN THERE!!! @liamgallagher and @oasis are testing @principalitysta speakers in Cardiff and they are LOUD,';\n'Oasis soundcheck Cardiff sounds wicked,'; 'Oasis sound checking in Cardiff ohhhh my god.'\n\nOn Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside (Seen in Cardiff in 1997)\n\nOasis crew members could be forgiven for looking back in anger on Sunday after Liam took a swipe at them on social media \n\nLiam risked upsetting the tireless roadies responsible for organising Live '25 - the band's first tour since their 2009 implosion - by claiming even their families will be relieved to rid of them\n\n Oasis announce plans to release MORE tickets ahead of reunion stadium tour \nOasis crew members could be forgiven for looking back in anger on Sunday after Liam took a swipe at them on social media. \nLiam, 52, risked upsetting the tireless roadies responsible for organising Live '25 - the band's first tour since their 2009 implosion - by claiming even their families will be relieved to rid of them this summer.\nTaking to X, he quipped: 'Our crew members don't have friends and there wife's and husbands are glad to see the f**king backs of them and tell me n rkid everytime we see them they don't know how we put up with them on a daily basis let alone go around the f**king world with them fyi.' [sic] \nThe singer appeared to be responding to claims that Oasis crew members have not been issued free tickets for friends and family members - widely considered to be a perk of the job. \n'The crew will be travelling around the country with the band, setting up the venues, and will be on hand throughout the concerts in case they are needed,' one source told the Daily Mail's Katie Hind.\n'They'll be away from their family and are usually given tickets to invite them down to join them at one of the shows.\n'But the Gallagher brothers have banned any free tickets being given out. The crew are all fuming. Many of them have toured with other big-name artists and have never known anything like it. \n\nA statement posted to the band's official website confirmed a limited number of extra tickets will be released 'in the coming days' \n'All Oasis seem to care about is making as much money as they can. Is this about fans, or is the truth that it's all about the money?'\nThe band recently confirmed a limited number of extra tickets will be released ahead of July. \nA statement posted to the band's official website on Wednesday read: 'As the shows are getting closer, Oasis promoters may be able to release a very limited number of additional tickets for sale once final sight lines are checked and the production is fine tuned.\n'These final production releases will happen over the coming days.'\nFollowing their initial release, thousands of fans waited for hours in virtual queues to get their hands on highly coveted tickets for the band's reunion shows, only to find that prices had jumped in a 'dynamic pricing' scheme.\nJapanSouth KoreaOasisWalesLiam Gallagher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOasis kick off rehearsals in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour after last-minute change\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:50 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:52 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi has admitted that he's constantly worried about his health and mortality.\nThe rocker, 76, spoke candidly in a new interview as he said he often now asks himself: 'Will I last too much longer?' \nFrancis is the co-founder, lead singer, lead guitarist and the sole continuous member of the rock band Status Quo.\nIn recent years he has embraced vegetable smoothies, herbal supplements and 60 sit ups-a-day as part of his impressive lifestyle overhaul following years of alcohol and drug addiction. \nHe told The Mirror this week: 'My wife asks me when we have coffee at about 7ish, 7.30 am, she says, 'How are you today?'. I go, 'Well...' It's in the morning I get, 'What the f*** am I doing?' \n'And I can't get that out of my mind, whatever I do. I'll be alright as the day goes on. I'm going into the studio in a while. And then I look forward to the next meal, and that's it really.\n\nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi has admitted that he's constantly worried about his health and mortality\n\nThe rocker, 76, spoke candidly in a new interview as he said he often now asks himself: 'Will I last too much longer?'\n'Will I last too much long. Being 76 gets to me most mornings'. \nBack in 2021 he quipped that he hadn't got 'long left' as he discussed his strict health regime to prepare for his OUT OUT QUOING tour in 2022. \nHe said to The Sun on Saturday at the time: 'Coming out [of lockdown] is a problem for me. Going back to work with Quo is a problem for me.\n'Physically, can I do the Quo gig? I'm fit, but I cannot emulate the lung capacity any more and I have to increase that.\n'I've been practising in my room at night. I've been trying to sing Paper Plane and I get about a quarter of the way through it and it just tires you out.'\nHis intense fitness schedule included 30-length dips in his swanky indoor pool at 7am, followed by eight minutes of crunches and 60 sit-ups.\nFrancis, who lives in Surrey with his wife of 32 years Eileen, fills his nutrition-packed smoothies with broccoli, kale, spinach, carrots, raspberries and strawberries, with apple cider vinegar to aid digestion. \nBreakfast includes a diverse selection of fruit and vegetables while 'dinner' takes place at 3.30pm, giving the Status Quo star plenty of time for his stomach to settle ahead of exercising his vocal cords or going on stage. \nFrancis revealed he prefers to eat early as he performs better on an empty stomach. \n\nFrancis is the co-founder, lead singer, lead guitarist and the sole continuous member of the rock band Status Quo\nDinner is followed by a one-hour scenic power walk around his leafy neighbourhood. \nFrancis confirmed he has ditched prescription medicines in favour of herbal remedies and a long list of supplements including probiotics, Omega 3, vitamin D and magnesium tablets. \n\n Status Quo's FRANCIS ROSSI on sipping margaritas with Queen and why he won't buy wine (but loves a smoothie) \nHe decided to go teetotal several years ago after abusing alcohol in the 80s and developing a £1.7million cocaine habit which caused his septum to fall out in the shower. \nFrancis said any type of drug, including prescription medications, can be a 'slippery slope' for him, after struggling to give up the legal drug, Valium, in the past. \nHe also watched the deterioration of his band mate Rick Parfitt - who he has known since the age of 16 - after the rock 'n' roll lifestyle took a toll on his body. Rick passed away in 2016 at the age of 68. \nWhile he has turned his life around for the better, Francis confirmed he still has one vice, a single cigarette which he savours between 5.15pm and 6.30pm daily.\nHe opts for an American spirit tobacco which is free of nasty preservatives and additives \nFrancis said of his one-a-day habit: 'I light it and the nicotine hits worse than any drug or alcohol. I've got to have one vice!' \n\nIn recent years he has embraced vegetable smoothies, herbal supplements and 60 sit ups-a-day as part of his impressive lifestyle overhaul following years of alcohol and drug addiction \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi, 76, admits he's constantly worried about his health and mortality after lifestyle overhaul: 'Will I last too much longer?'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:47 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:52 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nA Strictly Come Dancing hunk has reportedly signed up for Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, just weeks after his shock split from his fiancée.\nBen Cohen, 46, is reportedly gearing up to take on the gruelling Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins challenge. \nThe former rugby player, who is well known for his appearance on Strictly more than a decade ago, is looking forward to 'throw himself into a new challenge' following his split from fiancée of 12 years Kristina Rihanoff. \nA TV insider told The Sun: 'Ben has had a difficult few months with his split from Kristina, having to sell their home and also having spiralling business debts.\n'Celeb SAS is not only a good pay day for him, but it's a new challenge to throw himself into.\n'Ben is obviously a sportsman and a very physical, competitive player so if anyone can handle the SAS recruitment process, it's him.'\n\nStrictly Come Dancing hunk Ben Cohen has reportedly signed up for Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins just weeks after his shock split from professional dancer fiancée\n\nThe former rugby star is reportedly gearing up to take on the gruelling challenge, in a bid to impress Rudy Reyes, Chris Oliver, Billy Billingham and Jason Fox\nMailOnline have contacted Ben and Celebrity SAS representatives for comment. \nBen and Kristina's relationship was the product of the BBC show's infamous curse when he left his then-wife Abby in 2013, before going onto date Kristina, before money troubles reportedly tore them apart. \nMailOnline was told that it was the severe financial difficulties they had recently experienced are believed to have been behind their split.\nThe extent of the couple's struggles were laid bare in unusual circumstances - during a court appearance last September when Kristina was caught driving without insurance.\nGiving evidence during the case, England World Cup winning rugby star Ben admitted he had bungled the handling of their car insurance policy and told how he was 'fighting to save his relationship and home'.\nA friend of the couple said: 'The past six months have been hell for them and it has torn the love they had apart. For the sake of their family, they have chosen to go forward as separate individuals.\n'Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it's over and it looks like there's no going back.'\nThe couple were left with crippling debts after they ploughed every penny they had into a yoga studio which plunged into crisis during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe former rugby player is looking forward to 'throw himself into a new challenge' following his split from fiancée of 12 years Kristina Rihanoff\n\nEXCLUSIVE The real reason for Kristina Rihanoff and Ben Cohen's split after 'six months of hell' is revealed as the couple separate after 12 years together \nAccording to The Sun, the couple are now left with a crippling £1million debt. \nIn a tortuously frank admission Cohen told the court: 'I get up every day and I fight not to lose everything - to lose my cars and my house and my relationship. I'm so overdrawn.'\nWhen questioned about the strains on his and Rihanoff's relationship, he said: 'We're still living together. We're in it financially.\n'We're in business together so the problem is that we opened the business before Covid and we got the worst severities of it and in all honestly this is just another problem for me to deal with.\n'I've got credit cards that are overdrawn. I'm overdrawn in both accounts. We have got a business debt because of Covid. It's just another problem.'\nMailOnline was given an insight into the struggles during an interview with the couple in May 2021.\nThey started Soo Yoga Group together in June 2017 - four years after falling for each other when they partnered on the 11th series of the hit BBC show.\nCompanies House records showed that the Soo Yoga Group Ltd was £488,470 in the red in its last submitted set of accounts for the year ending on July 31, 2022.\nThe company was facing being struck off and Cohen has since resigned as a director leaving Rihanoff as its sole director - while other companies linked to the couple were also in difficulties.\nIt was not long before the couple had put their £1.75million five-bedroom home in Sywell, Northamptonshire, where they had lived since 2016 on the market.\nCohen resorted to selling topless photos of himself in a bid to raise some much needed cash.\n\nThe extent of the couple's struggles were laid bare during a court appearance last September when Kristina was caught driving without insurance (pictured 2024)\nAhead of the new year, he created a calendar with 1,000 personally signed editions selling at £32.95 a time in the hope of raking in £33,000.\nThe couple revealed the irony of how they set off full of hope on a project to improve health and wellbeing only to be plunged into a crisis which left them facing losing everything and damaging their mental health.\nRussian-born Rihanoff - who left Strictly in 2015 before giving birth to their daughter Mila the following year - had worked hard to retrain as a yoga instructor.\nBut the couple were forced to close their seven-studio yoga centre when the pandemic struck just nine months after opening.\nThe studio offered dance, meditation and pilates classes while Cohen taught high intensity training.\nRihanoff told MailOnline: 'The company is a new company we'd just set it up. We invested everything we've ever had.\n'It was awful. I put everything into it and you don't even have a chance to develop the business.\n'We opened in August after the first lockdown and had a huge spike. It's a family orientated centre. Then November lockdown, December it was awful because we didn't know the end of it. It was forever and ever and ever. Fingers crossed we can go back to normality soon.'\nShe spoke of struggles with depression which has 'skyrocketed through the lockdowns' and admitted they struggled.\nAt that point the couple were able to temporarily run outdoor classes on tennis courts in Northampton but told of their plans to expand the business into a nationwide venture - hoping to emule the success of David Lloyd's sports club empire.\nCohen said: 'Yes it's great being outside and doing stuff but it shouldn't be at that point - we haven't earned a penny.'\nCohen told how it was 'tough to run a business' but said of his hopes: 'Essentially we want to do what David Lloyd did. Everyone thought he was crazy. David has been helping us with this too. We want to grow this across the country.'\nThe couple appeared to be back on track after getting engaged on a sun-kissed beach in the Maldives in 2022 and told of their hopes of tying the knot in Tuscany or Oxfordshire.\nBen told Hello! Magazine in 2023: 'Over the last nine years we've been through the wringer.\n'To support each other through difficult times in business is the ultimate test in a relationship.\n'I've watched her flourish, from her becoming a mum to growing as a businesswoman, and it has strengthened our bond.'\nBut their ongoing struggles were revealed when Rihanoff, who worked on Strictly between 2008 and 2013, appeared at Northampton Crown Court to unsuccessfully appeal a sentence for driving without insurance.\nSobbing throughout the hearing, she told the court it would be financially devastating if she was disqualified.\nShe said she needed to drive to judge ballroom competitions across the country, which earn her around £2,000 a month, and to take Mila to school.\nMailOnline later revealed the couple's yoga company had plunged almost £500,000 in debt.\nStrictly Come DancingBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStrictly Come Dancing hunk 'signs up for Celebrity SAS' just weeks after shock split from fiancée\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The plea was included with their collective request to elevate longtime staffer Tonya Simon to executive producer, Status reported.\n\nThe letter was sent to Paramount co-chief executives George Cheeks, Brian Robbins, and Chris McCarthy. Paramount did not immediately respond Monday to a reqest for comment.\n\nThe famed journalists “emphasized that the show has always corrected any errors transparently, in keeping with its determination to serve the public as an honest broker of news. But, they added, when they are factually correct, they must defend themselves from attack,” Darcy wrote.\n\nThey also “pointedly expressed concern that Paramount is failing to put up a fierce and unrelenting fight in the face of Trump’s lawsuit over the program’s Kamala Harris interview,” according to Status.\n\nAs many legal experts have done, the journalists ripped Trump’s allegations as baseless, and “warned in no uncertain terms that if Paramount were to settle with Trump, it will stain the reputation of the company and undermine the First Amendment,” Darcy wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe revelation came on Monday, the same day it was reported that Paramount Global, CBS and Donald Trump requested a stay on all proceedings in their $20 billion legal battle until Thursday, as they are “engaged in good faith, advanced, settlement negotiations,” lawyers wrote in a motion filed with the Texas court.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that a mediator proposed a $20 million settlement, which would include a $17 million donation to Trump’s presidential foundation or museum, as well as millions in legal fees and public service announcements on Paramount-owned networks to fight antisemitism.\n\nTrump complained that Harris’ response to a question on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was listening to the Biden administration was different in the final cut.\n\nThe president is suing the network for $20 billion, alleging that the Harris interview caused him “mental anguish” after being deceptively edited to make her look good. He also claims that its “false advertising and tampering” withheld viewers’ attention from him and his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nCBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing are false, explaining that the promo shown on “Face the Nation” used a longer section of Harris’ answer.","summary":"The revelation comes as Paramount and Trump are wrapping up settlement negotiations\n\n\nThe post Top ‘60 Minutes’ Correspondents Pleaded With Paramount to Fight Trump Lawsuit | Report appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/60-minutes-correspondents-plead-with-paramount-fight-trump-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-14T083241.865.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:23:40","author":"Josh Dickey","authors":["Josh Dickey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":336894270,"title":"The truth about what happens to Britain's stolen cars: Map reveals smuggling routes used by gangs to sneak motors out of the UK - and where they finally end up","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBryan Kohberger accepts plea deal in Idaho murders case after prosecution drops death penalty\n\nWoman killed in Spain jet ski accident named as wife of football club chairman\n\nMajor blow for savers as Reeves is set to slash tax-free Isa allowance\n\nROBERT JOBSON: A senior courtier told me what Harry and Meghan did to the heartbroken Queen.

Email rory.tingle@mailonline.co.uk \nBy RORY TINGLE, HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:13 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:13 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nGangs are stealing luxury cars from British driveways before whisking them abroad within hours for sale in the Middle East and Africa - as this new graphic reveals. \nOther expensive vehicles, including Range Rovers and Rolls-Royces, are shipped to Eastern Europe and then smuggled into Russia for use by sanctions-dodging Kremlin elites. \nThe highly sophisticated nature of the criminal gangs fuelling Britain's £1.77billion-a-year car theft epidemic is shown by their use of £20,000 high-tech devices to trick keyless entry systems. \nStolen cars are then rapidly driven to Dover and loaded onto ferries before victims, lenders or the police can react.\nOne police investigator said a car could be shipped abroad with cloned number plates before the owner had even been able to report it stolen. \nA new report contrasts the professionalism of gangs overseeing this 'comprehensive logistical process' with the lax police response - which has seen charging rates drop to just 2.6 per cent in 2023/2024. \nStolen cars are often broken into parts that end up in second-hand dealerships or scrapyards in Cyprus, the UAE and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they are sold into other Middle Eastern and North African countries.\nThe illegal trade has driven an 82 per cent increase in car insurance premium quotes since 2021, according to the report, Organised Vehicle Theft in the UK: Trends and Challenges, by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nA Range Rover stolen by the gang that was seized by police before being shipped abroad \n\nThis gang, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, were linked to almost 100 stolen cars, which were stolen and shipped off to the Middle East, or broken down for parts. Top row, left to right: Asif Matadar, Shewaz Rehman, Imran Taj. Bottom row: Zeeshan Ali, Adam Elwood and Mohammed Irfan\nAbout 130,000 vehicles are stolen each year in the UK - many from driveways or on streets outside homes. \nOne gang operating in Oldham, Greater Manchester were jailed last year after being linked to nearly 100 stolen cars. \nThe group arranged for prestige cars including Range Rovers, Mercedes, Porsche and BMWs to be stolen to order before being shipped off to the Middle East, or broken down for parts. \nRingleader Asif Hussain was jailed for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to handle stolen goods, conspiracy to export, and fraud.\nThe RUSI report says organised crime groups have 'shopping lists' of makes and models, indicating many are stolen to order. \nWhile manufacturers have made it harder to hack into keyless entry systems, criminals are beating them in a tech 'arms race' by using specialised devices costing as much as £20,000.\nThese typically work by ‘relaying’ or amplifying the signal of the victim’s key fob, often located inside their home, to trick vehicles into believing the fob is nearby.\nSellers in Bulgaria and Poland advertise devices designed for specific high-end models including Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lamborghini, Lexus and Porsche.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nTwo thieves recently showed a documentary crew how they could steal a keyless car in less than 20 seconds for a £5,000 fee\n\nThief 'T' and an accomplice demonstrated how they use an amplifier, which looks similar to a radio or walkie-talkie, to pick up the signal from the 'key' inside a home\nAs the report explains: ‘Vehicle theft is no longer a low-level, opportunistic crime, but rather a high-value, low-risk form of serious and organised crime with domestic and international dimensions. \n‘The criminal vehicle theft economy is far more resilient than the public and private systems meant to stop it.’\nThe illicit trade was described as a response to a shortage of car parts across much of the Middle East and Africa. \nMeanwhile, demand from Georgia and Azerbaijan could be an 'unintended consequence of sanctions' levied on Russia. \n'Examples have emerged of vehicles vanishing from UK streets and reappearing in Moscow,' the report states. \n'Vehicle theft in the UK represents a perfect storm of increasing domestic and international demand, compounded and exploited by innovative and organised criminals.'\nDespite the massive surge in car thefts, police forces have been 'collapsing' teams dedicated to tackling it. \nThe Met Police once had nearly 100 vehicle crime investigators, but this has now dwindled to only a 'handful'.\nThe RUSI report calls for a national body to be created to investigate car thefts and recover vehicles from overseas, as well as tightened security at ports. \n\nCriminals usually go in pairs to steal keyless cars. One holds a transmitter and stands next to the vehicle while the other stands close to the house holding an amplifier\n\nLast year, Essex Police found more than £14m worth of 'chopped' luxury cars as they were due to be shipped out of the country\n\nA Range rover recovered by Essex's Stolen Vehicle Intelligence Unit (SVIU)\nWhile many stolen cars are rapidly shipped out of the UK, others are left to ‘cool off’ before export to check if they are fitted with trackers. \nOne industrial estate in Essex was recently exposed as a storage facility for an international car smuggling ring exporting cars to Lithuania. \nA stolen Audi fitted with a GPS device was tracked to Baldwins Farm after being stolen from a driveway in North London. \nFive weeks later, it reappeared in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, where the vehicle had already been broken down into parts. \nDuring a recent Dispatches documentary, a reporter spoke to two thieves who showed how they could steal a keyless car in less than 20 seconds for a £5,000 fee.\nThief 'T' and an accomplice demonstrated how they use an amplifier, which looks similar to a radio or walkie-talkie, to pick up the signal from the 'key' inside a home and use it to unlock a car parked outside.\nThe two men, dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, demonstrated the technique on a car they claimed to have already stolen after placing the key fob in the living room of a property. \n\nGreater London experienced the most car theft in total in 2023, with 18,624 recorded thefts from 2,451,620 cars on the road - 0.76 per cent are stolen\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nEXCLUSIVE The murky past of family-run Essex farm now linked to international car smuggling ring \nAfter just a few seconds of holding the amplifier outside the window, the car door unlocked, allowing T to simply open the door and start up the engine. \nOnce the engine had started, the accomplice could take the amplifier, jump in the car and they drove off - with the entire theft taking less than 20 seconds.\nThe men then boasted of taking up to 20 vehicles a month for as much as £5,000 per car, depending on its value, and said up to 90 percent of them are stolen for parts.\nAsked whether they ever feel bad about their actions T said: 'These cars are insured, that's like, that's a first world problem. There's bigger s*** going on out there, that's, like... Your f***ing Range Rover's gone, boo-hoo, go and buy another one, man.'\nHe added: 'A lot of these cars are getting broken for parts. A lot of them are getting shipped out, Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece.' \nAdam Gibson, an agent at the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NaVCIS) - which is funded by the car industry - said the value of vehicles stolen seems to be dropping while the volume is increasing.\n'Whereas we were finding Range Rover's worth £150,000, we're getting pickup trucks and SUVs worth £40,000 now,' he said. \n'We are seeing brands like Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Lexus. So the quality has dropped off, I suppose, but the volume has gone up.\n\nBaldwins Farm, an industrial estate in Essex, was recently exposed as a storage facility for an international car smuggling ring exporting cars to Lithuania \n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the second most common destination for stolen UK cars (20.1%), followed some way behind by Cyprus (6.7%). Jamaica (5.7%) and Georgia (5.1%) were the fourth and fifth most common export countries respectively\n'Some gangs will literally gut the car of any personal effects.

Taylor that parents could opt their children out of a Maryland public school system's lessons that contain themes about homosexuality and transgenderism if they feel the material conflicts with their religious faith. \"Students pay the price when books are censored and educators are silenced,\" National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in reaction to the decision on BlueSky. \"Today, in the ruling on Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Supreme Court failed students. They have discounted and ignored the expertise of trained educational professionals, and harmed students in the process,\" she added. \"Shameful.\" AUTHORS BLAST 'HARMFUL' SCOTUS RULING ALLOWING PARENTS TO OPT KIDS OUT OF READING THEIR LGBTQ+ BOOKS The National Education Association is the largest teachers' union in the country, presiding over 3 million members. However, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said on Friday that parents and families should be respected. \"We have to respect all children and all families. Bad facts make bad law. Mahmoud should have been worked out on a local level, it's a shame it went all the way to SCOTUS,\" Weingarten said. \"Parents must have a say about their own kids, they are our partners in education.\" SUPREME COURT TO HEAR CASE ON LGBTQ-THEMED STORYBOOKS AND PARENTS’ RIGHT TO OPT OUT Weingarten shared similar sentiments on \"The Story\" in April, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case. \"This is something that has to be happening at the local level and not in the Supreme Court,\" Weingarten said, while also noting that the books containing LGBTQ content are not ones she would read to children. The two teachers' union bosses usually align in political views, having both endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. In the past, Weingarten has pushed back on book challenges from parents. In 2023, Weingarten launched a hotline called \"Freedom to Teach and Learn\" to report instances of book banning and challenges against curricula. Weingarten, the leader of the 1.7 million-member union, claimed at the time that \"MAGA lawmakers have used culture wars to divide communities and other schemes that drain resources from public education.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Teachers union leaders Pringle and Weingarten expressed differing views on the Supreme Court ruling allowing parents to opt children out of LGBTQ content based on religious beliefs.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/teachers-union-bosses-split-over-supreme-court-ruling-parental-rights-shield-kids-from-lgbtq-content","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/2e44cd07-unionbosses.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:00:22","author":"Joshua Nelson","authors":["Joshua Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.177},{"id":336893868,"title":"Liam Payne given heartbreaking tribute at the start of new Netflix series Building The Band which was filmed before his tragic death","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBryan Kohberger accepts plea deal in Idaho murders case after prosecution drops death penalty\n\nWoman killed in Spain jet ski accident named as wife of football club chairman\n\nMajor blow for savers as Reeves is set to slash tax-free Isa allowance\n\nROBERT JOBSON: A senior courtier told me what Harry and Meghan did to the heartbroken Queen.

Producers sent them the footage so they are fully aware of what to expect and they have given it their blessing.'\nIn January, Liam's cause of death was officially ruled as 'polytrauma' - a term used to describe multiple traumatic injuries sustained by the body.\n\nLast month, a source told The Sun that his family were shown the entire series in advance and have 'given it their blessing' before adding that Netflix worked 'very closely' with Liam's family to ensure the tone of the final cut was right\n\nThe celebrity mentors will bring their 'unparalleled expertise and personal band experience to the competition' \nHe had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 'up to 2.7 grams per litre in his blood', according to the National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office No. 14.\nThis is more than three times the legal driving limit in England and Wales, which is 0.08, meaning he would have been severely impaired in the moments before his fatal fall.\nA BAC of 2.7 grams per liter (0.27%) is extremely high, with medical experts warning that such levels can lead to confusion, disorientation, and dizziness.\nAccording to Alcohol.org, a BAC above 0.3% can result in alcohol poisoning, and anything above 0.4% could be fatal.\nIn addition to alcohol, the toxicology report found traces of several substances in Liam's system, including 'cocaine metabolites, methylecgonine, benzoylecgomine, cocaethylene, and the antidepressant sertraline,' which is often prescribed for anxiety and depression.\nBuenos AiresKelly RowlandLiam PayneThe Voice\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLiam Payne given heartbreaking tribute at the start of new Netflix series Building The Band which was filmed before his tragic death\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy SARAH SOTOODEH and CHRISTINE RENDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:22:57 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:00:18 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nKhloe Kardashian revealed every cosmetic surgery and procedure she's had done - after an aesthetics doctor broke down the various plastic surgery procedures he speculated the star had undergone over the years - a 'transformation' that he said was on full display at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding. \nDr. Jonny Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, provided an in-depth analysis as to the surgeries he believes Khloe, 41, has had, which appear to include more than just the nose job and facial injections she has previously admitted to. \nIn his breakdown, Betteridge suspects Khloe has undergone numerous procedures including a face and neck lift. \n'Taking into consideration Khloe's appearance from many years ago, we can appreciate just how much she has changed over the years,' Betteridge said in the video posted to TikTok. \nSoon after he published the reel, Khloe took to the comments of it to set the record straight on what she's really had done, which includes a nose job, Botox, filler, collagen baby threads, salmon sperm facials and more. \n\nKhloe Kardashian revealed every cosmetic surgery and procedure she's had done - after an aesthetics doctor broke down the various plastic surgery procedures he speculated the star had undergone over the years - a 'transformation' that he said was on full display at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding; seen on June 27 in Venice at the Bezos wedding festivities\n\nDr. Jonny Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, believe the procedures she's had include more than just the nose job and facial 'injections' she has previously admitted to; Khloe pictured in 2008\n'Alongside noticeable weight loss, I think she's had a temporal brow lift, upper blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty, lip filler, a face and neck lift, and a chin implant,' he speculated.\nWith the help of various photos, Betteridge detailed the physical indications he observed that he believed pointed to a surgically-enhanced tweak. \nIn addition to what he perceived to be a more 'tucked' earlobe, Khloe's 'smaller sideburn' also suggested she had undergone a facelift. \n'Apart from the jawline being ore contoured and the neck tighter, what I want you to notice here how in the before photo, the earlobe is slightly detached and hanging away from the face, but in the after it's tucked inward, smaller and more flush with the jawline, indicative of a surgical procedure.\n\n Khloe Kardashian sparks more plastic surgery rumors at historic Blue Origin space launch \n'In the after image, the hairline near the ear is more pulled back, which can result in a smaller sideburn. This can happen after a facelift when the skin is lifted and repositioned.\n'It's a dramatic transformation, probable surgical procedures I mentioned earlier can be visualized here in relation to the lifting of the brow, the reduction in upper eyelid hooding, the lifted and more contoured nose, fuller lips, projected chin and tighter jawline.'\nOn Instagram, Betteridge posted a shorter breakdown in which he claimed her appearance contained 'clear signs' of both non-surgical and probable surgically-enhanced changes. \n'Over the years, Khloe's transformation has gone far beyond weight loss. There are clear signs of both non-surgical tweaks and likely surgical procedures, with several features pointing to a face and neck lift,' he wrote. \nBetteridge also clarified his analysis was 'purely speculative and based on my professional opinion. \n'I have no personal knowledge of any treatments Khloe Kardashian may or may not have had,' he added. \nKhloe decided to set the record straight in the comments section of his video.\n\nKhloe decided to set the record straight in the comments section of his video\nKhloe kicked off the note with: 'I take this as a great compliment! First off I think these photos are about 15 years apart, but here's a list of things that I have done. I've been very open in the past about what I have done so here we go.'\nKhloe listed each procedure, as well as which doctor or what place she did them at.\n'Nose job @drkanodia90210,' referring to Dr. Raj Kanodia, also known as Doc Hollywood according to his Instagram page.\n'Laser hair for the hairline and everywhere else @sevlaseraesthetics, Botox and sculptra where my face tumor was removed in my cheek @7qspa, soft wave laser for skin tightening @softwavetherapy.' she continued.\n'Filler in the past but not any over the last few years (I hear it never goes away, so I'm sure it's still there but calmed down, lost 80 pounds over the years (slow and steady) @coachjoe.paris,' Khloe noted.\n'Collagen baby Threads underneath my chin and neck @thethingswedo.co, salmon sperm facials/regular facials, peptides, vitamins and daily skin care,' she said.\n'In 2025 there are many other things we can do before surgery but when it's timed, and if I choose to, I know some great doctors,' she added.\nShe wrote another comment in reply to her surgery and procedure reveal: 'Those photos are actually OVER 15 years ago... man time does fly.' \n\nBetteridge provided an in-depth breakdown of the various surgical enhancements he believes Kardashian has undergone\n\nHer years-long 'transformation' was on full display at the elaborate Bezos wedding this weekend\n\nKhloe's physical appearance has faced scrutiny over the years; pictured 2008\nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Kardashian about Betteridge's claims but did not immediately hear back. \nOver the years, Kardashian has been slammed for using filters, editing applications like FaceApp and getting various plastic surgery.\nBack in 2021, Kardashian finally confessed to undergoing a nose job after years of speculation from fans about her ever-changing appearance.\nA year later, she even took to Instagram to thank her plastic surgeon, Dr. Kanodia, for her 'perfect nose.'\nHer plastic surgeon calls himself the 'king of closed scarless rhinoplasty' and is based in Beverly Hills, conveniently close for the Kardashian family who all live nearby.\nAt the time, Kardashian opened up about the procedure saying she 'always wanted' to get a nose job, and 'finally got the courage' to do so.\nSpeaking to Robin Roberts during an ABC special on The Kardashians, she said: 'My whole life I would say - I've always wanted my nose done, forever.'\nAdding: 'But it's in the middle of your face and it's scary to think about. But I finally got the courage, and I did it, and I love it.'\nMany fans took this as Khloe admitting to having a nose job for the first time, but she corrected them on Twitter after the interview aired writing: 'Yes! I spoke about it at the [June 2021 Keeping Up with the Kardashians] reunion with Andy Cohen as well.'\n\nThe star pictured in 2012 on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno\n\nKhloe pictured in 2014\nDuring her interview with Cohen, she expressed frustration that critics were always accusing her of being on her 'third face transplant.'\n'I've had one nose job, [with] Dr. Raj Kanodia,' she insisted. 'You're the first person in an interview that's ever asked me about my nose.'\nThe mother-of-two added that she's also done 'injections' but 'not really Botox' since she claims to respond 'horribly' to it.\nBack in 2018, Kardashian spoke about wanting a nose job back in 2018 - which matches her timeline of when she claims she had the procedure done.\n'One day I think I'll get one because I think about it everyday. But I'm scared so for now it's all about contour,' she told her Instagram followers.\nAmid constant criticism over her looks, the reality star admitted on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast to feeling 'offended' by trolls accusing her of '12 face transplants' and thinks the constant hate is 'crazy.'\n\n'Over the years, Khloe's transformation has gone far beyond weight loss. There are clear signs of both non-surgical tweaks and likely surgical procedures, with several features pointing to a face and neck lift,' Betteridge wrote of Khloe\n\nThe star pictured during the Bezos wedding festivities with her sister Kim; pictured June 26\nThe star confirmed again that she has had only one plastic surgery operation, her nose job, and she added during the podcast that she 'loves it.'\nThe author said that she has been very upfront about her nose job and that is why it is so bothered when people have accused her of lying about other work.\n'It did use to bother me when people were [saying] I've had 12 face transplants,' shared the mother of one.\n'I'm like, \"Oh, my God, I have?\" I was like, \"That's crazy.\"'\nAnd the claims put her off: 'It didn't bother me. It offended me. I just couldn't figure out why people thought that.'\n\nIn 2020 Khloe's filter fail was exposed when she was called out on X for heavily altering a selfie after original look is finally revealed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians\n\nThis picture of Khloe was posted by the reality star in May 2020 -prompting a lot of debate among fans - with the caption, 'under b**ches skiiiinnnnn'\nThe Kardashians star has also long been rumored to undergo regular rounds of filler in her lips and her cheeks and went public about the latter after the removal of a tumor that left a noticeable indentation. \nKhloe's looks have also changed drastically over the years as she has lost over 30lbs thanks to daily workouts, which she documented in her book Strong Looks Better Naked.\nIn May 2020 the star caused a huge commotion when she posted a selfie looking totally unrecognizable, leaving her fans startled by her noticeably different appearance.\nKhloe was called out over the image again three months later, as her original look appeared to emerge in a scene from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, suggesting the reality star had overdosed on the filters, with some accusing her of using the video editing application FaceApp.\nHer visage was once again trending as the two pictures quickly went viral, after an X user posted the side-by-side shots, simply captioning them, 'khloe... girl...' leading to thousands of comments, likes and re-tweets.\n'When you move too fast and the filter drops,' one fan wrote, kicking off the criticism over how different the reality star appears.\n'Khloe Kardashian in 2020 looks like someone tried to draw Khloe Kardashian in 2019,' another user wrote, alongside the two images.\nHowever, some fans came to her defense, saying that the KUWTK star had no need to change her appearance. 'She looks so hot in the second one anyway. I don’t know why she would photoshop herself so much,' one fan wrote.\nLauren SanchezInstagramKhloe Kardashian\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKhloe Kardashian finally sets the record straight on EVERY cosmetic surgery she's ever had done\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 37\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CHLOE LOUISE FOR MAILONLINE\n Published:00:02 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:00:12 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nJulia Bradbury has revealed the heartbreaking response from her children when she told them about her cancer diagnosis as her daughter asked, 'are you going to die'?\nThe Countryfile presenter, 53, was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2021 before undergoing a mastectomy to have her 6cm tumour removed. \nJulia shares her son Zephyr, 13, and her twin girls, Xanthe and Zena, eight, with her property developer husband, Gerard Cunningham.\nAnd during an interview on new health podcast from Dr Oscar Duke, Bedside Manners, she explained that HER children immediately asked if she was going to loose her hair or if she will die. \nShe told the healthcare professional: 'So I took them into the garden. Jerry and I took them into the garden and just told them and said, look, we've got some bad news. \n'Mummy’s not very well, and she has this thing called cancer and they immediately went, does that mean your hair's going to fall out? And that's what children think about. They think about chemotherapy.\n\nJulia Bradbury has revealed the heartbreaking response from her children when she told them about her cancer diagnosis as her daughter asked, 'are you going to die'?\n\nThe Countryfile presenter, was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2021 before undergoing a mastectomy to have her 6cm tumour removed\n'Yeah, because they've seen these images, don't they? Then of course the question was, are you going to die? \n'And it's like, no, I don't think I am going to die. I'm going to have this treatment. I'm not going to be very well, and I'm going to be a bit sensitive and a bit poorly. \n'Then one of my little girls, and I've spoken about this a lot, and it always makes me cry, she said, can I still hug you? And I was like, yes, of course you can.' \nShe also discussed how she felt about her body after her mastectomy surgery.\nJulia said: 'I didn't want to look at my scars. I didn't want to look down at my new breast. I wanted to get through the painkiller phase and getting over the antibiotics. I wanted to be up and walking. I wanted to be back out in nature. \n'I wanted to feel more like me and then be ready to look myself in the mirror and go, right, this is the new me and from now on in, this is it. This is where we're going. This is who we are and let's move forward from this point. \n'My mum, bless her, lovely, Chrissy, she wanted to see straight away and so I let her see, and she just whispered by me and said, it's beautiful, Jules. You know you're going to be, it's lovely.'\n\nJulia shares her son Zephyr, 13, and her twin girls, Xanthe and Zena, eight, with her property developer husband, Gerard Cunningham\nJulia has also previously spoke about the moment she told her husband, Gerard Cunningham, that she had cancer around four years ago.\nAppearing on Davina McCall's Begin Again podcast, she said: 'I told him, and we cried. And I said, 'I'll do whatever I have to do to get through this. I will do whatever it is'.'\nDetermined to fight, she expressed her readiness to face any challenge that may pop up ahead.\n'If I have to lose a breast, I'll have to lose my hair. If I have to go, whatever it is I need to do,' she said. \n'I'm going to do what I need to do to get through this.'\n\nAnd during an interview on a podcast from Dr Oscar Duke, Bedside Manners, she explained that she children immediately asked if she was going to loose her hair or if she will die\n\nJulia has also previously spoke about the moment she told her husband, Gerard Cunningham, that she had cancer around four years ago\nJulia said fighting cancer is not the same for everyone. She explained: 'Every type of cancer is different. Every type of breast cancer is different.\n\n Julia Bradbury, 53, discusses the importance of finding purpose while battling cancer \n'You'll have a friend who's gone through breast cancer, and she and I will sit down and have a story, and we'll have had a different tumour in a different place, and it will behave differently.\n'It's very complicated. And that's the reason why the war on cancer hasn't been won yet.'\nIn 2023, she spoke about her determination to 'stay alive' two years on from her breast cancer diagnosis.\nThe journalist and TV presenter had the tumour, two lymph glands and her left breast removed before having reconstruction surgery.\nJulia has since revealed how her diagnosis changed her life, leading her to adopt a much healthier diet and go teetotal as she declared she will do everything possible to see her children grow up.\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated?\nWhat is breast cancer?\nIt comes from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.\nWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding tissue it is called 'invasive'. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.\nMost cases develop in those over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men, though this is rare.\nStaging indicates how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.\nThe cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast-growing. High-grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.\nWhat causes breast cancer?\nA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'.\nAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance, such as genetics.\nWhat are the symptoms of breast cancer?\nThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign. \nThe first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.\nHow is breast cancer diagnosed?\n\nInitial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours.\nBiopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer.\nIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest X-ray.\n\nHow is breast cancer treated?\nTreatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.\n\nSurgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumour.\nRadiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops them from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery.\nChemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying.\nHormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the 'female' hormone oestrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer.\nHow successful is treatment?\nThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.\nThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 71 means more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.\nFor more information visit breastcancernow.org or call its free helpline on 0808 800 6000\nDavina McCallCountryfileJulia Bradbury\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJulia Bradbury reveals heartbreaking response from her children when she shared her breast cancer diagnosis as she admits she 'didn't want to look at her scars' following surgery\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMY LAMARE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:31 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:23:32 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nJennifer Aniston shared several photos to her Instagram account on Monday, June 30.\nShe captioned it, 'Happy Monday' and shared a selection of recent photos with her dog and with her friends.\nPerhaps most notable was the pic of kissing Sean Hayes, who played Jack McFarland on Will and Grace.\nSean's sitcom competed with Friends, where Jennifer played Rachel Green.\nBut in the pic, the two actors looked very chummy as Aniston planted a kiss on Sean's cheek. \nHayes had a big smile on his face, on which he wore eye glasses, as Jennifer made a silly face while smooching him. \n\nJennifer Aniston shared several photos to her Instagram account on Monday, June 30\n\nShe also shared several photos of her Labrador Retriever, Lord Chesterfield\n\nThe Morning Show star, 56, also gave fans a touch of Friends nostalgia with a makeup-free photo with Courteney Cox, 61. \nIn the snap, the longtime friends stood in a bathroom with Jennifer hugging Courteney from behind.\n\n Jennifer Aniston reveals career 'bucket list' ambition... over a month after 'stalker' scare \nBoth of the actresses wore black with Jen in a spaghetti strap tank and Courteney in a black t-shirt.\nThe Horrible Bosses star also shared several snaps of her dogs, Lord Chesterfield, a Labrador, and Clyde, a miniature schnauzer.\nShe also shared a photo of herself hugging a friend as well as one of her and another woman sitting in front of a fireplace with what appears to be a group of people in front of them.\nAnd finally, her last shot was of a sunset over the Pacific Ocean. \nJennifer is best known for her role on Friends, which ran from 1994-2000 and now she's in another successful series, The Morning Show.\nBut she still has bucket list jobs she'd like to perform such as appearing on Broadway. \n\nThe Morning Show star, 56, also gave fans a touch of Friends nostalgia with a makeup-free photo with Courteney Cox, 61\n\nShe shared a few pics of her miniature schnauzer, Clyde\n\nHer Labrador snuggled with Jennifer and a friend\n\nLord Chesterfield and Clyde are two of Jennifer's three dogs. She also has a Pit Bull mix named Sophie\n\nShe also shared a photo of herself hugging a friend \n'I definitely want to do a Broadway play,' she told People. 'That's on my bucket list.'\nThe problem is, the actress, who has off-Broadway experience from her early career, needs time to focus on 'finding the right piece, the right material.'\n'But I absolutely have to do a play on Broadway,' she stressed.\nIn a separate interview with People, she dished on which role she'd like to revisit and it is NOT Rachel Green. \n'Oh my God, this literally came up the other day: Horrible Bosses,' Aniston said, referring to the 2011 comedy film and its 2014 sequel, in which employees plan how to murder their abusive bosses.\n'Jason Bateman and I were talking about that, and Charlie Day has been talking about it a lot too,' she continued. So that's something that we think would be super fun.\n'The characters are hilarious, and we need comedy. I personally think comedy is a necessity. \n'That's one that we would have a really fun time, I think, going back to, seeing where those crazy cats are today,' she added.\n\nAniston also shared a shot of her and another woman sitting in front of a fireplace with what appears to be a group of people in front of them\n\nAnd finally, her last shot was of a sunset over the Pacific Ocean\n\nLast month, a man named Jimmy Wayne Carwyle allegedly trespassed onto Aniston's Bel-Air property by ramming through the front gates - with the actress being home at the time of the incident.\nHe was arrested by LAPD officers after being apprehended by Aniston's own security team - but a subsequent ruling declared that Carwyle is mentally unfit to stand trial.\n‘He is not competent to stand trial so although I know it’s not the outcome my client would have preferred at this time I would submit on those two reports,’ public defender Robert Krauss informed the court during a hearing last month following a second analysis that concluded Carwyle was mentally unfit to continue with the case.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFriends legend Jennifer Aniston kisses rival 90s sitcom star in picture\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:22:40 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:23:19 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nOver the last week, the love triangle between Harrison, Helena and Toni has been a hot topic on Love Island. \nBut viewers were left baffled following Monday's episode, as they questioned a bold move by producers in the latest recoupling twist.\nMonday's episode saw the Islanders asked to gather around the fire pit where it was revealed there would be a re-coupling, with the boys choosing the girl they wanted to couple up with. \nFirst Tommy chose Emily then Georgio re-coupled with Yasmin, before Harry and Dejon stuck with Shakira and Meg. \nBut rather than Harrison being up next, Ben was revealed as the next hunk to make his choice, and he very unexpectedly chose to couple up with Helena - leaving viewers baffled as to why producers let him go first. \nThe decision meant that Harrison didn't get to make his decision between Helena and Toni, and ultimately ended up still with the Vegas cabana girl, leaving her visibly unimpressed with the move.\n\nLove Island fans have been left baffled by a huge move in Monday's recoupling, with Ben making the shock move to pair up with Helena\n\nHarrison didn't get to finally make his decision between Helena and Toni, and ultimately ended up still with the Vegas cabana girl\nAfter the re-coupling, Harrison immediately pulled Helena for a chat where he said: 'I had a speech in my head for you, it was very similar for what I said to Ton.'\nHe added: 'I planned a speech and the whole time I was there it was obviously about you, I thought finally we'd be able to couple up. But for some reason no. \n'Maybe I'm just jinxed,' said Helena. 'Maybe it's me.' \nHarrison then chatted to Toni and told her that he was 50/50 on whether he was going to pick her or Helena. \nFans were left confused as to why producers let Ben choose first, as they said: 'Why did they let Ben go before Harrison, we needed Harrison to make an actual choice,';\n'Ben and Helena??? Please don’t make me laugh,'; 'No?! harrison needed to pick between helena and toni?!';\n'Ben choosing Helena is ….what? I’m confused by the producers cuz Harrison definitely should have chose before Ben. We know he was gonna pick Helena so just let it be,';\n'Harrison should’ve picked first wtf ben???,'; '????? who let ben go before harrison LMAOOOOOO the producers love toni,';\n\nMonday's episode saw the Islanders asked to gather around the fire pit where it was revealed there would be a re-coupling, with the boys choosing the girl they wanted to couple up with\n\nNext up was Ben, who very unexpectedly chose to couple up with Helena - leaving viewers baffled as to why producers let him go before Harrison\n\nAfter the re-coupling, Harrison immediately pulled Helena for a chat where he said: 'I had a speech in my head for you, it was very similar for what I said to Ton'\n\nHarrison then chatted to Toni and told her that he was 50/50 on whether he was going to pick her or Helena\n\n'Why would the producers make Ben go first instead of Harrison???'; 'They should have let Harrsion go first!!!!! Oh producers you will crumble,';\n'Why did Ben choose before Harrison,'; 'Why did Ben picked before Harrison? I wanted to see who Harrison would have chosen between Toni and Helena,';\nBut some fans shared a theory as to why Ben was allowed to re-couple first. \nThey speculated: 'Waittt they made harrison go last and put helena and ben together so they could be dumped next as a couple okayy i get it now,';\n'Producers not letting Harrison pick first was definitely strategic,'; \n'Love Island producers making Ben go first so he can couple up with Helena and we can vote both home at once. I SEE THE VISION,'; \n'Hear me out… did the producers let Ben pick first so we can do a couple vote and get him and Helena out together.' \nElsewhere in the episode, the heart rate challenge returned to Love Island and Helena left the boys reeling with a very raunchy trick.\n\nFans were left confused as to why producers let Ben choose first, as they said: 'Why did they let Ben go before Harrison, we needed Harrison to make an actual choice'\n\nBut some fans shared a theory as to why Ben was allowed to re-couple first\nIn scenes on Monday's episode of the ITV reality show, Shakira received a text message announcing a new challenge for the villa.\nShe read: 'Islanders, it's time to get each others' pulses racing in tonight's Boys vs Girls challenge. #HeartthrobMode #BootyandBeats'.\nThe girls went first, with Toni leading the way, and attempt to raise the boys' heart rates with saucy performances.\nAlima's heart-racing entrance stunned the men while Emily dressed like an angel and Shakira threw rose petals. \nBut it was Helena's trick that really set things off as she whispered 'I can't wait to f*** you' in Harry's ear.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLove Island viewers are left baffled as they question huge recoupling decision after Ben swooped in to steal Helena - leaving fans with some VERY frosty pairings\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Lawyers for both parties requested a pause of all proceedings \"until July 3, 2025,\" according to Monday's filing. \"The Parties respectfully submit that good cause to stay all proceedings exists because the Parties are engaged in good faith, advanced, settlement negotiations,\" the lawyers told a Texas judge. Paramount did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Representatives for Trump's legal team declined to comment. CBS BLASTS TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER Last week, it was reported that a mediator suggested a $20 million settlement that would include $17 million towards a presidential library in addition to paying legal fees and airing public service announcements on all Paramount networks about combating antisemitism. Trump previously rejected Paramount's $15 million settlement offer, demanding at least $25 million and an apology, something Paramount wasn't willing to give. \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account,\" Trump attorney Ed Paltzik told Fox News Digital in a statement last week. \"CBS and Paramount targeted the President in an attempt to harm his reputation while committing the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion.\" '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES Last October, Trump sued CBS News and Paramount for $10 billion over allegations of election interference involving the \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the presidential election (the amount later jumped to $20 billion). The lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of deceitfully editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. The raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. CBS News has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting. Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder who recused herself from settlement discussions in February, made clear that she wanted to settle Trump's lawsuit in hopes of clearing the pathway for Paramount's multibillion-dollar planned merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration's FCC. There has been newsroom drama in recent months involving Redstone's efforts to \"keep tabs\" on the network's reporting of Trump, at least until the merger closes. That led to the abrupt resignations of \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who claimed he could no longer maintain editorial independence, in April, and CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon in May.

The speculation started when the Ride Wit Me rapper performed at Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony at the Liberty Hall earlier this year. Veterans like Jason Aldean and The Village People also performed at the event.During the conversation with host Ebro Darden, Nelly was asked about his rumored \"pro-Trump stance.\" The rapper was quick to clarify, explaining that his participation was based on \"respect\" for the office.“See, this is what I’m saying. Where did you get pro-Donald? What you had was respect for office.”He further continued:\"It’s great how people spin narratives to things that I think best fit whatever they’re against. You know what I’m saying? Instead of giving a brother the exact fundamental of what he did, what he said. Nobody’s doing that anymore.\"The St. Louis rapper also emphasized that he had never endorsed any president. He substantiated his assertion by highlighting that he had also performed for Kamala Harris at a 2024 event. However, people allegedly \"never brought it up.\"“It doesn’t mean you agree with that president [...] I never endorsed any president. I’ve never done that a day in my life. What I did say is that I’m a military brat. I love our men and women that service this country. I’ve done things all around this country. I’ve entertained the troops. Nobody brings that up. I’ve stayed man, you know, a commitment in my community, and I have a beautiful Black family,” concluded the rapper.This isn't the first time Nelly has defended his decision to perform at Donald Trump's inaugural ball. The rapper has spoken about it in several other interviews since the January 20, 2025, event.Read More: \"He's not thinking about the aftermath that will come\"— Internet reacts as Nelly defends his decision to perform at Trump's inaugurationWhen Nelly reportedly defended his performance at Trump's inaugural event and allegedly referenced Kamala HarrisBRELAND Hosts 3rd Annual \"BRELAND & Friends\" Benefit for Oasis Center at Ryman Auditorium - Source: GettyNelly recently defended his decision to perform at Trump's inauguration ceremony and reportedly made comments that some interpreted as indirect references to Kamala Harris. On June 28, he took to the comment section of a post by The Shade Room to address his love for the country and cleared his stance on the \"pro-Trump\" conjecture.“I reiterate, I did not campaign for anyone. I do not tell people who to vote for. I respect and love our country from top to bottom good and bad… and I am very aware that it’s a lot of things in this country that we need to work on the right is too far right and the left is too far left,\" wrote Nelly.Nelly also stated that if he were ever contacted by the POTUS' office for any reason, his response would not be influenced by financial considerations or race. In the same comment, Nelly made remarks that some took as indirect criticism of Kamala Harris:“Nothing to do with race but if you wanna make it about race, then let’s goooooooooooooo I find it very interesting. That’s so many of you would dump on the two black men that’s married to black women that has black children because the “ “ woman of color with the white husband and white kids. Didn’t win..!!”He further added:“Some of y’all have a problem with because the “prosecutor who has probably locked up more black men that we’ve helped woman of color with the white husband and white kids. Did not win the election.”For the unversed, Kamala Harris is a Hastings College of Law graduate who began her law career in the office of the district attorney of Alameda County. In 2010, she was elected attorney general of California.Although Nelly did not directly name Kamala Harris, his comments were widely interpreted online as a reference to her background and public image. The discussion surrounding his remarks sparked considerable debate across social media platforms.Read More: “I do not tell people who to vote for” — Nelly doubles down on his performance at Donald Trump inauguration eventWhy did 50 Cent diss Ashanti?

Don Bacon, one of just a few moderate Republicans in the House, announced on Monday that he will not run for reelection. That decision cracks open one of the party’s most vulnerable battleground seats just ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nFor five terms, the 61-year-old Bacon has represented Nebraska’s 2nd District, which is often referred to as a “blue dot” in reliably Republican Nebraska since it centers on Omaha and its increasingly liberal voters.\n\n“I think it’s time for a new Republican to be your nominee that can do 12, 14 hour a day and hold this seat,” Bacon said at a press conference at Omaha’s airport. “It is disconcerting to get attacked from the right.”\n\nThough Bacon believes he could win another race, he cited family reasons as his main motivation. He wants more time at home with his eight grandchildren, he said.\n\nThe stakes are high. Democrats need only a handful of pickups to retake the House, and this one was already on their list. The Cook Political Report calls it a “Republican Toss-Up.”\n\nBacon’s district has been a swing seat for many years. And a Democrat has won it in three recent presidential races: Barack Obama in 2008, Joe Biden in 2020, and Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nThe city’s mood is also changing. This year, voters ousted longtime Republican Mayor Jean Stothert and elected Democrat John Ewing. Democrats have already entered the congressional race, including state Sen. John Cavanaugh, son of former Rep. John J. Cavanaugh III, who held the seat in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nBacon’s announcement comes after another major GOP retirement: Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Tillis said this past weekend he won’t seek reelection, citing President Donald Trump’s proposed tax and health care cuts. Both Bacon and Tillis plan to serve out their terms.\n\nWhile Tillis’ seat might be a slightly longer shot, Democrats are very optimistic about flipping Bacon’s seat. After all, the president’s party usually loses ground in the midterms. Trump did in 2018, and Democrats hope to repeat that in 2026.\n\nBacon’s decision was not a surprise. A retired Air Force officer, he’s long expressed frustration with Washington gridlock—and with his party’s hard-right shift. In recent campaigns, he’s emphasized his bipartisan record, including voting for Biden’s 2021 infrastructure package. In 2024, he narrowly secured reelection, with just over 50% of the vote. \n\nHowever, not being a Trump loyalist has consequences in Republican circles. Bacon criticized the former president’s Ukraine policy, pushed to return tariff powers to Congress, and voiced skepticism about Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The Nebraska Republican Party endorsed a primary challenger against him in the 2024 cycle.\n\nNow House GOP leaders are scrambling to defend a key battleground, with no incumbent and a weak majority in the chamber.\n\nThe 2026 map just got more complicated.","summary":"Rep.

The lawsuit, initiated in October, accuses the network of deceptively editing a “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nOn Monday, attorneys filed a request in a Texas court to postpone all proceedings until Thursday. Trump initially sought $20 billion, but a mediator recently suggested a $20 million settlement, the Wall Street Journal reported. Paramount, which owns CBS, has previously described the lawsuit as “completely without merit” and requested its dismissal by the court.\n\nEfforts to reach Edward Paltzik, Trump’s lawyer, were unsuccessful. Similarly, representatives for Paramount Global and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, were also not immediately available for comment.\n\nCBS-parent Paramount Global is seeking approval from the Federal Communications Commission for its $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.\n\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr, who was named chair by Trump on Jan 20, said last week the commission was continuing to review the transaction. The FCC did not make a decision by the 180-day informal deadline in mid-May.\n\nTrump contended CBS sought to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party” and the former vice president in the election by airing two different versions of answers Harris gave to a question, while CBS denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn January, Carr reinstated a complaint about the “60 Minutes” Harris interview. CBS has urged Carr to dismiss the complaint, saying it did nothing wrong and that the complaint aims to turn “the FCC into a full-time censor of content.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nParamount Global and former President Donald Trump are in the midst of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Paramount and Trump Engaged in &#8216;Advanced&#8217; Settlement Discussions, Court Documents Reveal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/paramount-and-trump-engaged-in-advanced-settlement-discussions-court-documents-reveal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Paramount-Trump-in-advanced-settlement-talks-court-filing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 20:30:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":336854616,"title":"James Bond bosses 'narrow down their shortlist to just THREE contenders' - but did your favourite make the cut?","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jun 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Bond bosses 'narrow down their shortlist to just THREE contenders' - but did your favourite make the cut?\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CHLOE LOUISE FOR MAILONLINE\n Published:21:12 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:21:35 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nJames Bond bosses have reportedly narrowed down their shortlist to just three names, after a flurry of speculation. \nIt is believed that Saltburn star Jacob Elordi, Spider-Man's Tom Holland and Babygirl actor Harris Dickinson are at the top of Amazon's wish list, according to Variety.\nInside sources reportedly told the publication that the studio and producers are interested in casting a British actor under the age of 30.\nAnd while Jacob, 28, is Australian, he is still believed to be in the running as fellow Aussie actor George Lazenby has previously played Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969.\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Amazing, Jacob Elordi, Tom Holland and Harris for comment. Amazon declined to comment when contacted by Variety. \nThe studio announced on Wednesday that Denis Villeneuve - best known for directing Warner Bros.' two-part Dune adaptation - has signed on to direct the untitled film, via Amazon press release.\n\nThe 'final three James Bond contenders' left in the running to become the next 007 spy has been revealed- but did your favourite make the cut?\n\nIt is believed that Saltburn star Jacob Elordi, Spider-Man's Tom Holland (pictured) and Babygirl actor Harris Dickinson are at the top of Amazon's wish list, according to Variety magazine\nThe French-Canadian filmmaker, 57, will also serve as executive producer of the project alongside Tanya Lapointe. \nAmazon had previously set Amy Pascal and David Heyman as the film's producers, after the studio parted ways with longtime 007 caretakers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. \nThe news comes just over three years after Amazon completed its massive $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios that included the James Bond franchise.\nThere hasn't been a new 007 film since 2021's No Time to Die, the final film with Daniel Craig as the beloved secret agent. \nThe director said in a statement, 'Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr. No with Sean Connery.' \nHe added, 'I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he’s sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come.'\nThe filmmaker admitted, 'This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.'\nHe also went on to thank Bond producers Amy and David, adding they, 'are absolutely thrilled to bring him back to the screen. Thank you to Amazon MGM Studios for their trust.'\n\nInside sources reportedly told the publication that the studio and producers are interested in casting a British actor under the age of 30 (pictured: Harris Dickinson)\n\nAnd while Jacob, 28, is Australian, he is still believed to be in the running as fellow Aussie actor George Lazenby has previously played Bond in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969\n\nWhile fans still wait news on who the next actor to play British super-spy James Bond (last played by Daniel Craig, above) will be, Amazon MGM Studios has found the film's director\n\nThe studio announced Wednesday that Denis Villeneuve - best known for directing Warner Bros.' two-part Dune adaptation - has signed on to direct the untitled film, via Amazon press release\nAmy and David added, 'Denis Villeneuve has been in love with James Bond movies since he was a little boy.\n'It was always his dream to make this movie, and now it’s ours, too. We are lucky to be in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker.'\nAfter Amazon acquired MGM in 2022, they obtained full creative control of the 007 franchise with a deal they struck with Barbara and Michael, the offspring of original James Bond producer, Albert R. Broccoli.\nBarbara and Michael had been overseeing the franchise since 1995, when their father ceded control of his Eon Productions company to them. \nAmazon reached an agreement with Barbara and Michael in March 2025, and while financial terms were not disclosed, it was rumored to be upwards of $1 billion.\nVilleneuve made his directorial debut in 1998 with August 32nd on Earth, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival that year.\nHe followed that up with Maelstrom (2000), Polytechnique (2009) and Incendies (2010), the latter of which was nominated for Best International Film at the Academy Awards.\nThe filmmaker broke through in Hollywood with 2013's Prisoners, a dark drama starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nHe continued to win acclaim for 2013's Enemy, 2015's Sicario, 2016's Arrival, 2017's Blade Runner 2049 and, most recently, 2021's Dune: Part One and 2024's Dune: Part Two. \nJacob ElordiJames BondAmazonTom Holland\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJames Bond bosses 'narrow down their shortlist to just THREE contenders' - but did your favourite make the cut?\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Ann Selzer, the Des Moines Register, and the newspaper’s publisher Gannett, over Selzer’s survey that found Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris with a surprising lead over Trump in Iowa during the final days of the 2024 election.\n\nThe president’s complaint accused the Register of “brazen election interference” and violations of consumer protections and was filed just days after ABC News reached a $15 million settlement with Trump in his defamation suit over comments made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe poll by Selzer shockingly found Harris with a three-point lead in the reliably red state, suggesting that the 2024 election could swing in the democrats’ favor. In the end, however, Trump won the state by 13 points, representing an embarrassing 16-point error for the legendary pollster – who would later announce her retirement.\n\nA notice of dismissal was filed by attorneys for the president and GOP lawmakers who later joined the complaint in federal court on Monday, explaining that the plaintiffs were dropping the case “without prejudice.”\n\nAn attorney for Selzer, meanwhile, told NPR’s Tom Dreisbach that no settlement was reached with the president pursuant to the dismissal.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the legal teams for the defendants and plaintiffs for comment.\n\nThe withdrawal comes as the president’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over a 60 Minutes interview with Harris, which legal experts have said is frivolous and without merit, is speeding to a likely settlement as the network’s parent company Paramount is looking to complete a merger that requires the Trump administration’s approval.\n\nMore to follow...","summary":"Attorneys for J.

Email Sam.Lawley@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SAM LAWLEY \n Published:20:27 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:20:43 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nA disabled woman has claimed the council blocked a podcast she recorded from going live after a 'spiteful' social media user sent in a video of her smoking her medicinal cannabis.\nSarah Wingfield, 37, was keen to draw attention to employment issues for disabled jobseekers in the episode, which was set up by DurhamEnable - a council-funded body focussing on such challenges.\nThe podcast was also aimed at opening up job opportunities for herself, including in the world of indie acting, where she has already appeared in several roles. \nThe independent disability advocate, who has autism, even attended a photoshoot to promote the episode.\nBut the exciting prospect soon turned into a nightmare ordeal, with Durham County Council opting to stop the podcast from being uploaded after they were handed a screenshot from Facebook which appeared to show her smoking cannabis.\nMs Wingfield, who says police are aware of her prescription for the drug, was then hauled into a meeting with a DurhamEnable officer, where she claims she made her case - but to no avail.\nThe painful experience has left her feeling 'cancelled' and full of doubts about using the employment body in the future.\nShe told MailOnline: 'I am reluctant to use DurhamEnable for support now, which is a concern considering I've been looking for employment for three years.\n\nSarah Wingfield, pictured, has claimed the council blocked a podcast she recorded from going live after a 'spiteful' social media user sent in a video of her smoking her medicinal cannabis\n'[The podcast] could have opened doors and opportunities for me. It's a big jump to being cancelled.\n'I'm the only voice that has been silenced.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE Private clinics slammed for claiming 'medical cannabis' can be used for ADHD and the menopause \nMs Wingfield typically smokes her cannabis in a vape but when the device's cooling head breaks, she smokes it in rolling papers while she waits for a replacement part.\nA screenshot sent to the council in between the recording of her podcast and the date it was due to go live appeared to show her taking the prescribed substance in this way, although she refuses to confirm what was in the papers. \nThe disability advocate was then called into a meeting attended by a DurhamEnable representative, as well as her job coach, where they discussed the decision not to upload the episode.\nMs Wingfield said she was told the move was based on 'perception' and a breach of the council's social media policy, despite her not being a direct employee.\nIn fact, she pointed out that she does not get paid for her podcast appearances, rather she has to arrange transport out of her own pocket. \n'They said that it didn't matter if it was tobacco I was smoking,' she added.\n\nThe painful experience has left her feeling 'cancelled' and full of doubts about using the employment body in the future\n'[Cannabis] is really good for chronic pain. It's helped me with my studies and everything. \n'I understand it can be abused. I understand the stigma surrounding that as well.'\n\n REVEALED: 9,000 Britons now take cannabis on prescription for medical conditions such as chronic pain, anxiety and PTSD \nAfter the meeting, the Durham local then asked for a copy of the council's social media policy but claims she got vague screenshots of rules applying to employees.\nFurther attempts to determine what regulations or guidance she had broken with the video have proved unfruitful and now Ms Wingfield is threatening to escalate the matter to the social care ombudsman and her local MP. \nShe said: 'I told the council to reinstate the podcast to help the disabled community. \n'[The submission of the Facebook screenshot] was sabotage via malicious communications and hate and Durham County Council have aided and abetted in this abusive and unnecessary ostracising of a disability advocate's voice. \n'My voice matters too.\n'It's unprofessional, harmful, and hasn't been handled professionally at any time.'\n\nShe was keen to draw attention to employment issues for disabled jobseekers in the episode, which was set up by DurhamEnable, a body funded by Durham County Council (pictured)\nMs Wingfield insists the saga has opened her up to increased abuse online, the exact outcome the council's social media policy aims to prevent.\n'[The saga] has allowed people to bully and that isn't what the policies and procedures are for,' she said.\n'I've made a lot of enemies doing disability advocacy, and there's a lot of hate for disabled people and when you are in the public eye, it's magnified. So I deal with a lot of trolling.\n'This was an issue close to my heart and by cancelling it, they're telling me I'm not as valid or important as everybody else. \n'I wish I could change it. I'm considering moving out of the area because my charity work and community work is fine, it's my local area where opportunities are being sabotaged.\n'I did nothing wrong, and at the end of the day, the content [on the podcast] was very important.'\nThe fallout, however, has not ended with the shelving of her podcast. The disability advocate later noticed she had been cropped out of the pictures taking during the photoshoot she attended. \nMs Wingfield's shoulder can still be seen in one of the shots from the promotional day but her face has been left out of the snaps. \n'I broke down in tears [when I saw the cropped photo,' she added.\n'I just felt so rejected and discarded. It was so dehumanising.' \n\n Cannabis warning as major study finds two thirds of drug users suffer reduced brain activity \nTo add insult to injury, she has also had a Facebook account dedicated to her acting career taken down after someone reported it for impersonation.\nMeanwhile, her page on Etsy was temporarily removed after a similar complaint, which she suspects came from someone in her hometown of Newton Aycliffe.\n'It's a very small town so the smallest thing becomes a huge thing,' Ms Wingfield added.\n'I've been a target of some local click-led hate campaigns in my hometown, and I'm constantly battling that.'\nJim Murray, head of education and skills at Durham County Council, said: 'We are committed to supporting and giving a voice to people from all backgrounds. \n'This commitment is a key motivation behind the DurhamEnable podcast, which we set up to share the experiences of people with disabilities.\n'A decision was made not to publish an episode featuring Sarah. We informed Sarah of this decision and the reasons behind it, both in writing and in person and stressed how her wellbeing is of the utmost importance to us.\n'We are keen to continue supporting Sarah through our DurhamEnable service, which aims to help disabled people gain the skills and confidence to succeed in long-term employment.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCouncil shut down my disability podcast... all because a photo of me taking my prescription cannabis was circulated by a spiteful social media user\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email Sam.Lawley@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SAM LAWLEY \n Published:20:31 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:20:31 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nSix short months ago, as the nights were drawing in and her neighbours started putting up their Christmas decorations, Georgia-Leigh Gardiner had a lot to look forward to.\nPicking a dress for her rapidly approaching wedding, getting prepped for a business degree and, most importantly, spending quality time with her two-year-old son Arlo before he headed off to nursery.\nBut a devastating doctor's appointment on Friday June 13 changed all of that.\nA year of stomach aches had resulted in dramatic weight loss, 18kg in fact, but Georgia-Leigh was repeatedly told by her GP and local hospital, Leeds General Infirmary, to relax and take a few lansoprazole.\nNow, after one doctor spotted a lump and decided to book her in for scans, the mother, 28, was being told the life-shattering news she had poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, an aggressive form of stomach cancer. Even worse, it had spread to the peritoneum and was incurable.\nGeorgia-Leigh's first reaction at the meeting at St James's University Hospital was to laugh in abject disbelief at the doctor's words, before turning to her soon-to-be husband Callum and mutter: 'Are they actually being serious?'\nHer partner had turned a shade of green and, after a few seconds allowed the revelation to sink in, she herself started to cry and rushed out of the room before she had a full-blown panic attack.\nTwo weeks on and Georgia-Leigh is relentlessly scanning the market for treatment options, bolstered by a flying Gofundme, but told MailOnline she remains 'angry' at Leeds's failure to take her case seriously.\n\nGeorgia-Leigh Gardiner was diagnosed with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, an aggressive form of stomach cancer, this month after repeatedly being told she had acid reflux\n\nBefore the devastating news, she had lots to look forward to including spending quality time with her two-year-old son Arlo, pictured, before he headed off to nursery\n'When they gave me my diagnosis, I went through a stage of being upset,' she said. \n\nEXCLUSIVE I was told I had gallstones when I actually had cancer... now I won't get to see my girl grow up \n'Then I got quite angry because when we researched into this type of gastric cancer, it can go from stage one to four in a matter of months.\n'So my initial thoughts were, \"maybe if they did the test they needed to do at the time then they could have caught it at an earlier stage, when it wasn't incurable, when it hadn't spread\".\n'I wasn't getting any answers and I was still losing weight. It was making me lethargic, I was in constant pain and I couldn't eat. I was being sick so my quality of life was not good and I wasn't being taken seriously.\n'I don't know if that's because of my age. If somebody older would have gone in with the same things I was experiencing, they might have been taken more seriously at the start.'\nEarly visits to her GP and Leeds General Infirmary complaining of diminished appetite saw her persistently rebuffed, even when blood scans raised a few minor issues. \nSoon she was struggling to keep food or water down, leaving her in constant pain and shedding pounds at an alarming speed. \nBut all it takes is one doctor to listen to your case. Unfortunately, when Georgia-Leigh found her woman, it was too late. \n\nHer wedding ceremony with fiance Callum, pictured, has been moved forward in light of her diagnosis with terminal cancer\n\nGeorgia-Leigh is realistic about her chances in a battle against cancer and some of the money raised in a Gofundme will go towards making memories with little Arlo \nShe said: 'When I was going to the hospital, they were sending me home. It was impossible. \n\n I was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 22 - these are the subtle symptoms I ignored for MONTHS \n'It wasn't until the good GP surgeon sent me to the non-specific symptoms pathway [that her case was fast-tracked]. I took her a card to say, \"thank you for taking me seriously\". Because it was awful and I was really ill, and no one would listen. \n'I was going through all the emotions.'\nThe doctor had noticed a lump on her breast and although some scans at the breast clinic came back OK, she was sent to Bradford for more tests. \nAn endoscopy raised some initial concerns before a CT scan confirmed the worst.\nGeorgia-Leigh's thoughts soon crystallised after her initial delirious reaction and she has been going to a wellness centre which boasts oxygen chambers.\nShe has also been in conversation with St James's, who she praises for their response to the diagnosis. \nHer options have been bolstered by the £7,230 which has flown into her GoFundMe in just three weeks.\n\nThe mother is unfussy about the destination of the big family holiday, as long as they are all together and putting adversity to the back of their minds\n\nShe is determined for her toddler son not to forget her and will make sure to take plenty of photos during their planned trips abroad\nThe mother's unusual case has made her eligible for a clinical trial through the NHS, while the Hallwang Clinic in Germany has emerged as an, albeit expensive, option offering drugs and treatment unavailable in the UK.\nBut Georgia-Leigh is stoically realistic about her chances in a battle against cancer and some of the money will go towards making memories with little Arlo while she still has the time.\n\n Doctors' alarm after discovering frightening cancer is exploding in young people \n'I just did not ever expect to be diagnosed with cancer,' she said. 'It's like an out of body experience.\n'My goal is to live as long as I can be honest. Obviously cancer hasn't got a cure so, being realistic about it, I need to also be making as many memories and taking as many photos as possible with my two year old. \n'I don't ever want him to forget who I am. \n'I want to see him grow up and get married but if that's not an option, I want him to be able to look back and see all these memories, even if he doesn't physically remember them, at least he's got them in front of him.'\nThe mother is unfussy about the destination of the big family holiday, as long as the three are all together and putting adversity to the back of their minds. \nShe said: 'We were supposed to be getting married in Italy, me and my fiance, because it's beautiful. I've never been. It's on my bucket list and obviously we're having to bring the wedding forward. \n\nThe mother has been pressing on with plans for a memorable wedding day in September, despite also getting ready to start chemotherapy in the coming weeks\n\nGeorgia-Leigh's thoughts soon crystallised after initially laughing at the news she had cancer and she has been going to a wellness centre which boasts oxygen chambers\n'I'd just be happy anywhere with my family, to be honest, with no cares in the world, and enjoying the quality time with them someplace. \n'I could sit and watch the sun with them for hours.' \n\n Surprising symptoms of 'overlooked' cancer that only 15% of women survive if it's caught late \nGeorgia-Leigh has been pressing on with plans for a memorable wedding day in September, despite also getting ready to start chemotherapy in the coming weeks.\n'There's a charity that we're in talks with called the Wedding Wishing Well,' she said. They make dream weddings happen for people who get diagnosed with a terminal illness that have a short life expectancy. \n'I've got my dress. It's beautiful, classic and royal, but it's not too slick. It's a romantic style dress. And definitely ivory, not white.'\nIn the meantime, friends have been rallying around the young cancer sufferer, not just by pouring money into her fundraiser but also by organising events themselves.\nOne has even arranged a ladies night ballroom in her honour, with 200 tickets being snapped up in no time.\n'It is very overwhelming, because I wasn't expecting so much support from it, to be honest,' Georgia-Leigh added.\n\nShe told MailOnline she remains 'angry' at Leeds General Infirmary's failure to take her case seriously (Stock Photo)\n\nShe has also been in conversation with St James's University Hospital, who provided the initial diagnosis. She praises the establishment for its response to her condition (Stock Photo)\n\n UK's top cancer doctors reveal 2 foods that could be driving cancer in the under 50s \n'But I feel like I can fight this fight until I can't anymore.'\nRepresenting St James's University Hospital, Dr Magnus Harrison, Chief Medical Officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: 'We are sorry to hear about Georgia's experience and would like to support her with this. \n'We would ask her to contact our PALS service so that we can work with her directly and understand what has happened.'\nMailOnline has approached Leeds General Infirmary for comment.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBride-to-be, 28, whose cancer was dismissed as acid reflux says she 'laughed in disbelief' when doctors said she had a year to live - and now vows to spend final months with her toddler son\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Going in a straight line fast isn't the worrying bit. It's going around the corners, that's when things can go wrong'.\nNicholas often shares his love for racing to Instagram alongside snaps of himself posing alongside numerous Ferrari supercars.\nIn one gushing post he said: 'Since I was a kid I loved racing, I grew up watching F1 with my dad and now I get to share the passion with my boy. Never thought I’d get the chance to drive myself, dream come true.'\nNicholas is wed to stunning model Bryana Holly, 31, and together the fiercely private couple share son Joaquin, six, and another child born in 2022.\nLast year he confirmed the couple were married after sparking speculation when he referred to her as his 'wife'.\n\nThe British actor, 35, plays Lex Luthor in the new Superman movie and has been promoting the film over the last few days\n\nSince his breakout E4 role 2007 Nicholas has sported dark, short hair - but the father-of-two has switched up his look for bleached locks\n\nNicholas was first seen walking around Midtown looking dapper in a brown tailored suit and a tan sweater underneath\n\ne was seen leaving ABC Studios having changed into a white vest and light brown short-sleeved shirt\nThe couple, who rarely make public appearances together, officially began dating in 2016 after meeting in Los Angeles. \nWarner Bros. released a new trailer for Superman earlier this month, as fans flocked to pick up their tickets just as they went on sale, seemingly at a record pace.\nAmazon announced also a special offer for Prime members to see Superman a few days before its July 11 release, with early screenings on July 8.\nWith the trailer's debut on Wednesday, it was also announced by Fandango that the Prime early screenings were the ticket retailer's best first-day ticket pre-sales of 2025.\nFans have not been hesitating to scoop up their own tickets for the July 11 release, with many taking to social media to show off their ticket purchases.\nEarly box office projections have already been quite huge, with early numbers suggesting it could open between $154 million and $175 million.\nIf this record pace continues, it could be even higher, as fans have continued to express their excitement on social media all day on Wednesday after the new trailer dropped.\nThe trailer begins with a massive skyscraper falling and Superman (David Corenswet) swooping in to stop it from hitting the ground as we hear Lex Luthor (Nicholas) detailing his plan to destroy the Man of Steel.\n\nNicholas is married to model Bryana Holly, 31, and together the fiercely private couple share son Joaquin, six, and another child born in 2022\n\nWarner Bros. released a new trailer for Superman earlier this month, as fans flocked to pick up their tickets just as they went on sale (Nicholas pictured in the movie) \n\nLuthor and his minions are seen destroying Superman's Fortress of Solitude, while we also see Superman/Clark Kent making out with Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), along with shots of his parents (Pruitt Taylor Vince, Neva Howell).\nDroids are seeing picking up a battered Superman and taking him to the Fortress, along with shots of Superman in battle with Luthor's various henchfolk.\nOne particular shot fans have been cheering for shows Superman and his beloved dog Krypto the Superdog battle an enemy, literally punching his teeth out and hitting the camera lens, breaking the proverbial 'fourth wall.' \nSuperman is also see clashing with the abrasive Green Lantern character Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), who challenges him to, 'make a move, big blue.'\nMore shots show people all over the world rooting for Superman, which infuriates Luthor, who says, 'They chose him, let them die.'\nNicholas Hoult\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicholas Hoult is unrecognisable as he shows off a new look and opts for THREE outfit changes while promoting Superman in New York City\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I'm happy with it, but I think also coming off the show if you want to be an influencer or you want to give it a go you're constantly taking videos and pictures of yourself.\n'So I'm constantly looking at pictures and thinking all that could I look a bit old or I look a bit this and that's kind of what egged me on to do it.'\nRevealing the procedure was 'gifted', she said: 'I'm not sure if I would have gone ahead with it if it wasn't. But I have always, for years and years, had just an insecurity about my eyes.'\nPatsy added that she 'would not recommend' the surgery to her young fans or followers.\nThe reality star, who quit her job in office administration to go on Love Island last year, also revealed to the publication that she has since 'struggled' with a career path and is looking to move to Australia to find a 'normal 9 to 5 job'.\nPatsy burst onto our screens last summer and initially coupled up with Ayo before being picked by Munveer.\nBut after just 10 days they were voted out by their fellow Islanders.\n\nPatsy revealed she felt she need the surgery due to feeling the pressure of being an influencer and noted that the procedure was 'gifted'\n\nThe TV star, who appeared on Love Island last year, woke up alone in her hospital room and admitted she was originally horrified by her appearance and was unable to look in the mirror; pictured on Love Island last year\n\n Love Island spoilers: The heart rate challenge is back - and Helena has VERY raunchy trick \nAhead of going on the Love Island, Patsy revealed last year how she worked with ITV bosses to adapt the villa for her disability.\nThe former office administrator, has previously shared details of living with disability Erb's palsy - a condition characterized by weakness and loss of motion in the arm - which she developed during her traumatic birth at Lewisham hospital.\nShe has undergone several operations on her arm including muscle transplants and nerve transplants to improve the quality of her movement.\nAhead of the series Patsy told how producers have 'covered all bases' to 'look after her' during the stint on the show.\nShe told The Sun: 'No stone has been left unturned when it comes to 'am I happy to go in there and get involved with day to day activities' and stuff like that.'\n'There are things that will be interesting I guess, for other people to see on camera that I can't do. I struggle to put my hair up and stuff.\n'But I always just kind of find something to rest my arm on, or I often - you'll probably see me in there - I'm using my friend's shoulder to put my arm on, so I can lift it up and do my hair.\n'So you'll definitely as as the show plays out, you'll be able to see things I can and can't do.'\nShe has previously said of her disability and childhood: 'I was a normal baby at birth or should have been, but I had a birth injury or disability.\n\nPatsy burst onto our screens last summer and initially coupled up with Ayo before being picked by Munveer but after just 10 days they were voted out by their fellow Islanders\n\n'From there I have had a few operations, muscle transplants, nerve transplants to get it to where it is now, which I am happy with and I know for other people with the condition, it is in a good way.\n'It's something I've had for all of my life that I get on with and I don't know any different, day to day for me it's quite a small part of who I am.'\nPatsy hoped she inspired other people living with a disability to feel as body confident as she does and shared details of her story with her co-stars.\nShe said: 'I am really looking forward to speaking about it in the villa and hopefully people will be able to watch and understand from my explanation a little more about.\n'I'm really hoping there will be people all over the country who have similar things - and I know people with exactly the same condition, who will see me doing something like this and think wow I would never go for something like that and she's doing it and she's so confident and body confident and I can be the same.'\nITVCosmetic SurgeryLove IslandTurkey\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLove Island star reveals she's jetted to Turkey for 'painful' cat eye facelift surgery as she shares tragic reason behind the procedure\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Don Bacon won’t vie for reelection, leaving competitive House district open","text":"GOP Rep. Don Bacon announced Monday that he would not vie for reelection next year, leaving his highly competitive House seat in Nebraska up for grabs in the 2026 cycle.\n\nBacon (R-Neb.), who hasn’t been shy about criticizing President Trump and disagreeing with fellow Republicans on Ukraine, explained that he wanted to spend more time with his family.\n\n“When we started this journey in 2015, we had one grandchild. Today, Angie and I are blessed to have eight grandchildren,” Bacon said in a statement.\n\n“After 30 years in the Air Force and 10 years in Congress, it’s time to spend my future with the love of my life, our four kids, and our wonderful grandchildren. Thank you, Nebraska!”\n\nBacon is one of three sitting House Republicans who hail from a district that former Vice President Kamala Harris won last November. There are 13 House Democrats who come from a district that President Trump won.\n\nThe five-term congressman comes from Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which is home to Omaha and had narrowly eked out a win last cycle — 50.9% to 49.1% — in one of the closest races in the country.\n\nGiven the ultra-slim 220 to 212 GOP majority in the House, Bacon’s decision not to run for reelection complicates their path to holding the lower chamber. \n\nIf Bacon ran for reelection, he would’ve likely faced another tough race to hold onto his seat, given that many analysts expect the midterms to be a blue wave year for House contests. \n\n“The writing has been on the wall for months. Nebraskans are tired of the false promises that Republicans are trying to sell and they want real results,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus, a spokesperson, chided in a statement. \n\n“Don Bacon’s decision to not seek reelection in 2026 is the latest vote of no-confidence for House Republicans and their electoral prospects. Next November, Nebraskans are going to elect a Democrat who will actually deliver for them.”\n\nBacon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, had been one of a handful of Republicans in Congress who publicly criticized Trump’s approach to Ukraine.\n\n“I feel so strongly about it, I just don’t care,” Bacon told The Post in March, while accusing the president of taking “a pro-Russian view” of the brutal war.\n\n“He has been very weak on Ukraine,” Bacon, bluntly added, “and he’s been a bit of an appeaser to Russia.”\n\nThe Nebraska Republican had also been a critic of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the leaked Signal chat earlier this year. \n\nBacon’s announcement comes after Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) revealed that he would not be seeking reelection in 2026, leaving one of the GOP’s most vulnerable seats up for grabs.","summary":"Nebraska Rep.

And Eric sparked talk of a Trump political dynasty earlier this month when he told the Financial Times that a political career would be 'would be an easy one' for family members, if they took that option.\n\nNorth Carolina is a longtime battleground state where Democrats tend to win the governorships and Republicans the Senate seats.\n\nDemocrats, however, see the retirement of Tillis, a well-liked Republican senator, as a chance to change their luck. The party is pushing former Gov. Roy Cooper, a popular politician, to run for the seat.\n\nAsked if he would back a successor for his seat, Tillis didn't answer.\n\n'Dependent upon whether or not President Trump endorses somebody it could be an open primary,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill on Sunday night.. 'He could close it out and the party could get behind it, I suspect that's what they do. I just really hope he has some discernment because obviously Mark Robinson was a bad pick.'\n\nRobinson, the scandal-ridden lieutenant governor, lost last year's gubernatorial race to Democrat Josh Stein even as Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the presidential race. \n\nLara Trump, a North Carolina native who graduated from N.C. State University, currently anchors a weekend show on Fox News.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, she served as co-chair of Republican National Committee. In that contest, President Trump backed Whatley to be chairman with Lara Trump as his deputy. The duo served together through the election.\n\nShe was previously floated as a potential Senate candidate when former Republican Sen. Richard Burr retired. She opted not to launch a campaign for the seat.\n\nEric and Lara currently live in Florida. Lara was touted as a candidate to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate when he was confirmed as secretary of state but, again, she opted to stay out of politics.\n\nShe said she worries about moving her family to Washington D.C., pointing to advice she received from her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who both worked in the first Trump Administration.\n\n'It was tough on them personally, but it was really tough on their family,' she told Time magazine in February.\n\n'Even if I decided to move my whole family, dogs and all, up to Washington, D.C., I still think that it probably would have been a big challenge for my kids and for us as a whole.'\n\nEric Trump, speaking to the Financial Times a few weeks ago, expressed the same concerns about his children and a political life.\n\n'The real question is: 'Do you want to drag other members of your family into it?'' Eric Trump said when asked about running for public office. Their son Luke is seven and daughter Caroline is five.\n\n'Would I want my kids to live the same experience over the last decade that I've lived?\n\n'If the answer was yes, I think the political path would be an easy one, meaning, I think I could do it,' he said. 'And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.'\n\nTillis announced his retirement on Sunday after Trump whacked him over his opposition to the president's 'big, beautiful' budget bill currently making its way through the Senate. \n\nTillis was one of two Republican senators who voted against the 'motion to proceed' on Trump's budget bill Saturday evening, along with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. \n\nIn a post made to his social media site Truth Social Sunday morning, President Trump came after Tillis, claiming that he 'hurt the great people of North Carolina' and calling him a 'talker and complainer.'\n\n'Thom Tillis has hurt the great people of North Carolina. Even on the catastrophic flooding, nothing was done to help until I took office. Then a Miracle took place! Tillis is a talker and complainer, Not A Doer! He's even worse than Rand 'Fauci' Paul,' Trump wrote on Sunday morning.","summary":"Lara Trump is one of the many Republicans weighing a run for North Carolina's open Senate seat after criticism from President Donald Trump pushed Senator Thom Tillis into retirement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14861753/lara-trump-eric-donald-north-carolina-senate.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/30/19/99867315-0-image-m-27_1751307352369.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/05/7586455073097101428/1024x576_MP4_7586455073097101428.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-30 18:41:14","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":336830934,"title":"Sir Elton John is assisted off a boat in Italy before enjoying Al fresco meal with husband David Furnish after seemingly picking a side in Beckham feud","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jun 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUK will be even hotter tomorrow: Temperatures could hit 35C as amber health alert is extended across England after sunseekers flocked to the coast as 'killer' heatwave gripped Britain\n\nWoman killed in Spain jet ski accident named as wife of football club chairman\n\nSandy Gall dead at 97: Veteran News at Ten presenter dies at home\n\nROBERT JOBSON: A senior courtier told me what Harry and Meghan did to the heartbroken Queen.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:19:12 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:19:13 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nSir Elton John was assisted off a boat before joining his husband for an Al fresco meal as the pair were spotted in Italy on Saturday.\nThe music legend, 78, and filmmaker husband, 62, jetted off to Nerano in Naples over the weekend. \nSir Elton- who has spoken out about health issues in recent years - was assisted as he disembarked from his boat.\nHe later joined husband David and a close group of friends for a meal at the renowned Lo Scoglio restaurant.\nIt comes after Elton and David appeared to pick their sides in the escalating Beckham family feud.\nDespite being friends with David and Victoria Beckham for over 30 years, Sir Elton delivered a bombshell show of support for his godson Brooklyn and wife Nicola Peltz.\n\nLast week, Brooklyn shared a besotted post dedicated to his US actress wife as he marked five years since he proposed, declaring it the 'best decision ever.'\nAnd whilst there has been no social media likes from his parents, one of the top comments is from his godfather Elton who tagged the pair and wrote 'Happy Anniversary to the sweetest, most loving couple.'\nHis husband David had earlier added his own loving message, commenting 'Happy Anniversary to the gorgeous couple.'\nSir Elton and his husband's very public show of support will no doubt cause tension in the Beckham family home, considering their long-standing friendship with Brooklyn's parents.\nDavid affectionately calls the musician 'Uncle Elton' after becoming friends in his football heyday.\nSir Elton was due to perform at the Beckhams wedding in 1999 before suffering a heart attack that prevented him from playing. He later sang at one of the children’s christenings.\nMeanwhile Victoria once disclosed that it was Elton who inspired her to say goodbye to the Spice Girls, penning an emotional letter to her older self where she confessed that watching her friend perform made her realise that her true calling lay beyond singing.\nVictoria and David have recently reached out to their son with social media olive branches, tagging him in Father's Day posts.\n\nDespite being friends with David and Victoria Beckham for over 30 years, Sir Elton John has delivered a bombshell show of support for his godson Brooklyn and wife Nicola Peltz\n\nLast week Brooklyn shared a besotted post dedicated to his US actress wife as he marked five years since he proposed, declaring it the 'best decision ever' \nBut the family feud has continued to rumble on, with celeb friends now picking sides.\nNicola's fallout with her husband's family highlighted an unlikely alliance last week as Yolanda Hadid showed support for Victoria.\nThe actress, 30, dated Yolanda's son Anwar for around a year when he was 17 and she was 22 but their age-gap apparently concerned his family.\nIn a show of support Yolanda, 61, shared a love heart underneath David's knighthood announcement.\nWhile there is no public history of a relationship between the two matriarchs, it is possible she understands what the family is going through after she suffered her own 'strained' relationship with the Bates Motel star during her romance with Anwar.\nDavid told his children 'I will always be there, no matter what' in an emotional Father's Day Instagram post amid their ongoing family fallout.\nHe shared pictures of Victoria and their four children Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 13, laughing and looking cheery in happier times.\nSubtly reaching out to his eldest son, David insisted he will always be around to support Brooklyn even if times get tough.\n\nWhilst there has been no social media likes from his parents, one of the top comments is from his godfather Elton who wrote 'Happy Anniversary to the sweetest, most loving couple'\n\nHis husband David had earlier added his own loving message, commenting 'Happy Anniversary to the gorgeous couple'\n\nDavid affectionately calls the musician 'Uncle Elton' after becoming friends in his football heyday\nHe wrote: 'My most important & favourite job in life is being a dad... I'm so proud of all of you and like daddy ( sorry boys ) tells you every single day I will always be here for you no matter what...\n'Mummy thank you for doing the most important part and making me a father there is no greater gift in life than making me a dad... Happy Father's Day... I love you kiddies more than you could imagine.. @victoriabeckham @brooklynpeltzbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven @tedbeckhamdavid'\nCruz responded to his father on the post, writing: 'You mean the world to us and inspire us every single day dad I love you'.\nVictoria's Father's Day tribute to husband David was also filled with nods to their son Brooklyn as she reached out to her eldest child.\nElton JohnItaly\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSir Elton John is assisted off a boat in Italy before enjoying Al fresco meal with husband David Furnish after seemingly picking a side in Beckham feud\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Even on the catastrophic flooding, nothing was done to help until I took office. Then a Miracle took place! Tillis is a talker and complainer, Not A Doer! He's even worse than Rand 'Fauci' Paul,' Trump wrote on Sunday morning.\n\nTillis, who was set to face a reelection fight in a critical swing state next year in the 2026 midterms, raised significant concerns this week over the budget bill’s deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\nTillis shared projections that his state could lose $38.9 billion, impacting more than 600,000 North Carolinians.\n\nCutting Medicaid was seen by a number of Republicans as a way to pay for the president’s policy agenda, which includes increases in areas such as border security, which the White House asked to be at $150 billion.\n\nNotably, Republican leaders in Tillis' own state said they were willing to work with the hand they were dealt by Washington. \n\nNorth Carolina's State Senate Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger wrote on X, formerly Twitter Saturday that he supports '@realDonaldTrump’s Big Beautiful Bill and the legislature will work through any implementation issues.'\n\nNorth Carolina is state that Trump has narrowly won in all three of his elections, yet still sees Democrat leadership at the state level, making it a swing state.\n\nIt is also home to a number of nationally prominent Republicans who could be frontrunners to replace Tillis, such as National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Chairman Richard Hudson and Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Michael Whatley. \n\nTrump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump - wife of his son Eric - is also from the state, and could potentially make a bid for the seat. After serving as the RNC Co-Chair in 2024, Lara Trump is now the host of My View with Lara Trump on Fox News.","summary":"A Republican representing a key swing congressional district will not run for reelection in the midterms.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14861429/anti-trump-republican-don-bacon-reelection.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/30/17/99863841-0-image-a-8_1751299984849.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 18:11:38","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.044},{"id":336813300,"title":"Lily James' ex Matt Smith, 42, steps out with former flame Emma Laird, 26, - two years after being spotted in a clinch on pub date","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jun 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSandy Gall dead at 97: Veteran News at Ten presenter dies at home\n\nGrinning Channel migrants pose for SELFIES on packed dinghy as total tops 170,000 since start of crisis - and expert warns French powers to stop boats will make no difference to illegal arrivals\n\nEurope heat record: Spain and Portugal boil in highest temperatures as wildfires rage across continent fanned by 'suffocating' heatwave while Brit goes missing on Greek island\n\nThis is exactly what you have to do to lose half a stone in just two weeks - and you don't need Mounjaro or Ozempic!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:18:06 BST, 30 June 2025 |Updated:18:25 BST, 30 June 2025 \n\nLily James' ex Matt Smith stepped out with his former flame Emma Laird over the weekend.\nThe Crown actor, 42, and the actress, 26, were spotted in a clinch on a pub date back in the summer of 2023.\nAnd now it appears they are back spending time with each other as they headed to a trendy north London bakery and enjoyed a stroll together with his beloved dog.\nFor the outing Matt dressed casually in a light blue jumper and dark trousers, while Emma opted for a chic all-white outfit.\nThe date comes after Matt's romantic life was last in the news back in January when he was seen passionately kissing a mystery brunette on a Rio de Janeiro.\nSoon after it was revealed she was Jessica Felix, a Brazilian model and trainee doctor who celebrated her 26th birthday in December. \n\nLily James' ex Matt Smith stepped out with his former flame Emma Laird in London over the weekend\n\nIt appears they are back spending time with each other as they headed to a trendy north London bakery and enjoyed a stroll together with his beloved dog\nBut now it appears he could be back spending more time with Emma two years after their close display at a pub on a night out.\nRepresentatives for Matt and Emma have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. \nThe actor was thought to be single after ending his most high profile romance with actress Lily James in 2020.\nThe couple first met in 2014 on the set of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in which Matt played Mr. Collins and James Elizabeth Bennet.\nIt was previously reported by The Mail On Sunday that Matt was dating businesswoman Caroline Brady in 2021 but they have not been pictured together since 2022.\nLily and Matt were notoriously private about their relationship before going official at the Milan premiere of Lily's film Cinderella in 2015.\nShe later quashed rumours of a proposal, telling The Sun on Sunday: 'We're not engaged yet. But it's going very well.'\nThe pair split in 2019 owing to 'hectic' work schedules before briefly rekindling their romance during the first Covid lockdown in which they self-isolated together at the north London home they had shared.\nHowever, they split for good in October 2020, with sources claiming they 'realised they'd be better off as friends.'\n\nFor the outing Matt dressed casually in a light blue jumper and dark trousers, while Emma opted for a chic all-white outfit\n\nIn July 2023 Matt was spotted in a clinch with actress Emma outside a pub near his North London home\n\nEmma teamed her trendy linen shirt with jeans and a pair of stylish black shoes \n\nEmma was most recently seen in the film 28 Years Later (seen at the London premiere earlier this month)\n\nSeen with Emma in 2023 as they enjoyed a close clinch\nBefore that he dated several famous women including Billie Piper, Brazilian actress Mayana Moura and model Daisy Lowe.\nIn July 2023 Matt was spotted in a clinch with actress Emma outside a pub near his North London home.\n\n Matt Smith, 40, lives it up with actress Emma Laird, 25, as they leave Chiltern Firehouse just minutes apart... four months after being spotted in a clinch on pub date \nThe couple spent hours chatting and laughing together, and at one point they were seen gazing into one another's eyes as they drank and smoked at a picnic table.\nAnd at around midnight, the pair headed off into the evening together. An onlooker said at the time: 'They were both looking in great spirits, enjoying several drinks al fresco until the late hours.\n'They seemed to have great chemistry, and once the lights were switched off, they disappeared together.'\nJust a month later in August of that summer Matt enjoyed a cosy date with his rumoured girlfriend Lili Gattyan at a restaurant in Marylebone.\nAn onlooker told The Sun at the time: 'They appeared close and were laughing and joking. He had his dog with him and people stopped by for a chat.'\nLili, who owns a swimwear brand Eunoia, 'looked like she was having a ball', added the onlooker.\nWhile Matt remains tight-lipped over his romance, he recently spoke about his desire to start a family, saying: 'I do think that's what life is all about in the end. Children. Making a family...\n'You know, when you're dead, and you're on the slab, that's what'll count'.\nMeanwhile, Emma's star is on the rise, as she has starred in the Apple TV+ series The Crowded Room, and in Kenneth Branagh's A Haunting In Venice, her feature film debut, in the past few years.\n\nMatt has been largely single since he split from Lily James in December 2019 after more than five years together, though they remain friends (the former couple are pictured in 2015)\nShe most recently starred in 28 Years Later. \nThe former model first came to prominence as an actress in American TV drama Mayor Of Kingstown, where she played the key role of an escort employed by the Russian mafia.\nIn 2023 it was rumoured that she was in a relationship with Taylor Swift's ex Joe Alwyn, after filming The Brutalist with him in Hungary.\nOn Instagram, she shared a picture of the actor on a scooter during a night out, along with a caption that read: 'Moments in March,' accompanied by a red heart emoji.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily James' ex Matt Smith, 42, steps out with former flame Emma Laird, 26, - two years after being spotted in a clinch on pub date\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Good riddance.\n\nBecause most of the truly bad ideas in American government start in or around New York City, it is worth taking a moment to think about what Mr. Mamdani’s victory might mean for those of us who live elsewhere.\n\nIt’s important not to read too much into any single election. That said, the most simple and enduring rule in campaigns is that something always beats nothing. Mr. Cuomo didn’t bother to explain what he intended to do as mayor; he just collected endorsements and cash (about $30 million). In contrast, whatever you think of his ideas, Mr. Mamdani, a New York state representative, aggressively presented a coherent and fairly thorough set of policies that he believes will improve the quality of life of New Yorkers.\n\nThose ideas are, of course, what we are going to spend the next few months discussing. Mr. Mamdani wants the city to run grocery stores, provide “free” child care and “free” mass transit, set the minimum wage at $30 per hour, freeze rents, defund the police, globalize the intifada, etc.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a city where residents already pay the highest taxes in the nation, a city that has surrendered to shoplifters (locking goods in cabinets), criminals, fare jumpers, vagrants living in the transit system, failing schools, illegal immigrants housed in midtown hotels on the taxpayer tab and more.\n\nFor Democrats, a Mamdani campaign will be a nightmare. Even if he loses, he is not going away; his agenda and rhetoric will set the tone for the party into the 2026 election cycle. Should he win, which is certainly possible — and may be likely given that the city broke for Vice President Kamala Harris by 38 percentage points in November — he will be the best-known Democrat in the United States well into the 2028 presidential election cycle. Consequently, his agenda will be the de facto starting point for Democrats for some time.\n\nThat makes sense. All the energy in the Democratic Party is found on the farthest leftward part of the spectrum and has been for at least a decade. The “moderates” — the ones who want only half your money and are willing to tolerate 10 million illegal immigrants but no more — have been marginalized for obvious reasons. Why buy a bad copy when you can buy the original?\n\nMr. Mamdani is a faithful representative of the new Democratic Party, a party that is culturally at war with most of America, especially working-class America, a party whose identity is now entirely associated with all the worst impulses of the left. That is a lovely gift for a Republican Party that is having trouble finding its north star on policy and is likely to have an identity crisis of its own in 2028.\n\nCandidates and elected officials like Mr. Mamdani also will make things infinitely easier for President Trump as he sails toward the last few years of his tenure and provide perfect foils for Republican presidential primary contestants in 2028.\n\nAs for the people of New York City? One of the most difficult and durable rules of life is that you really can’t help people who refuse to help themselves. Some residents, like Mr. Trump, will join the diaspora and leave the city, which may lose as many as three congressional seats after the next reapportionment and which has already lost 800,000 people in the past five years.\n\nThey will move, as they have done for years, to the South and West and will immediately start annoying their neighbors by complaining that their new community is not as good as New York. But none of them will ever go home.\n\n• Michael McKenna is a contributing editor at The Washington Times. He was born and raised in New York City.","summary":"Mamdani is a gift to Trump and the Republican Party","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jun/29/mamdani-gift-trump-republican-party/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/28/McKenna_AH.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 17:01:36","author":"Michael McKenna","authors":["Michael McKenna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":336890796,"title":"15 Sneaky Moves Pulled by Trump That&#8217;ll Have A Grave Impact You","text":"It seems like everyday since President Donald Trump took office, breaking news headlines continue to flood the media. And in the midst of the downpour of current events, one day, you just might miss something that'll have a major impact on your everyday life.\n\nFrom attacks on Black history to Trump's attempt to alter the U.S. Constitution, there's no telling what will come next, and as the president continues his self-proclaimed mandate to reshape the country-- and history-- it's important Americans everywhere stay vigilant. Here's 15 \"fine print\" moves by the Trump administration that you might've missed in the last six months. \n\nQuietly Rewriting History\n\nIn efforts to purge all diversity in the government, the Trump administration faced backlash after Civil Rights icon and former Brooklyn Dodgers' player Jackie Robinson's military service was erased from the Department of Defense database, according to ESPN. The Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee airmen and the Marines at Iwo Jima were also among the president's erasure of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Although the move was ultimately reversed, this shady attempt to rewrite history drew bipartisan criticism.\n\nBirthright Citizenship\n\nGenerations after the 14th Amendment was added to the historic legislation, the Trump administration now argues birthright citizenship is not Constitutional. By definition, a person born on U.S. soil is automatically a U.S. citizen. Folks like former Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and even Bruce Lee have their citizenship under this Amendment. As part of his January storm of executive orders, Trump attacked the 14th Amendment, and months later, he is still fighting to get it removed. On June 27, the U.S. Supreme Court voted to lift temporary blocks against Trump's order-- meaning the president is just one step closer to his wish being granted, according to NPR.\n\nCuts to Medicaid\n\nTrump spent most of his campaign and early second term promising not to cut Medicaid, but surprise, surprise... that was not the full truth. In his Big, Beautiful Bill Act-- the 1,000-page spending bill drawing criticism from Democrats and Republicans-- drastic cuts to Medicaid are promised. As of June 30, the bill sits in the House of Representatives, waiting for approval. If it passes, the more than 71 million Americans will be impacted. Of those, about 20 percent are Black Americans, according to Medicaid Awareness. \n\nHiring WWE CEO to Take Down DOE\n\nPresident Trump vowed to dismantle the Department of Education, and he started his agenda by slyly appointing Linda McMahon to run the show. McMahon has a brief background in education. In fact, she was nominated to serve on the Connecticut State Board of Education in 2009, according to ABC News. But unfortunately, that's where her expertise stops. Before she was picked by Trump, McMahon founded WWE with her husband Vincent. As one of the most questionable picks in Trump's cabinet, McMahon has made it her mission to fulfill the president's agenda, no matter the cost. The DOE provides financial assistance to states and school districts, most notably in Title I grants for low-income schools and special education funding. Without it, Black and brown students, who are typically the most vulnerable -- will likely have limited protections and assistance as they progress in the American educational system. \n\nSuspending $19 Million HBCU Scholarship\n\nRemember in February when Trump's national spending freeze left billions of dollars in allocated funds suspended in the air? Well, while most folks were worried about food stamps, Medicaid and FEMA funding, our HBCUs were dealing with the harsh consequences of the blitz. The federal government suspended a scholarship program giving $19 million to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), according to AL.com. The 1890 Scholarship Program allowed lower income students to chase their educations goals at their dream HBCUs. Shortly after, a judge ordered the Trump administration to restore the program. \n\nDefying Judge Orders\n\nSince the beginning of his second term, Trump has faced legal backlash from federal judges who claim his actions are illegal or unconstitutional. In several cases-- like when a judge ordered him to turn around a plane full of alleged Venezuelan gang members-- Trump took a sneaky route either claiming his hands were tied or just flat out ignoring the ruling. In the case of the ICE plane, the administration claimed since the flights were over international waters, the judges order did not apply, according to ABC News. \n\nSuspending the Jobs Corps\n\nAs we previously reported, the Department of Labor announced all Job Corps centers will pause operations by Monday (June 30). The program provides free education and vocational training to Americans within the ages of 16 and 24. The Root spoke with Illinois attorney Henderson Banks, who claimed Trump's dismantling of the program was illegal. \"What the Trump administration and the Department of Labor is doing is not what legislation stated or enacted for the program or certain job sites to be dismantled,\" Banks said. \"There's an administrative process that was not followed, which gives those contractors who received and depended on funding a claim against the Trump administration and the Department of Labor to sue the government.\" A judge has since issued an order allowing for Job Corps operations to continue. \n\nSneaky Tax Cuts\n\nThe biggest right-wing appeal of the Big, Beautiful Bill is its promised tax cuts for the wealthy. As the wealth gap in the country continues to widen, Trump’s tax cuts prove to be another handout for the richest Americans—most of whom are white, according to data from the Pew Research Center. On the other hand, Trump’s cuts will likely increase the racial divide in the country. A 2024 study conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found corporate tax cuts disproportionately benefit white households because white people disproportionately own corporate stocks and bonds, unlike Black households.\n\n$1 Billion Cuts to Mental Health Programs in Schools\n\nAs a part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, $1 billion was allocated to increase the amount of mental health professionals in schools, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump's administration cut it completely citing concerns about a DEI focus among providers, according to Education Week. To be expected, the decision was immediately met with criticism from mental health advocates and education professionals, who argued without these programs, students will likely suffer the consequences. In 2023, around 53 percent of Black students said they experienced some sort of depression, according to AP News. \n\nA Pause on USDA Inspections of Meat\n\nIn a post-COVID world and during the height of the bird flu, which saw historic prices of eggs, Trump and DOGE's reorganizing of the government also led to questionable moves in the FDA. The organization is reportedly still in a shift of most routine food safety inspections to state and local authorities, according to CBS News. In an attempt to cut down on government spending, many critics argued the quality and safety of food standards would have a grave impact on Americans nationwide. The FDA stated inspections will continue during the reorganization, but already DOGE layoffs and inconsistencies from the administration pose a threat.\n\n‘Restriction on Enforcement’\n\nOn page 544 of the 1,082-page bill, a hidden provision called the “Restriction on Enforcement” has the potential to officially upend the checks and balances system. Under SEC. 70302, more restrictions against U.S. judges who push back on Trump’s orders are on the table. The administration has been sued, blocked and threatened with contempt in court by judges fearing Trump’s orders are unconstitutional. If the bill passes in the House, then this small section would likely benefit Trump’s deportation agenda and his anti-DEI push.\n\nRolling Back on Climate Change Legislation\n\nOn his very first day in office, Trump rescinded several Biden-era initiatives aimed at addressing growing climate change concerns pushing for clean energy, making its development more difficult and expensive. And as the racial gap widens, Black communities will continue to be devastated by harsh weather conditions. Black Americans are at greater risk of experiencing natural disasters because of concentrated populations in extreme weather environments, like in Black cities like St. Louis and Houston, according to McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility.\n\nExecutive Order to Cancel 'Sesame Street'\n\nDespite the president's continuous claims of media bias and \"fake news\" in the nation, he is still fighting to put an end to-- wait for it-- \"Sesame Street.\" In May, he signed an executive order to get rid of government funding for PBS and NPR. \"It’s the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with,\" PBS said in response. Instead of setting his target on media machines with clear bias, Trump insisted PBS and NPR posed dangerous threats and were poisoning the youth. In response, both organizations have sued the administration. \n\nTrump's Attacks South African President\n\nHoping to recreate that White House moment with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump's public meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa turned into calculated attempt to corner him. Trump came ready with a PowerPoint presentation, a stack of documents, a horrific video and several false claims of a white genocide going on in the African nation. Although Ramaphosa chose to go high, denying Trump's lies and trying to focus the Oval Office discussion on trade and a technological partnership, the U.S. president persisted. The meeting came one week after Trump welcomed 60 Afrikaners-- white South Africans-- to the country with refugee status. Critics of the move argued it was a slap in the face to Black and brown migrants who Trump has demonized over the past decade.\n\nAI Regulation in Big, Beautiful Bill Act\n\nIn a world where artificial intelligence is growing rapidly and unexpectedly, the Trump administration is offering scary regulations-- or lack there of-- to AI. In the Republican-led spending bill, one provision aims to ban state regulation of AI, and even Republicans are upset about it. Ga. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene came out saying she opposes the provision because it violates states’ rights. This was of course after she voted to pass the bill to the House, admitting she didn't read that part. But if the very people elected to read and review proposed legislation have confessed to being unaware of the very small, fine print, then Americans should probably be paying even closer attention to what's at stake.","summary":"From cutting the Job Corps to sneaking in scary artificial intelligence regulation, many fear Trump is trying to distract Americans with an onslaught of questionable moves. \n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/15-sneaky-moves-pulled-by-trump-thatll-have-a-grave-imp-2000047948","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/30164155/GettyImages-2222468342-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 16:55:41","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":336819844,"title":"The last words and final moments of 40 presidents","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nthe explainer\n\nThe last words and final moments of 40 presidents\n\nSome are eloquent quotes worthy of the holders of the highest office in the nation, and others... aren't\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'I'm trying to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris'\n\n(Image credit: Illustration by Julia Wytrazek / Getty Images)\n\nDavid Faris, The Week Staff \n\n30 June 2025\n\nAmerican presidents have met their end in virtually every way known to human beings, some suddenly in hails of gunfire, some shortly after leaving office and some of old age years or even decades after their time as the country's leader. There is no official office that certifies the last words of presidents, and because much of what we know about the leaders of the early American Republic is secondhand or perhaps even altogether apocryphal, there is a considerable amount of guesswork involved in reconstructing the last moments of some of the most powerful men who have ever lived. And of course, not all of them were in any condition to offer last words. Some, like Ronald Reagan, were in the final throes of Alzheimer's, and others, like 100-year-old Jimmy Carter, were no longer able to communicate from their deathbeds.\n\nGiven the importance that even the least well-regarded presidents have had on U.S. and world history, there is value in interpreting their parting thoughts for future generations to ponder. For better or worse, these are the 40 men who have had the unique honor and responsibility of serving as president of the United States and who are no longer with us. Some had regrets, while others had none, and many expected another chapter on a different plane. As far as we can tell, none expected it to be hell, although perhaps several of them should have.\n1.

John Adams\n\"Thomas Jefferson survives.\" What Adams didn't know was that Jefferson had actually passed away several hours earlier.\n\n3. Thomas Jefferson\nHis last recorded words are \"No, doctor, nothing more,\" but the three people present at the time of his death all noted that he either stated or asked about the date shortly before his death. The date: July 4, of course. History likes to remember him as closing out his time on earth with this fitting speech: \"Is it the Fourth? I resign my spirit to God, my daughter, and my country.\"\n4. James Madison\n\"Nothing more than a change of mind, my dear.\" It was his response when one of his nieces asked him \"What is the matter?\"\n5. James Monroe\n\"I regret that I should leave this world without again beholding him\" — \"him\" being James Madison, one of his best friends.\n6. John Quincy Adams\n\"This is the last of Earth. I am content.\" JQA actually had a stroke on the floor of the House of Representatives and died in the Speaker's Room in the Capitol Building.\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\"I hope to meet each of you in heaven. Be good, children, all of you, and strive to be ready when the change comes.\"\n8. Martin Van Buren\n\"There is but one reliance.\"\n9. William Henry Harrison \nSpoken to Veep John Tyler: \"I understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.\"\n10. John Tyler\n\"Perhaps it is best.\"\n11. James K. Polk\n\"I love you, Sarah. For all eternity, I love you.\" Sarah, as you might have already assumed, was his wife. She lived for another 42 years.\n12. Zachary Taylor\n\"I regret nothing, but I am sorry to leave my friends.\"\n13. Millard Fillmore\n\"The nourishment is palatable.\" He was commenting about some soup he had just been fed.\n14. Franklin Pierce\nNo last words seem to have been recorded for Pierce, though given his tragic life, perhaps they were words of relief that it was finally ending.\n15. James Buchanan\n\"Oh, Lord God Almighty, as thou wilt!\"\n16. Abraham Lincoln\n\"She won't think anything about it.\" His remark was to his wife, who was wondering what their female theater companion would think if she saw Mary Todd \"hanging\" on her husband so.\n17. Andrew Johnson\n\"Oh, do not cry. Be good children and we shall meet in heaven.\" Rather similar to Andrew Jackson's last words, aren't they?\n18. Ulysses S. Grant\n\"Water.\" Grant was suffering from throat cancer and couldn't speak much, but he did write something more poignant shortly before his death: \"There was never one more willing to go than I am.\"\n19. Rutherford B. Hayes\n\"I know I am going where Lucy is.\" His wife, teetotaling \"Lemonade\" Lucy, had died four years before.\n20. James Garfield\n\"Swaim, can't you stop the pain?\" Garfield, who had been shot by an assassin months before, was napping in his room in the company of good friends General David Swaim and Colonel A.F. Rockwell.\n21. Chester A. Arthur\nThey're not recorded, but a friend said his \"almost\" last words were, \"Life is not worth living.\"\n22. Grover Cleveland\n\"I have tried so hard to do right.\"\n23. Benjamin Harrison\n\"Are the doctors here? Doctor, my lungs...\" Harrison died of pneumonia.\n24. William McKinley\n\"Goodbye, all, goodbye. It is God's way. His will be done.\"\n25. Teddy Roosevelt\n\"Put out the light.\" He was speaking to his valet right before he went to sleep. He died sometime during the night.\n26. William Howard Taft\nHis words were not recorded for posterity.\n27. Woodrow Wilson\n\"When the machinery is broken... I am ready.\"\n28. Warren G. Harding\n\"That's good. Go on, read some more.\" His wife had been reading him an article about himself from the Saturday Evening Post.\n29. Calvin Coolidge\n\"Good morning, Robert.\" He greeted a carpenter working on his house, then died of coronary thrombosis shortly thereafter.\n30. Herbert Hoover\nWe don't know the last words he spoke, but the last words he is known to have written were a get-well message to Harry Truman, who hit his head on the bathtub after slipping in his bathroom. In a telegram, Hoover wrote, \"Bathtubs are a menace to ex-presidents for as you may recall a bathtub rose up and fractured my vertebrae when I was in Venezuela on your world famine mission in 1946. My warmest sympathy and best wishes for your speedy recovery.\"\n31. Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n\"I have a terrific headache.\" He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage a few minutes later.\n32. Harry Truman\nTruman's last words are unknown.\n33. Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\"I want to go. God take me.\"\n34. John F. Kennedy\n\"No, you certainly can't.\" Kennedy said this in response to his fellow passenger, Nellie Connally, the wife of Gov. John Connally. She had just remarked, \"You certainly can't say that the people of Dallas haven't given you a nice welcome, Mr. President.\" You'll occasionally read that Kennedy's last words were \"My God, I've been hit.\"\n35. Lyndon B. Johnson\n\"Send Mike immediately.\" Mike was his Secret Service agent who was housed in a compound 100 yards away from the main house at Johnson's Texas ranch. When agents arrived in Johnson's bedroom, he was already dead.\n36. Richard Nixon\n\"Help.\" He said this to a housekeeper as he had a stroke in 1994. Though he remained alert for a period of time after he was taken to the hospital, he was unable to speak.\n37. Gerald Ford\nGerald Ford's last words are not known.\n38. Ronald Reagan\nReagan's last words have not been shared with the public, but his daughter Patti shared his final moments:\n\"At the last moment when his breathing told us this was it, he opened his eyes and looked straight at my mother. Eyes that hadn't opened for days, did. And they weren't chalky or vague. They were clear, and blue, and full of love. If a death can be lovely, his was. In his last moment, he taught me that there is nothing stronger than love between two people, two souls... It was the last thing he could do in this world to show my mother how entwined their souls are... and it was everything.\"\n39. Jimmy Carter\nCarter, who lived longer than any other president, had been in hospice, and his last confirmed words were in response to his son Chip asking if he was trying to live to 100. \"No,\" said Carter, \"I'm trying to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris.\" He got his wish, although he was surely unhappy with the outcome.\n40. George H.W. Bush \nIn the final minutes before his death in 2018, George H.W. Bush's eldest son, former President George W. Bush, called and told him that he loved him and that he had been a \"wonderful Dad.\" George H.W. Bush's last words were therefore a simple reply: \"I love you, too.\"\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week Staff\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\n'More must be done'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nAre masked ICE agents America's new secret police?\n\nToday's Big Question\nCritics say masks undermine trust in law enforcement\n\nDoes buy now, pay later affect your credit score?\n\nthe explainer\nThe company behind the FICO score is going to start including a person's 'buy now, pay later' payment history in its credit models\n\nYou might also like\n\n'The arts are not just expressions of creativity'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\n'Postal commemoration is especially befitting'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nSmithsonian asserts its autonomy from Trump\n\nThe DC institution defied Trump's firing of National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet\n\n'Art is one of humanity's great empathic mediums'\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nThe JFK files: the truth at last?\n\nIn The Spotlight\nMore than 64,000 previously classified documents relating the 1963 assassination of John F.

Andrew Cuomo (D) should be primaried.\nEven before Mamdani’s win, young Democrats said Hogg’s high-profile ouster from DNC leadership could be a good thing for the progressive movement.\n\nThe Hill article noted that Hogg’s organization called Leaders We Deserve has been working to get younger progressives elected.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in 2024, a 22-year-old former DNC delegate said she was quitting the Democrat Party and planned to vote for President Donald Trump, per Breitbart News.\n\nAudrey McNeal said in part:\n\nYou see, after I was elected in March which was before Joe Biden’s debate, I wanted to go to the DNC because I wanted answers on free speech issues, the border, and the economy. However, reflecting on my time at the DNC I realized it was no longer the party of free speech and civil liberties it used to be. In fact, Patrick Henry once said, ‘The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.’ And for the rulers of the Democratic Party elite to install Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee via stripping the vote of 14 million Americans including their own delegates such as myself, well that was a decision and a transaction that was concealed. And now I’m happy to say that I’m officially joining the Republican Party as a constitutional conservative.\n\nThe news about Hogg comes as the Democrat party is reportedly experiencing “bad vibes” and infighting as it faces mounting problems, per Breitbart News.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent CBS News Poll showed most Democrats felt “frustrated” when it came to how their party was handling Trump’s presidency, the Breitbart News article stating that “Democrats remain in disarray, and they know it.”\n\n“All of this comes as internal polling shows the Democrat Party is in a complete brand collapse,” the report concluded.","summary":"Many younger Democrats reportedly believe gun control activist David Hogg's ouster from his role with the Democrat National Convention (DNC) is a positive thing for the future of a party that lacks clear leadership.\n\n\nThe post Report: Young Democrats Believe Activist David Hogg Is Gaining Power Outside DNC appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/30/report-young-democrats-believe-activist-david-hogg-is-gaining-power-outside-dnc/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/david-hogg-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 15:49:14","author":"Amy Furr","authors":["Amy Furr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":336775186,"title":"No state is safe: Trans people are planning to move overseas rather than live in Trump’s America","text":"Isabella remembers the moment she knew she needed to leave the U.S. It was March 2023, when Daily Wire host Michael Knowles gave a chilling speech to one of the most influential conservative gatherings in the country.\n\n\"There can be no middle way in dealing with transgenderism.

In the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decision in US v Skrmetti, which upheld Tennessee and other red states' rights to ban transition healthcare for minors, four trans people told The Independent that the case had solidified their plans to escape the USA.\n\nLike every single person interviewed for this story, Isabella would only speak under a pseudonym out for fear of reprisals from far-right extremist groups, or perhaps even government officials.\n\nAnd while the Skrmetti decision only concerned trans children, those who spoke to The Independent feared that the Court's reasoning could make it easier to restrict trans healthcare for adults too — as Republicans are already trying to do nationally.\n\n\"Before the 2024 election, my timeline for relocating abroad was more like five to ten years out, if at all.

Knowles likened them to \"demons.\" One Republican candidate claimed pro-trans teachers should be \"executed.\" Multiple serving GOP legislators have falsely claimed that random mass shooting suspects are trans, while Donald Trump Jr has alleged — contrary to all available evidence — that trans people are \"the most violent domestic terror threat\" in the country.\n\nThen came Donald Trump's second inauguration, and his blitzkrieg effort to centralize federal power under the office of the president. Since then migration has become a regular topic among trans people both online and in person, along with acidic social media debates about the ethics and class politics of fleeing one’s country.\n\n\"My plans for emigration have been in a holding pattern,” said one trans lawyer in her forties, who began transitioning roughly 25 years ago and is now considering leaving the country.\n\n\"Getting all the documents and background checks and apostilles to be able to move, and contacting contractors... but not making any decisions yet in the increasingly vain hope that abandoning my family and home country won’t become a necessity,” she said.\n\n\"This [Skrmetti] decision definitely made me get back into planning mode.

But now, “it almost feels like a blue state can’t save us.”\n\nMultiple groups have sprung up to help trans people migrate, either within the U.S. or internationally. Some are open and legally incorporated, such as the Denver-based non-profit Trans Continental Pipeline. \"At the heart of it, we’re glorified movers, trying to help people get where they want to go and out of traumatic situations,\" founder Keira Richards told Mother Jones last year.\n\nOther groups are more secretive and ad-hoc, fearful of attacks and harassment by anti-trans extremists.\n\n\"We’ve had a few people today contact us and/or announce their desire to emigrate faster from the USA, considering the broader implications of this ruling,\" a member of one such group told The Independent.\n\n\"People of course are stockpiling hormones and getting passports in order if they can... I can tell you our top destinations are Canada, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Thailand, and the Netherlands in particular.\"\n\nThe group includes trans people in countries across the world, this person said, including some lawyers who help people understand the implications of new U.S. anti-trans policies. In some places, they have contacts who can help trans immigrants get settled in and find community.\n\nGroup members gather and share information on immigration pathways, visa requirements, and the level of freedom and protection available to trans people in various countries.\n\n‘We’ve read our history books. We know where this goes’\n\nThe story of one trans woman we’ll call Rachel illustrates how individual areas and then the entire USA have become progressively more hostile to trans people. Back in 2023, having already moved from the Tennessee countryside where she grew up to the big city of Nashville, she felt forced to flee her home state entirely.\n\n\"At that time I was highly skeptical that it would ever get to the point where I had to emigrate,\" Rachel told The Independent. \"I have to say that I completely stand corrected.\"\n\nInitially, Nashville had felt safe enough for her to finally transition. But beginning in around 2020, when conservative news site The Daily Wire moved its headquarters to Nashville, she felt a major \"tonal shift.\"\n\nRelatives who'd once been supportive began to turn against her. Nazi flyers were stuffed into her mailbox. She received \"direct threats\" from people she believes were probably her neighbors, and suffered repeated housing discrimination despite having a steady income. Daily Wire host Matt Walsh, a prominent anti-trans activist, held a \"rally to end child mutilation\" at the state capitol.\n\nIn March 2023, on the same day Tennessee's Republican governor Bill Lee signed the healthcare ban at the heart of the Skrmetti case, someone draped a huge swastika-emblazoned banner from a Nashville bridge thanking him for \"tirelessly working to fight trannies and fags.\" At another point, Rachel recalls, someone projected the words \"TRANS-FREE TENNESSEE\" on a local building.\n\nRachel even had a brush with Skrmetti himself: that is, Tennessee's attorney general Jonathan Skrmetti, against whom the Supreme Court lawsuit was filed. In 2022 he demanded detailed patient records from Rachel's trans healthcare provider Vanderbilt University, leading to accusations that he was trying to compile a \"list\" of trans people.\n\n\"Skrmetti seems like the ghost that will hound me for the rest of my life,\" complained Rachel. \"It's always Tennessee! It’s a state out of which the current manifestation of conservative politics has grown. And I was there to witness it.”\n\nNow those politics have taken root in the White House, and Rachel is applying for citizenship in the foreign country where one of her parents was born — something she's always been eligible for, but only recently started seriously working on.\n\nFor her, the new Supreme Court decision changed nothing. But listening to the oral arguments before Trump’s inauguration, and anticipating which way the case would go, was part of what made her plan to leave in the first place.\n\nEven though she isn't totally sure whether she’ll go, Rachel wants to be ready at short notice. She keeps many of her belongings in storage, and has abandoned some of her hobbies for fear that the equipment would weigh her down.\n\n\"I think that everything is on the table at this point,\" she said. \"The same rhetorical patterns, in some cases precisely the same accusations, that are being levied at trans people were being levied at the Jewish population [in Nazi Germany].\n\n\"We've read our history books. We know the outcome of that is... I think it's naive to think that it's impossible in the United States.\"\n\n(Knowles, for his part, has insisted that his 2023 CPAC speech was not a call for cultural genocide against trans people because they are not a group with shared genetics, and also because they are \"not a legitimate category of being.\")\n\nTo Isabella, living in Chile has been both a challenge and a relief. She's still figuring out her medical care, still learning Spanish, still trying to meet new friends. \"Winter and summer are flipped, which is so weird to me,\" she said.\n\nNot everyone could have made the move, she notes. She was lucky enough to have some local contacts and a job that she could keep doing from her new country, as well as the financial resources necessary to uproot her life.\n\nBut she no longer has to deal with the daily drumbeat of assaults on her rights and unashamed demonization of her identity. \"You feel like you can breathe better, and you're not worried that you're gonna be the victim of some terrible attack,\" she said.\n\nEven so, she can't completely stop worrying. Conservative politicians across the world have found trans people a tempting punchbag, including in nearby Argentina. The feminist philosopher Judith Butler has argued that transphobia is a central element of modern fascism, from to Hungary to Brazil to the USA and beyond.\n\n\"You never know, these days, because transphobia is global,\" said Isabella. \"The question is, is it going to come to Chile? That's always a fear.

Thank you, Nebraska!\" Bacon announced Monday. Bacon's announcement comes as Congress works overtime to pass President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" by their self-imposed July 4 deadline. Through the reconciliation process, the megabill seeks to deliver on the president's key campaign promises, including tax cuts, immigration reform and energy production. The moderate Republican has built a reputation for bucking Trump's agenda in the House. While Bacon ultimately voted with his Republican colleagues to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last month, the Nebraska Republican had concerns about the impact of proposed Medicaid cuts. THOM TILLIS ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT FROM SENATE AFTER CLASH WITH TRUMP Bacon indicated earlier this month that he would vote against the White House's rescission proposal if it cuts an AIDS relief program. Last month, he was the only Republican who voted against a House bill to make Trump's name change for the Gulf of America permanent. Bacon, a loyal Ukraine supporter, has also criticized Trump's position on its war with Russia. REPUBLICAN REP INDICATES HE'S 'A NO' ON TRUMP-BACKED RESCISSIONS MEASURE Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., announced Sunday he would also not seek re-election next year. Like Bacon, Tillis has been willing to buck Trump and the Republican Party on key issues, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tillis was one of just two Republicans who voted against a procedural vote on the bill in the Senate this weekend. Bacon has represented Nebraska's second congressional district since 2017. He won re-election in 2024 by less than two percentage points. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won his district by almost five percentage points in 2024. Nebraska is one of just two states that splits its Electoral College votes in presidential elections by congressional district. Bacon's congressional district was already a high-target House seat for Democrats ahead of the competitive 2026 midterm elections. \"The writing has been on the wall for months,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Spokesperson Madison Andrus said on Friday.

People marched in protest of the results and many claimed the election process was rigged.\n\nThough President Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory, claiming the election was fraudulent, his legal challenges were unsuccessful.\n\nThe American nation ended up with an inept President Biden and even more inept Vice President Kamala Harris. Life in America in many respects became a struggle and much of what the Biden administration enacted was unacceptable.\n\nAnd God was busy in His own mysterious ways.\n\nPresident Biden started his tenure with a snub, by not inviting Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu to the White House in the first weeks or months of his presidency, as had been customary. Only on July 25, 2024, more than three years into Biden’s presidency, Biden invited PM Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House for the first time.\n\nEarlier in their terms, in September 2023, Biden and Netanyahu met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, in New York.\n\nBiden’s behavior raised many eyebrows in the political arena while God continued working in his own mysterious ways.\n\nOctober 7, 2023\n\nOn October 7, 2023, the terror group Hamas, a proxy of Iran, and Qatar’s beneficiary, launched a surprise and vicious coordinated attack from the Gaza Strip on southern Israel. The attack began with a rocket salvo fired into southern and central Israel, followed by ground, air, and sea infiltrations of Israel’s sovereign territory by Hamas, other militants, and Gaza civilians.\n\nThe attack resulted in the murder of 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel, and the kidnapping of 250 others. This was the deadliest single day in the state of Israel’s recent 76 year history and the worst mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nOctober 7th was in fact a gift to Israel’s survival; a wakeup call to all of Israel. The government and the people woke up from the dream of living in peace with people who want their demise and nothing else. They realized that Iran built a chokehold around their tiny state and the destruction of the country was near unless foreign policy changed dramatically.\n\nThe way of how to treat the axis of the surrounding enemies: Hamas to the south, Hezbollah to the north and Syria to the east must take a new path. And Iran, the head of this axis snake, must be dealt with as well.\n\nSwords of Iron War Began\n\nThe Hamas invasion into Israel and the extensive massacre of Israelis triggered the Israel-Hamas war code named “Swords Of Iron”. Hamas facing Israel’s military might also trigger Iran’s proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon to act. In solidarity with Iran’s other proxy Hamas, since October 8, 2023, it regularly fired rockets into Israel’s north.\n\nIsrael’s north and south were damaged badly and the residents of those two regions found themselves displaced refugees taking shelter in hotels all over Israel.\n\nNow Israel has to fight two fronts – south and north – while also protecting its eastern front with Syria, where Iran and Hezbollah were also operating.\n\nAnd God, in His mysterious ways, allowed the stirring trouble.\n\nEvents During Israel At War\n\nOn October 18, 2023, ten days into the war with Hamas, President Biden arrived in Israel, in a show of solidarity. During his visit, Biden met with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog; he also met with first responders and victims of the attack families. Biden’s visit aimed to demonstrate U.S. support for Israel, which is what the Israelis took it as, however that was not the case.\n\nSince that visit Biden acted as if Israel was his vassal state, under such status Israel could not exist. He used Israel’s dependency on the U.S. for weapons and political approval to be the nail in Israel’s war wheel.\n\nSince October 7, 2023, Biden’s top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was sent to Israel 11 times, each time with the aim to put pressure on Israel, to deliver Biden’s “DON’T” messages and to hamper the war efforts.\n\nPresident Biden issued “DON’T” warnings to Israel, particularly in the context of its military operations in Gaza. The primary “DON’T” related to Israel’s much needed ground invasion of Rafah, in southern Gaza.\n\nBiden threatened to stop sending bombs and artillery shells to Israel if such an invasion were to take place. This decision was based on his concerns that the invasion will impact on the civilian population in Rafah. Netanyahu managed to circumvent the “Don’t” and the IDF successfully captured Rafah which ended Hamas’ weapons smuggling train from Egypt, which borders Rafah.\n\nOther iteration of Biden’s “Don’t” targeted Jewish community expansion in Judea and Samaria and the process of facilitating humanitarian aid to the Gazans. In the latter the Biden administration provided “solutions” that failed miserably.\n\nThough at first Biden appeared to be in solidarity with Israel, he turned out to be very hostile to an American ally. He also put embargos on much needed weapons which Israel ordered and paid for from U.S. manufacturers.\n\nWhile Israel was fighting Hamas with unprecedented warfare conditions, which the terror group built since 2017, PM Netanyahu had a new front to face, the Biden administration hostilities. Netanyahu needed to dodge the hostile US behavior toward his war efforts as if he was avoiding getting wet by raindrops. The Israeli leader was trying to lead his country’s war efforts and the Biden administration was weakening it.\n\nAnd what was God doing? He knew what would take place next.\n\nTaking Out Hezbollah and the Fall of Syria\n\nFollowing the cross-border hostilities that began in October 8, 2023, in September 2024 the conflict with Hezbollah escalated, during which Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Iran’s principal proxy. A ceasefire agreement was announced on November 27, 2024.\n\nFollowing the fall of Hezbollah, on December 8, 2024, the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which relied much on Hezbollah’s support, collapsed during a major offensive spearheaded by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham opposition force.\n\nIsrael cleared the surrounding enemies’ bases for its next move.\n\nGod cleared the path to what comes next.\n\nPresidential Election 2024\n\nU.S. presidential election 2024 was nearing. According to interviews with Trump he was weighing a run again. His decision to run again was based on America’s much felt decline during the Biden 4-years in office. Trump’s mission was to save America, to put America first.\n\nUnfit to run again, the Democrat Party sent Biden home and placed acting Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential candidate.\n\nMr. Trump worked hard at this presidential run with four years of helpful experience to rely on. He placed people to make sure this election had integrity. The American people sought an honest election as well.\n\nMr. Trump won; he became the 47th president of the United States of America. With 270 out of 538 members of the Electoral College needed to win, Trump won 312 Electoral College votes; he also received 49.81% of the popular vote from 77,303,568 Americans.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, the 47th President Donald Trump swore allegiance to the United States of America.\n\nGod positioned His actors where He needed them to be: Donald Trump at the helm of the U.S. and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm of Israel.\n\nThe Domino Effect\n\nOn February 4, 2025, the 47th President Donald Trump invited Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. Unlike Biden’s discourteous behavior, Netanyahu was the first leader to have an audience with the newly reelected President Trump.\n\nFrom May 13 to 16, 2025, President Trump undertook the first major international trip of his second term, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The visit’s location, close to Israel, made people in Israel wonder why Mr. Trump did not swing by and land in Israel for a few hours. The rumors spread that there was daylight between the two leaders, they had a fall out. That was bogus.\n\nPresident Trump and PM Netanyahu see very much eye to eye and speak on the phone often. Both leaders publicly expressed their closeness and friendship.\n\nIsrael’s military, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and the US military Centcom Command, headed by General Michael “Erik” Kurilla often practice war maneuvers together.\n\nIn May 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed its concerns about Iran’s growing uranium stockpile enriched to near weapons-grade levels while it refused to cooperate fully with IAEA inspections. Iran’s continued enrichment activities and lack of transparency raise concerns about obviously malevolent intentions.\n\nIsrael’s own intelligence findings attested that Iran was very close to producing a nuclear warhead. This left Israel with no other option but to attack Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nSince the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and the wakeup call for a policy change, Israel worked on fine-tuning the plans it had for years, to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities before it achieved producing a nuclear warhead then it was too late to act.\n\nNetanyahu’s Life Mission\n\nIran’s “death to Israel” threats have been reverberating in Mr. Netanyahu’s head for 40 years while in or out as Israel’s leader.\n\nTo end Iran’s threat to Israel is Mr. Netanyahu’s life mission guided by his father – Benzion Netanyahu – and the Holocaust. As the current Prime Minister of the Jewish state, Israel, the “death to Israel” which Iran’s leaders chant is seen as a threat for a 2nd Holocaust. Netanyahu’s mission has been to stop Iran’s malicious plans and he expressed it very often in public forums.\n\nAlready ten years ago Netanyahu warned the Jewish world: “The threat is growing. The challenges for the Jewish people never stop. The number one threat to Israel and the Jewish people is Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Be strong and of good courage and fight back. Fight on Iran.”\n\nIran And U.S. Talks\n\nThe first round of high-level meetings between U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, mediated by Oman, took place in Oman on April 12, 2025. The second round of talks, also mediated by Oman, occurred in Rome on April 19, 2025. The discussions were described as constructive, with possible good outcomes.\n\nWhile president Trump was negotiating with Iran to dismantle its nuclear program Israel readiness to attack Iran was being finalized.\n\nPresident Trump and PM Netanyahu held secret coordination phone calls while their public announcements were based on encouraging Iran to accept peace.\n\nPresident Trump gave Iran 60-days to agree to dismantle its nuclear program. Iran failed to come to the table.\n\nIsrael Attack On Iran – June 13, 2025\n\nOn the 61st day, on June 13, 2025, Operation Rising Lion was launched by Israel against Iran. The operation’s focus was to disrupt or destroy Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile capabilities.\n\nSince Israel Air Force entered Iran’s air space it had damaged or destroyed much of the nuclear program facilities, ballistic missiles stockpile, and government symbol buildings as well as assassinated many nuclear scientists and military command.\n\nIDF Response To Iran\n\n20 IDF jets bombed Iran’s 2 F-5s, 8 launchers after 30+ missile barrage at Israel\n\nIn the first few days of the war, Israel achieved more than expected, causing irreversible damage near the hidden Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan nuclear facilities. To do more, Israel needed the US deep penetrating bombs it does not possess.\n\nThe Crescendo\n\nSince there were no longer talks between the U.S. and Iran envoys, President Trump gave Iran a warning to agree to his conditions or suffer the consequences within two weeks.\n\nThe chatter of if and when such an attack would take place was heard in Washington D.C. and Jerusalem.\n\nThe Surprise Attack\n\nPresident Trump kept a poker face. Only Mr. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu and very few trusted people around them knew when the attack was due to take place and how. The Iranians were bamboozled and totally unaware of what was coming their way.\n\nOn Sunday, June 22, 2025, codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. Air Force and Navy attacked three nuclear facilities in Iran: the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, the Natanz nuclear site and the Esfahan nuclear technology center.\n\nThe three facilities were precisely and successfully bombed by fourteen GBU-57A/B Mop 30,000-pound (14,000 kg) bombs, carried by and dropped from Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, and also with a separate barrage of Tomahawk missiles fired from a submarine.\n\nAll the participating U.S. planes and pilots returned home safely.\n\nAs of this writing, President Trump told the American nation – and the world – that “Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”\n\nAs for now, God rested. In His mysterious ways He directed Israel and the United States to make the people of Israel and the American people safer; also Planet Earth much safer.\n\nTrump temporary lost his presidency for a good reason. Ask God. October 7, 2023 Hamas massacre in Israel happened for a good reason as well. The answer to it is with God.\n\nWhen one does not understand why things happened the way they do, one should just accept that it is God who shuffles the cards. Because things happen for a reason.","summary":"I am a Jewess; I have a convinced belief in God.

Summers “never disappoints, does he?” Isabella M. Weber, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who signed a public letter endorsing Mamdani’s campaign proposals, told me during a lengthy conversation last week. Weber rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, when she called for government price controls and published detailed research about how big companies were taking advantage of the global emergency to raise their prices and profit margins. Responding to Summers’s comments, she said that describing Mamdani’s program as Trotskyite was “absurd” and didn’t tell us anything “about what Mamdani’s agenda is trying to get at.”\nIn the open letter, which The Nation published a few days before the primary, more than two dozen progressive economists from the United States and other countries described Mamdani’s policy platform as “a bold yet practical blueprint to tackle some of New York City’s most urgent challenges—above all, the cost of living.” Weber told me that she felt Mamdani “did very well in presenting himself as someone who stands up for the affordability of life and focusses on what I have been calling ‘essentials’—the stuff that people can’t do without: housing, food, transportation, and child care. If you can’t afford that stuff, you are really pushed to the margins of society.”\nWeber contrasted Mamdani’s proposals with the equivocations of Joe Biden’s Administration during the nationwide cost-of-living crisis that Donald Trump and other Republicans successfully exploited in last year’s election. She recounted how Biden, in his 2024 State of the Union speech, denounced corporations for capitalizing on a period of crisis by increasing their prices or reducing the size of their offerings, but then didn’t do much about it. After Kamala Harris replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, she proposed a federal ban on price gouging by food suppliers and grocery stores. But she subsequently rowed back on the issue, Weber recalled, “based on pressure from similar quarters that have been criticizing Mamdani’s campaign.”\nThe critique of Harris’s proposal was that price controls don’t work, and the same charge is being hurled at Mamdani’s call for a rent freeze on roughly a million rent-stabilized apartments. (The freeze wouldn’t apply to the city’s million or so market-rate apartments.) In a controversial column that favored Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani but took aim at both, the New York Times’ editorial board said that a rent freeze “could restrict housing supply and make it harder for younger New Yorkers and new arrivals to afford housing.” The argument is that, if landlords and developers see a rent freeze, they would be deterred from investing in new affordable housing. When I put this point to Weber, she said that it was important to realize that Mamdani’s call for a rent freeze is accompanied by a pledge to build an additional two hundred thousand rent-stabilized units over the next ten years; his campaign plans to accomplish this by expanding public investments, changing zoning laws, and fast-tracking planning approvals. “If you only do a rent freeze without insuring that you also build, I don’t think that’s a great idea,” Weber said. “Given the severeness of the affordability crisis in New York City, the combination of a rent freeze and an aggressive build-out of affordable housing is a good idea.”\nCreating more affordable housing is hardly a radical new mayoral goal, of course. In 2014, at the start of his eight-year tenure, Bill de Blasio also unveiled a plan to build or preserve two hundred thousand affordable apartments, and, in 2021, his administration announced that it had achieved this goal. Arguably, the most successful expansion of the city’s affordable-housing stock came with the construction of public-housing projects, which began during the Great Depression under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who established the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), and continued in the postwar decades. Subsequently, federal funding dried up, and public housing came to be associated with crime and other problems. In recent decades, New York’s mayors have built affordable housing primarily through public-private partnerships, in which for-profit and not-for-profit developers receive tax breaks and other forms of support for putting up buildings that are privately managed. Mamdani’s website says he will “recommit” to public housing, doubling the city’s investment in “major renovations of NYCHA housing” and using NYCHA-owned land, such as parking lots, as sites for more affordable housing—a proposal that de Blasio also championed.\nThat sounds sensible, and overdue, but the housing shortage facing the city is formidable: some recent studies say it needs to build as many as half a million new homes. Mamdani has put less emphasis on encouraging market-rate development. He has given a few nods to the “abundance” wing of the Democratic Party, such as pledging to eliminate parking minimums and encourage development around subway stations and other transport hubs. But the primary goal of his plan is to “unleash the public sector to build housing for the many.”\nAnother objective is to provide the city’s residents with cheap and healthy food. The Mamdani campaign says that its new grocery stores would operate in city-owned buildings in low-income areas that currently lack adequate options—so-called food deserts. It went on, “Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers.” Before moving to Massachusetts, Weber once lived in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she sometimes found it difficult to shop for healthy foods. “The price dimension”—of Mamdani’s proposal—“is important, but the other is the accessibility of nutritious food,” she said.\nIt’s important to note, as some media accounts haven’t, that Mamdani is proposing a pilot scheme of just five new stores—one in each borough. In a metropolis with more than fifteen thousand privately-owned supermarkets and grocery outlets, this seems like small beer. Nonetheless, Weber said that the experiment could be valuable. If it succeeded, it could be expanded, she noted, and ultimately it could encourage more competitive pricing in private stores: “If you have an alternative that is reliably cheap and doesn’t take advantage of opportunities to raise prices when they occur, that can change the pricing dynamic for whole sectors. That is potentially an important advantage that comes from having a public option.”\nIn many people’s minds, the term “public option” is associated with health care. But public transportation is a public option, too, and, as Weber pointed out, the proposal to make bus rides free fits in with Mamdani’s emphasis on basic needs. “Affordable transportation options are essential for your basic material well-being, to get to a job, make money, and earn a living,” she said. Some progressive thinkers and groups have extended the public option concept to other areas, including communications, financial services, and food retailing. In a recent article that cited Mamdani’s proposal on grocery stores, Becky Chao, the director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project, wrote, “Public options show what’s possible when governments respond to local communities’ needs and build real alternatives for their constituents, when we grapple with the imbalance of power in our economy, and focus on marketshaping solutions that constrain corporate power while building power for all Americans.” Of course, public options will only succeed if they deliver what they promise. For example, there’s no guarantee that city-run grocery stores would be able to provide cheaper and more nutritious foods. “That’s why you need a pilot,” Weber acknowledged. “To see if you can pull it off.”\nAnother of Mamdani’s proposals is more familiar to mainstream Democratic policymakers, and likely more consequential all around: universal child care. During the 2020 election campaign, Biden called for federally financed child care for all children aged three and four. After he was elected, he included a version of this proposal in his Build Back Better plan, which failed to make it through Congress after Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema opposed it. Mamdani, according to his website, is promising to provide “free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families.” This plan builds on de Blasio’s establishment of universal pre-K, which was the signature achievement of his mayoralty. Weber pointed to studies showing that child-care programs—which already exist in places like France, Sweden, and her native Germany—generate positive outcomes for parents and children alike. She said that the city at large would also benefit from them, because fewer families would be forced to leave when they have children. “I can think of three off the top of my head that moved out because it was completely impossible,” she said. “It’s really important for New York as a place.”\nThat’s surely true, but how realistic are Mamdani’s proposals? One obvious issue is cost. Earlier this year, the group New Yorkers United for Child Care released a plan for statewide universal coverage that it said would cost $12.7 billion a year. The Mamdani campaign hasn’t said how much its plan for the city would cost, but if it was half that figure it would expand the city budget by about five per cent. To help pay for his spending proposals, Mamdani says, he would raise the city income-tax rate by two percentage points for individuals earning more than a million dollars a year, and by increasing the state corporate tax rate to 11.5 per cent. Cuomo, pushing back on Mamdani’s proposals, claimed that the tax hikes would prompt many rich people and businesses to flee, thereby undermining the city’s tax base. At least one recent study of millionaire migration patterns suggests that the threat of tax flight has been exaggerated, but it’s certainly true that Mamdani, in order to get his tax proposals enacted, would need the support of Governor Kathy Hochul and the state legislature. “They wouldn’t only have to support it—they’d have to initiate it,” a longtime state official and observer of Albany politics, told me. “And it’s great to say you are going to introduce free bus rides in New York City, but you don’t run the M.T.A., which runs the buses. The governor appoints most of the M.T.A.’s board.”\nFinancial experts say that Mamdani would also have to get state approval for the extra seventy billion dollars in municipal-bond issues that he is proposing in order to pay for his affordable-housing program. These realities of New York politics partly reflect the state’s constitution, originally adopted in 1777, which devolved some but by no means all powers of self-government to the city. The next mayor, like so many of his predecessors, will have to engage in awkward negotiations with politicians in Albany. This isn’t necessarily a hopeless position. The official noted that de Blasio, after being elected in 2013, eventually received a good deal of state funding for his electoral platform, which included universal pre-K. And this de Blasio success came despite the fact that he had an awkward relationship with Cuomo, who was then governor. “It’s normal Albany politics—the haggling, the back-and-forth,” the observer said, adding that Mamdani “has a good chance to get a good chunk of his agenda through, but he’s unlikely to get everything.”\nThat’s only one assessment, of course. Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business leadership group that represents about three hundred companies in the city, gave me another one. Since the primary election, Wylde said, she has been spending a lot of time reassuring senior executives that Mamdani wouldn’t have the authority to push through his proposals, particularly the tax ones, “so they don’t freak out and move.” Wylde went on, “We have every confidence that the Governor will make clear to him that his tax agenda is a non-starter.”\nWeber questioned the notion that wealthy people could leave New York en masse. She said that having an apartment in a desirable part of Manhattan is a status symbol that they value highly, and she added that folks on more modest incomes are more sensitive to rising costs. “If rent costs become too high, and transportation and food, they do end up leaving. For the super-rich, the calculus is completely different.”\nShe did grant that Mamdani will face some major obstacles if he gets elected, but that hasn’t sapped her enthusiasm for his candidacy, which she regards as a model not just for New York mayoral hopefuls but for any politician seeking to counter the rise of Trump and other right-wing populists.\nAt the end of our conversation, I asked Weber how she would describe Zohranomics. As municipal socialism, perhaps? Or municipal Rooseveltism? “I’m not sure we need to search for ‘isms’ here,” she replied. “If anything, it is a very effective form of antifascist economic policy. We are at a moment where the crisis of economic security, of affordability, that comes with basic questions of dignity and identity are being used by the far right in ways that fuel the return of fascist tendencies. I think that having an agenda that is laser-focussed on the needs of ordinary people is what we need, and that is basically where the Democrats fell flat last year. At the federal level and the global level, we are dealing with the consequences of that lack of vision right now.” ♦","summary":"As some Wall Street billionaires melt down over Zohran Mamdani’s policy platform, a prominent progressive economist argues that it meets the moment.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-case-for-zohranomics","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/685ee8e0215595a38dd030cb/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Cassidy_Zohran.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 10:00:00","author":"John Cassidy","authors":["John Cassidy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":336634938,"title":"Trump won election thanks to Catholic and Protestant vote, new study finds with evidence","text":"(ZENIT News / Washington, 06.29.2025).- 8 months after the U.S. election that gave Trump victory, a new study reveals how decisive the Catholic, Evangelical and Protestant vote is with facts and not just hypotheses.\n\nDonald Trump made significant gains among a wider spectrum of religious Americans in the 2024 presidential election—reaching beyond his core evangelical base to secure more support from Catholics and non-evangelical Protestants, including minority groups, according to a new Pew Research Center study released June 26, 2025.\n\nBased on a robust sample of 7,100 validated voters—those confirmed to have actually voted—Pew’s analysis shows that Trump captured 62% of the Protestant vote in 2024, up three points from 2020. Among Catholics, he saw a notable six-point increase, drawing 55% of their support. These gains helped him clinch a comeback victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, who represented the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe most striking development, however, was Trump’s surge among racial minority Protestants—particularly Hispanic and Asian Protestants, who are not typically considered part of his political stronghold. He won 70% of their votes, up from 55% in 2020. Even among Black Protestants, a demographic still overwhelmingly loyal to Democrats, Trump improved his share from 9% to 15%.\n\n“This tells us Trump successfully expanded his coalition,” said John Green, senior fellow and former director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics. “He kept his core of white Christian support and reached out more effectively to Hispanic and Asian Protestant communities.”\n\nHarris dominated among religiously unaffiliated voters—atheists, agnostics, and those who claim no religious identity—winning 70% of their votes. That number underscores an enduring cultural divide in American politics: one marked not only by policy but by identity, belief, and community belonging.\n\nAmong voters who attend religious services monthly or more, Trump prevailed nearly two-to-one. That group, though shrinking in proportion to the general population, remains a reliably high-turnout bloc. The study showed 64% of them voted for Trump in 2024, compared to 59% in 2020.\n\n“People who stay engaged with religious institutions are more likely to vote,” Green noted. “Voting is not just a personal decision—it’s a communal act. When your community votes, you vote.”\n\nTrump’s improved performance among Catholics may owe something to the nature of the 2024 race itself. Unlike in 2020, when he ran against President Joe Biden—a practicing Catholic—neither candidate in 2024 represented that faith tradition. Without a co-religionist on the ticket, Catholic voters may have been more responsive to other priorities, such as economic policy, religious liberty, or cultural issues.\n\nBut Trump’s appeal to Hispanic and Asian Protestants remains a puzzle to some observers, especially given his hardline stance on immigration. For Gabriel Salguero, founder of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, the explanation lies in a convergence of theological and practical concerns.\n\n“Latino evangelicals don’t vote based on a single issue,” Salguero said. “We’re concerned about family, economic stability, religious values, life ethics, and biblical marriage. Trump engaged directly—he visited our churches, he advertised on our radio stations. That matters.”\n\nSalguero emphasized that Trump’s rhetoric on immigration was nuanced in the eyes of many Latino evangelicals. “There’s a perception that he’s focused on criminal elements, not on law-abiding families,” he said. “That makes a difference.”\n\nThe Pew report also reaffirmed longstanding demographic divides. Trump outpaced Harris by 14 points among voters without a college degree, doubling his 2016 advantage. He dominated rural areas by 40 points, an even greater margin than in past elections, and held a steady edge among older voters, winning 54% of those over 65.\n\nBy contrast, younger voters leaned heavily Democratic, with Harris maintaining strong support among Gen Z and millennials.\n\nDespite the polarization, the study’s deeper narrative is about realignment: not the shattering of old coalitions, but their reshaping. Religious identity, often assumed to be a static political marker, is proving more fluid—especially among minority voters.\n\nThe data also raise important questions for Democrats, who may need to re-evaluate their messaging and outreach to faith-based communities beyond their traditional base.\n\nWhile Trump’s critics argue that his policies often clashed with Christian values—particularly around immigration, compassion, and truthfulness—his resonance with certain faith groups suggests that policy platforms alone do not explain voter behavior. Symbolism, perceived authenticity, and targeted engagement often carry equal weight.\n\nAs the 2026 midterms approach, faith leaders like Salguero will be watching closely to see whether these shifts hold—or whether they were a one-time electoral anomaly.\n\nThe Pew survey’s margin of error is just 1.5 percentage points, making it one of the most statistically reliable portraits yet of the 2024 electorate. But its most enduring insight may not lie in who won, but in who changed.

I think it’s just a collection of people that don’t like Trump right now, right? And that’s served them well in ‘20, but imagine trying to create a big tent that had AOC and John Kasich in it, right? You know? Or Liz Cheney and AOC. You sort of got to rip a hole in the middle, right, as you’re trying to stretch that tent,\" Todd told disgraced former CBS News anchor Charlie Rose. Todd and Rose discussed Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayor primary win and more during the conversation. \"It feels like they’re way too poll-tested. It feels like that they’re trying so hard to sort of keep their suburban voters, and that’s been part of their problem. The growth in the Democratic electorate is in the suburbs, wealthy suburbs, and so the growth of the Republican electorate has been in the working-class exurbs and actually, even in working-class urban areas. And, I think that that’s been their disconnect, is that their voters are in one place, their messaging is in another, but when they try to message to their suburban voters, they've sort of lost touch with their working-class roots,\" Todd continued. DEMOCRATS' MAJOR MESSAGING CRISIS: THE PARTY OF OPPOSITION WITHOUT SOLUTIONS Todd said both parties' coalitions were too big and added, \"we would probably be a better democracy if we could have 4 major parties.\" The ex-NBC \"Meet the Press\" moderator has been critical of the party in the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Trump. He questioned whether the public was sold a \"40-year bill of goods\" with regard to former President Joe Biden's family-man image during a conversation with CNN host Jake Tapper on the \"Chuck Toddcast.\" \"You and I covered, for most of our professional lives, the story of Joe Biden was: This guy cared about his family so much he commuted home every night from Washington,\" Todd said. \"You know what else you could say is, this man was so ambitious that after his family went through that tragedy, he commuted every day to work, like it's the same story. I sit here, I look at this, and I think, were we sold a 40-year bill of goods?\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' Todd said in March that Democratic leadership, specifically House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, were feeling \"paralyzed\" by the two different constituencies within the Democratic Party. \"Jeffries and Schumer are acting paralyzed because they have two different constituencies. They have ones who are worried about a left-wing tea party, and they should be worried about that, because I do think this anger inside the base is real,\" Todd said. \"Then you have others who are like, hey, I won, and Trump carried my state. So I’ve got to do this. So, I think that’s why Jeffries and Schumer come across as paralyzed, because they’re trying to placate a coalition party that doesn’t know which direction to go to.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Todd suggested during his conversation with Rose that the Republicans might not have stuck with Trump as their nominee if Biden didn't run for re-election at all.

Trump teases 'very wealthy' group will purchase Chinese app in matter of weeks","text":"Donald Trump revealed a 'very wealthy' group of buyers is set to purchase TikTok in the upcoming weeks - following years of battles with the Chinese-owned app. \n\nThe president made the shock announcement in an interview on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\n\n'We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,' Trump declared without giving away many details or revealing where the proposal was coming from. \n\n'I think I'll need, probably China approval, but President Xi will probably do it.' \n\nBartiromo asked who the buyer is, to which Trump responded they will be revealed in just two weeks. \n\n'They're very, very wealthy people. It's a group of wealthy people,' he bluntly said.\n\nThis tease at new TikTok owners comes Trump's stance on the popular app has drastically shifted over the years. \n\nDuring his first term, Trump was determined to take down the video-sharing application - calling for a total ban in the US. \n\nTikTok is owned by China-based company ByteDance, which has raised concerns about privacy and security. \n\nA federal law to ban TikTok for being a threat to national security briefly went into effect the day before Trump was sworn in for his second term in January. \n\nUnder the Biden administration, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA) called for ByteDance to sell TikTok by the deadline or the app would be barred from the US.\n\nThe company did not sell the social media platform, meaning the banning it was the only remaining option. \n\nBut in an unexpected turn of events, one of TikTok's fiercest adversaries became its unlikely savior - issuing an executive order to postpone the ban by 75 days on January 20 as one of his first presidential acts. \n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew had even attended Trump's inauguration. \n\n'Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?' Trump said in a Truth Social post on January 16. \n\nHis change of heart was reportedly due to the massive amount of support he garnered for his White House run through the campaign.\n\n'I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,' Trump told NBC in May. \n\nTikToks by ratings-obsessed Trump and his team had amassed more than 4 billion views - more than popstar Taylor Swift or political rival Kamala Harris.\n\nHe believes his TikTok presence helped him garner support specifically from younger voters. \n\nIn April, Trump extended the postponement another 75 days to work out a deal with the Chinese-run company that would ultimately lead to the platform being taken over by an American-approved buyer. \n\n'My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,' he wrote on Truth Social at the time.\n\n'The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.' \n\nAt the time, White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with US ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.\n\nTrump saved TikTok for a third time on June 19, issuing another 90 days to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.\n\n'As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \n\n'This extension will last 90 days, which the administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.","summary":"Donald Trump revealed a 'very wealthy' group of buyers is set to purchase TikTok in the upcoming weeks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14858763/tiktok-bought-sold-trump-wealthy-group-weeks.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/29/21/99838731-0-image-m-11_1751228555937.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/09/3393517041277095451/1024x576_MP4_3393517041277095451.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-29 20:33:37","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.264}]}
