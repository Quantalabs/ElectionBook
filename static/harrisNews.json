{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":3907,"news":[{"id":255890734,"title":"A.G. Sulzberger is unfit to run The New York Times as latest op-ed spreads misinformation","text":"‘Caution: Those with sensitive stomachs or respect for the truth should stop here.” That’s the warning label The Washington Post should have slapped on a recent essay. Unfortunately, it didn’t and let the writer gas on as if his fabulist claims were grounded in reality. The op-ed was doubly dispiriting because, although it appeared in The Washington Post, it was written by the publisher of The New York Times. Both outlets likely thought the joint imprimatur would increase the audience and impact. Instead, the resulting flop magnifies their effort to spread misinformation. Both outlets apparently still think Americans are foolish enough to trust Big Media to tell them the truth. Author A.G. Sulzberger’s effort to inflate what was little more than another vicious attack on Donald Trump into a rallying cry for press independence is noteworthy for all the wrong reasons. His farrago of leftist partisanship, self-aggrandizement and fearmongering comes disguised as an appeal for freedom of the press. The transparent motive gives readers yet another reason to search elsewhere for facts and fairness. Of course, nobody can argue with such truths as “The flow of trustworthy news and information is critical to a free, secure and prosperous nation.” Or the claim that “defense of the free press has been a point of rare bipartisan consensus throughout the nation’s history.” The author wraps his argument in red, white and blue by quoting President Ronald Reagan as saying, “There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong, and independent press to our continued success in what the Founding Fathers called our ‘noble experiment’ in self-government.” Bias papered over Citing Reagan is an obvious tease to draw in conservatives and Republicans. It’s also a fig leaf to cover the Big Lie about the Times built-in bias. It hasn’t endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Up and down the ballot, year in year out, no matter the office and the candidates, it would endorse a dead raccoon if it was running on the Democrat line. The more recent and greater sin is that the paper’s radical narratives are no longer limited to opinion pages. Nearly every article on every topic reflects a scolding, far-left view, whether it be on race, Israel, markets, the weather, books, films, theater or even sports. The hyperpartisanship has reached new depths in the Trump era, with the Times a chief player in fomenting the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. And don’t forget that Sulzberger fired his opinion editor for publishing an op-ed from GOP Sen. Tom Cotton urging Trump to use the military to quell the 2020 urban riots. The fifth male in his family to hold the title of publisher — no outsiders need apply — Sulzberger uses his essay to charge that Trump “and his allies have declared their intention to increase their attacks on a press he has long derided as ‘the enemy of the people.’ ” He even blames Trump for anti-press crackdowns in Brazil and India and adds that the former president’s use of the term “fake news” caused global harm, writing “around 70 countries on six continents have enacted ‘fake news’ laws.” The implication is that the president shouldn’t enjoy freedom of speech if it involves criticism of certain media. Yet the author still has the nerve to claim that “I have no interest in wading into politics” and insists he will not let the Times “cast aside neutrality” in its election coverage. Oh, please, does he even read his paper? Or maybe he, like so many other New Yorkers, has given up hoping for a semblance of even-handedness. Among the lines that deserve a warning label all their own are this one: “At The Times, we are committed to following the facts and presenting a full, fair and accurate picture of November’s election and the candidates and issues shaping it.” This from the publisher of a paper which each day promotes three or four loaded stories against Trump and sees only “joy” and “hope” in his Democratic opponent. So Kamala Harris is not only assured of the paper’s backing, she also won’t be pushed on her policy flip-flops. Crying shame And she shouldn’t waste time concocting elaborate evasions about how she wants to take the country in a different direction than the Biden-Harris administration. Whatever she says — or even if she keeps ducking interviews — will be good enough for the Times. The paper is so rife with Trump hate that a book critic declared the Constitution is one of the “biggest threats” to the country. That’s because . . . Trump won the Electoral College in 2016. Ultimately, Sulzberger’s screed is not the high-minded appeal to our better angels he thinks it is. Rather, it’s a reflection of how out little he understands America. The nation is politically divided, yet the Times embodies the arrogance of the urban, elite left as it looks with contempt on those who see the world differently. Its bias is so ingrained that it raises no objection to Dems using the courts to try to bankrupt, imprison and keep Trump off the ballot. If Republicans tried that, the sky would fall. After the 2016 election, the former publisher, Sulzberger’s father, wrote a note to readers apologizing for not better understanding Trump’s appeal. That blindness was explained in part by the fact that some members of the newsroom were preparing to celebrate Hillary Clinton’s victory. While it’s understandable that election night ended in tears for many Democrats, tears in the newsroom of the nation’s largest newspaper are out of bounds. Or should have been. But eight years later, the paper has moved even deeper into the partisan swamp. It supports Big Tech censorship of conservative voices, meaning it believes in freedom of speech only for speech it agrees with. And just as it tried to bury the facts about Joe Biden’s corruption with his family influence peddling scheme, it hid his mental decline. Last June 26, the paper carried water for the White House with a story headlined, “How Misleading Videos Are Trailing Biden as He Battles Age Doubts.” The very next day brought the debate debacle, where it became clear how unfit Biden actually was. In the aftermath, when polls showed Trump building a massive lead, the Times suddenly switched horses and called for the president to quit the race. When he did, and when Harris was anointed by party bosses in a backroom, Tammany Hall coup, the paper didn’t object to Dems ignoring the will of 14 million primary voters. Keeping Trump out of the White House was and is all that matters. Ultimately, the Times is, like every media outlet — and all Americans — free to say and write pretty much anything it wants. But it would have more credibility if it admitted it has a political agenda and gave up the pretense of fairness. Until then, good luck to Sulzberger in his quest for an Oscar for impersonating a publisher devoted to free, fair and honest speech.","summary":"‘Caution: Those with sensitive stomachs or respect for the truth should stop here.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/07/opinion/a-g-sulzberger-is-unfit-to-run-the-new-york-times-as-latest-op-ed-spreads-misinformation/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GNY.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 00:47:38","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":255890828,"title":"Harris visits spice shop known for hating and slamming Republicans, calls for end of 'divisiveness'","text":"Kamala Harris made a campaign stop on Saturday at a spice shop known to openly discriminate against Republicans while calling for an end to political \"divison.\"The spice shop, Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, welcomed the Democrat nominee to browse the store and meet some supporters.While facing a gaggle of reporters, Harris claimed, \"It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness.

Liz Cheney. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Dick Cheney said in a statement Friday. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement that Harris was “proud to have the support of Vice President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” On Saturday, former President Donald Trump called Dick Cheney an “irrelevant RINO” – or Republican in Name Only. “He’s the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I am the Peace President, and only I will stop World War III!” Dick Cheney, a longtime conservative Republican, was vice president under former President George W. Bush and was one of the most influential officials behind the invasion of Iraq and the CIA’s interrogation tactics after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Liz Cheney first revealed her father’s plans Friday at the Texas Tribune Festival, after saying two days ago that she is backing the Democratic nominee. “I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Liz Cheney said Wednesday at Duke University. “As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.” In a statement Wednesday, O’Malley Dillon said Harris was “proud to have earned Congresswoman Cheney’s vote.” Liz Cheney was one of only two Republicans to serve on the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol assault and Trump’s role in it. The former president has repeatedly blasted Cheney for it, suggesting she and the others on the committee should be jailed. He continued the same line of attacks on Saturday, saying Liz Cheney “and her Unselects deleted and destroyed all evidence and information – IT’S GONE.” “Much of it proved that Nancy Pelosi was responsible for J6 – DIDN’T PROVIDE SECURITY. Cheney and the others should be prosecuted for what they did, but Comrade Kamala is even worse!” he added. The Cheneys aren’t the only Republicans to back Harris. Several Republicans spoke at the Democratic National Convention urging their fellow Republicans to back Harris for the sake of democracy, including former Georgia Lt. Gov.

Trump vowed to vastly reshape the federal bureaucracy on Saturday in a wide-ranging, often unfocused speech at a rally in Wisconsin. He pledged to ultimately eliminate the Department of Education, redirect the efforts of the Justice Department and fire civil servants charged with carrying out Biden administration policies that he disagreed with. And he told his supporters that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading vaccine skeptic who recently endorsed him, would be “very much involved” in a panel on “chronic health problems and childhood diseases.” Mr. Kennedy rose to prominence as a vaccine skeptic who promoted a disproved link between vaccines and autism. At one point Mr. Trump got in a dig at Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he has frequently accused without evidence of covering up signs that Mr. Biden was not fit to be president, by saying that he would support modifying the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to make it an impeachable offense for a vice president to cover up the incapacity of the president. It was a long-shot proposal at best, which would entail a difficult process that he does not control.","summary":"In Wisconsin, former President Donald J.

Nikki Haley dodged when asked whether she thinks former President Donald Trump is a good candidate, instead acknowledging only that she thinks he is “the Republican nominee.” After Haley said of her 2024 candidacy in a CBS “Face the Nation” interview set to air Sunday, “I ran because I thought I could do a better job,” moderator Margaret Brennan responded, “You don’t think he’s a good candidate?” “I think he is the Republican nominee,” Haley said in a clip released ahead of the full interview. “And I think putting him against Kamala Harris, who is the Democrat nominee — for me, it’s not a question.” “Now, do I agree with his style? Do I agree with his approach? Do I agree with his communications? No,” she continued. Haley, who ran for the Republican nomination against Trump before dropping out and quickly endorsing him, said that while she does not agree with Trump’s style, approach or communications, she supports the former president because of policy agreements. The former ambassador to the United Nations is also willing to offer advice, she told CBS. Haley said that she is on “standby” to campaign for Trump — and that he’s aware of that willingness on her part. But she said she has not been asked to help with debate prep or campaigning. “And that’s his choice — whatever he decides to do with his campaign, he can do that,” Haley said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” last month that he’d like to see Haley and other GOP leaders hit the trail, saying, “Me and Nikki need to go to Georgia.” “We’re giving advice on TV to President Trump. He’s got a lot of critics,” Graham said. “He’s got a lot of advisers, but to Nikki Haley and [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis and [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin and all these great people we have, let’s get together and actually campaign for the guy.” Haley’s support — and willingness to stump for Trump — is a far cry from the dynamic the two shared during the primary, which saw Trump mocking Haley’s birth name and Haley calling him “diminished” and “unhinged.” Speaking at Clemson University after losing the South Carolina primary to Trump, Haley called him a “disaster” for the GOP, adding that she was not afraid to express her disapproval publicly and did not need to “kiss the ring.” “Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud,” Haley said at the time, prior to her endorsement of Trump. “I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him.” Haley has gradually changed tune since then, speaking at the Republican National Convention in July and offering her “strong endorsement” of him. But that hasn’t stopped Haley from critiquing Trump’s campaign performance, saying to Fox News in August that it needed to “focus” and stay away from personal attacks on Harris. Discussing the options before voters this November, Haley appeared to adopt a resigned tone in her comments to Brennan. “These are the candidates we have been given,” Haley said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov.

Latest polls suggest the southern states of Texas and Florida, which Trump carried comfortably by 5 points and 4 points respectively in 2020, are now far closer than at any time in the race. Trump won Florida in both 2016 and 2020 securing 30 electoral votes, while Texas which has remained solidly red since 1976 was also won by Trump in 2020, garnering him 40 electoral college votes. But the former president has seen his support erode among most demographic groups since his Democratic rival in the November 5 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket over the summer. Now things could be about to change in states that were never considered swing states or toss-ups, with latest surveys from Emerson College suggesting Harris is now within the margin of error (about 3 points) in both. The poll suggests Trump is only narrowly ahead in his home state of Florida at 50 percent with Harris at 45 percent. In Texas things are even tighter with just 4 percentage points separating the pair at 50 percent compared to Harris’ 46 percent, well within the margin of error. Texas has remained a squarely red state since the late 1970s despite Democrats attempting to to turn the state blue. In Florida, the state has steadily become more Republican since Obama carried the state in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential election. The steady turn towards the GOP is in no small part due to the rise in the number of Republicans registered in the state with 1 million more GOP supporters registered to vote than Democrats. County elections supervisors revealed there are currently 5.3 million active Republican voters in Florida compared to 4.3 million active Democratic voters. But Florida could still flip either way with a further 3.9 million voters who are either not affiliate with any political party or who affiliate with minor parties. Nationally, Harris is leading Trump among Hispanic voters by 13 percentage points, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted in August, while Biden led that demographic by just five points in May. She has also boosted her support among black Americans, outperforming Biden by seven points among that demographic. But she has barely moved the needle among white voters, those same polls show. Whites without a college degree, long the linchpin of Trump’s coalition, still favor the former president by 25 points, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. They favored Trump by 29 points when he was running against Biden. That relative resilience among white voters represents an electoral bright spot for Trump, and several Trump advisers and allies have said in recent weeks that maintaining the former president’s margins within that demographic will be crucial if he is to defeat Harris. That is especially true in the northern ‘Rust Belt’ states, Wisconsin included, which skew white and have large rural populations. Trump relied heavily on these voters when he swept the Rust Belt’s swing states on the way to his 2016 victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Biden won the White House in 2020 in part by bringing some of these voters back into the Democratic Party. While the Trump campaign has identified Hispanics and black men as a key area of growth for the Republican Party, much of Trump’s campaigning in recent weeks has taken place in small cities and towns in the Rust Belt that are not diverse. Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance, is expected to hit relatively rural areas of the Rust Belt particularly hard in the final weeks before the election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe race for the White House is tightening up in two states&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Recent survey shows change in competition between Trump and Kamala in two important states first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/recent-survey-shows-change-in-competition-between-trump-and-kamala-in-two-important-states/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-New-poll-reveals-shift-in-race-between.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 23:36:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":255889860,"title":"George W.

(AP) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican, will vote for Kamala Harris for president, he announced Friday. Liz Cheney, who herself endorsed Harris on Wednesday, first announced her father’s endorsement when asked by Mark Leibovich of The Atlantic magazine during an onstage interview at The Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. “Wow,” Leibovich replied as the audience cheered. Like his daughter, Dick Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, notably during Liz Cheney’s ill-fated reelection campaign in 2022. Dick Cheney put out a statement Friday confirming his endorsement, which read almost entirely as opposition to Trump rather than support of Harris. “He can never be trusted with power again,” the statement said. “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Trump responded on his Truth Social platform by calling the former vice president “an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter.” The acronym stands for “Republican in name only.” Asked for comment, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “Who is Liz Cheney?” The campaign confirmed Cheung was being sarcastic by also pointing to a comment Liz Cheney posted online four years ago in which she called Harris a “radical liberal.” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Harris’ campaign chair, released a statement saying, “The Vice President is proud to have the support of Vice President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” Dick Cheney, 83, has made few if any public appearances over the past year or more. He has dealt with heart issues since his 40s and underwent a heart transplant in 2012. Dick Cheney’s statement Friday was similar to a 2022 campaign ad for Liz Cheney as she sought a fourth term as Wyoming’s lone congressperson. In it, he called Trump a “coward” for trying to “steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” The ad did little good for his daughter in a deep-red state that once held the Cheney family dear but is now thoroughly in Trump’s corner. By a more than 2-to-1 margin, Liz Cheney lost her Republican primary to Trump-endorsed attorney Harriet Hageman. Dick Cheney has been friends with Democrats over the years but never supported one for president. Both Cheneys backed Trump in 2016, but after Liz Cheney criticized Trump foreign policy decisions and Trump criticized the “endless wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq launched when Dick Cheney was vice president, their support waned. If either Cheney supported Trump in 2020, they were mum about it. Meanwhile, their home state of Wyoming that year delivered Trump his widest margin of victory. By 2021, Liz Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump and her investigation into him for the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot made them irredeemable to Trump — and soon most of the GOP. There were exceptions. One was Cheney ally Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a Republican Trump critic who earlier this year endorsed Biden and spoke in support of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August. Several other top Republicans have come out in support of Harris while some, including Sen. Mitt Romney and former Vice President Mike Pence, say they won’t be voting for Trump. Of them only Romney, who is not seeking reelection, is still in office. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

JD Vance (R-OH) dismissed school shootings as “fact of life,” despite video that she played earlier in the segment that disproved her assertion and demonstrated that Vance advocated for stronger security at schools to help prevent shootings and said that it’s a “fact of life” that deranged people know schools are soft targets. Brzezinski played video of Vance, in which Vance said, “What is going to solve this problem, and I really do believe this, is, look, I don’t like this, I don’t like to admit this, I don’t like that this is a fact of life, but if you’re a psycho, and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets, and we have got to bolster security at our schools, so that a person who walks through the front door — we’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to.” Co-host Willie Geist then noted that Vance called for better security, and stated, “his full comment was, ‘I don’t like that this is a fact of life,’ he said, we don’t have to like the reality we live in, but it is the reality we live in.” Geist continued, “So, you would think that that would prompt him, then, to say, let’s sit down and change this reality, let’s sit down and do something about it. Because, clearly, having the school resource officers there, who acted heroically the other day and probably prevented more kids and teachers from dying, it wasn’t enough to save the poor people who did die.” Brzezinski then argued, in contradiction to the video she had just played, “[T]hat comment that he made right there is another very, very stark example of the difference between these two campaigns, Harris-Walz vs. Trump-Vance, they see it — Trump-Vance — as a fact of life.

Nearly 90 corporate CEOs and other leaders signed a letter Friday endorsing Kamala for president. Their endorsements exemplify a profound shift in the Democratic party, which once championed working class Americans and the downtrodden, but now embodies unbridled corporate interests. Wisconsin is once again a crucial swing state in the presidential election, with polls showing Trump and Kamala Harris in a virtual tie.

Nikki Haley dodged when asked whether she thinks former President Donald Trump is a good candidate, instead acknowledging only that she thinks he is \"the Republican nominee.” After Haley said of her 2024 candidacy in a CBS \"Face the Nation\" interview set to air Sunday, “I ran because I thought I could do a better job,” moderator Margaret Brennan responded, “You don’t think he’s a good candidate?” “I think he is the Republican nominee,” Haley said in a clip released ahead of the full interview. “And I think putting him against Kamala Harris, who is the Democrat nominee — for me, it’s not a question.\" \"Now, do I agree with his style? Do I agree with his approach? Do I agree with his communications? No,” she continued. Haley, who ran for the Republican nomination against Trump before dropping out and quickly endorsing him, said that while she does not agree with Trump’s style, approach or communications, she supports the former president because of policy agreements. The former ambassador to the United Nations is also willing to offer advice, she told CBS. Haley said that she is on “standby” to campaign for Trump — and that he's aware of that willingness on her part. But she said she has not been asked to help with debate prep or campaigning. “And that’s his choice — whatever he decides to do with his campaign, he can do that,” Haley said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" last month that he'd like to see Haley and other GOP leaders hit the trail, saying, “Me and Nikki need to go to Georgia.” “We’re giving advice on TV to President Trump.

Glenn] Youngkin and all these great people we have, let’s get together and actually campaign for the guy.” Haley's support — and willingness to stump for Trump — is a far cry from the dynamic the two shared during the primary, which saw Trump mocking Haley’s birth name and Haley calling him \"diminished\" and \"unhinged.\" Speaking at Clemson University after losing the South Carolina primary to Trump, Haley called him a “disaster” for the GOP, adding that she was not afraid to express her disapproval publicly and did not need to “kiss the ring.” “Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud,” Haley said at the time, prior to her endorsement of Trump. “I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him.” Haley has gradually changed tune since then, speaking at the Republican National Convention in July and offering her “strong endorsement” of him. But that hasn't stopped Haley from critiquing Trump's campaign performance, saying to Fox News in August that it needed to \"focus\" and stay away from personal attacks on Harris. Discussing the options before voters this November, Haley appeared to adopt a resigned tone in her comments to Brennan. “These are the candidates we have been given,” Haley said.","summary":"Former South Carolina Gov.

Asked at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas whether she was “done” when a new administration takes over in January, or might continue in her job or take on a new administration role, Yellen said: “Probably done, but … we’ll see.” The comments are the closest that Yellen, 78, has come to announcing her future plans as the presidential race between US Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump heats up. Yellen has been the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary, Federal Reserve Chair and director of the White House National Economic Council. Yellen told the event in Austin that she still has a lot of work to do at Treasury in coming months, including another likely meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, her Beijing counterpart, to try to manage an often tense relationship. The two met in April in Beijing, where Yellen warned China to rein in excess industrial capacity ahead of Biden’s decision to impose steep tariff increases on Chinese-made electric vehicles, batteries, solar products and semiconductors. Yellen said she would welcome a visit to the US but also may return to China herself, adding: “My guess is that we will have, one way or another, a visit.” The Treasury’s top economic diplomat, Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh, will lead a delegation to Beijing “very soon” to discuss economic issues. Shambaugh leads a US-China economic working group that has made addressing China’s excess factory production a top issue Yellen said the US-China relationship “needs to be prioritised and nurtured” by the next US administration, with discussions at the highest levels and among agency staffs. “We have enough differences and without a chance to discuss them and put them in context, it’s certainly possible for tensions to rise,” Yellen said. “So this is something that really requires ongoing attention. I hope that it would get it.” Yellen also said the US economy has largely reached a “soft landing” with lower inflation after US August jobs data on Friday showed a slight decline in the unemployment rate despite slower hiring. “When you see pace of job creation diminishing over time, what I love to see is that it stabilises roughly where it is now, and we have to be careful to make sure that it’s not going to weaken further,” Yellen said. She said consumer spending remains “quite solid” and while there is “less frenzy” in hiring, there are not meaningful lay-offs “I’m attentive to downside risks now on the employment side, but I what I think we’re seeing, we will continue to see, is a good, solid economy,” Yellen said.","summary":"The US Treasury secretary says the US-China relationship ‘needs to be prioritised and nurtured’ by the next administration.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3277637/janet-yellen-probably-done-when-biden-ends-term-may-meet-chinese-counterpart-soon","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/08/4c83cc95-f41c-45e7-9581-210343231bd6_87ba8d18.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:50:52","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.221},{"id":255888050,"title":"Kamala Harris is adopting Trump’s policies and Democrats are embracing conservative values, such as “edgy” football.","text":"Over at The Nation, the outlet’s designated sports editor Dave Zirin addressed the move made by the Democrats and the Harris-Walz campaign to embrace the Minnesota governor’s former position as an assistant football coach. His supposed leadership and the metaphors of the sport have become fixtures somewhat in the campaign. And Zirin sees trouble with this decision. In the so-called taking over of football from conservatives Zirin sees dire consequences – because appealing to those fans of the most popular sport in the nation is a poor decision??? He says that the sport carries some “dark” aspects, such as the threat of concussions, but also toxic testosterone-fueled components that will drive away a core of Democratic Party youths. The Democratic Party is presenting football as a symbol of the kind of teamwork needed to take down Donald Trump, argues @EdgeofSports. The embrace of football is rattling conservatives, but it may cost Democrats young progressive voters.https://t.co/2WSs0snLln— The Nation (@thenation) August 26, 2024 The hypermasculinity and violence of football…could repel young voters. This could repel the young, left-wing voters more interested in policy changes than who wins the football wars. Young people care about racism, the economy, climate change, Palestine, and a host of other issues given short shrift at the convention. Football not only won’t be enough to satisfy them. Its embrace may send a signal that the big tent isn’t big enough for them. What adds to the mirthful wishcasting is something else Zirin touts, and that is the manner the Democrats have allegedly appropriated the sport of football as their own. This is supposedly something that completely unravels Republicans, in his fevered mind. “How confused, how utterly rattled, these conservatives must be at the moment. Democrats are claiming football for themselves; presenting the sport as not only patriotic but as a potent symbol of the kind of teamwork needed to take down Donald Trump.” This is nothing more than desperate wishcasting, of course, but it points to something else taking place in the minds of the Democratic Party. They somehow operate as if they suddenly begin to embrace some aspect of the culture that means that the conservatives no longer have access to it? So if Democrats now declare football as a symbol of…I dunno, something, for their party…conservatives can no longer claim to enjoy the game themselves? This is ridiculous on its face, of course, but it cuts to the level of desperation for their party. Just as Kamala has adopted a number of policy items that have long been on Trump’s docket – no taxes on tips, building the border wall, etc. – the Dems are trying to claim various cultural touchstones that have been regarded as conservative in the past. Some opined that at the Democratic Convention, they took over country music. Quite the surprise, considering just one year ago that genre was considered toxic and dangerous. Also at the convention, patriotism was highlighted as a novel item embraced by the Dems, with chants of “USA” heard and then celebrated as the party tried to claim the “love of country” mantle from the right. It’s especially galling considering they routinely call expressions of pride for the nation “jingoism” and divisive and antagonistic. Now they go the other way; instead of inviting all under the Stars & Stripes, it is said they displayed the “Democratic brand of patriotism.” The selection of Tim Walz has brought a number of changes to Democrat approaches, and this is due to the conflict he delivers. Walz is an avid hunter, something that brings challenges to the anti-gun party. It has been fun to watch them tightrope to targeting “bad guns” as a result. The Walz arrival brought another supposedly claimed component, one even more ridiculous. The campaign produced a piece of merchandise playing off of the Walz hunting preference, a branded baseball hat in a camouflage pattern. By itself, it is not all that remarkable, as just about any brand in America with a tangential connection to the outdoors might produce this kind of headgear. But Rolling Stone, in a dose of over-insistence, saw the stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, Ella Emhoff (who appears as outdoorsy as a teacup poodle), wearing one such hat at the convention and turned rhapsodic. Ella Emhoff is about to be all of us this fall in that coveted Harris/Walz camo hat pic.twitter.com/xWK1lOtv7I— Nate Morris 🥥🌴 (@_natemorris) August 20, 2024 That is quite the political party makeover, in a matter of a few weeks, for the sake of pushing a San Francisco Democrat who was raised in Canada into the White House. It is quite the list of items that were scorned by this party not so long ago; country music, hunting gear, patriotism, border hawks, and now football. That sure looks like something the Democrats normally demonize – cultural appropriation. The result, however, delivers the opposite of what is intended. Like Kamala’s sudden new position on several political issues, the embracing of these cultural items appears like a shallow, calculated maneuver rather than a genuine acceptance of these touchstones. It conveys the Southern aphorism: “All hat, and no cattle.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOver at The Nation, the outlet’s designated sports editor Dave Zirin addressed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris is adopting Trump&#8217;s policies and Democrats are embracing conservative values, such as &#8220;edgy&#8221; football. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-is-adopting-trumps-policies-and-democrats-are-embracing-conservative-values-such-as-edgy-football/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Is-Stealing-Trump039s-Agenda-and-Dems.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:49:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":255889496,"title":"Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula to win the U.S. Open for her third Grand Slam title","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Police release video of Toronto plaza shooting that killed university student A university student from Brampton was killed when two shooters fired indiscriminately into a crowded plaza in Toronto last month in what police say was a 'cowardly act.'

Nobody checked them.\"A video of the former president's remarks were posted to X, formerly Twitter, by @KamalaHQ. The video currently has over 260,000 views.Newsweek has contacted Trump's campaign via email on Saturday for comment.On July 15, the Republican National Committee published and formally adopted new immigration policy priorities during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.The document stated, \"Republicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal aliens, deadly drugs, and migrant crime.\"Key policy points in the platform included: \"Seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion\" \"Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history\" \"Stop the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels, crush gang violence, and lock up violent offenders\" The platform promises to \"restore every border policy of the Trump administration\" and finish the border wall Trump began during his previous term. It also calls for strengthening U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ramping up penalties for illegal entry and visa overstays, and reinstating Trump's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.The 2024 platform uses more direct language compared to the 2016/2020 version, omitting conciliatory statements about immigrants' contributions to the country.This hardline stance is further reinforced by Trump's pick for vice president, Ohio Senator JD Vance who has backed calls for mass deportation of illegal immigrants, despite unclear implementation plans.At the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin, Vance echoed Trump's rhetoric, stating, \"We have to deport people, we have to deport people who broke our laws who came in here and I think we start with the violent criminals.\"Vance's campaign has been even more explicit, with a fundraising message declaring, \"We need to deport every single person who invaded our country illegally.\" This aligns with Trump's claim that between 15 and 20 million people could be deported under his plans, though official estimates put the number of undocumented migrants in the U.S. at around 11 million.In his convention speech, Vance linked immigration to housing issues, stating, \"Then the Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens. So citizens had to compete with people who shouldn't even be here for precious housing.\" However, data from the Migration Policy Institute shows that only about 28 percent of illegal immigrants own homes, compared to roughly 65 percent of American citizens.Vance's hardline stance is juxtaposed with his personal life. His wife, Usha, is the daughter of Indian immigrants, whom he praised for \"enriching\" the country. This has led to some criticism from extremist figures within Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, questioning the authenticity of his immigration views.However, some Republican lawmakers have expressed doubts about the practicality of mass deportations. Representative Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican who represents the largest stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border in Congress, previously told Newsweek, \"You're not going to round up 10 million people and deport them. It's simple—you do not have the infrastructure to do that.\"The debate over immigration policy has intensified as both major parties seek to present contrasting visions ahead of the 2024 election. While Trump and the Republican National Committee advocate for a hardline approach, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to revive President Joe Biden's failed bipartisan border security bill.Recent data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows over 620,000 immigration court deportation cases were filed in fiscal year 2023, with around 236,000 resulting in removals. This surpasses the 187,000 removals that occurred during the peak of Trump's administration in 2019.Gonzales warned that completely shutting down the border would impact industries across the country, stating, \"There's not one industry that is not tied to the U.S.-Mexico border.\"With an estimated 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, addressing the immigration crisis will require balancing security concerns with humanitarian considerations and practical realities.","summary":"\"[They] should have never been allowed to come into our country.

Gov. Mark Robinson says he wants abortion to be illegal at ‘zero’ weeks, in new audio released by Democrats","text":"A Democratic group has released new audio of North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is running for governor, saying that he wants to get abortion restrictions down to “zero” weeks. In the audio, which the group said was recorded on Sept. 3 at a Robinson campaign event in Troy, N.C., a woman asked Robinson about his stance on abortion and why he was supporting North Carolina’s current 12-week ban on the procedure. Robinson replied by saying, “That 12 weeks, exceptions for rape and incest … I’m not going to say it’s reasonable. But my faith allows me to live with that, because that’s where the consensus is. Do I want to continue to lower it? You better know it. I would love to get down to six weeks. And I’d like to get down to zero. I would like to push it back as far as we could and eliminate as many abortions as we can.” “We can’t do it all at once,” he added. “The Democrats started off with Roe v. Wade, then moved to ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ Then they got to where? Nine months in the womb. They did that over 50 years. … And we can do it.” The recording, which was shared with NBC News, was published by the Mark Robinson War Room, a project of the North Carolina Democratic Leadership Committee, which is backed by the Democratic Governors Association. The group said it was established for the “sole purpose of holding Lt. Governor Mark Robinson accountable for his toxic record and dangerous agenda for North Carolina.” Robinson is running against Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. Publicly, Robinson has stood behind allowing current restrictions in North Carolina to stand. The lieutenant governor acknowledged in a TV ad earlier this year that his wife had an abortion 30 years ago and offered support for the current abortion restrictions in North Carolina, which limit the procedure after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. But Robinson is advocating for measures that go further. He made similar comments at a campaign event in February, saying, “We’ve got it down to 12 weeks, the next goal is to get it down to six, and then just keep moving from there,” referring to abortion, a local Fox News affiliate reported. In the audio shared with NBC News, Robinson also told the woman that he has not changed his stance on abortion “at all” and that “there’s no reason why an abortion should happen ever.” “I’m 100% for life, and that’s how I think it should be. If I’m a pastor in the pulpit, that’s what I’m preaching. If I’m counseling someone, a young lady, a couple, that’s what I’m telling them. I’m telling them, ‘Choose life for your child,’” he added. Robinson then explained that he was not a pastor, and that as an elected official he needed to work with the consensus. “Now a lot of people say, ‘Well, that’s changing your position. That’s giving up your conviction.’ Not it’s not,” Robinson said. “You got to be an elected official. You have to be mature enough in your faith to watch people do things that you disagree with and allow them to do it because we don’t live in a theocracy. If we have politicians who start running the country like they run their church, then we end up like Iran. That’s not how this country was formed.” Stein has been an outspoken supporter of abortion rights and has vowed to defend access to the procedure. When asked about the comments Robinson made about taking abortions down to “zero,” Mike Lonergan, the communications director for Robinson’s campaign, sent a written statement. “Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is pro-life because of the painful and difficult experience he and his wife had, and his faith,” Lonergan said in the statement. “By supporting taxpayer-funded, late-term abortion on demand, Kamala Harris and Josh Stein are extreme and out of step with North Carolina voters. They are using the same playbook that failed here in 2022, and it’ll fail again in 2024.” “The legislature has already spoken on this issue,” Lonergan added. “As governor, Mark Robinson will work to make North Carolina a destination for life by building a culture that does more to support women and families, including bolstering adoption, as well as foster and childcare.”","summary":"A Democratic group has released new audio of North Carolina Republican Lt.

Mike Waltz: Gold Star Families Want to Hear Biden Admin Acknowledge They 'Did Some Things Wrong'","text":"During an interview on Breitbart News Saturday, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) spoke about how the Gold Star families who lost their loved ones during the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, want to hear the administration acknowledge that they “did some things wrong.” Waltz spoke about how in the aftermath of former President Donald Trump Arlington National Cemetery, honoring the 13 fallen American service members who were killed during the Biden administration’s botched withdrawal, the media and Vice President Kamala Harris have attacked Trump and claimed that there was an altercation between Trump campaign officials and a cemetery official. The Florida Congressman added that Harris has “not made a single phone call” or “visit” with the families, and now she was “weighing in.” “He was there at the request of the families. Oh, by the way, the families invited her and Biden too, and they still didn’t show up. And, oh, by the way, as a veteran, I’ve visited my Green Berets that I lost down there where those tombstones are for the last twenty years. We always take photos. We always post them online. I want America to see the sacrifices that were made for them. It was a beautiful moment, there was no altercation. This is a made-up hoax, and it’s really disgusting because those families had a special moment with a former President of the United States who has bothered to show up and hear their grievances,” Waltz explained. Host Matthew Boyle explained that “the hardest thing to hear” from the Gold Star families was how Harris does not have “empathy enough” to pick up the phone and make a call to them. “Here’s the thing that I think scars them so deeply,” Waltz explained. “All they want to hear is, ‘We know we did some things wrong. We should have done them better. We’re learning our lesson so this doesn’t happen to future soldiers.’ But, every time Biden and now her, say, ‘No, no, no. This was an outstanding success,’ it’s another stab in the heart for these families, because you’ve got a major political party led by these two that are saying, ‘No, this is the right way to do it. This is the way we would do it again in the future.’ “The best way to honor their loss is to say, ‘We learned our lessons, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure this never happens again.’ But, they’re not hearing that – well, they’re hearing nothing. But, that’s what they want to hear, is that, ‘We’ve learned our lessons. This is not going to happen to future kids and future Marines.’ But, yet they don’t even have the – just the gall to weigh in now, has just been another – just another punch, just another beat down for these poor families,” Waltz added. The Gold Star families of the fallen service members have issued statements explaining that they had given the approval for photos and videos to be taken at Arlington National Cemetery, and have criticized Harris for issuing a statement labeling Trump’s visit to the cemetery as a “political stunt.” Waltz continued to note that during the upcoming presidential debate between Trump and Harris, the vice president may point out that the Biden administration executed Trump’s Doha Agreement of withdrawing from Afghanistan. “She may go there to say, ‘No, no. What Biden did was actually execute your deal, Donald Trump. This was your – you’re responsible for this, for that Doha Agreement.’ Number one, President Trump’s advisers came to him and said, ‘The Taliban haven’t lived up to six out of seven conditions of the deal. They haven’t lived up to their end.’ And, what did President Trump do? He left 2500 special operators, the NATO still had their troops there, we still had our contractors there, and we still had Bagram Airbase. Right? So, yeah, President Trump entered a deal. The Taliban didn’t live up to it. And, as far as he was concerned when he left office in 2020, that the deal was off. Number two, Biden had no problem tearing up all kinds of Trump policies, like Keystone XL Pipeline, despite the billions and the ten thousand jobs that were involved there. The Paris Climate Accord, all of the policies relating to the border, over 60 executive orders that he tore up and replaced. I mean, we could keep going down the line. The Iran Deal, that they got back into, that they tried to get back into. So, he can tear up all these Trump policies, but he was stuck with that one?” Waltz added.","summary":"During an interview on Breitbart News Saturday, Rep.

During a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump prepped his base, telling them that even if he does well in his debate with Harris, he'll still be blasted by the media. \"If I destroy her in the debate, they'll say Trump suffered a humiliating debate tonight,\" he told a crowd of MAGA faithful on Saturday. While it's no secret that Trump – who for years has called members of the press enemies of the US and encouraged his crowd to boo them at his rallies — is regularly fact checked by reporters, few people leapt to Joe Biden's defense after his disastrous performance earlier this year. Biden's poor debate performance — and the resulting pressure from the public, press, and other Democratic lawmakers — led to him ultimately dropping out of the presidential race in July. Despite that, Trump is insisting that he'll be treated unfairly by the media after his upcoming debate. But that may just be expectation setting by the former president. In addition to trashing the broader media, Trump has already specifically attacked the network hosting the debate, ABC News, calling it the \"worst network in terms of fairness.\" Some Republicans are privately afraid that Trump will blow his debate performance, according to a recent report from Politico. “I think — I pray — he can be disciplined,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Republican strategist, told the outlet. But she also admitted that her prayers may not be answered. “If Trump feels like he’s backed into a corner and feels like it’s three on one, that could be a problem,” she said. Trump's own words suggest her fears may be well founded. Podcaster Lex Friedman, who tends to be friendly to right-wing guests, recently spoke with Trump and encouraged him to share a \"positive vision of the future\" rather than criticizing his opponent. Senator Lindsey Graham expressed a similar position in a New York Times op-ed. “Every day that the candidates trade insults is a good day for [Harris] because it’s one less day that she has to defend the failures of the Biden-Harris administration,” he said. Trump disagreed. “Yeah, I think you have to criticize though,” he told the podcaster. “I think they’re nasty.” Trump and Harris will face off on ABC on September 10 in Philadelphia at 9pm EST.","summary":"Former president has already complained that ABC, the networking hosting the debate, is the ‘worst network in terms of fairness’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-debate-media-win-b2608899.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/07/22/2024-09-07T201016Z_429320563_RC2WV9ANGA62_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-WISCONSIN.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AHvwupmp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:05:56","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":255888876,"title":"Blinken to travel to Britain to discuss Middle East","text":"WASHINGTON >> U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to travel to the United Kingdom on Monday, the State Department said, a week after Britain suspended some arms export licenses with Israel over equipment that could be used in the war in Gaza. In the trip slated to go through Tuesday, Blinken will open the U.S.-UK Strategic Dialogue, “reaffirming our special relationship,” Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson, said today. Blinken will also meet with senior government officials to discuss issues including the Indo-Pacific, the AUKUS defense pact between the U.S., Australia, Britain and the Middle East, and collective efforts to support Ukraine in the war against Russia. Britain said on Sept. 2 it was immediately suspending 30 of its 350 arms export licenses with Israel, saying there was a risk such equipment might be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law in Israel’s war with Hamas in the densely populated Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to succeed him, is under pressure from critics of the war to suspend some arms deliveries to Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally. A U.S. official said in July the Biden administration would resume shipping 500-pound bombs to Israel but would continue to hold back on supplying 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about their use in Gaza. CIA Director William Burns, chief U.S. negotiator for an end to the war in Gaza, said in London today that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the coming days.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to travel to the United Kingdom on Monday, the State Department said, a week after Britain suspended some arms export licenses with Israel over equipment that could be used in the war in Gaza.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/07/breaking-news/blinken-to-travel-to-britain-to-discuss-middle-east/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_blinken-6-11.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:01:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.026},{"id":255890352,"title":"Harris Targets Trump on Abortion in Latest Campaign Ad","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign released a TV advertisement on Saturday reminding voters that former President Donald J. Trump has taken credit for helping overturn Roe v. Wade, and targeting the growing share of voters who say that abortion is their top issue. The new 30-second ad will appear on broadcast and cable networks in seven swing states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin — and in Nebraska’s competitive Second Congressional District, the campaign said. It is part of a broader $370 million advertising blitz by the Harris campaign, which said it had not determined how much it would spend to broadcast the abortion spot. What the ad says Over ominous music, the ad opens with a clip of Mr. Trump saying in 2016 that “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who seek abortions. It then shows him saying this year that for “years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated and I did it, and I’m proud to have done it.” The narrator then says that Mr. Trump “wants to go further, with plans to restrict birth control, ban abortion nationwide, even monitor women’s pregnancies.”","summary":"The ad, which will run in several battleground states, comes as a growing share of voters say that abortion is their top issue.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/us/politics/harris-trump-ad-abortion.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/07/multimedia/07election-live-harris-ads-pckb/07election-live-harris-ads-pckb-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:00:42","author":"Tim Balk","authors":["Tim Balk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":255887388,"title":"Mark Hamill Coins a Hilarious New Moniker for Donald Trump: \"Don’t Call Him...\"","text":"Ever since President Joe Biden named Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor after withdrawing from the presidential race, former President Donald Trump has been relentless in launching verbal attacks at her, calling her 'Comrade Kamala', insulting her Indian lineage, and even mispronouncing her name as 'Ka-MA-la' or 'KUH-ma-la.' In light of the same, Star Wars actor, Mark Hamill, called out the Republican leader over his 'childish behavior.' He argued that it demonstrates \"disrespect and contempt.\" According to Huff Post, Hamill gave Trump a new moniker in response. “When they go low, we should respond in kind,” he suggested on X. “From now on, don’t call him ‘Don’. Call him ‘Done.’” He added, \"'La' Is that so difficult? Deliberately mispronouncing her name is both childish and his way of conveying disrespect and contempt.\" Netizens chimed in agreement with the Return of the Jedi actor's remarks, labeling Trump as a 'bully'. \"I like DonOld. But yes, purposely saying her name wrong lets them feel like they are in control of her,\" a person penned. \"You're completely right. There's only one way to deal with a bully. And it's certainly not by being the *better* person...it's by giving them all of their same 'medicine' right back. 'Done' is done,\" an X user quipped. \"Done-old Trump. Just like it sounds,\" another mocked. According to The New York Times, Trump once tried to justify his pronunciation after backlash. “Some people think I mispronounce it on purpose...but actually, I’ve heard it said about seven different ways,” he said. \"They were explaining to me, 'You can't say \"ka-MALA\" — you can say \"COMMA-la,\"' Trump remarked, adding, \"'Don't worry about it — I couldn't care less if I mispronounce it. I couldn't care less,'\" at a rally. In 2017, Harris sat down for an interview with CNN's David Axelrod for The Axe Files podcast, where she educated the audience on how to pronounce her name right. \"There are many ways. If you were asking my grandmother, she'd say, 'KUH-muh-lah.' I usually help people pronounce it by saying, 'Well, just think of a comma and add a 'la' at the end.'\" Meanwhile, according to University of Michigan psychology professor, Myles Durkee, Trump's mispronunciation of her name is an attempt to 'other' her. \"When you intentionally mispronounce someone's name who's less traditional in the American context, it's almost a dog whistle to othering that person, trying to suggest they're less American, that they're less worthy of you saying their name correctly in the first place,\" Durkee argued. At a recent political event, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff also brought up the same and stated to the audience that he had a remedy if Trump continued to struggle with pronouncing her name. \"Here's the good news: After November, you can call her 'Madam President,'\" Emhoff quipped.","summary":"Trump has repeatedly mispronounced VP Kamla Harris&#39; first name.

Nerves and excitement will be high that night as Americans tune in to the much-anticipated debate in Philadelphia, following a dismal performance from President Joe Biden in Atlanta in late June when he went up against Trump.In a video posted to X, former Twitter, user Julia Hamelburg shared a video of Harris meeting with locals at a small business in Pittsburg as she hugged a woman who began crying.In the video, Harris can be seen embracing the woman and reassuring her that \"we are going to be good, we are going to be fine. We are all in this together.\"As of Saturday afternoon, the video has garnered over 1.2 million views and has been shared by Kamala HQ on X where it has garnered over 325,000 views.\"Donald Trump could literally never. WATCH Kamala Harris steps out of debate prep in Pittsburgh to inspire the next generation, chat with voters, thank a teacher, and be a normal, wholesome person,\" Hamelburg wrote on X as she shared the video.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaign via email for comment.In a campaign press release, the Harris campaign gave additional details surrounding the moment.\"During a visit to Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Vice President Harris took a break from preparing for Tuesday's debate to meet young people, teachers, families, and community members. In a personal exchange, she reminded a voter that she is in this fight with and for all of them. She also thanked a teacher, met a young consumer protection lawyer, and inspired a middle school student to be a leader,\" the Harris campaign said.The moment comes as Harris is on day two of a five-day working session in Pittsburgh, getting ready for Tuesday's presidential debate against Trump.Harris arrived at the Omni William Penn Hotel early Thursday afternoon as The New York Times reported on Saturday that Harris is \"holed up\" for five days in a hotel room in the city in preparation for the debate. While Harris' debate prep is \"highly choreographed,\" as the Times put it, Trump's campaign is not even calling it \"debate prep\" but rather \"policy time\" in which the former president has held a few sessions so far.Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state in this year's election with both candidates targeting the state, with Harris and Biden attending a Labor Day parade last week in Pittsburgh. It was the first time the two have shared a speaking slot on the political stage since Biden ended his reelection campaign in July, making Harris the candidate.Their visit followed an appearance by Trump in the state late last month when he visited Johnstown, just 75 miles from where he was shot during a campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two others injured, while Trump was struck in the ear.Battleground states will play a key role in determining the result of this year's election due to the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population. A presidential candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success.According to FiveThirtyEight's polling average, as of Saturday afternoon the vice president is 0.7 points ahead of Trump in the state, with 46.2 percent to his 45.5 percent.Although Harris is leading in the polling averages, recent polls in Pennsylvania have also shown the pair tied, including the latest surveys conducted by Wick and Emerson College between August 25 and 29 where the two tied at 48 percent.Meanwhile, other polls have shown Trump in the lead, including a Trafalgar Group poll from August 30, which put the former president 2 points ahead of Harris among likely voters with 47 to 45 percent. A SoCal Strategies poll from August 23 put the former president 1 point ahead with 48 percent to Harris' 47 percent while a Fabrizio Ward poll from August 21 also put the Republican 1 point ahead in a head-to-head matchup.","summary":"In the video, the vice president can be seen embracing the woman and reassuring her that \"we are all in this together.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-kamala-harris-embracing-crying-woman-takes-off-online-1950376","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2466486/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:48:02","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.269},{"id":255887410,"title":"Trump Threatens to Let Conspiracy Theorist Senator ‘Run’ Education in Wisconsin","text":"Donald Trump held a rally on Saturday in Wisconsin, one of the key battleground states that may help determine the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. He visited the town of Mosinee as he worked to shore up his base, which includes working-class and rural dwellers. With 59 days to the election, on Saturday he proposed killing the federal Department of Education. “I’m dying to get back to do this: We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education and send education back to Wisconsin and back to the states,” Trump said to cheers. “We’ll send it back to the states so that Ron Johnson can run it.” Wisconsin Republican Sen. Johnson has been perpetrating several conspiracy theories, most recently positing without evidence that the federal government might have been involved in the assassination attempt of Trump in July. “When you don’t know the federal government involvement in the JFK assassination, when you really don’t know what happened with Nixon … that might’ve been the second coup,” Johnson told the Federalist Radio Hour podcast on Thursday, via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “The first coup is you take out Kennedy, the second coup you take out Nixon, and then you take out Trump.” He also incredulously blamed large schools for the shooting. Back in 2022, Johnson also promoted misinformation regarding Covid, claiming that mouthwash and other unproven treatments could kill the coronavirus. At his rally on Saturday, Trump also fixated on some of his typical personal bugaboos, including crowd size (he’s been particularly obsessed with rally attendance since Vice President Kamala Harris has been drawing high, enthusiastic audiences at the 2024 rallies she’s held since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race). “This is a big crowd,” he said shortly before the two-hour rally began, noting that “nobody’s ever had crowds like this“ and he mentioned the crowd size several times during his speech, which included several mispronunciations (he referred to Elon Musk as “Leon” and said “president of the United Spates,” among other foibles). He also revisited his rhetoric on migrants and egregiously claimed women in blue states are executing babies. He also once again addressed he and his VP running mate J.D. Vance being called “weird,” which he also focused on earlier in the week during a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. On Saturday, he said the “fake news” called him and his VP nominee “weird,” but Trump accused Harris’ VP running mate Tim Walz as being the “weird” one because he signed into Minnesota law that schools require access to menstrual products in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. “He is really weird, this guy,” he said of Walz. “Can you imagine, I’m weird?” Trump has been losing some of his support in several demographic groups since Harris took over the top spot on the Democratic ticket, formally accepting the party’s nomination in August. Harris is leading Trump among Hispanic voters by 13 percentage points, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted in August, and she has increased her support among Black Americans. However, her support among white voters without a college degree has remained about the same, while that demographic supports Trump by 25 points, per the same poll. Meanwhile, Harris has raked in record-breaking donations, while Trump has been banking on billionaires to try to put him back in the White House. Trump and Harris will face-off on Tuesday in Philadelphia for their first debate before the election, which will air on ABC News.","summary":"GOP presidential nominee hit rural town of Mosinee in battleground state on Saturday","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-ron-johnson-end-federal-department-of-education-1235097401/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DonaldTrump-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:47:52","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":255886340,"title":"Beloved pop star looks unrecognisable in a cropped red wig as she films her new music video at The Louvre - can YOU guess who it is?","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 7th 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Nicole Kidman reveals her 'heart is broken' as her beloved mother Janelle died just hours before she was awarded Best Actress for her role in Babygirl at the Venice Film Festival: Australian star has emotional tribute read to stunned audience Revealed: The real reason Prince Harry may be on a 'golden ticket' diplomatic visa in the U.S. and why getting a green card could be a financial 'dagger to the heart' for the Royal Family Is Kate's return to public life on the horizon?

Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, jousted with Trump during three high-stakes debates that year. She recently told The New York Times that Harris should use her background as a prosecutor to make a case against Trump. “She just should not be baited. She should bait him,” Clinton told the newspaper. Clinton argued that during a key moment in the final 2016 presidential debate, her needling of Trump on foreign affairs – where she called him a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin – threw him off balance. “He can be rattled,” Clinton told the Times. “He doesn’t know how to respond to substantive, direct attacks.” “And I think that from her prosecutorial background, I think that’s what she will be equipped to do,” Clinton added. You don&apos;t need to be a Democrat to agree that Hillary Clinton was right about Putin’s puppet #TBTpic.twitter.com/XUGCmTdTyo — Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) July 21, 2023 Clinton, who in 2016 won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Trump after coming up short in pivotal battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, said the debate would be a prime opportunity for Harris to offer a contrast with the former president as they appeal to wavering voters. “There still is enough potential movement in key states where people can be persuaded that they don’t want to sign on for another four years of him,” Clinton said. Trump in both 2016 and 2020 relentlessly sought to control the tone of his debates with Clinton and current US President Joe Biden, respectively. In the first televised debate of the 2020 election, Trump frequently spoke over Biden, so much so that Biden told Trump to “shut up” after several interruptions. Biden’s one-time 2024 re-election bid was eventually derailed in large part by a poor debate performance against Trump in June. The next month, Biden stepped aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee and endorsed Harris as his successor, paving the way for her ascension as the party’s new standard-bearer. Harris and Trump, who are locked in a highly competitive race, will face off on Tuesday at the National Constitution Centre in Philadelphia.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, the Closer actor, 51, revealed his metamorphosis for the historical drama was his 'most extreme transformation yet', while also reflecting on some of the lower moments of his career. Starring alongside Alicia Vikander, who plays Henry VIII's sixth wife Katherine Parr, Jude transforms into a miserable incarnation of the king who could barely walk at the time, weighed 28st and needed nine men to lift him on his horse. Lifting the lid on how he managed to gain weight for the role, he said: 'It was a process. 'Like Charlie Chaplin or Father Christmas, Henry has a familiar silhouette, so if you get that shape, the brain fills in a lot of the gaps. So I grew a beard. I had bodysuits, clothes, weights on my legs and bits in my shoes to perfect his gait. Jude Law has revealed he gorged on 'late night ice-cream' as part of his 'extreme' transformation into a bloated Henry VIII The Closer actor revealed his metamorphosis for the historical drama was his 'most extreme transformation yet' (pictured with co-star Alicia Vikander) 'I only had about four months to prep, so couldn't balloon up to full weight, but I did eat loads — late-night pasta and ice cream — so I had a bigger face. He added bluntly that sometimes he would think of him as a 'paraplegic gorilla' as if he had a lot of power but couldn't move, in a way that made him 'weirdly helpless'. The acting icon believes Firebrand is in fact about 'surviving domestic abuse' and describes his character as 'a gangster — a former golden boy who's rotting'. The London-born star, originally from Lewisham, has been Hollywood's darling between the 1990s and early 200s after his legendary performances in films as The Talented Mr Ripley, Closer, Cold Mountain, Road To Perdition and AI. In 2004 he became Alfie Cartwright for the remake of romcom Alfie, for which Jude was paid £6 million - yet he admitted he was 'probably paid too much'. Not too long after it, he became the topic of a Chris Rock joke at the Oscars, comparing him with Tom Cruise. 'Why is he in every movie I've seen in the last four years?,' the comedian joked, but Jude revealed he found it 'upsetting'. 'The attention cools off if your movies are not making a ton of money.

Jude's most recent project, historical crime film The Order, just premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August and will be available to watch on Prime Video. Jude's performance as Terry Husk, a washed-up FBI agent who goes up against real-life white supremacist group The Order, received a seven-minute standing ovation at the Festival.

Jude Law and Nicholas Hoult battle wildfire smoke to film tense scenes for their new crime film The Order in Canada He said of his character: 'There was a sort of lived-in -quality to him that I enjoyed. 'There was a lot of discussion about facial hair, but every agent I interviewed had a moustache, so it was just a given that I had to grow one.' Also starring are Alison Oliver, Tye Sheridan, Jurnee Smollett, and Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas plays The Order leader Bob Mathews, an American neo-Nazi who led the white supremacist group in 1983. Nicholas revealed that the film's director -Justin Kurzel gave each actor a 'manifesto' for their character, including tasks for them to complete. 'I just found out on the boat here – one of Jude's tasks was to follow me for a day!' he said. 'He was -trailing me for a day when I landed in Calgary.' The Order is based on the 1989 biography The Silent Brotherhood by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt. It was written by Zach Baylin and distributed by Prime Video (though Amazon MGM Studios). Though a Prime Video film, Vertical acquired partial rights to the film, and will release it on December 6, 2024, in a limited theatrical release. At The Order's Venice Film Festival press conference, Jude spoke about the importance of the film at a time when far-right ideologies are rising again. In 2004 he became Alfie Cartwright for the remake of romcom Alfie, for which Jude was paid £6 million - yet he admitted he was ' probably paid too much' (pictured at the afterparty of Alfie's London premiere with ex Sienna Miller in 2004) 'There is a definite tier system as to who is offered what first, and if the work is not coming in as freely you have to consider what you want to do,' he told bluntly about the film industry Jude's most recent project, historical crime film The Order, just premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August and will be available to watch on Prime Video. (cast pictured L-R: Matias Garrido, Nicholas Hoult, Jurnee Smollett, director Justin Kurzel, Jude, Tye Sheridan, and Philip Lewitski) 'Sadly, the relevance speaks for itself,' he said. 'It felt like a piece of work that needed to be made now. It’s always interesting finding a piece from the past that has some relevant relationship to the present day.” Director Justin agreed with Law, adding that the film’s parallels with today’s world were what made it so interesting to make. 'It’s always an extraordinary thing when you find a piece of writing or event from the past that has some sort of perspective that can have a conversation with today’s politics. That’s a rare gem. So, we felt that there was a lot that was being said about today.'

(AP) — With just days to go before his first — and likely only — debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump leaned into his familiar grievances about everything from his indictments and efforts to keep him off the ballot as he campaigned in one of the most deeply Republican swaths of battleground Wisconsin. “The Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail — they want me in jail — for the crime of exposing their corruption,” Trump claimed at an outdoor rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, where he spoke behind a wall of bullet-proof glass following his July assassination attempt. There’s no evidence that either Biden or Harris have had any influence over decisions by the Justice Department or local jurisdictions to indict Trump. The former president was speaking a day after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, returning attention to his many indictments and criminal conviction. After his appearance, he delivered a lengthy statement to news cameras in which he brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct — at times in graphic language — potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten. Hours later, a Manhattan judge announced that the sentencing in his hush money case had been postponed until after the November election, granting him a hard-won reprieve. The sentencing had previously been scheduled for Sept. 18, about seven weeks before Election Day. At the rally, Trump again criticized Harris in dark and ominous language, claiming that if the woman he calls “Comrade Kamala Harris gets four more years, we will be living in a full-blown Banana Republic ruled by anarchy.” He also railed against the Biden administration’s border policies, calling the Democrats’ approach “suicidal.” Both Harris and Trump have been frequent visitors to Wisconsin this year, a state where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. Several polls of Wisconsin voters conducted after President Joe Biden withdrew showed Harris and Trump in a close race. The crowd in Mosinee was greeted by a big screen video of Trump urging attendees to check their voter registration and make a plan for voting. “If we swamp them, they can’t cheat,” Trump said, continuing to raise unfounded concerns about voter fraud, which is extremely rare. Democrats consider Wisconsin to be one of the must-win “blue wall” states. Biden, who was in Wisconsin on Thursday, won the state in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes. Trump carried it by a slightly larger margin, nearly 23,000 votes, in 2016. As Trump was campaigning, Harris took a short break from debate prep on Saturday to stop at Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, where she bought a number of seasoning mixes. One customer saw the Democratic nominee and began openly weeping as Harris hugged her and said, “We’re going to be fine. We’re all in this together.” Harris said she was honored to have endorsements from two major Republicans: former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman. “People are exhausted, about the division and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans,” she said, adding that her main message at the debate would be that the country wants to be united. “It’s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,” she said. “It’s time to bring our country together, to chart a new way forward.” Trump held his rally in the central Wisconsin city of Mosinee, with a population of about 4,500 people. It is within Wisconsin’s mostly rural 7th Congressional District, a reliably Republican area in a purple state. Trump carried the county where Mosinee is located by 18 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020. Among those in the crowd was Dale Osuldsen, who was celebrating his 68th birthday Saturday at his first ever Trump rally. He hopes a second Trump administration will take on “cancel culture” and bring the country back to its “foundational past. “We’ve had past administrations say they want to fundamentally change America,” Osulden said. “Fundamentally changing America is a bad thing.” Democrats have relied on massive turnout in the state’s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, to counter Republican strength in rural areas like Mosinee and the Milwaukee suburbs. Trump must win the votes in places like Mosinee to have any chance of cutting into the Democrats’ advantage in urban areas. Republicans held their national convention in Milwaukee in July and Trump has made four previous stops to the state, most recently just last week in the western Wisconsin city of La Crosse. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last month filled the same Milwaukee arena where Republicans held their national convention for a rally that coincided with the Democratic National Convention just 90 miles away in Chicago. Walz returned Monday to Milwaukee, where he spoke at a Labor Day rally organized by unions. ___ Bauer reported from Madison.

Smikle told Newsweek on Saturday that the Cheney family's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris gives Republicans and independents \"permission\" to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee.This week, Harris scored the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney. Both devout conservatives, Dick and Liz Cheney have been critical of former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, especially after his supporters laid siege to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. In their separate endorsements, Dick and Liz Cheney called Trump a \"threat\" and a \"danger,\" respectively.In an email to Newsweek on Saturday afternoon, Smikle, an MSNBC political analyst and part-time lecturer of international and public affairs at Columbia University, said, \"The Cheney endorsements help provide that permission structure for Republicans and independents who may have stayed home to come out and vote for her.\"Smikle said that campaigns are additive, meaning that they try to gain voters rather than \"reduce support by doubling down on polarizing ideology. Harris is moving to the middle to capture more voters.\"\"Her campaign realized that they need to appear cohesive, focused, and forward-thinking with inspirational and aspirational messages about opportunities in a Democratic administration,\" Smikle added.When reached for comment by Newsweek on Saturday afternoon, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said via email, \"Who's Basil A. Smikle?\"On Wednesday, Liz Cheney said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, \"Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.\"\"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in a statement on Friday. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.\"Newsweek reached out to Liz Cheney for comment and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation where Dick Cheney is a trustee for comment from him via email on Saturday afternoon.On January 6, 2021, Trump's violent mob of supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election victory following repeated claims from Trump that the election was stolen from him via widespread voter fraud. There is no evidence to support such claims.The former president faces four felonies for his alleged actions to subvert the 2020 election and over 1,488 people have been charged for their alleged actions on January 6. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and claims the case is politically motivated.Liz Cheney, who served Wyoming's at-large district from 2017 to 2023 and was third in GOP House leadership, was at the Capitol when the insurrection occurred and served as one of only two Republicans on the House select committee tasked with investigating the events surrounding that day.Trump attacked the Cheney family following their endorsement of Harris in a social media post on his platform Truth Social.\"Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO [Republican in name only], along with his daughter, who lost by the largest margin in the History of Congressional Races!\" the former president wrote on Friday.Liz Cheney lost her GOP primary in Wyoming to Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman in 2022. The loss marked the second-worst defeat for a House incumbent in 60 years and was not \"the largest margin in the History of Congressional Races\" as Trump claimed.Trump continued in his Truth Social post: \"He's the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris. I am the Peace President, and only I will stop World War III!\"Dick Cheney was vilified by Democrats in the past over the George W. Bush administration's handling of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Trump wrote on Friday that Liz Cheney's actions \"with the Unselect Committee of Political Losers is unthinkable,\" and accused the bipartisan panel of lawmakers of deleting evidence related to the investigation, despite there being no evidence of such claims and members of the committee pushing back on his claims.Smikle told Newsweek on Saturday that Trump's campaign strategy \"has been to double down on rather antiquated, if not belligerent, views toward women and resurrected racial and gendered critiques of black women in particular in positions of power.\"He added: \"Those actions, even among Republicans that may be inclined to vote for him, don't traditionally entice exponentially more voters to run to the polls or speak with intensity about their support. He'll certainly have his base, but growth is another story.\"","summary":"Dick and Liz Cheney's endorsement of Harris helped her with Republican and independent voters, Dr. Basil A.

There’s a stage and replica TV lighting and an adviser in full Lee Strasberg method-acting mode, not just playing Donald Trump but inhabiting him, wearing a boxy suit and a long tie. The former president’s preparations are more improv. They are pointedly called not “debate prep” but “policy time,” meant to refresh him on his record. Nobody is playing Harris; sometimes his aides sit at a long table opposite him and bat questions back and forth, or other times he pulls up a chair closer to them. Trump has held just a handful of sessions so far, interrupting one at his Las Vegas hotel so he and his advisers could go up to his suite to watch Harris’ convention speech. While the two camps’ preparations for the big night in Philadelphia could not be more different, both sides view the debate the same way, according to interviews with nearly two dozen people close to the candidates, many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss the private preparations. The Harris and Trump teams see it as a crucial moment to define Harris for millions of swing voters who know what they think about Trump but are still curious about her. Bringing out Trump’s most self-destructive instincts is a priority for Harris, as is coming across as coolheaded and presidential. “She should not be baited, she should bait him,” Hillary Clinton, the last woman to debate Trump, said in an interview Thursday. “When I said he was a Russian puppet, he just sputtered onstage. I think that’s an example of how you get out a fact about him that really unnerves him.” In Trump’s debate prep sessions, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has embraced the role of posing tough questions to Trump, including on uncomfortable subjects like his criminal convictions, according to a person with knowledge of the gatherings. Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic member of Congress from Hawaii who memorably attacked Harris in a 2019 presidential primary debate, has also been helping Trump prepare. Trump’s advisers are acutely aware of the risk that he could appear overly aggressive, as he did in his first, disastrous debate with Joe Biden in 2020, when the COVID-infected Trump sweated profusely and incessantly interrupted his rival. Trump advisers worry that he will not be able to stop himself from showing his deep contempt for Harris or from seeming to lecture a female opponent. While he respected Clinton as “smart” and a hard worker, Trump believes that Harris is unintelligent, advisers and allies say. In private, he uses misogynistic language to describe her and gossips about her past romantic relationships, including with Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco. The former president’s allies and advisers have urged him to be “happy Trump” in the debate rather than “mean, bully Trump,” as one close ally put it, while pressing a policy-based case against Harris. There are risks to that approach as well: One ally warned that if Trump tried to stay on his best behavior, he could overcorrect and come across as “low energy.” The Trump team also expects him to face tough questions about abortion, a topic on which he has been all over the map in recent weeks, appearing uncertain about how to position himself. The Trump camp has a straightforward goal for the debate: to force Harris both to own her partnership with the unpopular Biden and to take responsibility for the parts of his presidency that voters are unhappiest about. Trump has focused in particular on the high cost of living; chaos around the world, especially in Ukraine and the Middle East; public safety; and immigration. “You can’t ‘turn the page’ when you’re singularly responsible for the current economic and border nightmare our country is living through,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said when asked about the campaign’s debate strategy. Trump’s aides hope he can create his own version of Ronald Reagan’s famous moment in his 1980 debate against President Jimmy Carter, when Reagan asked television viewers whether they felt better off now than before Carter took office. Harris has also telegraphed how she plans to go after Trump. Unlike Biden, she has not focused squarely on portraying the former president as a fundamental threat to American democracy. She has tried to minimize him as a stale old act who is repeating his same tired playbook. And she has painted him as a rich guy who cares only about helping other rich guys — a populist line of attack that resonates with voters in focus groups. Harris has also ditched Clinton’s unsuccessful strategy of denouncing Trump as a racist and a misogynist. The vice president’s aides believe it’s a waste of time to tell voters what a terrible person Trump is, given how hard it is to find a voter who does not already have a fixed view of his character — good or bad. Instead, Harris is trying to connect with the thin slice of undecided voters who feel sour about the economy and worried about the future, and who want to hear what each candidate will do to improve their lives. Harris and those advising her understand that the debate will be a race to define herself and her political brand before Trump can. And despite all the noise in liberal circles that Trump is torpedoing his campaign with his undisciplined behavior, Harris and the people ensconced in the hotel with her are not underestimating him. One challenge for Harris is that Trump, who clashed onstage with Biden in June, has more recent debate experience than the vice president has. She must try to shake off the rust while anticipating what it will be like to stand feet away from someone she has never met but who has attacked her policies, her political past and even her racial identity. Harris is preparing for attacks on her race and her political and personal relationships. Harris’ sessions, at the Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, have been led by Karen Dunn, a Democratic lawyer who also helped Clinton prepare for debates. Dunn’s co-pilot is Rohini Kosoglu, Harris’ former domestic policy adviser and Senate chief of staff. A few others with whom Harris feels comfortable, and who can be trusted to deliver tough feedback, have joined the sessions, people briefed on the process said. They include Sean Clegg, a political consultant who was a lead strategist on Harris’ 2020 campaign. Clegg’s talent, people who work with him say, is that he knows Harris well enough that he can encourage her to speak in a way that is accessible; if he hears something that sounds too dense, he will flag it for her. Philippe Reines, a former aide to Clinton, is reprising his 2016 role as Trump. The Trump team held a three-hour debate prep session Tuesday at his private club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Additional sessions are planned for Sunday and Monday. When Gaetz was asked about the preparations, he stayed on message. “President Trump doesn’t do debate prep,” he texted on Friday. “He regularly assembles advisors to talk about how he will secure the border, lower prices and stop the global chaos caused by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Just another day at Mar-a-Lago!” In fact, Trump has done more work preparing for the 2024 debates than he ever did in 2016 and 2020. He has been briefed on Harris’ past debate performances and her verbal tics. He remembers well her viral moment in 2020 when she debated Vice President Mike Pence and cut off his attempted interruption by saying, “I’m speaking.” Referring to that exchange, Trump has privately told associates, “I’m not going to let her do to me what she did to Mike.” He was happy to let his advisers negotiate the muting of microphones when the candidates are not talking. (Harris’ team had been pushing for microphones to be unmuted, hoping that Trump would talk obnoxiously over her and give her an opening for a snappy riposte.) The two candidates will debate without a live audience, from behind lecterns. In private, Trump has toyed repeatedly with dropping out of the debate, which is being hosted by ABC News, one of his least favorite networks. (No other debates are scheduled yet.) He has ranted about what he claims is its unfairness toward him and has proposed debates on other networks. He has particular hatred for ABC’s star anchor George Stephanopoulos, whom he nicknamed “Slopadopoulos.” Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos this year over an interview related to one of the former president’s court cases, and in discussions about the debate, Trump’s advisers told ABC he would not consent to one moderated by Stephanopoulos. Trump has also complained about another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, who asked him pointed questions at a recent conference of Black journalists, during which he questioned Harris’ racial identity. (The debate hosts ended up being ABC News’ David Muir and Linsey Davis.) Ultimately, Trump concluded that the downsides of skipping the debate — especially the appearance of weakness — outweighed his concerns about attending. He has told associates that he has a good relationship with Muir and is comfortable with his selection as one of the debate hosts. ——— This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is holed up for five days in a Pittsburgh hotel, doing highly choreographed debate practice sessions before Tuesday night&#8217;s clash.

August 26 marked three years since the Abbey Gate suicide bombing attack outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, which killed 13 U.S. service members, injured 18 others, and killed about 170 Afghans. During a speech in Detroit marking the day, Trump placed the blame for the “humiliation in Afghanistan” on both Harris and Mr. Biden. In a response first shared with CBS News, Harris’ campaign is using Trump’s announcement, and abrupt cancellation, five years ago of a meeting at Camp David with Taliban leaders, to highlight the role his deal with the Taliban played in the withdrawal. The campaign argues that Trump’s deal created a “virtually impossible” deadline and left “the Biden-Harris administration with zero plans for an orderly withdrawal — only a dangerous, costly mess.” “Trump shamelessly attacks the vice president because he hopes he can trick the country into forgetting that his own actions put troops in harm’s way,” Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein told CBS News. “Trump wanted to bring the Taliban to Camp David just days before September 11th—think about that. He cut a bad deal with the very same people who violently took over Afghanistan and led to the collapse of the Afghan government.” On Sept. 7, 2019, Trump tweeted that a meeting with the Taliban was canceled after a U.S. soldier was killed in an attack by the terrorist group. Months later, in February 2020, Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban to pave the way for a significant drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by the end of that year, in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban that the country would not be used for terrorist activities. However, Taliban attacks on Afghan forces continued. Trump’s former national security adviser H.R. McMaster called the deal a “surrender agreement with the Taliban” during a podcast interview. CBS News has reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the Harris campaign’s criticism. The attack at the Kabul airport happened during the effort by Mr. Biden to evacuate American soldiers and Afghans out of Afghanistan, part of a longtime goal shared by him and Trump to officially end the long-running war. House Republicans are currently investigating the Biden administration’s withdrawal. Mr. Biden panned Trump’s Taliban deal, but followed through with it, extending the withdrawal deadline by a couple of months to have troops out by Sept. 11, 2021, to avoid further military escalation in the country. “It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself but it was an agreement made by the United States government, and that means something,” Mr. Biden said in April 2021. A plurality of respondents in an August 2021 CBS News poll believed the removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan went “very badly,” and the moment began a steady decline of Mr. Biden’s approval rating. In recent weeks, Trump has leaned into more criticism of Mr. Biden and Harris over the attack and the withdrawal. In late August, Trump was invited to the Arlington National Cemetery by family members of some service members for a wreath-laying ceremony. The visit was overshadowed by an altercation between a cemetery employee and Trump’s campaign over the presence of a campaign photographer, which the families granted permission for access but the cemetery’s federal law prohibits. During a speech at the National Guard Association conference in Detroit later that day, Trump called on the resignations of Biden administration officials involved in the withdrawal. “It’s not even believable how stupid these people were, to allow this to happen to our country. And we became a laughing stock all over the world, and we buried 13 soldiers,” he added. In a statement that day, Harris reaffirmed her support for Mr. Biden’s decision to end the war and wrote that the 13 deceased service members “represent the best of America, putting our beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe.” Before becoming vice president, Harris had supported a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and an end to the war. In April 2021, she said she was the last person Mr. Biden consulted with before the president decided to withdraw all remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As the chaotic withdrawal unfolded in August 2021, Harris emphasized the focus on evacuating American citizens and Afghans working with the U.S. “There’s no question there will be and should be a robust analysis of what has happened,” she said during a trip to Singapore in 2021. contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; campaign is rehashing former President Donald Trump&#8217;s 2020 deal with the Taliban, as the Republican nominee has repeatedly criticized her for the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan during President Biden&#8217;s first year in office.  August 26 marked three years since the Abbey Gate suicide bombing attack outside the Hamid &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Harris campaign hits Trump on 2020 Taliban deal in response to his criticism of Afghanistan withdrawal appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/harris-campaign-hits-trump-on-2020-taliban-deal-in-response-to-his-criticism-of-afghanistan-withdrawal/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/07/5d6eef36-20c4-4aa1-8490-8f2ece67f713/thumbnail/1200x630/7cacdc7e986d44c166043ef9325f4f21/trump-kamala-getty.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:25:37","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":255886062,"title":"Tight race for control of Congress could be decided by just a handful of campaigns","text":"The race for control of Congress is as close as ever, with barely two dozen House seats and a handful in the Senate likely to determine the majority this November and whether a single party sweeps to power with the White House. Lawmakers are returning to Washington for a three-week legislative sprint, away from the campaign trail where races have become “trench warfare” and a seat-by-seat slog. Many of the highest-profile races are being waged in Montana, New York, California and beyond, far from the presidential battleground states contested by Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. “Buckle up,” said Jack Pandol, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Upended by the summer shake-up that replaced President Joe Biden with Harris atop the Democratic ticket, the down-ballot campaigns enter this fall stretch at a virtual toss-up, a high-wire uncertainty where every single seat won or lost could make the difference in party control. What's changed is not so much the fundamentals of the individual races, but which side has the energy and enthusiasm to make sure their voters actually show up and cast their ballots, strategists said. Money, volunteers and voter enthusiasm are flowing to the Democratic campaigns since Harris replaced Biden. That's challenging Republicans who entered the election cycle favored for gains and buoyed by Trump’s comeback bid, despite the criminal charges hanging over his potential return to the White House. Trump and Republicans are working feverishly to regain the momentum they enjoyed from the GOP convention in Milwaukee and from the Supreme Court decision giving former presidents broad immunity from prosecution, including for some acts related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election and for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Trump’s campaign staff held a private conference call Friday with House Republicans, assuring them that the movement is shifting to Trump as they game out strategies ahead, according to another Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed conversation. “There’s a lot of handwringing going on and a lot of anxiousness about where this election is headed,” said Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Trump ally who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm. Speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, Daines played up GOP Senate candidates as warriors and predicted that enthusiasm from rural voters who will “crawl over broken glass” to vote for Trump will help Republicans such as Sam Brown, who is challenging Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev. Still, the fundraising gap Republicans now find themselves facing with Democrats is a problem, say GOP strategists on both ends of the Capitol, leaving them without money to keep pace with advertising and on-the-ground organizing. “We have a lot of work to do,” Daines said. Long gone are the days of supermajorities in the House and Senate, replaced by a new era of razor-thin margins that leave little margin for errors in political campaigns, or actual governing. Democrats are almost certain to see their narrow majority slip to at least a 50-50 split with Republicans with the retirement of independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. His departure is making way for Republican Gov. Jim Justice to handily win that seat. Trump is wildly popular in Montana, where Senate Republicans see their best chance to go on offense as they challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. But Tester is also a popular figure in the Big Sky state, where a whopping $238 million-plus is being spent on ads. Senate Republicans had the advantage this this cycle, with few incumbents to protect, allowing them to challenge Democrats with handpicked, often wealthy recruits in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. Democrats have only more recently gone on offense in long-shot races against Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. But incumbents often bring longevity and name recognition to the race, making them tough to topple, as is the case in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Sen. Bob Casey is being challenged by Republican Dave McCormick, and in Ohio, where Sen. Sherrod Brown is running a playful cookie-eating television ad as he faces Republican Bernie Moreno. For the open seat in Democratic-heavy Maryland, the state’s popular former Republican governor, Larry Hogan, who was courted to run by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, is in a tough matchup against county executive Angela Alsobrooks. She would make history as one of the few Black women elected to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has predicted Democrats will keep their majority. In a Senate split, majority control goes to the party in the White House because the vice president can cast deciding votes. “Democrats have never been in a stronger position to defend our Senate majority,\" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has crisscrossed the country this summer in some 20 states as what he calls an “ambassador of hope” in his party's quest to save its razor-thin majority. The Republicans are trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts where Biden had won, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere. But House Democrats, whose campaign chairwoman, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state was among those who spoke privately to Biden about the potential down-ballot drag as he weighed his decision to exit the race, are benefiting from the Harris momentum. Democrats are working to protect their own most embattled House lawmakers, a handful of pragmatic legislators including Marcy Kaptur in Ohio, Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania and a trio of younger lawmakers who lead the centrist Blue Dog coalition — Mary Peltola of Alaska, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state and Jared Golden of Maine. Each faces a notable Republican: Nick Begich, from an Alaskan political family; Washington's Trump-endorsed Joe Kent; and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault in Maine. Republicans have gone to great lengths to diversify their own ranks of what just a few years ago, remained a party of mostly white men, and few women. The 2018 election, for example, left about a about a dozen Republican women and no Black Republicans in the House. GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, chairman of the NRCC, said House Republicans are “right where we expected to be,” acknowledging it’s a “trench warfare” fight. Because many of the House races are being contested so far from the presidential battlegrounds, candidates are being forced to stand up their own operations along with the congressional committees to turn out the vote. House Democrats are seeing an organic flow of volunteers mobilized, having knocked on more than 377,000 doors and made more than 845,000 phone calls in August, greater than in the previous three months combined, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said. House Republicans have propped up dozens of “Battle Stations” for voter outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly areas without Trump’s campaign infrastructure, and also report crowds of enthusiastic voters at events as Johnson traveled the country in the contested regions. Fundraising remains imbalanced as Democrats are outpacing Republicans with Harris atop the ticket, and Republicans are sounding alarms to their own donors to get off the sidelines. “We are on track to flip the Senate,\" said Jason Thielman, executive director of the NRSC. But he said the Democrats' “massive cash advantage is a real problem. The biggest thing preventing Senate Republicans from having a great night in November is the cash crunch.” Both the DSCC and DSCC posted record online fundraising in the days after Harris' campaign announcement and her team sent $25 million to down-ballot races, including $10 million each this past week to the House and Senate committees. DCCC Spokesperson Viet Shelton said grassroots enthusiasm to elect a Democratic House majority is \"at an all-time high.” He said voters want to elect “get-stuff-done incumbents” not a “rag-tag group\" of Republican candidates aligned with Trump.

Trump and Harris are now essentially tied in the polls, with the Republican again shrugging off a mountain of scandals that would have sunk candidates of the past. At the rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, the former president delivered his characteristic stream of insults, exaggerations and outright falsehoods, painting a picture of an apocalyptic America run by a leftist dictatorship -- a \"rogue regime.\" Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris, \"your government imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet, while weaponizing law enforcement to jail political opponents,\" Trump told several thousand supporters at an airport in the heartland of Trump's mostly white, conservative base. \"With your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing and plotting will come to an end.\" He denounced the string of criminal cases he faces over everything from attempting to overthrow his 2020 election loss to Biden, to dozens of felony fraud convictions in New York. Harris, taking a break from days of debate preparation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, visited a spice store where she drew a contrast to Trump's grim tone. Asked what message she would most like to get across in their debate Tuesday, she replied: \"It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together -- chart a new way forward.\" Harris said she was \"honored\" by the recent endorsements of two prominent conservatives, former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, adding, \"It's important to put country above party.\" Asked if she was ready to face Trump, Harris said simply, \"Yes, I am.\" Crowds outside cheered as she left the shop, and the Harris campaign released video of the vice president hugging emotional supporters there, including a young girl. Police union for Trump Trump got a boost Friday when the country's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, endorsed him despite his historic status as a convicted felon. And he enjoyed a legal victory earlier in the day when a New York judge delayed his sentencing for hush money paid to a porn star until after the November election. Trump also appeared before reporters to rail against the women who have accused him of sexual impropriety. Harris, a former California prosecutor, is leaning heavily on her message that she represents law and order in a contest against a convicted criminal who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss -- another unprecedented element in a political season that has the country on edge. Harris's policies The vice president jumped into the 2024 race at the last minute after Biden abruptly dropped out on July 21, amid fears over his stamina and mental acuity. Despite a burst of initial enthusiasm from Democrats, Harris has had to race to introduce and define herself. The debate on Tuesday offers her a prime opportunity to present clear policy proposals -- she has been criticized for a lack of detail -- while sharpening her attack lines against Trump. The former president, perhaps seeking to set expectations for the debate, said Saturday that the \"crooked system\" would not acknowledge if he won on Tuesday. \"They'll say, 'Trump suffered a humiliating defeat',\" he asserted. Pennsylvania, where Harris is preparing, is closely divided between Republican and Democratic voters, and may be the deciding piece in the puzzle of the state-by-state Electoral College battle that decides US presidential elections. The debate will be the first-ever meeting between Harris and Trump. He refused to attend Biden's inauguration -- he would have met her there -- after falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen from him.

The vice president is cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh where she can focus on honing crisp two-minute answers, per the debate’s rules. She’s been working with aides since Thursday and chose a venue that allows the Democratic nominee the option of mingling with swing-state voters. Trump, the Republican nominee, publicly dismisses the value of studying for the debate. The former president is choosing instead to fill his days with campaign-related events on the premise that he’ll know what he needs to do once he steps on the debate stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. “You can go in with all the strategy you want but you have to sort of feel it out as the debate’s taking place,” he said during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Trump then quoted former boxing great Mike Tyson, who said, “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Harris has said she is prepared for Trump to rattle off insults and misrepresent facts, even as her campaign has seen value in focusing on the middle class and the prospects of a better future for the country. “We should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth,” Harris said in a radio interview for the Rickey Smiley Morning Show. “He tends to fight for himself, not for the American people, and I think that’s going to come out during the course of the debate.” In her own preparation, Harris has the Democratic consultant Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, portraying Trump. She likes to describe Trump as having a “playbook” of falsehoods to go after Democrats such as Clinton and former President Barack Obama. Harris has said she understands Trump on a deeper psychological level. She has tried in speeches like her remarks at the Democratic National Convention to show that she would be a stronger leader than him — an argument that gets at Trump’s own desire to project and show strength. Trump’s June 27 debate against President Joe Biden shook up the election, with Biden’s disastrous performance ultimately leading to him stepping aside as the Democratic nominee and endorsing Harris. Both campaigns know the first in-person meeting between Harris and Trump could be a decisive event in a tight race. Trump is preemptively criticizing the ABC News debate moderators, claiming he will not be treated fairly. But he said he plans to let Harris speak, just as he did during his debate with Biden. “I let him talk. I’m gonna let her talk,” he said during the Hannity town hall. Trump aides said that this time would be no different than the previous debate and that the former president would not be doing any more traditional prep. There are no stand-ins, no sets, no play-acting. Instead, they point to Trump’s frequent interviews, including taking questions at lengthy press conferences, sitting for hourlong podcasts, and participating in town halls with friendly hosts like Hannity. Trump also meets regularly with policy advisers who are experts on issues that may come up during the debate. During these informal sessions, they talk about the issues, Trump’s policies while he was in office, and the plans he’s put forth for a second term. “I have meetings on it. We talk about it. But there’s not a lot you can do. You either know your subject or not. You either have good policy or not,” he said in a New Hampshire radio interview. Before the last debate Trump held sessions with notable Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who at the time was under consideration to be Trump’s vice presidential pick. This time he has held sessions with Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate who is now backing Trump. Gabbard, who is also now a member of Trump’s transition team, was brought in specifically to help Trump this time around because she knows Harris, having debated her when the two were running for the Democratic nomination in 2020. She also hosted a recent town hall with Trump in Wisconsin. Trump, aides insist, intends to put Harris on the defensive. He wants to portray her as too liberal as he tries to tie her to Biden’s economic record and points out her reversals on issues such as a fracking ban that she no longer supports. “We look forward for the opportunity for Americans to see her on stage, incapable of defending her policies and flip-flops,” said Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. “The president’s proven he has a command of the issues, she does not.” Harris’ team is banking that Trump will come off as extreme and that they can use the debate as a springboard to further build on the momentum that her short campaign has generated. The campaign plans to use the pre-debate weekend to hold 2,000 events with volunteers and reach more than one million voters. “With hundreds of offices and thousands of staff across the battlegrounds, we are able to harness all the buzz around the debate and break through to hard-to-reach voters,” said Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground states director, in a statement.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTheir showdown reflects not just two separate visions for the country but&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris and Trump preparing differently for Tuesday&#8217;s debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/harris-and-trump-preparing-differently-for-tuesdays-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1725743880_rewrite-this-title-Harris-and-Trump-are-getting-ready-for.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:18:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":255885340,"title":"Trump Continues Obsession With Crowd Size —But Reports Show Harris Draws Similar Turnouts","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Donald Trump boasted early at his rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, on Saturday that the crowds turning out to his campaign events were greater than those of Vice President Kamala Harris—an obsessive topic with the former president—but on-the-ground reports, and a deeper look by The New York Times, showing the two presidential candidates draw comparable audiences. Trump's rally was held at Central Wisconsin Airport. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. Key Facts Trump, who spoke before a modest crowd assembled for a rally at the Central Wisconsin Airport, claimed Harris does not have big crowds into her rallies before lauding audience members who he claimed traveled to his rally from North Carolina. Trump said no other person has “had crowds like this… and the fake news knows it,” before pointing to a media section that was roundly booed by the crowd. The former president’s comments are the most recent in a series of remarks about the crowds his and Harris’ rallies draw, as he has repeatedly claimed the vice president’s crowds are smaller, even falsely accusing Harris of using artificial intelligence to cover up low attendance at a Detroit rally. Trump, who has exaggerated his own crowd sizes, draws similarly large audience numbers to Harris, according to The New York Times, which noted Trump’s longer speeches at three rallies last month possibly contributed to more crowd thinning than what was seen during three rallies of Harris’.

Big Number About 5,600. That is the average crowd size across 28 Trump rallies this year, according to an analysis from the Harvard Kennedy School. The average figure is similar to attendance averages of 4,600 in 2023 taken from a total of 19 Trump campaign events that year, the analysis noted. Tangent Former President Barack Obama criticized Trump during a speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, attacking his “weird obsession with crowd sizes.” Obama moved his hands apart and then brought them close together after the remark, looking down and acting surprised at his gesture, which provoked laughs from attendees. Key Background Trump’s focus on crowd sizes dates back to his first run for president, when the then-presidential candidate usually drew audiences larger than his Republican competitors or Hilary Clinton’s, The Washington Post reported, adding Trump regularly exaggerated the large turnouts of his campaign events. Trump’s campaign once moved a 2015 Phoenix rally to a larger venue to compensate for the 4,200 people who ended up attending, though the former presidential candidate later claimed the crowd size numbered about 15,000, according to the Post. That trend continued into his presidency. Trump falsely claimed his inauguration day speech drew 1.5 million people, which was disproved by photographs. Years later, Trump’s former Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was criticized on social media for claiming more than one million supporters showed up for Trump’s “Million MAGA March” in 2020, as videos and photos of the event appeared to show far less people in attendance than what McEnany claimed. Trump’s most recent notorious crowd size fib centered around his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 near the National Mall, which he claimed had more attendees than that of Martin Luther King Jr.’s iconic speech during the March on Washington in 1963. Trump’s claim was also disproven by photos of his and King’s speech, which was delivered to an estimated 250,000 people, according to the National Constitution Center. The Jan. 6 committee estimated Trump’s crowd numbered about 53,000.

While Sen. Graham would now disagree, since he has since transformed into a loyal Trump disciple, his prediction has come true. There is very little left other than its name and the elephant symbol that represents the old Republican Party. For example, imagine the party of Eisenhower and Reagan supporting Vladimir Putin over a democratic Ukraine and our NATO allies. Or imagine the once law and order party nominating a twice impeached sexual abuser and convicted felon for President. Unthinkable, but here we are. In a matter of weeks Americans will vote in what will be the most consequential election in our history. An election where what is at stake is much larger than the destruction of a political party. Knowing everything we now know about Donald Trump and the clear existential threat he poses to our Constitution, the rule of law, our governmental institutions and to democracy itself, the choice should be very clear. To paraphrase Lindsey Graham’s 2016 prediction, if we elect Trump, we will get destroyed… and some of us will deserve it. But in the end, we will all be left to suffer and mourn the failed great experiment in democracy Hon. Rich DiPentima Portsmouth, N.H. Rich: Calling this “the most consequential election in our history,” risks uttering the most hyperbolic statement in history—but who’s to say you’re wrong? Not us. In 60 days, the most powerful nation in the history of the world may or may not entrust our vast nuclear arsenal, and with it mankind’s future, to a felon whose family, if they cared for him at all, would have had him committed long ago. Current polls say this election is a tossup. Yes—and it seems like Anton Chigurh is the one who’s tossing the coin. The Editor –=≈=– When It’s Wrong to Go Right To the Editor: Please support Chuck Morse for Governor and Russell Prescott for Congress in the First Congressional District. Morse and Prescott have done what so many candidates fail to do: fight for and deliver on their campaign promises to make the lives of New Hampshire citizens better. Morse has spent more than a decade fighting to make New Hampshire citizens more safe, more prosperous, and more free. Learn about Chuck Morse here: https://www.chuckmorsefornh.com. As U.S. Senator, Kelly Ayotte didn’t fulfill her campaign promises; she increasingly voted with the Democrats, for example: she voted to start funding illegal immigrants (HR 240), restrict Second Amendment rights (HR 2578), and against eliminating wasteful Government agencies (HR 2028). It’s too bad we can’t count on Kelly Ayotte, she is a good speaker, knows how to appeal to voters. But she hasn’t explained why Republican voters should trust her this time. In his 14 years in office Russell Prescott fought to fulfill his campaign promises; he remained true to N.H. voters and his conservative beliefs. Prescott is also a winner, having won seven elections, including against, now U.S. Senator, Maggie Hassan twice. It’s vitally important to elect people who have demonstrated commitment to their promises in the face of strong opposition since Washington seduces so many politicians into abandoning their promises, e.g., Ayotte. Learn about Russell Prescott here: https://www.prescottforcongress.com. We must support the candidates who have proven they will fight for their campaign promises to make our lives better. If we don’t reward them, why should they fight so hard to govern for the people rather than just go along like many politicians do? Please support Chuck Morse for Governor and Russell Prescott for Congress in the First Congressional District. Don Ewing Meredith, N.H. Don: We are not surprised you support Chuck Morse. Listening to him being interviewed on NHPR, we were struck by the depth of his commitment to the fictional hellscape that is MAGA-world. Compared to the weathervane that is Kelly Ayotte, Morse appears to embody the rock-solid certainty that conservatives seem to find so irresistible. We use the weasel words “appear” and “seem” here because this insatiable thirst for certainty is so foreign to us. We see a fetish for certainty as a feeble defense mechanism. If we’ve learned anything from life, it’s to accept, and even embrace, ambiguity. As for Prescott, he is a Republican who has not renounced his party’s presidential candidate. He is therefore unfit for any public office. The Editor –=≈=– Defending and Supporting Warmington To the Editor: With the September primary election for the New Hampshire governor’s race just a few weeks away, negative campaign advertisements have started to make the rounds on television and social media. One recent ad targets Cinde Warmington for lobbying work she did 22 years ago for Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin when she was employed as an attorney for Shaheen Gordon. While it does not take 20/20 hindsight to see the harm this drug has done over the years to thousands of Granite Staters and their families, it is critical to remember that at the time there was legitimate concern in the medical community about taking legislative steps that would curb access to the drug for those needing it for legitimate pain relief. Representing her client, Warmington testified against a bill that eventually passed that required that patients try three alternative medications before being given OxyContin. When questioned for a 2023 Keene Sentinel article, former Sen. Sylvia Larsen said Warmington’s testimony was appropriate for a person acting as an advocate for a pharmaceutical company and for a drug that many in the medical community at the time considered to be a step forward for people suffering great pain. “A lobbyist has the role of representing a client in the best light possible,” Larsen said. The bottom line that two decades ago, Cinde Warmington did what every attorney who swears an oath promises do. She represented her client ethically and professionally, did not allow personal feelings to cloud her professional judgment, and presented her case within the best of her abilities—and ultimately still lost when the legislature passed the bill anyway. Since that time, she has spent nearly two decades advocating for expanding substance use disorder treatment services and increased access to telehealth services. She has also served on the boards of the New Hampshire Professionals Health Program, Riverbend Community Mental Health, and the Lakes Region Mental Health Center, where she served as Chair and also won an award for her advocacy on mental health issues. As a two-term Executive Councilor, she’s often been the lone voice of sanity during times when her Republican colleagues were busy trying to reject federal COVID outreach funding, rubber-stamp Governor Sununu’s extreme judicial and departmental appointments, and inexplicably vote down family planning funding. A trained litigator, she has never been shy in her work on the Executive Council when it comes to being a strong voice for those who don’t have a seat at the table—from people trying to obtain basic reproductive health services to families in need of rental assistance. In short, she is persistent, persuasive, and speaks her mind concisely, pointedly, and with impact. She also does her homework and, whenever pushback is justified, always gives her colleagues—and Governor Sununu—all they can handle. Bottom line, Cinde Warmington would be an amazing addition to the growing group of female Democratic governors committed to expanding economic and health care opportunities in their states, while pushing back hard against Trumpism and Project 2025. She will have your back—and she has our strong and enthusiastic endorsement. Rep. David Meuse, Rep. Joan Hamblett, and Hon. Peter Somssich Portsmouth, N.H. David, Joan, and Peter: Thank you for providing our readers with some crucial insight on this matter. Rep. Marjorie Smith [D-Durham] shares your view. In an August 31st letter to the Portsmouth Herald, she added a telling detail: “Cinde argued that physicians—not insurance companies—should be able to decide which medications were most beneficial and appropriate for their patients.” The Editor –=≈=– Who Do You Trust With The Economy? To the Editor: Which party is better for the economy, Republicans or Democrats? Do tax cuts for the rich spur job creation? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 51,825,000 jobs have been created since 1989. Of those, 1,840,000 jobs were created under Republican presidents. George H.[H.]W. Bush was responsible for 2,602,000 jobs in his four years, his son created 2,130,000 in eight years and Donald Trump’s presidency lost 2,892,000 jobs in his four years. Each of them promised cutting taxes would create jobs. They did not. Bill Clinton created 23,218,000 jobs in eight years, Barack Obama 10,562,000 in eight years and Joe Biden has already created 16,205,000 in less than four years. In total 49,985,000 jobs were created by these Democratic presidents. Each raised taxes during their term. Each democratic president came into office when the economy was slumping and left it booming. If taxes affect job creation, then cutting taxes on the rich, businesses, and allowing multinational businesses to avoid taxes on their foreign profits cost jobs and raising them on the rich and big businesses creates jobs. Walter Hamilton Portsmouth, N.H. Walter: The simplistic notion that there’s some button in the Oval Office that a president can push to create jobs makes us want to bang our editorial head against the newsroom wall. Some facts are undeniable, though. Democratic administrations work for workers. Republican administrations work for bosses. Large numbers are notoriously difficult to grasp, particularly when making comparisons. These employment figures are even more startling when seen as percentages. Of the 51.8 million new jobs created since 1989, Republicans created two percent. Democrats created the other 98 percent. Yet much of the public—and the media—swallow the old, unfounded assumption that Republicans are better at creating jobs. And don’t even get us started on the deficit. Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re going to pound another dent into the newsroom wall. The Editor –=≈=– Yearning for Imaginary Better Times Dear Editor, Some people support trump [sic] because they remember prices for gas and food were lower four years ago. They were. But so were wages. Then covid happened; the economy collapsed. Trump disparaged medical science and encouraged followers to go maskless, causing 300,000 avoidable deaths, out of the one million Americans who died. Under trump [sic], government aid checks were sent to keep people in their homes, and food on their tables. When Biden became President, Congressional Republicans voted against extending the covid aid, but Democrats prevailed. Biden’s aid saved millions from hunger and homelessness, but also caused inflation. Now, 3 ½ years later, inflation is coming down, prices are returning to normal, 15 million new jobs were created, and wages are rising faster than prices. Yearning for imaginary better times, when science was dismissed and relatives died because a power-craven, boastful narcissist couldn’t admit he was wrong, isn’t the path to a better future. Bruce Joffe Piedmont, Calif. Bruce: Perhaps the past thirty years have engendered a prejudice in us—Thanks, Newt!—but Republican voters, do not seem overly fond of thinking too deeply. “Make America Great Again,” the supposed savior bellows. His minions roar their approval. To what date would they like to set the Wayback Machine? We suspect the 1950s. That was when a man—a man—could have one job, own a home, feed his family, send his kids to college, and take an occasional vacation. In other words, the brief golden age created by organized labor. Ah, yes… the “good old days”—when women were expected to stay home and raise kids, and southern Blacks were restricted to “colored” water fountains. The Editor –=≈=– Who Did What at Maidan Square? Dear Editor, In order to understand the war in Ukraine one must consider the violent change of government in February 2014. The government had financial problems, like many European governments at the time, that likely stemmed from the U.S. mortgage-backed securities debacle. The Ukraine president and the opposition clashed in 2013 when the government decided to accept a loan package from the Russian government instead of the International Monetary Fund’s loan package. Protests occurred in Maidan Square in Kyiv for many months, until the president was forced to flee in February, 2014, following what is described in the Western press as a violent confrontation between protesters and the police. But in order to understand the events that transpired later one must understand who perpetrated the violence and why. Please find below the URL for a peer reviewed paper on the subject of the Maidan Square violence. This violence initiated a series of events that resulted in the Ukraine Civil War and the Russian Limited Military Operation. The events that transpired following the violence were not inevitable but those who were responsible for the violence assumed important roles in the new government. They showed themselves to be unwilling to use diplomacy to solve disagreements. Your Loyal Reader, Gregory Kalkanis Berkeley, Calif. Gregory: If we knew more about this we might be tempted to make a more detailed reply. We don’t, so we won’t. The Editor –=≈=– The Old Blowhard To The Editor: Donald Trump as a campaigner reveals a great deal about his personality, cognitive ability and style. His staff has worked hard to keep him focused on the issues facing the country to no avail. He misunderstands and/or exaggerates them, quickly veering off-script to his own concerns. He recites repeatedly his long list of grievances, and he relishes the game of finding the most noxious insults to his rivals. Or, he retreats to Mar-a-Lago and pouts. Trump’s field is entertainment, not government. His strongman bluster is a pretense to hide his insecurities in that area. He is apparently unable to research, absorb and analyze information, so he makes it up. He ad libs and acts impulsively rather than making informed decisions. Rather than strong, he is old, weak, and vulnerable to praise and flattery. Does that sound like presidential material for the richest, most powerful country in the world? Sounds downright frightening to me. And to our allies, by the way. Vote for Kamala Harris to save the day… and our nation! Cynthia Muse Rye, N.H. Cynthia: Einstein is supposed to have said, “Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the universe.” We would argue that there is now a third thing: Trump’s unfitness for the presidency. The Editor –=≈=– Character and Truth Matter Dear Editor: The American Legion Magazine (August, 2024) devoted two pages to the “border crisis,” stating: “The American Legion stands firm: Secure the borders.” Conspicuously missing from the article; Congress DID frame a bipartisan bill addressing well-known border problems but former President Trump instructed his devotees in Congress not to let it pass. Oversight by the American Legion… ? Hardly. They correctly conclude: “This is a national problem requiring bi-partisan solutions and actions by our Congress, president and governors.” The Biden Administration has endlessly (and wrongly) been accused of opening borders to every person on the planet, giving them iphones, credit cards, transportation to cities of their choice, hotel rooms, food, medical, education, even Social Security. It’s claimed “veterans have been pushed aside while illegals get top notch medical care.” Veterans have a right to know whether VA resources are being diverted to illegal immigrants and the American Legion did, emphatically, refute those lies. “Do illegal immigrants receive VA health care? No.” VA claims agents process claims on behalf of other federal agencies. This includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has a contract with the VA Financial Services Center (FSC) to process medical claims. However, the agency doesn’t incur any costs for the claims that come from the ICE program. According to VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes, “no resources meant for veterans are used as part of this agreement. FSC provides administrative functions for ICE, using ICE funds, having zero impact on veterans health care or benefits.” I passionately believe that veterans organizations should feel duty-bound to speak to these outrageous lies and, unashamedly, reveal the sources of these lies. We are but days away from an election that could alter the course of history, determining whether our Republic remains or is unceremoniously tossed upon the ash heap of antiquity alongside other great civilizations that withered and perished from within. My generation will soon be gone from this earth. We will die comforted by the knowledge our fathers risked their lives preserving freedom around the globe and so that we could live in a world where character and truth matter, and in a country that symbolizes enduring hope and provides an unending haven for all who seek peace and friendship. This in contrast to those who choose to idolize and support a lying racist xenophobic, climate-change denying, twice-impeached narcissistic conman, convicted felon and tyrant, an unprincipled man who incited an armed attack on his own Capitol in an attempt to overturn an election he knew he’d lost. This former president has chosen for his running mate a self-described “never Trumper,” a man who once believed Trump “unhinged, toxic, cultural heroin,” and whose policies range from “immoral to absurd,” a man who once opined, “Trump could become America’s Hitler.” Donald Trump is unquestionably a threat to our national security, world peace and stability. Every clear-thinking, right-minded, sensible American voter must recognize Donald Trump and J.D. Vance plainly unfit to lead our nation. David L. Snell Franklin, N.C. David: The American Legion Magazine’s reticence on assigning responsibility for the demise of the border bill is disappointing but not surprising. That organization has always shied away from the truth when it might offend its more rabidly right wing members. The Editor –=≈=– The Truth Matters To the Editor: Donald Trump has always played fast and loose with the truth, but now at age 78 he would not know the truth if it slapped him in the face. He claimed that no one was killed during the Jan 6th assault on Congress, when one was shot dead and three died of medical conditions. He claimed that his rally on Jan. 6th, which had at most 25,000 people, was larger than the 200,000 at Martin Luther King’s march on Washington. He frequently claimed that Nicki Haley was in charge of security at the Capitol on Jan. 6th when she was not even in the government. She had been his ambassador to the United Nations, which has no authority over security for Congress. Trump is not just lying, he is hallucinating, like saying the thousands who showed up to see Vice President Harris did not exist and the crowds were generated by artificial intelligence. He claims democrats are responsible for rising violent crime, when violent crime has been lower than when Trump left office, every year, and has dropped every year. He gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a billionaire’s wife for donating to the Republican Party. He then said the Medal of Freedom was better than the Congressional Medal of Honor because most Medal of Honor recipients either died or were wounded, while this rich woman wrote checks without harming herself. For Trump, risking your life to defend your country makes you a sucker and a loser. Please consider his state of mind when casting your vote in November. Walter Hamilton Portsmouth N.H. Walter: Some people apparently find it hard to grasp the theory that there may be multiple universes. Perhaps it might help if they tried a thought experiment: Can you imagine Donald Trump and the truth both existing in the same universe? The Editor –=≈=– Why Cinde? To the Editor: While serving four years on the New Hampshire Executive Council, learning the governor’s role, Cinde Warmington became the best-qualified Democratic candidate. She got to know the inner workings of every aspect of our government—where the money comes from and how it gets spent. She developed a working relationship with every department and the commissioners. She learned about all the issues from every corner of our state and she developed strong working ties with the State Legislature. Looking forward, past the primary to the general election campaign, the Republican nominee will run on issues—crime, drugs and homelessness—that will make Joyce Craig vulnerable. Think, Manchester! In the case of a Republican running against Cinde Warmington, it is a different story. Reproductive rights, education and the environment will be the issues—and are winners for Democrats. Let’s occupy the corner office with Governor Cinde Warmington! Vote September 10th in the Primary. Vote November 5th in the General Election. Salme Perry Rollinsford, N.H. –=≈=– Let’s Not Elect a Madman Dear Editor: Donald Trump has stated many obscene and fantastical lies over his career including that Democratic states allow the killing of babies after they are born, but his recent claim before the Moms for Liberty last week might be his most unhinged lie ever. While discussing transgender issues Trump stated, “But uh, the transgender thing is an incredible thing… your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation the school decides what’s going to happen with your child and you many of these child’s [sic] 15 years later say “what the hell happened, who did this to me?” To suggest that somehow schools are performing surgical operations on children to change their gender is nothing short of lunacy and a complete break from reality. If there is anything to worry about when sending your child off to school, it is not that their gender will be changed. It would be that they may never come home because of some lunatic with an AR-15 decides to kill as many children as possible. Of course, Donald Trump cares little about those children but is deluded enough to think that Democrats kill babies and that schools are changing their gender. These insane comments by Trump demonstrate that he has lost touch with reality, and he should never be allowed to be put in a position of power in our government. His own words clearly reflect an individual who represents an existential threat to our nation and the world. Rich DiPentima Portsmouth, N.H. Rich: A surprising number of people seem ready to put more power than evolution ever prepared us for into the hands of a full-blown lunatic, but we are not among them. We’re with you. The Editor","summary":"Dear Editor: In May 2016, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stated: “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed… and we will deserve it.” At the time he was referring to the Republican Party.

The Hollywood couple spent months trailed by feverish speculation that their marriage was on the verge of collapse, culminating in Jennifer finally filing for divorce on their second wedding anniversary, August 20. On Friday night, Lopez could be seen flashing the flesh at the Toronto premiere of her new film Unstoppable, produced by Affleck and his best friend Matt Damon. Although Damon was on hand to pose in group shots with Lopez, Affleck notably skipped the star-studded event and remained at home in California. He was spotted hours before the premiere taking a phone in call in his car, grinning broadly during what appeared to be a lighthearted conversation.

She enjoyed a cheeky chat at the afterparty with her co-star Bobby Cannavale, whom she was heard telling: 'I'm a bad picker.' Loud music was playing and Cannavale seemingly did not catch what she was saying the first time, so she had to repeat the phrase twice. Once he finally cottoned onto her meaning, she started laughing and added: 'It is what it is,' in footage obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Lopez is in the midst of her fourth divorce, having previously been married to model Ojani Noa, backup dancer Criss Judd and pop star Marc Anthony. Meanwhile, Damon had a 'long, deep conversation' with Lopez at the premiere afterparty for Unstoppable, it is claimed. Damon and Lopez proudly posed together at the premiere earlier that evening during the Toronto International Film Festival. Affleck, 52, who co-produced the film with Damon, did not attend the star-studded event on Friday amid his ongoing divorce from Lopez. Now Damon - who has reportedly been a major source of support for Affleck during the collapse of his marriage - is said to have had a 20-minute tête-à-tête with Lopez. They were seen sharing a laugh at the afterparty, as well as having a more somber chat and even taking each other's hands, a source informed People.

The interaction began when Damon joined Lopez at her alfresco table, where she was seated with Damon's wife Luciana Barroso and her co-star Don Cheadle. At the premiere, held at Roy Thomson Hall, Damon and Lopez were seen proudly gathering together for a glamorous group shot. They happily mingled with Jharrel Jerome, Bobby Cannavale, and Don Cheadle — Lopez's co-stars in the film. Both Damon and Lopez — who sizzled in a revealing gown — seemed to be enjoying themselves, with Damon even flashing a smile in the group photo. Damon looked dapper in a grey suit with a black button-up shirt underneath. He completed the outfit with black shoes. The Massachusetts born star sported a salt-and-pepper scruff, adding a rugged charm to his appearance. Matt was also joined by his wife Luciana Barroso, 48, who looked sensational in a skintight plunging black gown. Her brunette tresses were pinned up in an elegant updo, with a few strands left to frame her face. Damon was pictured posing with his best friend's soon-to-be ex wife, Lopez, at the premiere of their film, Unstoppable, on Friday in Toronto, Canada The Talented Mr. Ripley star, 53, and the Love Don't Cost a Thing hitmaker, 55, were pictured in a group shot along with co-stars Bobby Cannavale, Jharrel Jerome, and Don Cheadle She accessorized with a black clutch and golden jewelry.

Barroso is also mom to Alexia, 26, from a previous relationship. Damon and Affleck have been friends for over 40 years. They grew up together in Boston, Massachusetts, and went to school together. They both broke into Hollywood through their work on the 1997 film Good Will Hunting. They wrote the screenplay together, with Damon also starring in the film, which was a critical and commercial success, earning them an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

She paired her silver, disco ball-inspired dress, from Tamara Ralph, with a pair of open-toed high heels and Hassanzadeh jewelry. The Hustlers actress wore her waist-length, light brown hair down in loose waves that cascaded down her back. Her appearance comes just two and a half weeks after she filed for divorce on her and Affleck's two-year wedding anniversary. Despite navigating the end of her fourth marriage, a source told DailyMail.com that the Let's Get Loud hitmaker was happy to 'head to the Toronto Film Festival to promote this film because Unstoppable means a lot to her, she wants to support it.' 'It is a true life story that is very inspirational and she is proud to be a part of it. Acting in the movie was a high point for her,' the insider added. 'The movie has been getting a lot of attention and Jennifer wants it to do the best it can. She is very professional and always works hard to give her movies their best opportunities.'

But those producers did not get their way as now only one of them will be there. The project is from Ben's production company Artists Equity, which he co-founded with Damon. Affleck and Damon are among the 14 producers on the film. The film will be shown in the Special Presentations section at the Toronto International Film Festival, followed by a limited theatrical release in December 2024, by Amazon MGM Studios.

A four-lane blacktop highway runs from southwest Virginia into Tennessee, where Interstate 40 leads to the Dixie Highway, which leads into the North Carolina mountains. Poverty is part of the culture in the southern Appalachians, but the people are a resourceful breed that believes in God and hard work. Appalachia has deep gospel roots from a time when it wasn’t uncommon for the faithful to speak in tongues. They love America and worry about what might become of her. Folks in the Appalachian region told The Epoch Times that affording groceries to feed their families is the top concern. Some worried about all the illegal immigrants coming into the country and the government funding foreign wars instead of taking care of problems at home. Others mentioned the need for affordable health care and abortion access. Several said they distrust Washington, where politicians promise one thing, then do another once elected. Many told The Epoch Times they were independents who will vote for former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), a self-described hillbilly who grew up in Appalachia. Several Democrats in the region, which is considered solid red, declined to be interviewed. Others said they like Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, because of their strong stance on abortion and health care and their promise to bring down the costs of housing. One man said he didn’t think Trump was a good person, so Harris won his vote. To outsiders, it might seem counterintuitive for poor, rural folks to support Trump, who is a billionaire. Conservatives who spoke to The Epoch Times said that if anyone could help America’s economy, it would be Trump because of his business experience and because he was so rich he couldn’t be bought. They said they didn’t know much about Vance, but they liked his roots in rural Kentucky and Ohio, which they can identify with. They see the hillbilly who wants to be vice president as someone who understands their lives. The message on the Speers Ferry Church marquee hints at what’s on many people’s mind in this neck of the woods: “Prices Go Up But Salvation is Still Free.” At the end of summer, lazy clouds cast shadows on the vast green mountains, and back roads named Goode Hollow and Kin Folks Drive lead into the hills. Chad Baker is 74 and lives in a small mobile home near the train tracks in Norton, Virginia, where folks still make moonshine whiskey. He worked 37 years—half his life—in strip mines in Virginia and Kentucky pulling coal out of the ground. He has black lung from years of breathing coal dust and lives on a fixed income from retirement. For the first time in his life, Baker intends to vote this November—for Trump and Vance. “I don’t get no education,” he said. “I don’t know if I passed the sixth grade.” “But I’m smart enough to know what they’ve done to this country,” he said of the current administration. Baker said some of his buddies feel the same way, so they made a pact not to cut their beards until Trump gets in office. His chief complaint is the price of groceries. He no longer buys hamburger meat at the store because it costs too much. He survives on sandwiches and meals at Kentucky Fried Chicken. “It’s got plumb out of hand,” he said of prices. He grew up hunting squirrels and deer. He and his friends would forage for wild ginseng in mountain hollers. Back then, going to school didn’t seem so important, he said. Good-paying jobs in the mines were there for the taking, allowing mountain men to earn a living with muscle and sweat. Baker said he feels that Trump can reverse America’s economic decline by restoring fossil fuel jobs and providing cheaper energy. “Now there’s no jobs. They’re all gone,” he said. “And you got to have a good education to even probably apply for some of those jobs, you know?” He said he doesn’t understand why President Joe Biden and Harris, who is running to replace her boss, want to stop producing fossil fuels. Baker said he figured that makes America poorer, while making other countries richer. Illegal immigrants entering the country are another problem for Baker because he doesn’t think some of them have the country’s best interests at heart. “I’ve got a bad feeling,” he said. “So many of them come from countries that hate America, but yet America has loved them.” The current administration owns the border crisis, he said. Shellie Fields and her husband, Paul, a veteran who rides a Harley-Davidson, sat around a camp fire and shared their thoughts about the presidential race. Fields, a 48-year-old Republican, considers herself a hillbilly, just like Vance. “I love JD Vance. He’s down to earth. He’s just like us,” she said. The people who criticize Trump’s running mate are jealous because he pulled himself out of poverty and found a way to go to an Ivy League school, she said. “He had to work for it,” Fields said. She said Vance came from the middle class and understands the problems of rural towns. Vance’s upbringing couldn’t have been more different than Trump’s, but folks living in southern Appalachia think the selection of Vance reflects a commitment to the working class. Fields said she doesn’t have much faith that Harris understands the middle class or that she deserves a promotion to president. But she thinks Harris’ selection of Walz as her running mate will help her because he was a football coach, which people feel is down to earth. She said “Bidenomics” has been a disaster, but she worries that women and black Americans will vote for Harris even if they don’t know what she stands for. Fields believes in putting the most capable person into the White House, regardless of race or sex. She said she will vote for Trump because he is strong on the border and will stand up to China, two of her key concerns with Harris. “I do not like how she’s not visiting the border,” Fields said of Harris. “The border’s got to get fixed.” Not everyone in Norton feels the same. Amanda Amaro, 47, is a transplant from North Carolina who raised her children in Virginia and describes herself as a “headbanging hillbilly.” Norton is definitely Trump country, she said while taking a smoke break from her restaurant job. But she doesn’t plan on voting for him. She won’t vote for Harris either. She said she believes Generation X and Baby Boomers are clinging to Trump because it makes them feel safer and that he says things they want to hear. Amaro said she thinks everything is staged in American politics, right down to the Trump assassination attempt. “I know that’s very cynical,” she said. “I used to have hope; trust me, I did when I was younger.” She distrusts the political system and Washington. Though it’s about a six-hour drive from Norton, the nation’s capital could be a million miles away. Amaro has struggled financially, finding it hard to land a job despite everybody saying there are plenty available. Like many others in town, she values family and hard work. She grew up believing in the American dream, but the older she got, the more it seemed to slip away. That same rugged individualism lives on in East Tennessee today. Rural Tennessee is blessed with ample rivers, lakes, and mountains, where folks like to hunt and fish and believe in the Second Amendment, said Terry Marek, chairman of the Sullivan County Democratic Party. “Individuals in this part of the country are very independent, so people really believe in self-determination and their ability to make their decisions,” he told The Epoch Times. For the first time in Kingsport, Tennessee, the Democrats will hold a rally on Sept. 7 to support their presidential nominee. “It’s very exciting. It could be anywhere from 25 to 200 people,” he said. Marek, who grew up in New Orleans, is a transplant to the region. He is under no illusions that Tennessee will turn blue this year. But he said he believes the excitement surrounding Harris could drive enough down-ballot votes to stop a Republican supermajority in the Tennessee House. “I find many individuals that contact us are afraid to put yard signs up,” Marek said. He said he hopes this election cycle will change that, paving the way for liberals in the region to “realize it’s OK to come out of the closet and vote Democrat.” Marek said people in east Tennessee and southwest Virginia are worried about health care, including access to abortion. Abortion has become a major issue for Democrats, driving many to vote in the midterm elections in 2022 and preventing a Republican red wave. Tennessee’s abortion ban, passed in 2022, is considered one of the strictest in the nation, allowing abortion only to save the mother’s life or prevent major injury. The state’s Republican-controlled Legislature allowed one company to control the region’s health care, resulting in closures to emergency rooms and clinics, Marek said. Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol make up the Tri-Cities area. They each have one hospital, but some facilities have closed, he said. A women’s health care clinic in east Tennessee that also performed abortions shut down and moved to Virginia due to the state’s abortion ban, he said. The economy is also a big issue for east Tennessee voters, he said, but there are plenty of jobs paying $10 to $18 per hour in the Kingsport area. Poverty is no stranger to the region. “Everybody feels the pinch of prices being higher,” Marek said. “But unemployment is really, really down in our neck of the woods, so we’re at or below 3 percent unemployment.” Tennessee saw an influx of new residents because property values were relatively low. Prices have gone up now on rentals and home purchases as more people moved into the area, he said. People hope Harris can cap the high price of rental housing through rent control, such as they have in New York City, he said. John Williams, 56, reckons he’s a hillbilly. “I was born in the woods and raised in a cave,” he joked while stopping at a local market in Kodak, Tennessee. He considers himself an independent voter, likely to break for Trump. He doesn’t know much about Vance but liked the idea of a hillbilly helping to run Washington. “I think they need to get a good old redneck in the office to run the place. I think it would help a lot,” he said. Williams said he liked Trump’s tough approach in standing up to China and North Korea. He values Trump’s business experience, too, believing it could help with inflation, his No. 1 issue. Williams said he’s in favor of getting rid of the Department of Education and giving the money directly to the states, an idea Trump campaigns on. Right now, schools in the area need more resources to help students get a better education, Williams said, especially children with disabilities. His wife has struggled to get her autistic child help in school, he said. “Any time you get rid of the middleman, it’s better,” he said. Like others, Williams said he believes elites run the country and look down their noses at mountain folk. In reality, the men and women of past generations were resourceful and broke their backs to build what the younger generation takes for granted, he said. Williams, who dropped out of high school, said he has worked in construction and as a handyman. He also learned to work on cars. When one job dried up, he'd learn a new skill to get by, he said. Pancotto, who works in maintenance at a local apartment complex, said he feels ignored by politicians. He favors the Trump–Vance ticket. Issues for him include the price of food, neglect of veterans, and the border crisis, which he believes unfairly benefits illegal immigrants at the expense of American citizens. For the first time ever, Pancotto planted a garden this year to help cut down on his grocery bill. He noted that English cucumbers are expensive at two for $4. “We’re not making more money, but we’re paying more out,” he said. He hopes that Vance might actually make a difference for people like him because Vance understands the region’s struggles and could better represent their interests. The road runs past lush, green farmland, weathered barns, abandoned gas stations, and wooden shacks flying American and Confederate flags. Hot Springs, with a population of 520 souls, is an old resort town that’s having a resurgence. For almost 200 years, people have come to bathe in the natural mineral springs. Transplants from all over the country have moved here, mixing with local southern culture. The combination gives the town a Bohemian feel. Hot Springs has a brewery, restaurants, quirky shops, and historic homes turned into lodgings. Hikers with backpacks stop at the town on their journey to access the nearby Appalachian Trail. Phillip Solomon, 53, moved from Los Angeles to this mountain town in 2016 after the presidential election, when he said he saw “things go a little sideways.” In 2019, he opened Artisun, a coffee shop and eclectic store filled with crystals, jewelry, artwork, pottery, and more. As he talked, a diverse clientele wandered into the store, where someone played the violin and an old piano, rehearsing for an event. Motorcycle riders came in wanting coffee. Solomon wanted a simpler life in the mountains. He holds diverse political views and values kindness, self-determination, and freedom of speech. “I think one of the greatest things about America is being in a country where you’re free to express yourself and live your life as you choose, have autonomy over your body, and make the choices for your body that you think are right for you,” he said. His wife and daughters support Harris because of her pro-abortion stance. His mother-in-law, who is from Florida, is a solid Trump supporter. Solomon is in the middle, weighing his choices. He isn’t necessarily pro-Harris or pro-Trump. He is trying to understand both sides. On the one hand, he plays in a punk rock band out of Atlanta, soon to release a song that could be offensive to those who like Harris, George Soros, and Anthony Fauci. On the other hand, he helped provide entertainment at the White House under former President Barack Obama. He doesn’t like the political polarization he’s seeing in the country, noting that Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention about the need to understand those with different opinions. “Even though there is someone who doesn’t agree with you about abortion, or guns, or taxation, or the border, or international relationships, we need to allow people to at least be able to express themselves,” Solomon said. “Unfortunately, the hope and change that we thought was coming [under Obama] really didn’t come,” he said. Solomon said free speech is critical to bringing people back together. He said he did not like how some people gloated when Trump was shot in an assassination attempt during a Pennsylvania rally. The economic concerns in Hot Springs mirror those of other southern Appalachian towns, such as the price of groceries and high housing costs. Illegal immigration, especially the arrival of military-aged men, worries some, too. “I think a lot of people around here are concerned about inflation,” Solomon said. Down the street, a rooster named Wayco serves as the greeter at a store called Tobacco Road. He has free run of the place, which is packed full of beer, wine, drinks, and snacks. Michael Walker, 42, is a transplant from Tampa, Florida, who moved to the area two years ago, following his high school sweetheart who wanted to trade the beaches for the mountains. When asked who he favored for president, Walker said, while holding Wayco, “I'd like for it to be Harris. I vote my emotions rather than any party affiliation.”","summary":"'I think they need to get a good old redneck in the office to run the place,' says one self-described hillbilly, as many others struggle to afford groceries.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/in-southern-appalachia-voters-favor-trump-but-harris-has-support-5718088","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/07/id5719905-Hillbilly-Politics-2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:00:50","author":"Darlene McCormick Sanchez","authors":["Darlene McCormick Sanchez"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":255885140,"title":"Hillary Clinton says Kamala Harris should 'bait' Trump during their upcoming debate: 'He can be rattled'","text":"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has some advice for Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee's upcoming debate with former President Donald Trump.Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, jousted with Trump during three high-stakes debates that year. She recently told The New York Times that Harris should use her background as a prosecutor to make a case against Trump.\"She just should not be baited. She should bait him,\" Clinton told the newspaper.Clinton argued that during a key moment in the final 2016 presidential debate, her needling of Trump on foreign affairs — where she called him a \"puppet\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin — threw him off balance.\"He can be rattled,\" Clinton told the Times. \"He doesn't know how to respond to substantive, direct attacks.\"\"And I think that from her prosecutorial background, I think that's what she will be equipped to do,\" Clinton added.Clinton, who in 2016 won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Trump after coming up short in pivotal battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, said the debate would be a prime opportunity for Harris to offer a contrast with the former president as they appeal to wavering voters.\"There still is enough potential movement in key states where people can be persuaded that they don't want to sign on for another four years of him,\" Clinton said.Trump in both 2016 and 2020 relentlessly sought to control the tone of his debates with Clinton and now-President Joe Biden, respectively.In the first televised debate of the 2020 election, Trump frequently spoke over Biden, so much so that Biden told Trump to \"shut up\" after several interruptions.Biden's onetime 2024 reelection bid was eventually derailed in large part by a poor debate performance against Trump in June. The next month, Biden stepped aside as the presumptive Democratic nominee and endorsed Harris as his successor, paving the way for her ascension as the party's new standard-bearer.Harris and Trump, who are locked in a highly competitive race, will face off on Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.","summary":"Hillary Clinton said Kamala Harris should lean into her background as a prosecutor to make a case against Trump during their upcoming debate.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-donald-trump-presidential-debate-2024-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/66dcbb445444ffafa763819c?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 20:56:52","author":"John L.

Trump, 42, was spotted wearing a sporty all-black athleisure outfit with matching shades and a ballcap on Friday. She enjoyed some fun in the sun while jet-skiing with one of her sons on a green and white watersport vehicle, while her husband was spotted shirtless and in bright green trunks. Kushner, 43, was also seen taking the two other children out on a jet-ski, while letting one of the little ones steer it as he calmly held onto the back. The couple was surrounded by private security and police during the outing. Despite it being an election year, Trump has largely skipped out on attending her father Donald Trump's presidential nominee events. Ivanka Trump enjoyed some fun in the sun while jet-skiing with one of her sons on a green and white watersport vehicle Her husband, Jared Kushner, was spotted shirtless and in bright green trunks She was spotted wearing a sporty all-black athleisure outfit with matching shades and a ballcap on Friday She made her first appearance at the RNC in Milwaukee last month, but has largely been absent from his campaign - a departure from her more active role while he was in-office. The family outing Friday came as New York judge delayed her father's sentencing in the Stormy Daniels case until after the November elections. The decision sets sentencing for November 26th, when Americans will already have voted and the results of the election should be known. It had been scheduled for September 18th, which would have fallen just two months before Election Day. Trump's team had asked for a delay, while prosecutors had left the matter up to the judge's discretion – something Merchan took as an indication prosecutors backed the move. The family outing Friday came as as New York judge delayed her father's sentencing in the Stormy Daniels case until after the November elections Kushner, 43, was also seen taking the two other children out on a jet-ski. He let one of the boy steer the boy while he calmly held onto the back of the jet-ski Security was seen keeping a close eye while the family was out on the jet-skis The judge, who Trump repeatedly attacked during his trial and again, had told the parties he will make his decision on timing Friday. Trump faces up to four years in prison, although experts predict the first-time offender might not get any jail time when sentencing finally comes. In a letter explaining his order, Judge Merchan spelled out the reason to delay as a measure to avoid 'any appearance - however unwarranted - that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.' He said adjourning 'should dispel any suggestion that the Court will have issued any decision...to give an advantage to, or to create a disadvantage for, any political party' or candidate. In good news for the Trump family, top pollster claims Kamala Harris' honeymoon period is 'officially over.' Frank Luntz, who specializes in interviews with undecided voters, pointed to the stat in an online post, in a race that is settling into a dead-heat. The couple was surrounded by private security and police during the outing Despite it being an election year, Trump has largely skipped out on attending her father Donald Trump 's presidential nominee events At one point, Kushner was seen helping the boys steer the jet-ski back to shore 'Quite a sharp drop in Democratic voter enthusiasm in this month’s YouGov poll. (It was 70% last month.) The honeymoon period is officially over,' Luntz declared in a post on X. He was referencing a non-partisan online poll that had Democratic enthusiasm peaking during the hype of the Democratic National Convention last month. That came after the stunning decision by President Joe Biden to step back, yielding to widespread polling that showed frustration with his candidacy and concerns about his age. It showed a steady increase in enthusiasm once Harris became the likely nominee. In the latest early September survey, Republicans have taken a slight lead on enthusiasm, with 60 percent saying they are 'very enthusiastic' or 'extremely enthusiastic.'

This time courtesy of co-host Joy Behar, who flustered Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro, with her trademark humor and cheeky misinterpretations. During Shapiro’s debut appearance on the daytime talk show, things got off to a bumpy start when Behar, known for her sharp wit, opened the conversation by teasing him about his popularity. She told Shapiro, “You’re super popular in Pennsylvania. My cousins live in Pennsylvania. They like you. Most of them.” When Shapiro asked, “Most?” Behar clarified, “Well, some of them are Trump supporters…but those are not blood, they’re in-laws.” As per Decider, the conversation took an unexpected turn when co-host Ana Navarro mentioned her recent work in Pennsylvania. She said, “I was just in Pennsylvania because we were doing something in Bethlehem with Puerto Ricans. I promised them you would come to see them. They love you too.” Shapiro, being polite, responded, “I’m sorry we didn’t hook up, that would have been fun. We had to come to New York to do that.” That’s when Behar’s dirty humor kicked in. Behar cheekily responded, “Excuse me? Hook up?” Navarro quickly added, “Don’t start rumors!” Amid the laughs, a visibly flustered Shapiro asked, “Was that on-air?” only for Behar to casually confirm, “Yeah, that was on-air.” After the hilarious exchange, Shapiro smoothly wrapped up his appearance by talking about politics, his support for Kamala Harris, and his love for both the Eagles and the Steelers. But Behar’s antics didn’t stop there. In another memorable moment from the show, Supreme Court Justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined the panel to promote her memoir, Lovely One. As per EW, during the interview, Behar questioned, \"So, Justice Jackson, I have to ask you this question, because public opinion of the Supreme Court has hit an all-time low. You might notice that in the media.\" Behar quickly apologized, when a smiling Whoopi Goldberg chimed in, \"Sometimes I just fall in love with the way you ask the question.\" Unfazed, Behar asked, \"Is it too blunt? Let me see if I can sugar-coat it— To what do you attribute this? And what can you do or any of you do to turn this around?\" Jackson remarked, \"We don't have any way of enforcing our opinions other than people's belief that the rule of law is important and that the court is safeguarding it. So, we have to rely in a lot of ways on public opinion. I try to write opinions that will allow the public to understand what's going on.\" Jackson added, \"I try very carefully in my opinions to stay in my lane as a judge, the understanding that the court is one of the three branches that we don't do policy decisions, that we are focused on law...I separate my personal views when I'm actually ruling...I do think it's our responsibility to reassure the public in our rulings, and those are the kinds of things that I try to do.”","summary":"Amid the laughs, a visibly flustered Shapiro asked, “Was that on-air?” only for Behar to casually confirm, “Yeah, that was on-air.”","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/joy-behars-hooking-up-comment-about-ana-navarro-catches-josh-shapiro-off-guard-on-the-view","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/714623/uploads/35f6e9e0-6cfb-11ef-ae48-93a058313b06_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 20:45:02","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.11},{"id":255884490,"title":"Why Black Athletes Need to Start Canceling Kamala-Bashing White Coaches","text":"Bruce Pearl, the head basketball coach at Auburn University, recently disparaged Vice President Kamala Harris by reposting a dishonest social media post claiming she is in favor of eliminating private health insurance. And it wasn’t the first time Pearl was on this type of time. His X/Twitter feed is replete with support for former President Donald Trump and opposition to all things “woke...” whatever he thinks that overused moniker means. The coach absolutely has a right to express himself however he chooses. However, why do so many Black athletes continue to allow white coaches to use Black talent to build generational wealth while disparaging Black leaders and opposing policies Black Americans support? Pearl is not alone. The list of white coaches who made millions off Black athletic talent while simultaneously opposing policies Black Americans back is long. There was Lou Holtz, former football coach at Notre Dame University, and Tommy Tuberville, former football coach at Auburn and now a U.S. senator from Alabama. Both are enthusiastic Trumpers. Strip their teams of every player who has a sister who looks like Harris, and they’d have no conference or national championships and none of the millions they believe their coaching brilliance alone “earned” them. Of the 18 young men listed on Auburn’s 2023-24 basketball roster, 14 are Black. I wonder how they feel about their 63-year old white coach — who makes $5.4 million per year — calling the nation’s first Black vice president a socialist and opposing policies aimed at combating discrimination and inequality. I also wonder how Pearl would fare coaching a team composed of fellow Trump supporters. I’m not sure if J.D. Vance can hoop, but I hear Barron Trump is 6-9. Black athletes are supposed to “shut up and dribble,” as television talk show host Laura Ingraham once ordered of LeBron James when he dared to discuss politics and racism. There is no matching admonition for white coaches or for white professional team owners. James knows what Pearl knows - that there is power in the platform they have because of their prominence. The day may soon be arriving when more Black, athletically gifted 17- and 18-year olds realize they have powerful platforms, too. White coaches badly want — no, desperately need — to recruit them so they can build winning teams and make money. That’s not a bad deal for young Black athletes, who can get a college scholarship along with name, image and likeness money and an opportunity to go pro someday. But a deal is an agreement between parties. Why should a Black basketball player agree to be coached by the likes of Pearl? There are other coaches out there, ones who haven’t repeatedly violated NCAA rules and who aren’t backing bigots. Here’s guessing Pearl would suddenly become very enamored with Harris and her policies if he knew trashing her would hurt him where it counts most — on the recruiting trail and, eventually, in his banking account.","summary":"Bruce Pearl, the head basketball coach at Auburn University, recently disparaged Vice President Kamala Harris by reposting a dishonest social media post claiming she is in favor of eliminating private health insurance.

Since President Joe Biden suspended his 2024 presidential campaign in July, Trump and his Republican allies have accused Vice President Kamala Harris and others at the White House of engaging in a cover-up to hide the state of Biden’s mental fitness. During a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, Trump said: “I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president of the United States — if you do that with a cover-up of the president of the United States, it’s grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office, ‘cause that’s what they did.” “You know, think of it — if he didn’t go to that debate, he’d still be running,” Trump added, referencing Biden’s poor performance at the CNN debate in June. CNN is reaching out to the Harris campaign for comment. The 25th Amendment has periodically been discussed as a means of last resort to remove a rogue or incapacitated president. This is a breaking story and will be updated.
