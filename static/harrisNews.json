The 2024 DNC is the official event where Democrats from all 50 states and the U.S. territories will come together from Aug. 19-22 to rally for Harris in her bid to be elected to the White House alongside vice presidential candidate Tim Walz. Nightly programming will be headquartered at Chicago’s United Center with other party activities set to take place at McCormick Place Convention Center, all of which are rolled out as a collaboration between the Democratic National Committee, the Chicago host committee, the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois. Per the DNC, 50,000 visitors are expected to descend upon Chicago, a figure that includes 5,000 delegates and alternates and 15,000 members of the media. Those visitors will have plenty of options for how and where to mix, mingle and commiserate about the state of U.S. politics at ancillary gatherings organized around official DNC activities. According to a third-party event directory posted online, there are well more than 100 events happening next week in Chicago with a roster of confirmed headliners that includes John Legend, Jon Stewart, Joan Jett, Octavia Spencer, DJ D-Nice, Lil Jon and stars of RuPaul’s Drag Race, among many others. Tongues have been wagging for weeks about which boldfaced names will be making the trek to the Midwest, even more so in the wake of July’s Republican National Convention that drew Amber Rose, Hulk Hogan, Jason Aldean, reality TV star Savannah Chrisley, Kid Rock, Dana White, Lee Greenwood and others. All eyes will be on the United Center stage to see how strategists deploy Hollywood elite to the main stage, particularly in an election year in which voters have repeatedly said that inflation, the economy and cost of living are the most pressing issues. Jon Stewart and his team from Comedy Central’s The Daily Show will post up from inside the Athenaeum Center for Thought & Culture for the entire convention’s run from Aug. 19-22. Stewart will broadcast a live show on Monday to kick start the week with the show’s roster of hosts and “all-star news team” filling in for the rest of the week. According to a site offering tickets, the closing night’s broadcast will run late (wrapping up after the close of the DNC around 11:45 p.m. local time) and is expected to be the most starry night of the convention. The Creative Coalition, led by Robin Bronk, has also confirmed details for a series of events being hosted by the nonprofit, nonpartisan social and public advocacy organization of the arts and entertainment community. Led by president Tim Daly and CEO Bronk, the org confirmed that it had booked a delegation that includes Uma Thurman, Uzo Aduba, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Anthony Anderson, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Busy Philipps, Jon Cryer, David Cross, Yolonda Ross, Iain Armitage, Chris Witaske and Danai Gurira. Per Thurman’s rep, she is no longer able to attend in person due to work commitments. Ralph is also working next week on the series that landed her an Emmy, Abbott Elementary, but her representative confirms that she will make the trip for Thursday to attend the convention’s closing night. Brown, who actively donates her time and activism to politics and many other industry causes, will be on the ground in Chicago “and booked solid for many events,” per her team. Also confirmed are Aduba, Ferguson, Philipps, Anderson, Gurira, Cryer and others. The Hollywood Reporter has learned that Connie Britton is likely to make the trip, and a source indicates that Don Cheadle may also be on the ground in Chicago. On Tuesday, Aug. 20, Creative Coalition will host a VIP welcome dinner at the Whitehall Hotel. The following morning will be an Empower Policy Luncheon hosted by the org and sponsored by Full Sail University at Palmer House Hotel. Described as a leadership luncheon, attendees are expected to be “C-suite and policy trailblazers from Fortune 500, entertainment, Silicon Valley and policy.” The following morning, the hotel will also host The Case for Kindness, a reception hosted by the Creative Coalition and sponsored by Articulus Entertainment that is a “salute to groundbreakers, trailblazers” and leaders from various sectors and special interest groups. Capping off the Creative Coalition’s big week will be a benefit gala concert at Chicago’s Ramova Theatre on Halsted Street on Wednesday, Aug. 21. Per The New York Times, which referred to the event as a “contender for biggest and best party of the week,” the concert will be co-hosted by Oscar winner Octavia Spencer and presented in partnership with Reproductive Freedom for All, End Citizens United and Gabrielle Giffords’ gun safety organization. Up on the marquee will be Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Drive-By Truckers and SistaStrings. The NYT reports that Gurira, Armitage, Aduba, Giffords and her Senator husband, Mark Kelly of Arizona, will be on the scene. Previous iterations of the gala concert have seen such acts as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sting, the Black Eyed Peas, Journey, Elvis Costello, the Goo Goo Dolls and Melissa Etheridge take the stage. Music is expected to be a big draw in the Windy City. Legend, who performed at the Lincoln Memorial after President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s inauguration in January 2021, is headlining a show at Salt Shed for billionaire Illinois governor JB Pritzker on Tuesday, Aug. 20. The night before, the Equality PAC will present a party featuring LGBTQ talent in Chicago’s iconic Boys Town that will feature RuPaul’s Drag Race stars Chad Michaels, Silky Nutmeg Ganache and Jackie Cox. Also on Monday, DJ D-Nice will hit the turntables at a celebration organized by members of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, and rapper Lil Jon will headline a Southern Soul party for Georgia’s State Democratic Party at PRYSM nightclub. Salt Shed will also host a special Pod Save America event on Thursday night. The political podcast is fronted by former President Barack Obama aides Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor. This story will be updated as more DNC details surface.","summary":"While the world waits to see if/when/how Taylor Swift or Beyoncé will weigh in on the historic campaign to elect Kamala Harris as president, details are surfacing on the celebrity contingent that has committed to traveling to Chicago next week for the Democratic National Convention.

At 78 years young, Trump took a humorous swipe at 'Bidenflation' by showcasing an unusually small container of TicTacs in Asheville on the past Wednesday evening. In a striking visual comparison, he presented two distinct sizes of TicTac boxes to illustrate inflation's impact on everyday shopping items. \"This is the greatest commercial they ever had,\" declared Trump, as he whipped out the TicTac box from his pocket. With a flourish, he showed off the diminutive pack and proclaimed: \"This is inflation.\" Even though POTUS Biden had withdrawn from the presidential contest over three weeks earlier, Trump, who famously used the same Tic Tac technique at an earlier rally in Minneapolis, didn't hesitate to take digs at him, reports the Mirror US. Turning the heat up, Trump tore into Democratic contender Kamala Harris with vitriolic criticism, claiming she was only in the fray because \"their fighter was losing.\" He didn't mince words saying: \"You know why she hasn't done an interview? She's not smart. She's not intelligent. And we've gone through enough of that with this guy, crooked Joe.\" To add further insult, he claimed: \"The American dream is dead. America isn't great.\" With the Democratic National Convention fast approaching next week, where VP candidate Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will be firmly in the spotlight, Trump couldn't resist unleashing a series of impromptu tirades against them. \"It's a fake ticket that never earned a single Democrat primary vote,\" he declared. \"It's a fake platform that offers no specifics about how to do the people's businesses and a fake promise to change the government, even though she's been in charge of that government for almost four years and hasn't done a damn thing,\" Trump vented at the rally. Trump claimed Harris \"copies.\" He claimed her economic policies \"will probably be a copy of my plan.\" The rally took place in Asheville, North Carolina, a Democratic city surrounded by staunchly Republican mountain counties. Trump assured North Carolinians of his plans to \"bring back manufacturing\" in the state and alleged that China and other Asian countries are being overly incentivised by the US. North Carolina, which gave Trump his narrowest statewide margin of victory four years ago, is predicted to be a battleground once again in 2024. Trump breezed through North Carolina's primary election this year, securing 74% of the vote against Nikki Haley's 23%. However, a more challenging race is expected against Harris in North Carolina come November.","summary":"Donald Trump pulled out a small pack of TicTacs at a rally in North Carolina as he mocked President Joe Biden, three weeks after the incumbent dropped out of the race","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/desperate-donald-trump-shakes-tic-33466879","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33466874.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_live_-president-trump-to-deliver-remarks-on-the-economy-in-asheville-nc-8_14_24-5-41-55-screenshot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 23:43:48","author":"Joseph Wilkes,Yelena Mandenberg","authors":["Joseph Wilkes","Yelena Mandenberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":254139684,"title":"Unveiling Kamala Harris’ secrets: An in-depth look at her silence on policies and plans even after a month of being the nominee, as revealed by SCOTT JENNINGS","text":"Elites in the Democratic party are truly shameless. They’d already committed an egregious affront to democracy by covering up President Joe Biden’s infirmity for months and then hand-picking his successor. It was even worse that Vice President Kamala Harris, their anointed nominee, had never won a single vote in a presidential primary contest. And it’s an ongoing insult that Harris has yet to submit to a single interview or news conference in the 24 days that she’s been her party’s new standard-bearer. But it’s the latest news from Harris world that is truly too much to stomach. Campaign insiders are now suggesting to the media that she wants to ‘break’ from Biden’s failed stewardship of the US economy. You know, the same economy she’s helped to run the past four years. In a ‘policy’ speech this week, they claim she’ll roll out her scheme for lowering costs, taming inflation and restoring the American dream. Well, don’t hold your breath. Even the New York Times isn’t fooled. ‘[Harris] will lay out an approach relatively light on details… it will rarely break from Mr. Biden on substance,’ the Times reported Wednesday. How exciting! It’s now abundantly clear that the Harris 2024 campaign strategy is to treat the American people as if they’re mushrooms… keep them in the dark and feed them crap. Almost 80 days out from the election (and only a month from the start of early voting in some states), Harris is yet to reveal an iota of what she actually wants to do as president. And the sad reality is that this cynical plan of silence just might work – especially if Donald Trump continues his current unfocused approach to his campaign. Every sensible Republican recognizes that Trump’s been off track since his speech at the Republican National Convention in July, when he delivered the longest convention address in history – rambling between a teleprompter script and off-the-cuff remarks. The former president’s meandering has only increased since Harris became the Democratic nominee. Trump has been too busy lobbing counterproductive comments about Harris’s race, instead of successfully framing the narrative against her litany of past policy failures, as he so expertly did with Biden. If the polls are any indication, Trump’s current tactics are not working. He has gone from a lead to a deficit in many major swing state polls – and Harris has even surged to an advantage on the question of who is more ‘trusted’ to handle the U.S. economy. To most Republicans, the most effective attack line against her is obvious: It’s common sense versus radical nonsense. In 2020, Harris was rated the second ‘most politically left’ senator in the 116th Congress by the non-partisan government transparency group Gov Track. The only senator rated as more radically liberal than Harris was the proud democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. When Harris unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic party nomination in 2020, as a proud progressive, she advocated for banning fracking, decriminalizing illegal border crossing, eliminating the private healthcare system and defunding the police. Now, unnamed spokespeople for her campaign claim she no longer supports any of that. As vice president, Harris was tasked with easing the global factors driving an unprecedented number of migrants to the U.S. border. The result was the worst illegal immigration crisis in American history – and an estimated 10 million border crossings since Biden was inaugurated. In her role as Vice President and loyal Biden lieutenant, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate in February 2021 to pass the nearly $2 trillion COVID stimulus bill that sent inflation soaring. Since then, prices have been a runaway freight train of misery for the American people. If Harris’s record proves anything it is that she’s a rank political opportunist. When Trump proposed eliminating federal taxes on tips for service industry workers, Harris said she’d do the same despite backing a bill that allowed the IRS to crack down on those very same workers. Harris’s position on the Israel-Hamas war is just as murky. As the newly named Democratic party nominee, she snubbed the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by refusing to preside over his address to a joint session of Congress in July. Officially, she hasn’t broken with the Biden administration’s policy of providing arms to Israel in support of their war against terror. And yet, she did recently meet with Hamas-friendly protestors and, according to the activists present, said she was open to imposing an arms embargo on the Jewish state. Her spokesperson denied it, but with no public questioning of Harris, how can we know the truth? So far, the Vice President hasn’t explained her ‘evolution’ from one of the most progressive senators in America in 2020 to a determined moderate in 2024. She intends to run a sheltered, sanitized campaign, built on vague platitudes and little scrutiny. And the only thing so far standing between Harris’s duplicitous strategy and the White House is an ABC News debate on September 10. Trump must be as focused for these 90 minutes as he’s ever been in his life. His entire campaign is riding on it. Trump must expose Harris for the radical progressive that she really is. If he falters, there won’t be much time to correct the trajectory of the race before votes are cast.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElites in the Democratic party are truly shameless.

In remarks to about 50 people at a West Loop fundraiser, Emhoff condemned antisemitism, while U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., stressed the importance of maintaining strong ties with Israel. The fundraiser was in the home of Lee Rosenberg, a senior adviser to Gov. JB Pritzker, the first of three stops on Emhoff’s trip to help raise money for his wife’s presidential campaign. Emhoff began by telling the crowd how excited he was for Harris to officially accept her party’s presidential nomination next week. Delegates already nominated Harris in an online roll call last week. “She’s a great leader, and she’s going to be a great president,” Emhoff said. Emhoff, who is Jewish, praised Harris for her work since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists. “The Kamala Harris I knew when I met her, I didn’t have to explain to her who I was,” Emhoff said. “She knew who I was, who I was as a Jewish person. “Since that horrific day of Oct. 7 … I saw first-hand from my vantage point, the work that she and President Biden did right away. It was really comforting to me … to see her spring into action that way.” Emhoff spoke about how unfortunate it was for the Biden and Harris administration to inherit the issues they did from Donald Trump’s administration and assured attendees that Harris would continue to combat antisemitism. “When they got to office, post-Trump, there’s so many things that Biden and Harris inherited. ... One of those things was hate,” he said. “You could see it, you could feel it. ... You could feel the antisemitism brewing,” Emhoff added, citing the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead and six wounded. Sen. Cardin said the United States needs “an administration that recognizes America’s global responsibilities and can form the type of alliances for our national security, and that’s the Harris/Walz ticket.” Harris “understands the importance of that relationship” with Israel, Cardin added. “On Oct. 7, I saw what the Biden and Harris administration did ... and made it clear that Israel has a responsibility to defend itself and the United States will always be there for Israel.” Emhoff outlined the consequences of another Trump presidency, saying that Donald Trump was “unfit for office.” “He cannot be anywhere near the White House,” Emhoff said. “There should be no nostalgia for that presidency. He’s weak and Kamala Harris smells weakness. She can see a fake tough guy from a mile away.” Emhoff made a second fundraising stop in Chicago on Wednesday before heading to north suburban Glencoe.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2024/08/14/dnc-chicago-kamala-harris-campaign-doug-emhoff-fundraiser-antisemitism-israel","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ac6549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5127x2927+0+246/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd1%2Fd9%2F36895af277bff087ce3471930eab%2Fap22","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 23:36:27","author":"Cindy Hernandez","authors":["Cindy Hernandez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":254139166,"title":"Trump ramps up rallies as Harris leads in several battleground states","text":"Trump ramps up rallies as Harris leads in several battleground states Former President Donald Trump discussed the economy at a rally in North Carolina Wednesday but didn't provide many specifics on his policy proposals.

The state’s top court ruled that the phrase, which describes what fetuses become after they have developed in a mother’s womb, “substantially complies” with the impartiality requirement under Arizona law. A full decision is said to be on the way, according to the brief order from the seven-member bench. Chief Justice Ann Scott Timmer and Justice James Beene dissented. Arizona for Abortion Access, the campaign that is backing the ballot initiative, sued to change the language in information pamphlets to merely say “fetus,” arguing the term was more impartial. “We are deeply disappointed in this ruling, but will not be deterred from doing everything in our power to communicate to voters the truth of the Arizona Abortion Access Act,” the group wrote in a statement, calling on residents to vote “YES” on the measure during the November general election. Abortions in Arizona are currently subject to a 15-week ban due to a law passed by Republican lawmakers in 2022 following the Supreme Court decision that allowed states to create gestational limits on such procedures, overturning nearly five decades of precedent under Roe v. Wade. The law provides exceptions for the life of the mother but not for rape or incest. The ballot measure, if approved, would amend the state constitution to allow abortions up to around 23 or 24 weeks after conception and would restrict the state from adopting or enforcing any law that would prohibit access to the procedure. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has made reproductive rights a central point of her campaign, and a recent HighGround Public Affairs survey shows her about 3 percentage points ahead of former President Donald Trump, with Harris receiving 44.4% of the support and Trump receiving 41.6%.","summary":"The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that fetuses can be described as an &#8220;unborn human being&#8221; in pamphlets informing voters before they decide whether to add a right to an abortion to the state&#8217;s constitution.

In it Trump blamed “the complexity of modern day equipment” for making his voice sound “somewhat different and strange” during a live interview on X with Elon Musk. But while the Harris campaign shared what looked like a screenshot of the post, they cut off the last line, where Trump explained that he released “an actual, and perfect, recording of the conversation.” Exactly why the original broadcast sounded so odd is not totally clear — the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about what led to the sound quality issues and what tech they used to fix it. But the Harris campaign’s post left out key context that Trump had released a cleaner version of the recording, making the post look purely like an excuse. “Trump blames his confused, slur-filled disaster of an interview with Elon Musk on ‘the complexity of modern day equipment,’” the KamalaHQ account wrote alongside the truncated post on Threads.

On Tuesday, Axios reported that the campaign has bought several ads linking to news stories from outlets like The Associated Press, CNN, and USA Today that show up at the top of Google search results pages. While these sponsored links send users to real news articles, the headline and text of the ads are written by the campaign, though it’s presented by Google in a way that appears like the outlet itself wrote it. Google allows for this and the Harris campaign is certainly not the first to use this tactic. But Facebook actually got rid of a similar feature in 2017 after The Wall Street Journal flagged examples of advertisers changing news site headlines in promoted content. Google’s ad library shows the Trump campaign has not run ads on Google Search. The headlines are far more glowing than would appear on most news sites. “VP Harris Protects Democracy - Trump Defends Jan 6 Comments,” reads one Harris-sponsored headline linking to The Independent. It’s not clear which specific article it linked to, but The Independent wasn’t happy. A spokesperson said it would seek for the ads to be removed and that it’s “entirely wrong for anyone to put fake headlines under The Independent brand. We object fiercely and believe it is undermining of what politics and journalism should be about.” Trump, of course, has made far grander, more numerous, and more deceptive statements over the course of his campaign. Just recently, he falsely said Harris “A.I.’d” a crowd of thousands that showed up to see her at a rally in Michigan. He also created a false narrative that Harris “happened to turn Black” as she aspired to higher office. Harris attended the historically black college Howard University, and her father is Jamaican-American. The Harris campaign has generally favored the informal language and style of modern social media — quickly adopting the “brat” aesthetic in a nod to Charli XCX’s popular album, for example. It’s raising a new set of questions about how to fairly present information and how viewers process internet content. Is an incomplete quote in what looks like a social media screenshot different from a carefully cropped soundbite in an attack ad? For Harris’ campaign, the answer seems to be no. The Harris campaign declined to comment.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220601/harris-campaign-trump-truth-social-elon-musk-interview-audio","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VEM0h8JH5xvAbDsaRb0XT_SJO8=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25545958/STK466_STK205_STK175_ELECTION_2024_TRUMP_HARRIS_CVIRGINIA_C.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 23:25:34","author":"Lauren Feiner","authors":["Lauren Feiner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":254138818,"title":"The only change Kamala Harris offers on Bidenomics is the label","text":"Kamala Harris is “hoping to distance herself from President Biden’s unpopularity on the economy,” her stenographers at Axios report. Get set for some epic gaslighting, as Harris tries to escape the blame not just for policies she backed these last 3½ years, but core Democratic stances. In her stump speech, she keeps vowing to bring down grocery bills on Day 1 in the Oval Office — and inflation, too. But if it were that easy, why not just tell her current partner in crime, the sitting president, how to do it? The fact is, the Federal Reserve has carried the weight on slowing inflation, by slamming interest rates through the roof . . . and thereby killing job growth and slowing the economy to near-recession levels. The Biden-Harris contribution has been exclusively on the goosing-inflation end, by putting Uncle Sam on a long-term track of spending $2 trillion more a year than he takes in. Remember: The economy started roaring back from the COVID shutdowns in the last quarter of 2020. Then Biden-Harris sought to grab credit for the rebound by ramming through their American Recovery Act, which dumped billions in new spending on an already-hot economy — and so triggered the record-breaking rise in prices, hitting 9% before the Fed began its clampdown. And while Harris has disowned some of her most extreme past positions, she hasn’t said a word about slowing spending. She certainly won’t let go of any of the green pork at the heart of the big-spending “Inflation Reduction Act.” And while she says she no longer wants to end all fracking, she won’t reverse the Biden era war on fossil fuels generally — the freezes on new drilling permits, the regular “no”s to new pipelines, the ever-tighter emissions standards for everything from power plants to factories to cars. On inflation, all Harris can offer is nickel-and-dime household savings the same as Biden-Harris have been gaslighting voters about for the last two years: Basically pretending it’s all about “shrinkflation,” hidden “junk fees” and other corporate skullduggery. She says strengthening the middle class will be a central goal of her presidency, but so did Joe. What, big picture, will she do differently? Harris has nothing, because the entire Democratic Party has nothing. The Trump-Vance ticket offers a pretty clear path to the prosperity the nation saw in Donald Trump’s first term, until COVID hit. Above all, as Trump noted Wednesday in North Carolina, free up America’s energy producers. We were energy-independent when he left office, with exports booming. Biden, enforcing his party’s core agenda, turned the curve down. Cheap energy is by far the best way to boost American manufacturing and the economy generally; it was a huge reason working-class wages rose rapidly under Trump, for the first time in decades. Other parts of Trumponomics helped: a major war on destructive federal regulations (also reversed once Democrats took over), tax relief (which Harris will end on her watch); pushing agencies across the board to prioritize growth over special interests. Harris has copied one single Trump proposal: no tax on tips. Good: Now Democrats can’t block it (even though their “Inflation Reduction Act” included a major IRS crackdown on reporting tips). But even if Harris wanted to copy the Trump policies that offer major hope for a booming, low-inflation US economy, her own party wouldn’t let her. Kamala Harris, even if she completely breaks with her Hollywood Democrat past, is literally just a replacement Dem — a (slightly) fresher face on a disastrous agenda. Any “distance” she offers from Bidenomics is just a new label on the same old, same old.","summary":"Kamala Harris is \"hoping to distance herself from President Biden's unpopularity on the economy,\" her stenographers at Axios report.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/opinion/the-only-change-kamala-harris-offers-on-bidenomics-is-the-label/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/KAM1212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 23:21:13","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.17},{"id":254139642,"title":"French military jets collide in mid-air, two dead","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Dominic Cardy officially launches new federal political party Independent New Brunswick MLA Dominic Cardy officially launched a new centrist federal political party, aiming to win the support of disillusioned Liberal and Conservative voters.

The tech company’s threat intelligence arm said the group is still actively targeting people associated with Biden, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate last month when he dropped out. It said those targeted have included current and former government officials, as well as presidential campaign affiliates. The new report from Google’s Threat Analysis Group affirms and expands on a Microsoft report released Friday that revealed suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in this year’s U.S. presidential election. It sheds light on how foreign adversaries are ramping up their efforts to disrupt the election that is now less than three months away. Google’s report said its threat researchers detected and disrupted a “small but steady cadence” of the Iranian attackers using email credential phishing, a type of cyberattack where the attacker poses as a trusted sender to try to get an email recipient to share their login details. John Hultquist, chief analyst for the company’s threat intelligence arm, said the company sends suspected targets of these attacks a Gmail popup that warns them that a government-backed attacker might be trying to steal their password. The report said Google observed the group gaining access to one high-profile political consultant’s personal Gmail account. Google reported the incident to the FBI in July. Microsoft’s Friday report had shared similar information, noting that the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign had been compromised and weaponized to send a phishing email to a high-ranking campaign official. The group is familiar to Google’s threat intelligence arm and other researchers, and this isn’t the first time it has tried to interfere in U.S. elections, Hultquist said. The report noted that the same Iranian group targeted both the Biden and Trump campaigns with phishing attacks during the 2020 cycle, as early as June of that year. The group also has been prolific in other cyber espionage activity, particularly in the Middle East, the report said. In recent months, as the Israel-Hamas War has aggravated tensions in the region, that activity has included email phishing campaigns targeted at Israeli diplomats, academics, non-governmental organizations and military affiliates. Trump’s campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame. The same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, though it wasn’t clear whether the leaked documents were related to the suspected Iranian cyber activity. The Washington Post and The New York Times also received the documents. While the Trump campaign hasn’t provided specific evidence linking Iran to the hack, both Trump and his longtime friend and former adviser Roger Stone have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions. Stone’s email was compromised by hackers targeting Trump’s campaign, a person familiar with the matter said. Google and Microsoft wouldn’t identify the people targeted in the Iranian intrusion attempts or confirm that Stone was among them. Google did confirm that the Iranian group in its report, which it calls APT42, is the same as the one in Microsoft’s research. Microsoft refers to the group as Mint Sandstorm. Harris’ campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, but has said it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and isn’t aware of any security breaches of its systems. The FBI on Monday confirmed that it’s investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign. The reports of Iranian hacking come as U.S. intelligence officials have warned of persistent and mounting efforts from both Russia and Iran to influence the U.S. election through their online activity. Beyond these hacking incidents, groups linked to the countries have used fake news websites and social media accounts to churn out content that appears intended to sway voters’ opinions. While neither Microsoft nor Google specified Iran’s intentions in the U.S. presidential race, U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran’s efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. Iran’s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. “We do not accord any credence to such reports,” the mission told The Associated Press. “The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.” The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Google’s report. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

The current president is barely seen. Last week, Joe Biden took a five-day weekend at his Delaware beach house (again) while Iran threatened to attack Israel, just days after the Dow fell more than 1,000 points in the wake of a lousy jobs report. On Wednesday, his entire public schedule consisted of a 15-minute drop-by at a White House economic conference and a 4 p.m. meeting to receive his daily intelligence briefing. Yes, 4 p.m. We have a deteriorating president who is in the political version of the witness protection program, save for rare exceptions. He should have resigned from office weeks ago, the minute he announced he wasn’t running again. Because answer this: How can this man be president for the next five months when he’s tacitly admitted he can’t be president for the subsequent four years? In August thus far, Biden has held exactly one public event outside of the White House, when he flew to New Orleans on Tuesday to a cancer center to talk about his “moonshot” initiative. Otherwise, for the first half of this month, he’s spent eight days lounging at the beach. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris for the last three weeks has stuck to performing the same stump speech at swing-state campaign rallies while avoiding any questions of substance. All Americans, regardless of political ideology, deserve so much better than this. But there’s a very good reason why Biden hasn’t resigned: Because unnamed powers in the Democratic Party don’t want Harris to be put in a position of responsibility for this administration’s disastrous record on the economy, inflation, wages, crime, the border and a world seemingly on fire. If we were talking about President Harris, she would have no choice but to own this train wreck and defend it, having played a big role in creating it as Biden’s partner. “As you have seen them in the past 3½ years, they’ve been partners, critical partners,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday. “It doesn’t matter if it is domestic issues, also foreign policy issues,” she insisted. “And that has been the case from Day 1 and continues to be the case.” President Harris couldn’t get away with doing nothing but speeches in places like Michigan and Wisconsin. President Harris would have to actually govern and make decisions — and be held accountable through these foreign concepts known as press conferences and interviews. It’s also noteworthy that Biden hasn’t campaigned with Harris in any capacity. There’s good reason for that: His own vice president is running away from him — not only from him personally, but from his toxic policies. And why wouldn’t she distance herself from debacles like, say, Bidenomics as much as possible? Especially when our corrupt media isn’t doing their basic homework to compare the rhetoric of Vice President Harris and Candidate Harris? Veep Harris, August 2023: “We are very proud of Bidenomics.” Candidate Harris, August 2024: “Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year.” Get it? The candidate who has been in power for 3½ years — and who has repeatedly praised the performance of this horrible economy during that time — now has a plan to lower costs. But only if she becomes president. You can’t make this up. Across almost every issue, mostly through unnamed campaign aides, Kamala is running away from her own past policy positions and rhetoric, because those positions are profoundly unpopular with any common-sense voter. Banning fracking and fossil fuels won’t sit well in Pennsylvania, for example. Mandating electric cars won’t fly in Michigan. Abolishing ICE, supporting sanctuary cities, offering free healthcare to illegals and raising taxes — all positions Harris has taken loudly and proudly — would be political suicide if she were to double down on them today. And that’s why Biden remains in power, in name at least. Because by doing so, Kamala the Chameleon can traipse off on her own version of the Eras Tour, as a fawning media cheers all her talk about the big changes she’ll make on Day 1. Despite, you know . . . having had all these years to fix the crises she and her boss created.

Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices rose just 0.2% from June to July after dropping slightly the previous month. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 2.9%, down from 3% in June. It was the mildest gain since March 2021. The ongoing inflation slowdown could affect the presidential campaign, given that former President Donald Trump has highlighted rampant inflation as a key failing of the Biden administration and its energy policies. Vice President Kamala Harris has said she would soon unveil new proposals to “bring down costs and also strengthen the economy overall.” The government said nearly all of July’s inflation reflected higher rental prices and other housing costs, a trend that, according to real-time data, is easing. As a result, housing costs should rise more slowly in the coming months, contributing to lower inflation. The report showed that inflation is steadily falling closer to the Fed’s 2% target — though not too quickly, which might suggest that the economy is weakening, said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and a former Treasury Department official. “It’s a comforting report, both because it is going in the right direction and because it is not doing anything too dramatic,” Sinclair said. “It is exactly what we wanted to see.” In July, grocery prices rose just 0.1% and are a scant 1.1% higher than they were a year earlier, a much slower pace of growth than in previous years. Yet many Americans are still struggling with food prices, which remain 21% above where they were three years ago. Gas prices were unchanged from June to July and have actually fallen 2.2% in the past year. Clothing prices also dropped last month; they’re nearly unchanged from 12 months earlier. New and used car prices fell in July, too. Used car prices, which had skyrocketed during the pandemic, have tumbled nearly 11% in the past year. Some food prices, including for meat, fish and eggs, are still increasing faster than before the pandemic. Dairy and fruit and vegetable prices, though, fell in July. Even as inflation — the rate of price increases — keeps slowing, many people are still struggling with daily costs that, on average, are still about 20% higher than they were three years ago. That’s true even though average U.S. wages have surpassed inflation for more than a year. Ariel Borchuk, who lives in the Harlem area of New York City, complained that the government’s inflation reports don’t mean anything to “regular people” like himself. “Everything,” he said, “is expensive. What more do you need to know?” Borchuk, 48, who works in the catering business, had just grabbed a hot fried chicken sandwich for $7.99 at a grocery store on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It’s something he says he really can’t afford. Borchuk said he’s been cooking more at home and eating out less and buying more of his groceries at Costco, where he said he can get good deals. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve’s Chicago branch, said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press that the July data shows that inflation is clearly on track to return to the central bank’s 2% target. He also noted that there are signs that the job market is weakening even while the Fed’s key rate remains at its highest level in decades. Goolsbee’s remarks suggested that he would support a series of rate cuts in the coming months. At a White House event Wednesday, President Joe Biden was asked whether the nation had defeated inflation. “Yes, yes, yes,” he said. “I’ve told you we’re going to have a soft landing,” he added, referring to an economy in which inflation is tamed without a steep recession. For nearly a year, cooling inflation has provided gradual relief to America’s consumers, who were stung by the price surges that erupted three years ago. Inflation peaked two years ago at 9.1%, the highest level in four decades. In July, excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices climbed a mild 0.2% from June, after a 0.1% increase the previous month. And compared with a year earlier, core inflation slowed from 3.3% to 3.2% — the lowest level since April 2021. Core prices are closely watched by economists because they typically provide a better read of where inflation is headed. When the central bank lowers its benchmark rate, over time it tends to reduce the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. Mortgage rates have already declined in anticipation of the Fed’s first rate reduction. Many companies have slowed their price increases as consumers have become more resistant to paying more. Mark Barrocas, CEO of SharkNinja, a small appliance-maker in Needham, Massachusetts, said the company raised its prices 5% to 7% in 2021 and 2022 but hasn’t done so since. For some items, it recently reduced prices to where they were before the earlier hikes took effect. Inflation has eased substantially in the past two years as global supply chains have been repaired, a spate of apartment construction in many large cities has cooled rental costs and higher interest rates have slowed auto sales, forcing dealers to offer better deals to potential car buyers. Consumers, particularly lower-income ones, are also becoming more price-sensitive, forgoing high-priced items or shifting to cheaper alternatives.

The tech company’s threat intelligence arm said the group is still actively targeting people associated with Biden, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate last month when he dropped out. It said those targeted have included current and former government officials, as well as presidential campaign affiliates. The new report from Google’s Threat Analysis Group affirms and expands on a Microsoft report released Friday that revealed suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in this year’s U.S. presidential election. It sheds light on how foreign adversaries are ramping up their efforts to disrupt the election that is now less than three months away. Google’s report said its threat researchers detected and disrupted a “small but steady cadence” of the Iranian attackers using email credential phishing, a type of cyberattack where the attacker poses as a trusted sender to try to get an email recipient to share their login details. John Hultquist, chief analyst for the company’s threat intelligence arm, said the company sends suspected targets of these attacks a Gmail popup that warns them that a government-backed attacker might be trying to steal their password. The report said Google observed the group gaining access to one high-profile political consultant’s personal Gmail account. Google reported the incident to the FBI in July. Microsoft’s Friday report had shared similar information, noting that the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign had been compromised and weaponized to send a phishing email to a high-ranking campaign official. The group is familiar to Google’s threat intelligence arm and other researchers, and this isn’t the first time it has tried to interfere in U.S. elections, Hultquist said. The report noted that the same Iranian group targeted both the Biden and Trump campaigns with phishing attacks during the 2020 cycle, as early as June of that year. The group also has been prolific in other cyber espionage activity, particularly in the Middle East, the report said. In recent months, as the Israel-Hamas War has aggravated tensions in the region, that activity has included email phishing campaigns targeted at Israeli diplomats, academics, non-governmental organizations and military affiliates. Trump’s campaign said Saturday that it had been hacked and that sensitive internal documents were stolen and distributed. It declared that Iranian actors were to blame. The same day, Politico revealed it had received leaked internal Trump campaign documents by email, though it wasn’t clear whether the leaked documents were related to the suspected Iranian cyber activity. The Washington Post and The New York Times also received the documents. While the Trump campaign hasn’t provided specific evidence linking Iran to the hack, both Trump and his longtime friend and former adviser Roger Stone have said they were contacted by Microsoft related to suspected cyber intrusions. Stone’s email was compromised by hackers targeting Trump’s campaign, a person familiar with the matter said. Google and Microsoft wouldn’t identify the people targeted in the Iranian intrusion attempts or confirm that Stone was among them. Google did confirm that the Iranian group in its report, which it calls APT42, is the same as the one in Microsoft’s research. Microsoft refers to the group as Mint Sandstorm. Harris’ campaign has declined to say whether it has identified any state-based intrusion attempts, but has said it vigilantly monitors cyber threats and isn’t aware of any security breaches of its systems. The FBI on Monday confirmed that it’s investigating the intrusion of the Trump campaign. Two people familiar with the matter said the FBI also is investigating attempts to gain access to the Biden-Harris campaign. The reports of Iranian hacking come as U.S. intelligence officials have warned of persistent and mounting efforts from both Russia and Iran to influence the U.S. election through their online activity. Beyond these hacking incidents, groups linked to the countries have used fake news websites and social media accounts to churn out content that appears intended to sway voters’ opinions. While neither Microsoft nor Google specified Iran’s intentions in the U.S. presidential race, U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran’s efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. Iran’s mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. “We do not accord any credence to such reports,” the mission told The Associated Press. “The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.” The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Google’s report. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Weissenstein contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

The Republican nominee for president has called to meet the press on Thursday at his Bedminster club in New Jersey, hoping to avoid a slew of negative headlines that followed last week’s, where he repeated previous lies and offered nothing new. The announcment comes as he was in North Carolina attempting to head off what appears to be a Kamala Harris surge that has put a number of red-leaning swing states back into sudden contention. Trump, now almost one month out from the GOP convention, once planned to storm through the rest of the summer pummeling ex-opponent Joe Biden all the way, riding on a wave of support buoyed by a shocking assassination attempt and the four-day Trumpfest that was the GOP convention in July. Instead, he enters mid-August facing a massively shaken-up campaign. Biden is no longer his opponent, having dropped out and endorsed his vice president, while Harris has roundly consolidated the Democratic field and is heading into her own party’s convention with a Democratic Party more unified than it has been at any time through the past two presidential election cycles. Her selection of Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate has only furthered to fuel her momentum as the affable midwestern politician has fallen into the role of attacking Harris’s opponents, Trump and running mate JD Vance, with ease. Now, as Trump plots his second attempt to regain a positive national spotlight (or at least transfer some negative attention to Harris). The ex-president rallied on Wednesday in North Carolina, a state where he won in the past two elections but now sees Harris gaining and cutting his polling lead down to single digits. He also clearly had hoped to recapture some momentum with a flashy interview advertised on Twitter/X with the site’s Trump-endorsing CEO, Elon Musk — but technical difficulties and a lack of focus in the interview led to the appearance being widely panned. Trumpworld sources were radio silent on Wednesday as the Bedminster presser loomed ahead. Reports from Trump insiders have indicated for days now that the ex-president is privately panicking over the sudden plunge in his polling, or what could more accurately be described as Harris rocketing back into competition. On CNN on Tuesday, Mar-a-Lago whisperer Maggie Haberman of the New York Times reported that the reality of running against a Black woman has stymied Trump, who has found himself unable to find an attack that lands effectively. “She is a woman, and she is a Black woman. And both of those factors have proven very challenging for him in the past,” Haberman opined. “He has seemed to really struggle with women opponents, women critics, and particularly Black women who are critics.” On Wednesday, Trump’s problems with women voters appeared on the verge of growing even worse. New audio from 2020 obtained by Heartland Signal, a left-leaning news outlet, depicted Vance telling a radio host that the only purpose of women after hitting menopausal age was to provide support for child-rearing. The ex-president is likely to face questions about this latest audio on Thursday as well as the ongoing campaign by Democrats to characterize his running mate as “weird” and on the extremes of social conservative viewpoints. Trump, in private conversations, has been seen to chafe at the label and defensively claim that Democrats are only leveling it at Vance, not him.","summary":"Ex-president’s second press conference comes on the heels of widely-panned Elon Musk conversation and rallies in states he won in 2016 and 2020","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-press-conference-bedminster-2024-campaign-b2596529.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/19/2165919869.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 23:06:32","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":254138574,"title":"Former Georgia GOP leader tells citizens it ‘doesn’t mean you’re Democrat’ to vote for Kamala Harris","text":"Former GOP Georgia Lt.

I campaigned for him.

It’s no coincidence that both candidates made their pledges in Nevada — a crucial battleground state which has the highest relative number of waiting staff in the United States, according to the US Labor Department. Tipping culture in the United States is fundamentally different from most other countries, as customers are encouraged to tip generously on everything from take-out coffee to cocktails.

With such a significant chunk of service-sector wages coming from tips, it’s not surprising that the policy has such broad appeal — even if many economists and think tanks do not like it. “There’s no particular reason that, in general, people in the service industry should pay lower taxes than somebody on the factory line, or somebody that’s providing nursing care,” Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), told AFP.","summary":"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris agree on very little, but the two presidential rivals have found common ground in calling for the elimination of taxes on tips &#8212; a populist move that many criticize as economically irresponsible.

During that minute-long gaggle after a Michigan rally last week, Harris said she hoped to schedule, maybe, a single interview by the end of the month. After four years of Democrats lambasting former President Donald Trump as an existential threat to our fragile democratic experiment, the press seems positively indifferent to the notion that a candidate who has not received a single national primary vote in either 2020 or 2024 is heading to a presidential election without even one on-the-record interview with one of its own. In other words, Harris knows all she has to do is ride out the shortest campaign in modern history and that the media will evidently cover for her. Sure, CNN’s John Berman admirably pushed back on the Harris campaign when it lied about her schedule in response to queries about her evasion of the media, and the Washington Post editorial board said that Harris must speak with journalists “if she hopes to prevail.” But evidently, that’s not really true. Somewhat innocuously, if not irritatingly, the Democratic hagiographers in the corporate media have peddled the party line that Republicans are “weird,” Harris is “brat,” and her candidacy marks the greatest thing since sliced bread. More maliciously, most in the media have ignored that Harris is a radical who presided over a quadrupling of the influx of illegal immigrants into the United States and an average annual inflation rate of nearly 6% and advocated nationalizing some 30% of the economy before that. But Harris is running out the clock because she can. The president announced he could concede to the palace coup 25 days ago, announcing both his withdrawal and his endorsement of Harris on July 21. Harris has spent these past three-and-a-half weeks eschewing the press with the feeble excuse of the flurry of kickstarting a presidential campaign with fewer than 100 days until Election Day, and the Democratic National Convention next week has bought her essentially another fortnight of the media playing ball and pretending it’s normal for a party to depose the democratically elected candidate with a second-stringer who can’t lob softballs from Rachel Maddow, let alone beach balls from the Pod bros. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINERAfter the DNC, Harris only has four weeks before early voting begins. The most crucial state of the Electoral College map, Pennsylvania, leads the calendar with early voting beginning on Sept. 16. Missouri allows select voters to begin casting early ballots the day after, and Minnesota, South Dakota, and Virginia all begin accepting early votes on Sept. 20. Biden gave his party fewer than half as many days to replace him than even Lyndon Johnson did in 1968, and that was in an alien era when Election Day was no misnomer rather than our current reality of a 50-day election season. Only 57 days will have elapsed between Biden backing Harris as his coronated replacement and the start of early voting, and to date, Harris has spent nearly half of those days avoiding answering but one question from the press. And the perfectly compliant media may be fine with accommodating Democrats, but they ought not delude themselves into believing they’re enabling anything remotely democratic.","summary":"In the 24 days Kamala Harris has spent as first de facto and then the definitive Democratic presidential nominee since President Joe Biden withdrew from reelection, the vice president has sat down for zero interviews and publicly spoken to the press for a total of 70 seconds.

The interaction was widely shared on social media. JOE ROGAN WARNS KAMALA HARRIS WILL WIN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ‘GIVING INTO THE BULLS---' LIKE NEVER BEFORE CNN developed a reputation as a partisan news organization during the Trump presidency, in large part, due to the anti-Trump tone that dominated the network's primetime programming. Then-White House reporter Jim Acosta was regularly combative with members of the administration. As a result, Trump referred to CNN as \"fake news\" on a regular basis for years. TV producer Chris Licht, formerly the executive producer of Colbert's show, took over the network in 2022 and made it clear he wanted to dial back the left-leaning opinion programming that engulfed the network under his predecessor, Jeff Zucker.

The search-engine behemoth cautioned that it expects the Iran-backed actor, APT42, to ramp up its cyber efforts amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran after having already targeted dozens of key officials. “APT42 is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor and they show no signs of stopping their attempts to target users and deploy novel tactics,” the tech giant wrote in a blog post. “This spring and summer, they have shown the ability to run numerous simultaneous phishing campaigns, particularly focused on Israel and the US,” Google added. Last Saturday, the Trump campaign confirmed that it was the victim of an attack from Iranian actors that Microsoft had revealed without identifying the specific victim. Multiple news organizations including Politico and the Washington Post claimed to have received Trump campaign material that appeared to have been part of the hack. Specifically, those outlets claimed to have been sent a 271-page document that appeared to be vetting material about Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. It included his potential vulnerabilities and was developed by Brand Woodward, a law firm that does work for a handful of Trump advisers. Microsoft didn’t mention APT42 specifically, but revealed that an Iranian group with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps sent a spear phishing email to a campaign official. Google described APT42 as being affiliated with the IRGC and engaging in phishing schemes targeting accounts “associated with the US presidential election.” The US was on the receiving end of 31% of APT42’s attacks, according to Google, and Israel weathered the same percentage. Attacks against Israel appeared to have spiked in April and May. Google further claimed to have eliminated “APT42-created Google Sites pages” that pretended to be a “petition from the legitimate Jewish Agency for Israel calling on the Israeli government to enter into mediation to end the conflict.” Iran has long been believed to be interested in hampering Trump’s reelection prospects, driven by a desire for revenge over his ordering of the strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani back in 2020 as well as his predilection for hefty sanctions against the regime. Google confirmed that APT42 has also taken aim at Biden and Harris, but suggested those efforts have not been successful. “Today, TAG [Google’s Threat Analysis Group] continues to observe unsuccessful attempts from APT42 to compromise the personal accounts of individuals affiliated with President Biden, Vice President Harris and former President Trump, including current and former government officials and individuals associated with the campaigns,” the search engine company wrote. The company further explained that it scuttled efforts by APT42 to attack accounts affiliated with the Trump and Biden campaigns back in the 2020 cycle and that it has done so this year as well. “In May and June, APT42 targets included the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen individuals affiliated with President Biden and with former President Trump,” Google wrote. Tactics of the group include disbursing phishing links in emails to high-profile officials and setting up bogus websites that look legitimate to gain information that can be used to help break into accounts. Google noted that accounts without multi-factor authentication were most vulnerable to those kinds of attacks. In addition to the hacks, Iran has been accused of backing efforts to assassinate Trump, including a recent federal complaint filed against Pakistani national Asif Merchant, 46, for plotting assassinations in New York City. While the court documents didn’t name Trump as the specific target, US Attorney General Merrick Garland later confirmed that was the case. Back in 2021, the director of National Intelligence declassified an assessment that Iran targeted Trump during the 2020 election cycle. “We assess that Iran carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects – though without directly promoting his rival,” the document read. “We assess that Supreme Leader Khamenei authorized the campaign.” Last month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence re-upped its concerns about Iranian meddling and told reporters that it hasn’t “observed a shift in Iran’s preferences” this cycle. It did not elaborate on the alleged campaign against Trump. Iran has publicly denied the allegations of election meddling.","summary":"An Iranian-backed actor that was known to have attempted to infiltrate accounts linked to people affiliated with former President Donald Trump has also targeted individuals in President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's orbit as well, Google claimed Wednesday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/us-news/google-claims-that-iran-has-also-targeted-harris-and-biden/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87777717.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:59:53","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":254138046,"title":"Trump claims Kamala Harris has ‘laugh of a crazy person’ and says he wants her sketch artist","text":"Former President Donald Trump (right) asked what happened to Kamala Harris’ (left) laugh and launched other personal attacks in his North Carolina rally (Pictures: REX/AP) Ex-President Donald Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris’ laugh and said he wanted to use the artist that sketched her magazine cover.

You’d assume the two Trump allies would have been heaping lavish praise on their favorite candidate. Instead, it was some tough love. Conway was pointed in criticizing Trump’s attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris, which have centered on everything from her intelligence to her race. “The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see,” said the first woman to run a winning presidential campaign. “It’s fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrast.” Kudlow agreed. “Again,” he said, “I think personal insults of her are not a good idea, really not a good idea. It’s a distraction, it’s unnecessary, it’s off-message.” Conway offered some optimism for an upcoming interview between Trump and X owner Elon Musk, suggesting it would be a great opportunity for Trump to showcase his “policy contrast.” Bless her heart. The Trump/Musk glitch-ridden livestream, in which Trump waxed poetic about Harris’ so-called resemblance to his wife Melania, among other nonsensical things, was not the contrast Conway was hoping for. Instead, it was a fact-resistant, grievance-riddled, sloppy mess of an interview between two thin-skinned billionaires who were all too happy to learn they hated the same people. Needless to say, it was light on policy. Since President Joe Biden dropped off the Democratic ticket and Harris stepped on, Trump’s 2.0 campaign has been plagued by unforced errors, lackluster messaging, whiffed attempts at defining her, lame name-calling, and embarrassing contrasts in enthusiasm and momentum. He’s tried, for some inexplicable reason, litigating her race, suggesting she only recently “happened to turn Black.” He’s tried insulting her competence and her intelligence. He’s bizarrely accused her of faking her massive crowd sizes with artificial intelligence — and we all know how important crowd size is to him. And on Tuesday, an official Trump campaign account on X posted a racist meme about migrants. As for her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, they’ve tried attacking his service record. They’re calling him “Tampon Tim,” for his state’s law requiring public schools to provide free menstrual products to students. Trump has tried calling him “Comrade Walz.” If recent polls are any indication, none of this is working to boost Trump’s campaign, especially in the all-important swing states, where Harris keeps getting better and better news — like the latest Cook Report, which has Harris up or tied with Trump in all but one swing state. Or the recent New York Times/Siena College poll, showing Harris is tightening the margins with one of Trump’s core constituencies — white working-class voters in swing states. Policy areas ripe for contrast But despite Conway’s nudges, as well as mounting criticism from other Republicans like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and even Peter “Pimp Ladies” Navarro, Trump seems determined to avoid real policy arguments. What’s surprising — and likely infuriating for many Republicans up for reelection in down-ballot races — is that there are plenty of policy areas to go after. Trump and Vance have attempted to pin the migrant crisis at the border on Harris, but thus far haven’t successfully pressured her to answer for her role inside the Biden administration. They’ve hammered the economy, with Trump even predicting a looming depression, but not to any visible impact on her numbers. But they’ve ignored some obvious low-hanging fruit when it comes to Walz, a huge missed opportunity to put the new Dem ticket on defense. First, abortion. While Republicans are rightly painted as extremists on women’s reproductive rights — representing only a fringe minority of voters who want abortion completely banned — Minnesota’s laws are outside the mainstream, too. A new statute in Minnesota does not include any specific prohibitions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. A majority of voters believe abortion should be legal, with some restrictions, including on weeks. A majority of abortion rights supporters say how long a woman has been pregnant should matter in determining legality, and support for legal abortion diminishes at later stages of pregnancy. Minnesota doesn’t require parental consent for minors. National polling shows overwhelming support for parental consent. Minnesota’s progressive transgender laws — making the state a “trans refuge,” where children can receive gender-affirming intervention and the courts can have “temporary emergency jurisdiction” during cross-state custody disputes if a child has been unable to get gender-affirming care, is not nationally popular. A majority of voters oppose gender-affirming care for minors, as well as trans women participating in sports against biological girls. On taxes — remember taxes? Republicans used to care about them. A lot. Minnesota’s got the highest corporate tax rate in the U.S. It’s also got the sixth-highest individual income tax top rate. It seems like this might matter to people. How about a meme or a riff on any of this stuff? Do Walz and Harris want to make America more like Minnesota? It’s a fair question that neither have had to answer because Trump prefers doling out dumb nicknames to drilling down on policy contrasts. Whether he just doesn’t care about the policy, or he’s too old and tired to get substantive and specific, Trump’s campaign is suffering because he refuses to take it — and voters — seriously.

Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Sen. Dr. Bill Cassidy, R-La., requested the Government Accountability Office analysis because they believed the Biden administration “has repeatedly failed to communicate to borrowers on how to transition to repayment,” a release says. Payments resumed in October 2023 after a 3½-year pause due to COVID-19. The congressional leaders – Foxx as chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and Cassidy as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions – say in addition to the January percentage making repayments, another 8 million borrowers in July alone have been placed into forbearance by the Biden administration. “The majority of borrowers don’t believe they need to pay back the loans they knowingly took on, and who can blame them after years of false hope and illegal schemes from the Biden-Harris administration?” Foxx said. “It’s past time for this administration to quit lying to the American public and focus on real solutions to deal with the cost of postsecondary education, like the College Cost Reduction Act that will hold institutions financially responsible for overpriced degrees that leave students with unaffordable debt.” Cassidy said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ nominee as his successor this fall, are not being honest on multiple fronts. “The Biden-Harris administration is misleading these borrowers to win their vote while setting them up for failure,” he said. “These borrowers are racking up interest with missed payments while waiting for the false promise of widespread debt ‘cancellation’ this administration has no authority to deliver. Let’s be clear, the Biden-Harris administration is not canceling debt. They are trying to take the debt from those who willingly took it on and transfer it onto the 87% of Americans who chose to not go to college or already paid off their education.” The federal report said 30% of borrowers, accounting for about $290 billion in loans, were past due on payments. About $254 billion in loans is not expected repaid because of deferment or forbearance. The report said 13.3 million borrowers, about 40%, were current. Those borrowers account for $706 billion in loans. A release from Foxx’s committee says, “To further disincentivize borrowers from paying off their loans after student loan payments resumed last August, the Biden-Harris Department of Education announced that borrowers will not be penalized or considered delinquent if they miss payments for up to a year. This ‘coincidentally’ pushes any consequences for not making payments to after the November election. Borrowers who choose not to pay will still be charged interest on their unpaid loans and may be unaware that interest is accruing. This policy violates the Fiscal Responsibility Act and misleads borrowers on what their responsibilities are to repay their loans.”","summary":"Congressional committee leaders from North Carolina and Louisiana said Thursday the federal report confirms the White House’s efforts to win votes at taxpayers’ expense.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/us-news/congressional-republicans-bash-biden-harris-administration-student-loan-plan/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-dmcccg3pq-1723674716384.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723660410&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/IfjeiMUG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:52:58","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.753},{"id":254137954,"title":"Kamala Harris tries to distance herself from President Biden in yet another policy flip-flip: ‘Everything about her campaign is fake’","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is furiously trying to “distance” herself from President Biden’s record — while also disavowing the far-left policies she heartily embraced just a few years ago. The result is a campaign run entirely on style over substance since Harris took the Democratic mantle from Biden last month. And Democratic campaign operatives warn that she risks voters catching on — and realizing she’s selling only cynical political opportunism. “It’s a marketing strategy that is TV-esque,” one senior Democratic aide said. “With such a short timeline now, policy matters less than personality. “She’s going to almost exclusively look at a voter like a consumer — and sell, sell, sell!” the aide quipped. “Do I think that’s a long-term strategy? No,” the aide admitted. “But I think the plan is win and figure it out.” Another Democratic campaign operative told The Post Wednesday that Harris was wisely trying to break with Biden’s economic policies due to his “horrible” polling numbers — and is prepared to jettison any of their administration’s talking points that don’t have “strong” public support. At the same time, Harris, 59, is also seemingly rejecting a host of her own progressive pet projects that she touted during her failed 2020 presidential bid — including support for Medicare for All, banning fracking and legalizing illegal immigration. Critics attacked Harris from both sides of the party four years ago — with the Biden campaign mocking her Medicare flip-flop in particular as a “have-it-every-which-way” plan, and aides for Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) slamming her policy stances as having been “cobbled together to address various poll numbers,” Politico reported. Now, she’s trying to burnish her moderate credentials by talking about inflation and the high cost of goods head on, while also embracing Trump’s pledge to not tax tips for service and hospitality workers in key battleground states like Nevada. “As far as Harris distancing from Biden, she was going to do that,” the campaign operative said, noting that Democrats have been energized by the opportunity to redefine the 2024 race. “It wasn’t called Harrisflation,” the operative added, referencing the “Bidenflation” moniker that Republicans have branded on the 81-year-old president as the US surged in 2022 to a 40-year high in consumer prices. Meanwhile the hits she’s taken for being aloof on policy and dodging major media interviews for almost a month after Biden’s departure has been strategic on her part, the senior Democratic aide said, giving her a chance to “to get her story straight later.” Harris advisers spilled to Axios on Wednesday that the presidential pick, who was elevated to presumtive nominee solely by winning over party bosses, isn’t afraid to lean into the policy reversals. “It’s no different than [Gov.] Kathy Hochul’s about-face on congestion pricing,” Rockland County Republican Rep. Mike Lawler told The Post, ripping Harris as a “fraud.” “Nobody believes that the economy is in a better position than it was under Donald Trump,” he said. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday that Harris’ revamped campaign — with its peddled talking points about “joy” and “fun” — was just as fake as the dances she has showed off at campaign events. “Everything about her campaign is fake,” Vance said. On Friday, she is expected to “take on corporate price-gouging” and discuss her own plans to lower the costs of food, housing and health care for the middle class during a planned campaign rally in Raleigh. Harris is also reportedly crafting a new image around her relatively humble California roots — the daughter of a working single mom — to curry favor with voters, saying the Harris agenda is about an effort to “win the future.” A slight plurality of voters trust Harris on economic issues over Trump, a Financial Times survey found earlier this week, while a larger plurality believe they will be in better financial shape under the former president. Still, some of the Biden economic agenda is expected to stick to Harris. White House press secretary Karine-Jean Pierre confirmed during the daily press briefing that the record was “both” of theirs. “I’m not going to get into polling,” she said. “What I will tell you is Bidenomics has been something that both the president and the vice president has worked on.” The Democratic operative who spoke with The Post said that some of the economic messaging points may be “easier to defend,” but that “Biden’s immigration record will stick to her.” “It’s easier to defend Biden’s record on the economy,” the operative explained. “You can point to jobs, you can point to the stock market, lowering the costs of drugs. … Immigration is much more difficult.” Another stumbling block could be her past promises to eliminate gas-powered vehicles by 2035, but she has signaled to some energy trade groups in Pennsylvania that she wouldn’t kill the domestic gas and oil industry, according to Reuters. Chet Thompson, the president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, told the outlet he would still maintain caution. “Until the vice president says otherwise, we have to believe she still stands for everything that was in her 2019 policy plan and for every policy she cosponsored as a senator,” he said. Harris and Biden are slated to appear in Prince George’s county, Md., for an event also touting their administration’s efforts to lower costs — their first joint appearance since he dropped out.","summary":"Democratic campaign operatives warn that she risks voters catching on — and realizing she's selling only cynical political opportunism.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/us-news/kamala-harris-latest-flip-flip-is-to-distance-herself-from-biden/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87770781.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CmqIPmG6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:52:48","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":254138766,"title":"Illinois State Fair attracts Democrats ahead of Democratic National Convention in Chicago","text":"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WLS) — Democrats from around the state gathered at the State Fair in Springfield Wednesday for an election season rally that takes on special meaning this year. In just five days the Democratic National Convention will get underway in Chicago, giving party members extra reason for excitement. ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch Governor’s Day for Democrats is always a big rah-rah party rally, but with Vice President Kamala Harris now carrying the banner for November, Wednesday was a chance to further fuel the enthusiasm for next week and November. More than 1,000 Democrats from across Illinois gathered at the state fair breakfast to reconnect and focus on the future with fresh motivation. “The excitement is palpable. Women are so engaged right now, even Gen Z’ers, who normally aren’t paying attention, they are super excited about this candidacy,” said Comptroller Susana Mendoza. Governor JB Pritzker and others reminded the crowd what’s at stake with the Democratic Convention getting underway next week. “We are just days away from hosting delegates and party leaders from across this nation for the 2024 Democratic National Convention and we are 83 days away from hearing the two words, this country has waited 248 years, to hear. Madam President,” Governor Pritzker said. Party leaders also talked about winning more seats in the state house, challenging attendees to do the work needed to win. “If you want to go backwards, you put your car in R,” Senator Tammy Duckworth said. “If you want to go forward, to put it in D.” Attendees said the annual rally took on a different feeling this time. “This is just, I mean, you just get chills, just hearing people talk, people excited. I feel like that. This is definitely different,” said Tammie Leigh-Brown of Macomb, Ill. “I think it’s just been an exciting three weeks, because the party has been completely energized. It seems like a completely different race,” said State Rep. Theresa Mah (D-SW Chicago). There was also a nod to President Joe Biden who stepped aside opening the door for Kamala Harris, “It’s incredible that a man and the character of Joe Biden stepped up and made a selfless decision for America,” Senator Dick Durbin said. But Wednesday it was about generating excitement for the new head of the ticket. Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton was wearing a shirt saying Kamala is for everybody “Kamala is for everybody and she is ready to shatter the highest glass ceiling and fight for all of us, and we in Illinois have her back because Democrats deliver,” Lt. Gov. Stratton said. Governor Pritzker said he is excited that the Chicago DNC host committee has raised $95 million, $10 million more than their goal. And he did not seem concerned if enthusiasm for Harris may be peaking soon. “When Donald Trump was ahead in the polls, that was too soon,” he said. The rally was also a call to action for Democrats across the state to get involved. “We are going to organize. We are going to, that’s right, put the boots on the ground and make sure that the fight isn’t over, that we finish it in November,” said IL Democratic Party Chair and State Rep. Lisa Hernandez. Thursday will be Republican Day at the fair, where they will get a chance to rally the party faithful around their candidates, with the forecast for November looking much different than a month ago.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, claims the Biden administration’s 2021 Executive Order 14019, which mandates federal agencies to engage in voter registration activities, oversteps the authority granted to the executive branch and infringes on state sovereignty. “Just as it’s illegal for a Democrat administration to do this, it would be illegal for a Republican administration to do this,” Republican Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach told the Washington Examiner. “We have a system where the government itself must follow the law, and it doesn’t matter who’s sitting in the White House.” The plaintiffs argue that this executive order, dubbed “Bidenbucks” by its critics, transforms federal agencies into de facto voter registration organizations, a role that, according to the lawsuit, should be reserved for states. They assert that this federal overreach undermines the integrity of state-run voter registration systems and threatens the balance of power between state and federal governments. Based on analysis from the left-wing think tank Demos, which backs the order, the initiative could lead to “approximately 3 million new or updated voter registrations per year.” This surge in voter registrations could potentially swing the election in favor of the Democrats in what is expected to be a closely contested race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The complaint argues that the executive order may lead to more Democratic registrants by citing the historically left-leaning nature of federal agencies, which is evident from the majority of federal employees’ political donations going to Democratic candidates in past elections. This suggests that the federal bureaucracy, responsible for implementing the order, could favor the Democratic Party, according to the complaint. But time is of the essence for this challenge, as there are only about three weeks left before early voting in some states begins, meaning much of the potential damage caused by “Bidenbucks” may already be done. “If one of the courts were to issue a preliminary injunction, it might have some impact on this upcoming election in November,” Kobach said, contending that if their lawsuit was successful, it would more likely affect future elections rather than 2024. As the former secretary of state for eight years in the Sunflower State, Kobach said he feels confident his state and others are right to challenge Biden’s get-out-the-vote effort, which he said “also motivated me to be part of this lawsuit.” The case, known as Montana v. Biden, seeks to have the district court immediately declare the executive order unconstitutional and to vacate and enjoin all agency actions implementing it. In addition to Kansas and Montana, other states that have joined in the complaint include Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and South Dakota. The problems caused by the Biden executive order have left visible impacts previously reported on by the Washington Examiner earlier this summer. For example, one participating site for the get-out-the-vote initiative was the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, which is the largest federally qualified health center in the state that services 70,000 people, including in Oklahoma. Footage reviewed by the Washington Examiner showed examples in which personnel at the health center touted their work turning out voters who ultimately rejected a 2022 anti-abortion referendum. The Montana case also builds on a similar petition by Pennsylvania state lawmakers to the Supreme Court in April, asking the justices if they have the right to challenge the executive order on the basis that it serves as an incursion on legislative duty. The Supreme Court has yet to take up that challenge and signaled it would not consider the appeal until late September. On Wednesday, the case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Daniel D. Crabtree, who is an appointee of former President Barack Obama. It’s not immediately clear whether and when the court will act on the request to enjoin the “Bidenbucks” initiative.","summary":"Kansas and a coalition of several Republican-led states joined a lawsuit to block the Biden administration from using taxpayer-funded federal agencies to register new voters and decried it an &#8220;unlawful&#8221; overreach that could result in millions of new Democratic registrants.

He is increasingly getting more involved in his father's political scene, having received a standing ovation at a campaign rally in July. Previously not in the public political eye, Barron is still much more removed than some of Trump's other children, like Donald Jr. and Eric.Weeks after his public political debut in July, Gen Z political influencer Bo Loudon called Barron one of his \"best friends,\" in a post praising his father, the GOP presidential candidate.Loudon, whose parents are conservative commentator Gina Loudon, who was on the 2020 Trump campaign media advisory board and co-chair of Women for Trump, and former Missouri state Senator John William Loudon, has over 200,000 followers on Instagram and 120,000 on X, formerly Twitter.Earlier this month, Trump thanked Barron for helping facilitate an introduction to Adin Ross, a 23-year-old streamer who spoke with Trump in a live interview about his presidential bid for over an hour.In a post to Truth Social a day later, Trump said that the interview \"EXPLODED, but in a very positive way,\" on the platform Kick, which Ross often uses to stream himself playing video games.Mulvaney said that Trump has \"always empowered the youngest, 'the weakest,' the bottom—he's always listened to everybody on the totem pole, he's going to listen to Barron.\"He cited anecdotes of Trump taking this approach with business endeavors in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as in more recent years in the political arena, asking Air Force enlistees, \"what do you think we should be doing, why are we here, how do you feel about this, etcetera, etcetera.\"Mulvaney, who previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget and is a former South Carolina representative, added, \"give him credit, he's not 18 years old anymore, Trump is not, so asking an 18-year-old how 18-year-olds think is probably not the stupidest thing he's ever done.\"Newsweek reached out to the Trump campaign for comment via email on Wednesday.Gen Z voters, a group that includes those age 18 to 27, are expected to play a big role in the election matchup between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who entered the campaign nearly 100 days before Election Day following President Joe Biden's exit from the race. For many Gen Z voters, this will be their first time casting ballots in a presidential election.Before dropping out, Biden had been trailing Trump among young voters. The race between Harris and Trump in this age group is much tighter, with both candidates actively seeking to win their support.","summary":"Mick Mulvaney, who served as Donald Trump's White House chief of staff, said the GOP candidate is seeking advice from his youngest son on attracting young voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-asking-barron-advice-young-voters-ex-official-1939503","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2450246/barron-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:51:34","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.001},{"id":254137676,"title":"Debut of X’s AI Image Generator with Minimal Restrictions on Political Content","text":"An upgraded version of X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok can now generate images — of almost anything. And some users have noticed just how few guardrails this latest language model has, compared to its competitors. The model, Grok-2, appears to carry few limitations on creating fake images of political figures. Since its rollout Tuesday in beta, X users have shared Grok-generated images of everything from former President Donald Trump locking lips with Elon Musk to Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris giving a thumbs up to the camera from a pilot’s cockpit as the two seemingly recreate 9/11. Most of the images are high quality but not quite photorealistic, and many of them are easily identified as having been computer-generated. Some, however, may pass for a real photo at first glance. The rollout adds to already-heightened concerns about the use of generative AI to spread false information ahead of the election. X has come under particular scrutiny for its role in hosting misinformation, with Musk — X’s owner and most followed user — having made dozens of posts this year sharing false or misleading claims about the upcoming U.S. election. X has also been a hub for deepfake videos and AI images of political figures, with false media of President Joe Biden, Trump and Harris often going viral whether as a joke or due to genuine attempts to fool potential voters. Last month, Musk reposted a fake Harris campaign ad without labeling it as misleading. When asked for comment, X’s press email returned its usual automated message: “Busy now, please check back later.” Musk has touted X’s AI models as a key part of the company’s future. Grok-2 and its smaller sibling Grok-2 mini will be made available through the platform’s enterprise API later this month, according to an xAI blog post. “Since announcing Grok-1 in November 2023, xAI has been moving at an extraordinary pace, driven by a small team with the highest talent density,” the post stated, adding that the launch of Grok-2 puts the company “at the forefront of AI development.” Grok’s major competitors in the AI space, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta AI, have policies that prompt them to decline requests to create potentially misleading images of public figures. But through Grok, users have been able to generate images of former President Barack Obama doing a line of cocaine, Harris pointing a gun under a false declaration that Democratic candidate Will Stancil won his Minnesota House race, and Musk crawling on all fours on a leash held by Trump. In tests conducted by NBC News, Grok showed very few guardrails. When prompted, it created numerous images that included hate symbols or racist imagery alongside well-known individuals including Trump. For both Trump and Harris, Grok would produce images showing the candidates holding weapons, but in other instances, Grok appeared to handle images with Harris more sensitively. Grok would not generate images of Harris with extremist imagery, but it did for Trump. Others online seem to be having fun with the new tool, generating more lighthearted images while also testing just how far they could push the boundaries. One image of “Baroque Obama,” depicting Obama wearing a white powdered wig and donning a luxurious coat with a lace cravat, has the former president playing the cello in an elaborately furnished room. Another punny image of “Buzz Lightbeer” showed Toy Story’s superhero action figure Buzz Lightyear holding up a pint of beer with a smile. Such images may bring up questions about Grok’s training data — which it has not made public — especially as many popular AI language models have been hit with lawsuits alleging that they used copyrighted images (and other kinds of copyrighted data) to train its algorithms. Grok has also come under scrutiny recently after five secretaries of state sent a letter to Musk alleging that the AI assistant misled users about ballot deadlines in numerous states, repeating the same false information for more than a week.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAn upgraded version of X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok can now generate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debut of X&#8217;s AI Image Generator with Minimal Restrictions on Political Content first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/debut-of-xs-ai-image-generator-with-minimal-restrictions-on-political-content/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-08/240814-x-phone-ch-1424-1af875.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:45:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":254137740,"title":"Top Illinois Democrats, including Pritzker and Johnson, to speak at Democratic convention","text":"Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson are among a slew of Illinois Democrats scheduled to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week. Pritzker will speak in a primetime address on Tuesday night, the same night former President Barack Obama will address the convention, according to two sources familiar with the plans. Johnson, Sen. Dick Durbin, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood have also been confirmed as speakers. President Joe Biden will address the convention on Monday, along with former Secretary of State and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton will address the convention before vice presidential nominee Tim Walz speaks and formally accepts the nomination. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will close out the convention with a Thursday night address. Pritzker, Duckworth and former Mayor Lori Lightfoot were instrumental in landing the convention in Chicago. But Johnson has also played an active role since taking office. Pritzker, who was a contender to be Harris’ running mate, told reporters last week that he planned to travel the country to help boost the Harris-Walz ticket ahead of the November election. And Johnson last week headlined an event in Detroit called “Black Men for Harris.” Pritzker and First Lady MK Pritzker on Tuesday plan to host a Salt Shed concert featuring John Legend. Pritzker has presidential aspirations, although a Harris win in November would mean he would have to wait a bit longer to launch a full-fledged presidential campaign. The Democratic governor last week would not definitively say whether he is considering a third run for governor in 2026 or if he would consider taking over for Walz as chair of the Democratic Governors Association should the ticket win. “At the moment, I’m just focused on the job that I’ve got,” he said. He also said that he has not contemplated a Cabinet position should Democrats win. Also on Wednesday, the DNC Host Committee said it brought in a record-breaking $94 million for the convention. The massive fundraising came even as Biden struggled in the polls — and in a debate performance that led to the end of his reelection campaign on July 21. Democrats quickly coalesced behind Harris as the nominee. She named Walz as her running mate last week.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/14/democratic-national-convention-top-illinois-democrat-speakers-pritzker-johnson-duckworth-durbin-underwood","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b293613/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F7a%2F2493dad17ec91dbe45f0a73ea309%2Fmerl","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:39:34","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":254137662,"title":"Instagram fails to protect female politicians from violent, racist, sexist comments","text":"Instagram fails to protect female politicians from violent, racist, sexist comments A new report that shows a deluge of misogynistic, racist and violent comments targeting Kamala Harris and female politicians on Instagram.

Mr. Ventura, now 73, is once again circling the ring. In a subplot that seems far-fetched even by the standards of the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Ventura — an avowed political independent, former Minnesota governor and marijuana entrepreneur who was on the shortlist to be Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate — has in recent days endorsed the Democrats Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, sharply criticized the Republican ticket and touched upon a decades-old beef with Hogan over a failed effort to unionize pro wrestlers. After Hogan — whose real name is Terry G. Bollea — made a popeyed, shirt-ripping appearance last month at the Republican National Convention, some have wondered if Mr. Ventura would appear in Chicago for the Democrats next week, scale the ropes in his feather boa and body-slam his rival, metaphorically, of course.

Vance also seemed to concur when the host suggested that having grandparents help raise children was a “weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman.” It's the latest in comments from the Republican nominee for vice presdident about women and \"traditional\" roles that have drawn ire. Vance has faced intense criticism in recent weeks for previous sexist comments, including his remarks about \"cat ladies.\" Now, his appearance on ThePortal podcast with host Eric Weinstein in April 2020 has been thrust back into the limelight Vance spoke about his wife’s Indian family, noting that they emigrated to the US about a year before his wife, Usha Vance, was born. He said at the time, her parents were “devoted” to Usha and their grandchild as well as to “future grandchildren.” The couple has three children, born in 2017, 2020 and in 2021. “You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them like they spoil him,” he said of his first child. “There's sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren, but it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents.” He added: “And the evidence on this is like super clear.” “That’s the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female in theory,” Weinstein said at the time. “Yes,” Vance agreed. “When your child was born, did your in-laws, and particularly your mother-in-law, show up in some huge way?” Weinstein asked Vance. “She lived with us for a year,” former President Donald Trump’s running mate noted. “I didn't know the answer to that. So that's a weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman,” Weinstein responded. “It’s in some ways, the most transgressive thing I've ever done against sort of the hyper-neo-liberal approach to work and family,” Vance said. “My wife had this baby seven weeks before she started the clerkship, [she’s] still not sleeping any more than an hour and a half in a given interval. And her mom just took a sabbatical. She's a biology professor in California, just took a sabbatical for a year and came and lived with us and took care of our kid for a year.” He added that it was “painfully economically inefficient.” “Why didn't she just keep her job, give us part of the wages to pay somebody else to do it?” he asked. “That is the thing that the hyper-liberalized economics wants you to do. The economic logic of always prioritizing paid wage labor over other forms of contributing to a society is to me ... a consequence of a sort of fundamental liberalism that is ultimately gonna unwind and collapse upon itself.” “It's the abandonment of a sort of Aristotelian virtue politics for a hyper-market-oriented way of thinking about what's good and what's desirable,” he added. “If people are paying for it and it contributes to GDP and it makes the economic consumption numbers rise, then it's good, and if it doesn't, it's bad ... that's sort of the root of our political problem.” The Independent has contacted the Vance campaign for comment. The Director of Rapid Response for Kamala Harris, Ammar Moussa, wrote on X: “I’m sorry - who is out here just out here talking about the ‘postmenopausal female’ and their role in society?” Democratic Illinois Congressman Sean Casten added: “Are you a post-menopausal woman? Did you quit your job to look after your grandkids? Because if you didn’t, you are not meeting your ‘whole purpose’ according to JD Vance.” Vance has faced criticism for a number of unearthed comments from his past, most notably telling Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio Cortez] — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” he said. “And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Harris has two stepchildren and Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, adopted twins in August 2021.","summary":"Vance also seemed to agree when a podcast host suggested that having grandparents help raise children was a ‘weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-children-women-audio-b2596492.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/23/SEI217406098.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/08MQbDlB-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:31:44","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":254137066,"title":"Google says it observed Iran trying to hack the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns","text":"Google said in a research report Wednesday that it detected efforts by Iranian hackers to target both the Trump and the Biden-Harris campaigns in May and June, part of a larger email phishing operation that still persists. Google’s announcement adds credence to the Trump campaign’s claim Saturday that it had been hacked as part of an Iranian campaign to interfere with the election. In its report, Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which tracks government-backed cyberattacks, said it had disrupted a “small but steady” phishing operation from a hacking unit tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In May and June, “targets included the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen individuals affiliated with President Biden and with former President Trump, including current and former officials in the U.S. government and individuals associated with the respective campaigns,” Google said in its report. The company blocked “numerous” attempts to log in to the targets’ personal email addresses, it said. Google said the hacking operation accessed the Gmail account of at least one high-profile political consultant in July. The company said it went on to secure the account and referred the matter to law enforcement. The company didn’t disclose the identity of the consultant or whether the consultant was involved with either campaign. Like many elite government-affiliated hacking groups, the Revolutionary Guard hackers are known for their dogged persistence. Google said it “continues to observe” unsuccessful attempts to break into accounts affiliated with Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump. The attempted hacks, part of a larger campaign to hack U.S. and Israeli targets, have used Google products like Sites, Drive and Gmail, Google said. Reports of a credible hacking threat to U.S. presidential campaigns began last week, when Microsoft said hackers affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard had broken into the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign. Microsoft didn’t provide more details about who was hacked. A spokesperson for Iran’s Mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Iranian state news previously reported that a representative for the mission had denied Iranian involvement in hacking Trump’s campaign. Over the weekend, three U.S. news outlets — Politico, The Washington Post and The New York Times — said they had received emails including what appeared to be Trump campaign files in what appeared to be a “hack-and-leak” operation to embarrass Trump. The FBI said Monday it was investigating efforts to hack both the Trump and the Biden-Harris campaigns but didn’t provide further details. Only the Trump campaign has claimed to have been hacked. The initial round of phishing emails this spring happened before Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the Democrats’ nominee. A Harris official told NBC News the campaign was unaware of any security breach. No major cybersecurity company or government agency has so far explicitly said that Iran successfully hacked the Trump campaign. Microsoft has declined to comment further on its report. A Microsoft spokesperson told NBC News its policy is to refrain from publicly disclosing details about a hacking victim unless that victim clearly asks it to. The series of events comes after a U.S. intelligence official from the Foreign Malign Influence Center, one of the few arms of the U.S. government devoted to countering foreign propaganda campaigns, warned that Iran was likely to continue efforts to denigrate Trump.","summary":"Google said in a research report that it detected efforts by Iranian hackers to target both the Trump and the Biden-Harris campaigns in May and June.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/google-says-observed-iran-trying-hack-trump-biden-harris-campaigns-rcna166645","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240712-donald-trump-mn-1110-e987d6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:28:05","author":"Kevin Collier","authors":["Kevin Collier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.538},{"id":254137658,"title":"Cornel West’s signature-gathering effort scrutinized in Maine","text":"Representatives of former Harvard University professor Cornel West’s third-party bid for president told the secretary of state that the campaign’s decentralized nature likely attributed to petitioners allegedly exceeding the maximum number of petition signatures set in state law and people saying they were misled. West representatives described the campaign as relying heavily on volunteers, especially in Maine, which allows anyone to collect signatures for someone trying to gain access to the presidential ballot and submit them to a municipality for verification. Campaign Manager Ceyanna Dent said that the West campaign, unlike most other campaigns, does not have state directors or paid staff in each state, making it difficult to control what happens on the ground, or know how many signatures are submitted. “We are a grassroots, people-powered campaign, so a lot of the petitioning process is decentralized and without state leads,” Dent said. “Our petitioners are everyday folk. They are working-class people.” Dent and other West campaign officials were addressing Secretary of State Shenna Bellows during a hearing on two separate challenges to the campaign’s petitions to appear as a third party candidate on Maine’s presidential ballot. A separate challenge to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s petitions was withdrawn on Tuesday for undisclosed reasons. The challenges appear to be part of a nationwide effort by Clear Choice Action, a group led by Biden allies, to prevent a third-party spoiler in what is expected to be a very tight presidential race. The Washington Post reported the group planned to “develop research and push storylines in the media” to discourage people from voting for third-party candidates. “They are frankly the same exact challenges we have seen from these folks and their allies in at least a half-dozen other states,” said attorney Mike McCorkle, who represented the West campaign. “They are couched in part on insinuations and allegations about activities in other states that have not been borne up under investigation.” It’s unclear what impact West’s candidacy will have on the presidential race in Maine, which uses ranked choice voting in presidential elections, minimizing the spoiler effect of third-party candidates. And West does not appear to be pulling much support in Maine. A poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in July found 4% of Maine respondents said they planned to vote for Kennedy and 1% for West, compared with 48% for Vice President Kamala Harris and 40% for former President Donald Trump. The Pine Street State Poll found about 4% of those surveyed were undecided. Portland resident Nathan Berger lists 16 specific challenges, including that the West campaign exceeded the 5,000 maximum signature limit by 983 signatures, while also claiming that thousands of those signatures violate state statute for having incorrect dates, duplicate entries, missing information and improper notarization. “Dr. West submitted nearly 1,000 signatures too many,” said attorney David Fox, who represented Berger. “That should really be the end of the analysis.” Anne Gass, of Gray, and Sandra Marquis, of Lewiston, accused the West campaign of defrauding voters by telling them the nominating petitions were to prevent “improper financial dealings by members of Congress and address corporate corruption.” Attorneys representing Gass and Marquis presented at least three witnesses, who were told the petition was to prohibit stock trading by federal officials. They were all surprised when they were contacted by an attorney telling them they had actually signed a petition for West to appear on the ballot. Falmouth resident Meryln Poulin said she and her fiance were approached after biking to the Shaw’s supermarket in Falmouth. Poulin said she waited outside with bikes and observed the petitioner approach several customers before approaching her. “The circulator never mentioned Cornel West,” Poulin said. “I was shocked that was what I had done.” McCorkle apologized to each witness and said the campaign did not intend to deceive people, effectively placing the blame on volunteer canvassers for not following the rules. But he also suggested that people should read any petition before signing. Wednesday’s hearing lasted nearly four hours and included a detailed review of signatures the challengers claimed should not have been validated by municipalities or the secretary of state’s office. Bellows did not issue a ruling on Wednesday. State law requires a decision within five business days of the hearing, which was left open until the end of Friday so the parties can address lingering questions and submit final arguments in writing. Bellows’ decision could be appealed to Superior Court. Bellows recently garnered nationwide headlines for ruling that former President Donald Trump was ineligible for Maine’s ballot because of his role in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, only to reverse course after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a similar case that state officials do not have the authority to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot.","summary":"The independent candidate's eligibility for the presidential ballot is facing 2 separate challenges.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/14/cornel-wests-signature-gathering-effort-scrutinized-in-maine/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/07/Election_2024_Ballot_Deception_38585.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:27:18","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.082},{"id":254137838,"title":"Tim Walz raises $3 million in Denver, capping “interesting” first week as Kamala Harris’ VP pick","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joked about his “interesting” first week as Kamala Harris’ running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket and criticized Donald Trump’s background on Wednesday during a Denver fundraiser that collected $3 million for the campaign. “This week has been interesting,” Walz told roughly 150 attendees in the backyard of the 33,000-square-foot Phipps Mansion, owned by Democratic megadonor Tim Gill. “That’s a Minnesota word, ‘interesting’ — so you Minnesotans know, it has multiple meanings.” He recounted being selected by Harris last week and then soon being put on a plane to a rally in Philadelphia — where he was told: “Here, you’ve got 45 minutes to read this speech off the teleprompter.” “Perhaps I neglected to tell you,” Walz recounted to laughs and cheers, “I’ve never used a teleprompter in my life.” The fundraiser was part of Walz’s first solo trip since joining the Harris ticket, a three-day, five-state swing. During his 15-minute in Denver in the early afternoon, Walz praised Harris’ “politics of kindness” and joked with Gov. Jared Polis, his former congressional counterpart and baseball teammate. He also criticized Trump, the Republican nominee, drawing a contrast between Harris’ background — both as a prosecutor and as a former McDonald’s employee — and the former president’s. Walz said he recently asked labor leaders in California if they could see Trump making a McFlurry. He paraphrased a Harris rally line, saying the vice president had gone after “fraudsters” and “predators,” adding: “We know who that might be.” He said there was “no safety net” when speaking in front of the large crowds that are common on a presidential campaign trail. Polis, who’d introduced him, chimed in: “Are you saying they’re not all AI?” That was a reference to a false claim Trump made in recent days — that the Harris campaign had used artificial intelligence to inflate crowd sizes in a picture from a recent campaign stop in Michigan. “I assure you, in Detroit, that wasn’t AI, and I’ll also assure you that every one of the ballots they’re going to cast will not be AI,” Walz replied, to cheers. Trump was recently in Colorado, making a stop in Aspen Saturday during a multistate Mountain West swing that he said raised $28 million. Since Harris picked Walz, Republicans have focused their attacks most heavily on aspects of his more than two decades of National Guard service, but little was said about the topic at the Denver fundraiser. The $3 million raised for the Harris Victory Fund on Wednesday was announced by Gill. Also in attendance were former U.S. Reps. John Salazar and Ed Perlmutter, current U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb and former state House Speaker Alec Garnett, now Polis’ chief of staff. Walz spoke broadly about Democratic priorities and ideals — like supporting “common-sense gun legislation” and addressing climate change and poverty — though he provided few specific policy proposals. Polis said he’d told Walz not to spend any campaign cash on winning Colorado, which has turned reliably blue in recent years and went for Biden by 13.5 percentage points over Trump in 2020. Polis said Harris and Walz’s presence on the ticket would be enough to support Democrats’ down-ballot efforts, meaning to preserve a state House supermajority and win a similar margin in the state Senate. Still, Walz urged attendees to keep working in the 83 days that remained until Election Day. “Sleep when you’re dead,” he said.

After booking $50 million worth of ads last month, the vice president is launching a $90 million bid over the next three weeks, according to a report from the Associated Press. The advertising push, her largest yet, will share Harris’s personal story with voters, with a special focus on seven swing states. Voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will hear attacks on former President Donald Trump’s “dangerous, extreme agenda” as Harris touts her tenure as California attorney general. Harris’s presidential campaign got off to a late start after she stepped into President Joe Biden’s shoes with just over 100 days to go until Election Day. The day after Biden’s historic campaign exit, Harris announced her intention to head the top of the Democratic ticket, leaving her only a narrow window of time to tell voters why she should lead the nation. Although the Democratic presidential nominee has stayed busy stumping in swing states, making her latest battleground tour across Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada last week, Harris has declined to make traditional media appearances to make her name and policy agenda known to voters. After facing criticism for not engaging with the press, Harris recently promised to sit down for an interview before the end of August. However, she continues to face pushback on her lack of interaction with the media. “Would it kill you guys to have a press conference? Why hasn’t she had a press conference?” CNN host Jim Acosta questioned Harris communications director Michael Tyler on Wednesday. Tyler deflected with a laugh, reminding Acosta that Harris agreed to do an interview before the end of the month and is speaking directly to voters in rallies across the country. “A campaign rally is not a press conference,” Acosta responded. “One interview before the end of the month, I mean, that’s not a lot.” The CNN host continued to push the Harris campaign to hold a press conference before August’s end, but Tyler deferred on the timing. “We will commit to directly engaging with the voters who are going to decide this election,” he told the network. Even during the flurry of rallies and events she has held in recent weeks, the vice president has given little insight into specifics of what a Harris presidency would entail. While she is set to unveil her economic blueprint in North Carolina on Friday, Harris’s campaign website has yet to create an issue page. The Washington Post’s editorial board worried on Sunday that “if she hopes to prevail, Ms. Harris needs to present her ideas.” On the opposite side of the political spectrum, Trump is using Harris’s relatively vague stance on policy as a campaign talking point. The former president has claimed that Harris is afraid to discuss her record and is deliberately leaving voters in the dark about her policy agenda. The Harris camp argues that the vice president’s positions will mirror her boss’s agenda. “I don’t think we should overstate the mystery here — she’s been part of these policy proposals for the last four years,” Michael Linden, a former staff member in the White House budget office under Biden, told the New York Times.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is investing heavily in her introduction to the country as critics say she&#8217;s dodging releasing her policy blueprint.&#160; After booking $50 million worth of ads last month, the vice president is launching a $90 million bid over the next three weeks, according to a report from the Associated Press.&#160; The advertising [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3121676/harris-invests-90-million-introduction-voters-campaign-kicks-can-policy-agenda-details/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kamala-Harris.-.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:25:23","author":"Emily Hallas","authors":["Emily Hallas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":254137932,"title":"Former 'Trump cheerleaders’' praise for Harris warns of 'trouble' for ex-president: conservative","text":"Many Republicans — from former Donald Trump advisers, to former and current lawmakers — have turned on the former president since his attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

It was great timing.\" Mediate reports: Rogan earned the ire of Trump recently after he praised independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a previous podcast guest, and argued he’s the 'only one' in the race who makes sense. While Rogan stopped short of an official endorsement, some reported his words as if they were. Trump took to Truth Social to fantasize about Rogan being booed at the next UFC event he’s at — Rogan has long been a fight commentator. The news outlet also notes that although Rogan called Harris' address to the Atlanta crowd a \"banger of a speech,\" the former Trump fan \"also theorized that Harris has been heavily coached.\" Nonetheless, conservative columnist Peter Wehner noted: \"The fact that past Trump cheerleaders like [former Fox News host] Megyn Kelly and Rogan are turning on Trump underscores the trouble he's in.

Telling The Sun: 'Everything Taylor does is for her fans and she will be putting on the best show of her life when she returns to Wembley.' Taylor Swift, 34, will reportledy be joined on stage at Wembley by pal Ed Sheeran, 33, on Thursday, with a source her latest Eras Tour show 'the hardest concert of her career' The singer, was forced to cancel three gigs in Vienna last week due to a foiled terror plot , shortly after three young kills were murdered at a Taylor Swift themed dance class in Southport, Merseyside 'Hate never wins and Taylor absolutely stands for that. Her shows are about love, unity and acceptance, and this is a message she will always want to convey.' MailOnline have contacted Taylor and Ed's reps for comment. Taylor was due to perform in front of an estimated 170,000 fans on August 8, 9, and 10 at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion, which was set to be reinforced with more security measures before the three shows were cancelled. 'Taylor has been devastated by this. She is devastated for the fans who have been waiting for years to see her,' an insider told The Mirror, in the first indication of Swift's reaction following the news. 'But the thought of what could have happened if the concerts had been targeted by a terror attack is horrifying, and she would never risk the safety of her fans. 'The memory of what happened at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester is still very vivid in everyone's minds. But she has told her team that she wants to try to return to Vienna as soon as possible in the future. She is very conscious of how disappointed her fans in Austria are.' The hitmaker has not made any public statements since the alleged plot was uncovered. The arrest of a third suspect was announced last week.

'The group is considered the greatest external terrorist threat to the continent,' claimed UN undersecretary for counterterrorism Vladimir Vorokov, who said the group had increased its recruitment efforts on the continent, according to ABC News.

The models are also linked to the recently released Flux image synthesis model, which allows X users to create largely uncensored photorealistic images that can be shared on the site. \"Flux, accessible through Grok, is an excellent text-to-image generator, but it is also really good at creating fake photographs of real locations and people, and sending them right to Twitter,\" wrote frequent AI commentator Ethan Mollick on X. \"Does anyone know if they are watermarking these in any way? It would be a good idea.\" In a report posted earlier today, The Verge noted that Grok's image generation capabilities appear to have minimal safeguards, allowing users to create potentially controversial content. According to their testing, Grok produced images depicting political figures in compromising situations, copyrighted characters in inappropriate contexts, and scenes of violence when prompted. The Verge found that while Grok claims to have certain limitations, such as avoiding pornographic or excessively violent content, these rules seem inconsistent in practice. Unlike other major AI image generators, Grok does not appear to refuse prompts involving real people or add identifying watermarks to its outputs. Given what people are generating so far—including images of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris kissing or giving a thumbs-up on the way to the Twin Towers in an apparent 9/11 attack—the unrestricted outputs may not last for long. But then again, Elon Musk has made a big deal out of \"freedom of speech\" on his platform, so perhaps the capability will remain (until someone likely files a defamation or copyright suit). People using Grok's image generator to shock brings up an old question in AI at this point: Should misuse of an AI image generator be the responsibility of the person who creates the prompt, the organization that created the AI model, or the platform that hosts the images? So far, there is no clear consensus, and the situation has yet to be resolved legally, although a new proposed US law called the NO FAKES act would presumably hold X liable for the creation of realistic image deepfakes. With Grok-2, the GPT-4 ceiling still holds Looking beyond images, in a release blog, xAI claims that Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini represent significant advancements in capabilities, with Grok-2 supposedly outperforming some leading competitors in recent benchmarks and what we call \"vibemarks.\" It's always wise to approach those claims with a dose of skepticism, but it appears that the \"GPT-4 class\" of AI language models (those with similar capability to OpenAI's model) has grown larger, but the GPT-4 barrier has not yet been smashed. \"There are now five GPT-4 class models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3.1, and now Grok 2,\" wrote Ethan Mollick on X. \"All of the labs are saying there is room left for continued giant improvements, but we haven’t seen any models truly leap above GPT-4… yet.\" xAI says it recently introduced an early version of Grok-2 to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena under the name \"sus-column-r,\" where it reportedly achieved a higher overall Elo score than models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 Turbo. Chatbot Arena is a popular subjective vibemarking website for AI models, but it's been the subject of controversy recently when people disagreed with OpenAI's GPT-4o mini placing so highly in the rankings. According to xAI, both new Grok models show improvements over predecessor Grok-1.5 in areas like graduate-level science knowledge, general knowledge, and math problem-solving in benchmarks that have similarly proved controversial. The company also highlighted Grok-2's performance on visual tasks, claiming state-of-the-art results in visual math reasoning and document-based question answering. The models are now available to X Premium and Premium+ subscribers through an updated app interface. Unlike some of its competitors in the open weights space, xAI isn't releasing the model weights for download or independent verification. This closed approach stands in stark contrast to recent moves by Meta, which recently released its Llama 3.1 405B model for anyone to download and run locally. xAI plans to release both models through an enterprise API later this month. The company says this API will feature multi-region deployment options and security measures like mandatory multifactor authentication. Details on pricing, usage limits, or data handling policies have not yet been announced. Photorealistic image generation aside, perhaps Grok-2's biggest liability is its deep link to X, which gives it a tendency to pull inaccurate information from tweets. It's a bit like if you had a friend who insisted on checking the social media site before answering any of your questions, even when it wasn't particularly relevant. As Mollick pointed out on X, this close link can be annoying: \"I only have access to Grok 2 mini right now, and it seems like a solid model, but often seems ill-served by its RAG connection to Twitter,\" he wrote. \"The model is fed results from Twitter that seem irrelevant to the prompt, and then desperately tries to connect them into something coherent.\"","summary":"With Grok's new AI image generator, X users put Musk's \"freedom of speech\" to the test.","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/","image":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump_catgirls_1-760x380.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-14 22:22:14","author":"Benj Edwards","authors":["Benj Edwards"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":254136752,"title":"Max inclusivity: Harris campaign is letting new hires ID themselves with custom pronouns","text":"The Harris campaign appears to be offering maximum inclusivity with unlimited preferred pronoun options for potential new hires to choose from when filling out their applications. Immediately after supplying one’s full name and resume, Harris for President job applicants are given a menu of \"pronouns\" to choose from, including identifiers such as \"Fae/faer,\" \"Hu/hu,\" \"Ey/em,\" and \"Xe/xem,\" among others. If, for some reason, none of the nine recommended pronouns the Harris campaign lists work for an applicant, they can check a box that reads \"Custom\" and enter in whatever pronouns they want. In addition to its unlimited array of pronoun options, the Harris campaign’s job applications also ask potential new hires to explain how they will \"contribute to building a diverse culture\" if they are hired. Meanwhile, the applications include a so-called \"optional\" diversity survey, which the campaign says helps them \"evaluate our diversity and inclusion efforts.\" The survey asks applicants to once again identify their preferred pronouns, as well as their gender identity and whether they are gay or straight. JESSE WATTERS: TRUMP'S RUNNING AGAINST A WOKE WOMAN AND A PROGRESSIVE VP Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment but did not receive a response. Earlier this month, a resurfaced clip of Vice President Kamala Harris from 2017 showed the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee calling on \"everybody\" to be \"woke.\" \"We have to stay woke. Like everybody needs to be woke,\" then-senator Harris said during a 2017 conference. \"And you can talk about if you’re the wokest or woker, but just stay more woke than less woke.\" Harris also followed up the next day reiterating her comments in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating, \"We have to stay active. We have to stay woke.\" HARRIS SAYS ‘EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE WOKE’ IN UNEARTHED CLIP SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE ON SOCIAL MEDIA A few days prior to that clip surfacing, Harris also drew mockery from the internet when another clip resurfaced of Harris introducing herself with her name, pronouns and descriptions of her clothing to a group that was visually impaired. \"Good afternoon. I want to welcome these leaders for coming in to have this very important discussion about some of the most pressing issues of our time,\" a masked up Harris said at the roundtable event discussing the Supreme Court's Roe v Wade decision and its impact on people with disabilities. \"I am Kamala Harris, my pronouns are she and her. I am a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit.\" Other guests at the table followed suit with similar introductions. Harris officially took over the Democratic nomination for president on Aug. 5, after President Joe Biden bowed to intra-party pressure over his cognitive decline and announced he would not continue to seek reelection. Upon her entrance into the race, Harris was lauded in the media for her identity politics, including her position as a \"daughter of immigrants,\" \"the first female vice president in U.S. history,\" and \"the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While running the first time around in 2020 to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Harris purposely highlighted her female pronouns when talking about the presidency. She shared why in a 2019 article from Buzzfeed News. \"I’m articulating it more than I have before, but I've always been very aware that for these jobs, we're asking people to see what they’ve not seen before,\" Harris told Buzzfeed in response to questions about her choice of words. It's necessary, Harris continued, \"especially in light of the whole discussion about ‘electability,’ which drives me bananas. It’s important for people to understand that they have to really check how they're thinking about these things.

Crypto group’s campaign spending angers Republicans By Katherine Doyle JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. — A leading pro-cryptocurrency political group is dumping millions of dollars into high-profile Senate races in Arizona and Michigan to back Democrats against Donald Trump-endorsed candidates, angering top Republicans who viewed the industry as an ally, not an opponent. Fairshake PAC and its affiliated super PAC announced plans to spend $3 million backing both Ruben Gallego in Arizona and Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, two contests that will play a major role in determining which party wins control of the closely divided Senate this fall. The campaign comes as top Republicans have sought to broker closer ties to members of the crypto industry amid a hostile regulatory environment. Fairshake pointed to Slotkin’s and Gallego’s current A-ratings from Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit advocating for the crypto industry. While both Democrats have expressed skepticism of the industry in the past, they crossed party lines this year to support a major crypto bill. The group also plans to spend $12 million in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, chair of the powerful Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, who is viewed by industry advocates as a crypto skeptic. Still, the spending in favor of Democrats in other critical races has rubbed some in the GOP the wrong way. They warn that the group risks losing sway with Republicans after working to cultivate hard-won relationships and question the durability of Gallego’s and Slotkin’s crypto support. The spending was a hot topic of conversation as Republicans descended on Jackson Hole this week, alongside investor Marc Andreessen and representatives from Coinbase and other crypto groups, to attend consecutive retreats hosted by the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Andreessen and his business partner, Ben Horowitz, have endorsed Trump in the presidential race and criticized the Biden administration’s regulatory agenda. Together, Andreessen and Horowitz are among Fairshake’s most significant donors. “Republicans are WTF about what’s going on with Fairshake, and I think that’s a pretty bad omen for the industry, that people are walking around wondering why our main trade association is pointing its arsenal at our friends,” said one industry leader, who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “A lot of people are walking around the CLF conference astonished that this is the strategic chess move that the industry has made.” Read more from Katherine → Republicans are stuck with Trump’s obsessions By Chuck Todd Nearly a month into Vice President Kamala Harris’ serving as the Democrats’ new standard-bearer, the question of who has the weaker presidential nominee for down-ballot candidates is back up for debate. As of this writing, it’s now Republicans in battleground states and districts who are begging their nominee to change course. And so far, Trump isn’t listening. A good example of this gentle public nudging of Trump to change his approach comes from Vivek Ramaswamy, the former presidential candidate who has been making the media rounds calling for a more focused and even subdued Trump campaign. Here’s what he said recently on NPR: “Who’s going to secure the border? Who’s going to grow the economy? Who’s going to stay out of World War III? And, more intangibly ... who’s going to restore national pride in this country? I think Donald Trump has a strong case on all of those counts, and I think he and the Republican Party will be well-served to focus on the policy contrasts.” And yet, in just about every public forum Trump has been involved in since Harris’ ascension, he has been incapable of pivoting to a message that’s anywhere close to the advice from Ramaswamy. This wouldn’t be hard for a normal candidate. And yet for Trump, it has been quite hard. In talking with folks who know him well, it’s clear he can’t get over losing to Joe Biden in 2020. His only personal hope of moving past the Biden defeat in 2020 was to defeat him in 2024. Now, Biden has denied him that opportunity. He also doesn’t seem to respect Harris as an opponent, and voters are picking up on that. Disdain from one candidate can turn swing voters against that campaign and toward the target. The best example of that? Hillary Clinton, who clearly never viewed Trump as a worthy opponent in 2016. The “deplorables” comment only reinforced that view. Well, Trump is falling into the same trap. It’s possible the less respect he shows for Harris, the less scared the public will be to give her a chance. Read more from Chuck → That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.
