Gavin Newsom called for the remainder of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to be returned to state control Wednesday and highlighted the pervasive fear throughout communities in Southern California since the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nNewsom spoke to reporters at a church in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, where pastors confronted federal immigration agents as they detained a man in the parking lot last month.\n\n“This cruelty, it’s about terrorizing communities, it’s about appearing tough,” Newsom said.\n\nThe governor said that during his visits, his own security vehicles have been mistaken for federal immigration enforcement and put community members on edge.\n\nHe called for an immediate demobilization of the remaining 2,000 Guard troops so they can return to their work countering drug trafficking, providing border support, and assisting in wildfire forest management.\n\n Justice Department fires prosecutor on Epstein case, two people familiar with the matter tell AP \n\nThere was no specific reason given for her firing from the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, according to one of the people who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nHer termination comes shortly after she prosecuted Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The rapper was convicted of lesser prostitution-related offenses.\n\nThe Justice Department recently appeared to acknowledge the existence of an investigation into her father, former FBI director James Comey, though the basis for that inquiry is unclear. He was abruptly fired by Trump during his first administration in 2017.\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker contributed.\n\n Make American Coke Great Again? \n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion — though the company didn’t confirm such a move.\n\n“This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!” Trump wrote on his social media site.\n\nA spokesperson for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said in a statement that the company appreciated Trump’s enthusiasm and promised that more details on new offerings within its products would be shared soon. Coca-Cola didn’t elaborate further.\n\nAny switch from high-fructose corn syrup in Coke sold in the U.S. would put Coca-Cola more in line with its practice in other countries, including Mexico and Australia.\n\nReturning to sugar in U.S. production might affect the nation’s corn farmers, whose yields are used in artificial sweeteners.\n\n▶ Read more about the potential of cane sugar being used in U.S. Coke production\n\n Trump tries to blame others as tensions rise around handling of Epstein case \n\nOn Tuesday, he accused former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as former FBI Director James Comey, of making up the much-hyped unreleased records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case.\n\nTrump presented no evidence in claiming that Democrats and Comey tampered with documents related to Epstein’s case.\n\nComey was fired in 2017, two years before Epstein’s arrest, and Obama was long gone from the White House by the time of Epstein’s death.\n\nDuring Biden’s presidency, the Justice Department put on trial an Epstein co-conspirator, but there is no indication that he or anyone from the White House had anything to do with that case.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s claims against former government officials\n\n First your shoes and now your shampoo? \n\nMore changes may be afoot for airline travelers going through TSA checkpoints.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted there could be changes to the current 3.4-ounce (100 milliliters) liquid limit for carry-ons.\n\nNoem says she is questioning the liquids limit.\n\n“So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,” she told a conference on Wednesday hosted by “The Hill.”\n\nThis follows her recent announcement that travelers will be allowed to keep their shoes on during airport screenings.\n\nThe liquid limits were introduced after a 2006 plot involving liquid explosives was foiled.\n\n▶ Read more on Noem’s plan.\n\n Trump says his fentanyl bill is a ‘blow’ to drug cartels \n\nTrump said the bill will toughen prison sentences by permanently reclassifying illegal, fentanyl-related drugs as Schedule 1 narcotics.\n\n“We’ll be getting the drug dealers, pushers and peddlers off our streets,” Trump said before signing the bill into law Wednesday.\n\nFentanyl is a highly potent opioid drug that doctors sometimes prescribe for severe pain.\n\nBut illegal forms of the drug, often fabricated in China, have been driving U.S. overdose deaths for years. Illicit producers have developed an array of tweaked versions of the drug to get around U.S. regulations.\n\nThe new bill automatically places all fentanyl-related copycat drugs into the government’s most highly restrictive category of banned substances, which also includes heroin.\n\nThe legislation does not affect fentanyl when used for medical purposes.\n\nSeveral people spoke about losing their loved ones, including children, to fentanyl overdoses.\n\n Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleads with Trump to take action on Epstein files \n\nTrump’s first-term national security adviser isn’t satisfied with the president’s actions on Epstein, and he’s making it known.\n\nIn a post on X, Flynn said records of the late New York financier’s sex-trafficking investigation are not a “hoax,” as Trump has called them.\n\nHe urged Trump to reestablish trust between the government and the people by holding accountable anyone involved in Epstein’s abuse of children.\n\n“With my strongest recommendation, please gather your team and figure out a way to move past this,” Flynn wrote. “The roll out of this was terrible, no way around that. Americans want America to be successful, therefore, WE NEED YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL.”\n\n House Speaker Mike Johnson insists he and Trump see eye-to-eye on Epstein \n\nJohnson is emphatically denying that his views differ from the president’s on whether records related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation should be made public.\n\nHe told reporters he has been “misquoted and misrepresented” as he attempted to bring together a coalition that has been roiled by the administration’s handling of the issue.\n\nJohnson said on a podcast Tuesday that on the Epstein files, the Trump administration “should put everything out there and let the people decide.”\n\nThe House Speaker was more specific Wednesday, saying he agrees with the president that all of the “credible” information should be released.\n\nTrump has been trying to get supporters to move on from Epstein. He told reporters Tuesday that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible,” but followed that with suggestions that the documents had credibility issues and were “made up” by Democrats in past administrations.\n\nOn Wednesday, he reiterated those claims and lambasted what he called the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.” He also lashed out at his own base, saying he no longer wanted the support of people who are still talking about Epstein.\n\n A federal judge in Tennessee may rule on whether to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from jail \n\nLawyers for the Justice Department have said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will detain Abrego Garcia if he’s freed.\n\nThe Salvadoran national is awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. The judge could rule in his case on Wednesday.\n\nICE officials have said they will initiate deportation proceedings against Abrego Garcia if he is released, and may even send him to a third country such as Mexico or South Sudan.\n\nAbrego Garcia became a flashpoint over Trump’s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. That expulsion violated a U.S. immigration judge’s 2019 order that shields Abrego Garcia from deportation because he likely faces threats of gang violence in El Salvador.\n\n Justice Department alumni urge lawmakers to reject Trump’s judicial pick \n\nIn a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than 900 former Justice Department lawyers raised concerns about elevating Emil Bove, a top department official, to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThey cited Bove’s role in the dismissal of New York Mayor Eric Adams’ case, and the claims of a whistleblower who says Bove suggested the department might have to flout court orders.\n\n“It is intolerable to us that anyone who disgraces the Justice Department would be promoted to one of the highest courts in the land, as it should be intolerable to anyone committed to maintaining our ordered system of justice,” they wrote.\n\nThe committee is expected to vote Thursday on Bove’s nomination.\n\nBove, who also defended Trump in his criminal cases, has denied the whistleblower’s claims. He told lawmakers at his confirmation hearing: “I am someone who tries to stand up for what I believe is right.”\n\n Vance wraps Pennsylvania speech \n\nThe vice president urged those in the crowd to, “Talk about what the bill does for American citizens,” ahead of the next year’s midterm elections.\n\nVance also called the vice presidency a “fun job” and said it was the honor of his life.\n\n Vance rails against ‘elites in Washington’ promoting four-year college \n\nThe vice president says the Trump administration is pushing for Americans coming out of high school to be able to “chart your own course in your own career path.”\n\n“Why is it that we force every single young person to get a big chunk of debt at a four-year college or university. Why don’t we give our young people more options?” Vance asked.\n\nHe added, “We think it’s fine, if you want to go to college, go to college.”\n\nBut he continued: “If you want to work with your hands, if you want to build a house, build a bridge” then “your government should not be forcing you to do what elites in Washington want you to do.”\n\nVance himself graduated from Ohio State University and Yale Law School.\n\n Vance touts Trump’s budget bill in Pennsylvania \n\nVice President JD Vance is speaking in Pennsylvania, working to sell Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package in a blue-collar district that could see a ferocious congressional campaign next year.\n\nVance addressed the crowd at Don’s Machine Shop in West Pittston saying: “While you guys thrived with bad policy coming from Washington, D.C., I think that you’re going to take off into a rocket ship with good policy coming from Washington, D.C., under Donald J. Trump’s leadership.”\n\nHe highlighted how the measure cuts taxes, including federal levies owed on overtime pay.\n\nThe vice president also said the measure cuts taxes for companies creating jobs in the U.S. and pledged that the Trump administration would keep fighting for people who “want to work with your hands.”\n\n The Pentagon offers a peek at the future of drone warfare \n\nThe Pentagon is showcasing the next generation of autonomous military equipment with a demonstration of aerial, undersea and terrestrial drone technology.\n\nThe Department of Defense displayed more than a dozen prototypes Wednesday during an exhibition in the Pentagon’s central plaza. The event was designed to highlight emerging technologies that military leaders hope will soon be available on the battlefield.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth toured the exhibition and spoke about the need to incentivize more partnerships between the military and private tech companies.\n\n“On drones — large, small, all classes — we need to be world class,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe equipment included several unmanned aircraft designed to execute offensive and defensive missions. There were also unmanned water vessels and an autonomous submersible that generates power from temperature fluctuations in the ocean.\n\nOther high-tech devices included weapons stations that can fire bullets or rockets.\n\nThe exhibition comes as Trump has issued new rules intended to spur innovations in drone development in the U.S.\n\n Trump waves a ‘prop’ letter about firing the Fed chair while meeting lawmakers \n\nThe president waved it during a discussion with lawmakers Tuesday night about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, but it was essentially a prop drafted by someone else.\n\nTrump hasn’t drafted an actual letter firing Powell, according to a person familiar who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting.\n\nThe president has called for Powell’s resignation and indicated that a renovation of Fed buildings could be grounds for dismissing the leader of the U.S. central bank.\n\nBut no final decision has been made by Trump on whether he will try to dismiss Powell, or wait out the Fed chair whose term expires in Mary 2026.\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that it’s “highly unlikely” he will fire Powell.\n\n— By Josh Boak\n\n Speaker Mike Johnson says a new Fed chair would be ‘helpful’ \n\nJohnson stopped short of calling for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to be fired, saying he wasn’t certain about the “executive authority” involved.\n\nBut he did say “new leadership would be helpful at the Fed.”\n\n“I’ve been unhappy with the leadership there personally,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday when asked whether Trump should remove Powell.\n\n Tempers flare as State Department defends mass layoff in congressional committee \n\nDisagreements erupted into a shouting match during a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, when a Democratic lawmaker accused a top department official of lying about the extent of staff reductions.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State for Management Michael Rigas testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday about the firing of more than 1,300 civil servants and foreign service officers last week.\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey was visibly angry as he confronted Rigas with a list of what Booker said were misstatements, half-truths or lies.\n\n“I don’t trust you, Mr. Rigas,” Booker said. “Your statements lack veracity.”\n\n“This is outrageous,” Rigas replied as he sought to respond despite multiple interruptions from Booker.\n\nBooker’s list resembled one compiled by former State Department officials that identified certain eliminated positions that Rigas said had been largely spared from the so-called “reduction in force.” Those include employees in the bureaus of intelligence and research, consular affairs, diplomatic security, energy and international organizations.\n\n“Sir, you have not been truthful,” Booker said. “I have watched you lie to this committee I have watched you lie to the House committee.”\n\n Former Jill Biden aide declines to answer questions about former president's age during House Republican inquiry \n\nAnthony Bernal, Jill Biden’s former chief of staff, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\n“Well, unfortunately, that was short,” said Congressman James Comer, the committee’s chair.\n\nComer promised to continue the investigation and did not rule out subpoenaing former Vice President Kamala Harris or members of President Joe Biden’s family.\n\nOversight Republicans claim, without evidence, that Biden was mentally incapacitated during his term and that his use of the presidential autopen while in office was illegal.\n\n“This is corruption at the highest level,” said Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican running for governor of his state.\n\nDemocrats have dismissed the investigation as a sideshow.\n\n“They still look like losers,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat who sat in on Bernal’s deposition.\n\n US companies doing business in China hope for a leader-level summit \n\nA meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could lower tensions in bilateral relations, according to Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n“The business community is very supportive of the idea of a meeting between the two presidents,” Stein said Wednesday.\n\nIn its annual survey released Wednesday, a record high number of council members said they had no new plans to invest in China this year. The survey also found a record-high number of companies indicated they may relocate business operations outside China.\n\nThe survey identified the U.S.-China relationship and tariffs as the top concerns for U.S. businesses operating in China.\n\nStein said tariffs and export controls by China and the U.S. are presenting challenges.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month said odds are high for the two leaders to meet this year but that there’s no firm plan.\n\n Trump defends Bondi, says she’s ‘done very good’ on the Epstein case \n\nThe president complained that Attorney General Pam Bondi has been “waylaid” over her handling of the case, but that he thinks “she’s doing a great job.”\n\nBondi has given out “credible information” about Epstein “and if she finds any more credible information she’ll give that, too,” he said.” What more can she do than that?”\n\nTrump said Bondi has “bigger problems” to work on and cited the administration’s work to remove criminals who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\n▶ Read more on the Epstein case\n\n Trump continues criticizing his supporters over Epstein conspiracy theories \n\nAlthough parts of the president’s base have clamored for more information about the Jeffrey Epstein case, Trump has made it clear that he’s done with the story.\n\n“It’s all been a big hoax,” he said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. “It’s perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.”\n\nTrump echoed a social media post earlier in the day, when he said talking about the case distracts from his accomplishments.\n\n Trump opens his meeting with flattery \n\nSitting with the crown prince of Bahrain, he described the Gulf nation as a “fantastic ally.” He said they would discuss trade and other topics.\n\nThe prince said they would announce $17 billion of investments in the United States, which “builds upon a legacy that we’re very proud of.”\n\n Trump only wants a Federal Reserve chair who would cut interest rates \n\nThe president said Wednesday that he wants to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with someone who would cut interest rates, setting one of the criteria for candidates seeking to lead the U.S. central bank.\n\n“I’m only interested in low interest people,” Trump told reporters.\n\nThe White House is pressuring Powell over the cost of renovating Fed buildings, but Trump has been outspoken in attacking Powell for declining to the Fed’s benchmark interest rate until the inflationary impact of the president’s tariffs is reflected in the data.\n\nTrump insists that inflation is low and has suggested anyone with a brain could be the Fed chair.\n\n“It’s not a tough job, to be honest, assuming you’re smart,” he said. “It might be one of the easiest jobs I’ve ever seen.”\n\n Trump floats Powell dismissal in meeting with lawmakers \n\nThe president indicated in a private meeting late Tuesday that he is leaning in favor of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nThe comments came in a meeting with House Republicans in the Oval Office, according to a White House official.\n\nDuring the meeting, which was scheduled on a separate matter, Trump asked lawmakers how they feel about Powell, and they expressed support for dismissing him, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss a private conversation.\n\nIn response, the president communicated that he was leaning in that direction, according to the official.\n\n— By Seung Min Kim\n\n Bahrain’s crown prince arrives at the White House \n\nTrump met his guest at the door to the West Wing. He did not answer questions about the potential for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n Maine clinics sue over Medicaid defunding \n\nOne piece of the big budget and policy measure Trump signed this month sought to cut off Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood affiliates.\n\nBut the nation’s biggest abortion provider isn’t the only organization hit by the cuts.\n\nMaine Family Planning sued Wednesday seeking to have reimbursements for its clinics restored. The group says it can be hard for many people in rural Maine to access health care without it.\n\nMedicaid is already barred under federal law from covering most abortions. This defunding measure impacts other services – including contraception, cancer screenings and primary care – offered by certain abortion providers.\n\nA judge has already restored Planned Parenthood’s reimbursements for now.\n\n▶ Read more about the Maine clinics’ lawsuit\n\n Trump slams his own supporters as he tries to move past Epstein ‘SCAM’ \n\nTrump faces mounting criticism from his political base over the Justice Department’s failure to release much-hyped records in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking investigation.\n\n“Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bulls---,’ hook, line, and sinker,” he wrote on his Truth Social site Wednesday morning.\n\nHe goes on to say: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s Epstein crisis\n\n Rubio says US ‘very concerned’ by surge in Israel-Syria violence, seeking a restoration of ceasefire \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters he had just been on the phone with “relevant parties” and hoped to have an update later Wednesday.\n\n“We want the fighting to stop because we had a ceasefire,” he said. “Overnight it broke down, so we’re talking with both sides, all the relevant sides, and hopefully we can bring it to a conclusion.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Israeli military launched are airstrikes in the heart of Damascus, hitting the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters and near the presidential palace in the hills outside the capital.\n\nClashes have raged for days in the southern Syrian city of Sweida between government forces and Druze armed groups, and Israel has launched dozens of strikes targeting government troops and convoys. Israel says the strikes are in support of the religious minority group, and has vowed to escalate its involvement.\n\n▶ Read more about the fighting in Syria\n\n Trump to sign Louisiana senator’s fentanyl bill into law \n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., asks a question during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing, Wednesday, June 18, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy’s office says he has been pushing the HALT Fentanyl Act since 2021.\n\nThe bill would make permanent a 2018 emergency rule that classifies the synthetic opioid and its knockoffs as Schedule I controlled substances. That change would result in harsher sentences for possession of the drug.\n\nThe White House has a bill-signing ceremony scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.\n\n US and Bahrain pave the way for a civilian-nuclear cooperation deal \n\nThe U.S. and Bahrain signed the agreement as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to enhance global energy security.\n\nThe deal will open up negotiations on what is known as a “123 agreement.” It will allow U.S. and American companies to invest in and construct nuclear energy projects in Bahrain, an island nation off the coast of Saudi Arabia with a population of around 1.5 million people.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani signed the memorandum of understanding on Wednesday, after Rubio signed a similar agreement with Malaysia last week.\n\n“The United States is prepared to be partner with any nation on Earth that wants to pursue a civil nuclear program that clearly is not geared towards weapons and or threatening the security of their neighbors,” Rubio said.\n\n Huckabee makes surprise visit to Netanyahu’s trial \n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee’s visit to the courthouse was a rare act of involvement in his host country’s internal affairs. It comes after Trump condemned the trial as a “witch hunt.”\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.\n\nHuckabee said Wednesday’s appearance was a matter of “representing what the president has said repeatedly.”\n\n“The president has made his position very clear,” Huckabee said ahead of his visit to the courthouse in Tel Aviv. “It’s a personal thing for him. He considers the prime minister a friend.”\n\nAfter the visit, Huckabee reposted Trump’s call for the trial to be thrown out and added the comment: “My conclusion? Trump is right…again.”\n\n▶ Read more about Trump and Netanyahu’s relationship\n\n A look inside a lab making the advanced fuel to power growing US nuclear energy ambitions \n\nNear signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they’re packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today’s power plants use.\n\nThe United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.\n\nPresident Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.\n\nBut just like cars won’t run without gas, those plants won’t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.\n\n▶ Read more about US nuclear energy ambitions\n\n Wholesale inflation can indicate where inflation might be headed \n\nEconomists also watch it because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.\n\nInflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.\n\nBut it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump’s trade policies. Trump has aggressively stepped up pressure on the Fed to cut rates, a move that threatens the central bank’s independence.\n\n US producer prices unchanged, with wholesale inflation remaining under control \n\nU.S. wholesale inflation cooled last month, despite worries that Trump’s tariffs would push prices higher for goods before they reach consumers.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it hits consumers — was unchanged last month from May and up 2.3% from a year earlier. Both measures came in below what economists had expected.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices were also unchanged from May and up 2.6% from June 2024.\n\nThe report on wholesale inflation came a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices last month rose 2.7% from June 2024, the biggest year-over-year gain since February, as Trump’s sweeping tariffs pushed up the cost of everything from groceries to appliances.\n\n Trump’s schedule, according to the White House \n\n1. 11 a.m. ET — Trump will greet and host a meeting with Bahrain’s Prime Minister and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa\n\n2. 3 p.m. — Trump will participate in a bill signing ceremony\n\n3. 7 p.m. — Trump will have dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani\n\n Some Republicans remain skeptical of the rescissions package \n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House.\n\n“Nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,” Collins said. “That isn’t because we haven’t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.”\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget acts as a nerve center for the White House, developing its budget, policy priorities and agency rulemaking.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn’t want the Senate to be going through numerous rounds of rescissions.\n\n“We are lawmakers. We should be legislating,” Murkowski said. “What we’re getting now is a direction from the White House and being told: ‘This is the priority and we want you to execute on it. We’ll be back with you with another round.’ I don’t accept that.”\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats in voting against the Senate taking up the measure, but the large majority of Republicans were supportive of Trump’s request.\n\n Trump administration says it is ending deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles \n\nChief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced the decision Tuesday in a statement.\n\nRoughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines had been deployed. It was not immediately clear how long the rest would stay. The troops were tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they carry out arrests.\n\nThe president ordered the deployment of about 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 active-duty Marines in early June to respond to protests against immigration raids in and around Los Angeles.\n\nTheir deployment went against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued to stop it.\n\nA district court judge initially said Trump acted illegally in deploying the Guard over Newsom’s opposition, but an appeals court said the administration could keep control of the troops. The case is ongoing.\n\nNewsom said the National Guard’s deployment to L.A. has pulled troops away from their families and civilian work “to serve as political pawns for the President in Los Angeles.”","summary":"The Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey and a prosecutor in the federal cases against Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jeffrey Epstein","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/james-comey-justice-department-jerome-powell-pam-bondi-gavin-newsom-b2790547.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/00/Trump_10977.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 23:51:27","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.469},{"id":342317076,"title":"RFK Jr. sparks 2028 speculation with major move that could put him on the outs with Trump","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to be making the first steps toward a 2028 presidential run. \n\nAxios reported Wednesday that Kennedy's super PAC hosted an online event last week, with two sources telling the publication that while another presidential bid wasn't openly discussed it felt like the current Health and Human Services secretary was testing the waters. \n\nThe call attracted hundreds of supporters and influencers that are part of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement. \n\nAmong them - comedian Russell Brand - who has attached himself to the MAHA movement after becoming sober.

Partners found that Kennedy's approval rating ran in the middle of the pack compared to other prominent political figures.\n\nTrump had higher favorables than Kennedy - with 26 percent holding a very favorable view of the president and 18 percent holding a somewhat favorable view. \n\nBut Trump's cumulative negative rating stood at 51 percent. \n\nWith Kennedy, 16 percent held a very favorable view of the HHS secretary while another 25 percent viewed him somewhat favorably.\n\nForty-six percent viewed Kennedy unfavorably, in a poll with a plus or minus 3.1 percent margin of error.","summary":"Robert F.

John Trump died in 1985. \n\nPresident Trump called the late Dr. Trump, a pioneer in cancer research who was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, a “smart man,” citing his multiple scientific degrees, and claimed that one of his students was Kaczynski, a mathematics professor who became widely known as the Unabomber when he was arrested in 1996 for a decades-long string of letter bomb attacks on figures in higher education and other industries. \n\n“Kaczynski was one of his students. Do you know who Kaczynski was? There's very little difference between a madman and a genius,” he said.\n\nTrump then claimed to have asked his uncle about the murderous ex-academic. \n\n“What kind of a student was he Uncle John? He said: “What kind of a student — seriously, good ... he’d go around correcting everybody. But it didn't work out too well for him. Didn't work out too well, but it's interesting in life,” Trump said. \n\nThe crowd did not show much of a reaction to the story, and it was unclear if the president was confusing Kaczynski, who died in a federal prison in 2023, with someone else. But it’s highly unlikely if not impossible that any of what he said about his uncle and the notorious murderer was true.\n\nNot only did Kaczynski — whose undergraduate degree was from Harvard and earned his Masters and Doctoral degrees in mathematics from the University of Michigan — never attend MIT, but even if the president’s uncle had crossed paths with the future terrorist, he could not have known that Kaczynski had been responsible for 16 bomb attacks between 1971 and 1995.\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley professor turned murderous recluse was one of the country’s most wanted fugitives until 1996, when his brother David Kaczynski, turned him in to the FBI after reading the now-infamous manifesto, Industrial Society and its Future, after The Washington Post published it at the recommendation of then-Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh.","summary":"Seeming gaffe comes a day after he fabricated a story about his uncle and Unabomber Ted

asked Trump about rumors of his pending firing of Powell while the president fielded media questions prior to a luncheon and meeting with the Bahrain Prime Minister and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa at the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\"He's always been too late, hence, his nickname 'Too Late,'\" Trump said of Powell.\n\n\"He should have cut interest rates a long time ago,\" Trump continued. \"Europe has cut them 10 times in the short time that we have cut none.\n\n\"The only time he cut them was just before the election to try and help Kamala [Harris], but, obviously, that didn't work,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He does a terrible job,\" Trump continued. \"He's costing us a lot of money, and we fight through it.\"\n\nHe said the nation's economy is strong enough that the Federal Reserve's lending rate of between 4.25% and 4.5% doesn't affect the nation.\n\nInstead, Trump said, it hurts those who want to buy a house by saddling them with a higher mortgage rate.\n\n\"He's a terrible Fed chair, Trump said. \"I'm surprised that [President Joe] Biden extended him, but they did.\"\n\n\"We're not planning on doing anything,\" Trump said, but \"we're very concerned.\"\n\nInstead of firing Powell, Trump said his administration can \"make a change in the next eight months or so.\"\n\nPowell initially became the Federal Reserve chairman in 2018 after Trump nominated him for the position during the president's first term.\n\nBiden nominated Powell for another four-year term, for which he was sworn in on May 23, 2022, and ends on May 15, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump has denied he is planning to fire Powell, unless evidence of fraud arises, CNBC reported on Wednesday.\n\nBut on Tuesday, he asked some House Republicans if he should fire Powell and was told he should, CNBC and The Hill reported.\n\nAn unnamed participant said Trump told the group he would fire Powell, media reported.\n\nTrump later denied he would fire Powell and said he has not drafted a letter to remove Powell from his chairmanship.\n\nTrump on Wednesday acknowledged he asked the group of House Republicans \"about the concept of firing\" Powell, CBS News reported.\n\nHe said it only would happen if there were some cause, such as possible fraud involved in a $2.5 billion improvement project for the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"He's already under investigation,\" Trump said of Powell. \"He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding.\"\n\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought last week accused Powell of undertaking a renovation project that has lasted for years that might run counter to federal law, CBS News reported.\n\nPowell in June told a Senate panel some of the criticisms of the renovation of the Federal Reserve's Washington, D.C., headquarters are \"misleading and inaccurate.\"\n\nTrump has criticized Powell for the Federal Reserve not lowering interest rates.\n\nPowell has cited Trump's often-changing tariff policies as the reason for not lowering the Federal Reserve's lending rate.\n\nPowell also has said he won't let politics influence the decisions of the independent Federal Reserve Board of Governors.","summary":"President Donald Trump said he won't fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell but will replace him within the next year when his

Virginia—Polls","text":"Former Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger held a double-digit lead against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears in the latest poll of the Virginia gubernatorial race released on Wednesday.Political scientist Larry Sabato told Newsweek the poll \"reinforces the widespread view that, for now at least, the Democrat is well ahead.\" Meanwhile, a Spanberger spokesperson told Newsweek it \"echoes what Abigail has been hearing from families across the Commonwealth.\"Newsweek reached out to the Earle-Sears campaign for comment via email.Why It MattersVirginia's gubernatorial race in November is a key test for both political parties this year. Once a battleground, Virginia has shifted toward Democrats over the past 20 years, though Republicans have proved competitive in the state's off-year gubernatorial races.The election pits Spanberger, a centrist Democrat who previously represented Virginia, against Winsome-Sears, the state's lieutenant governor, who was elected in 2021. Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, who narrowly won four years earlier, is ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.The race will be a crucial test for Democrats' messaging in the Trump 2.0 era—and a test of whether Republicans can maintain support from voters who shifted rightward in the 2024 election.What To KnowThe new Virginia Commonwealth University poll gives Spanberger an advantage over Earle-Sears, with 48 percent of respondents saying they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate and only 36 percent backing the Republican.The poll also found Democrats leading in other statewide races. Democrat Ghazala Hashmi leads Republican John Reid in the race for lieutenant governor by nine points (45 percent to 36 percent), while Democrat Jay Jones leads Republican incumbent Jason Miyares by nine points in the attorney general race (46 percent to 37 percent).The poll surveyed 809 adults, 764 of whom are registered to vote, from June 19, 2025, to July 3, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.16 percentage points.Other polls have similarly shown Spanberger with a lead. A HarrisX poll of 1,000 likely voters from May 9 to May 13, 2025, showed Spanberger up four points (52 percent to 48 percent). A Roanoke College poll of 658 Virginians from May 12 to May 19, 2025, showed her up 22 points (48 percent to 26 percent).Sabato told Newsweek that Spanberger has led every public poll so far.\"This survey just reinforces the widespread view that, for now at least, the Democrat is well ahead,\" he said. \"Of course, voting doesn't start until the end of September, and most votes are cast in the last two weeks and on Election Day.\"A key dynamic of the race is Trump's \"deep unpopularity in Virginia\" versus Youngkin's \"relative though not overwhelming popularity,\" Sabato said.Virginia, home to many federal workers, is a state that has been hit especially hard by Trump's cuts to the federal workforce.Last November, then-Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by less than six points, down from former President Joe Biden's 10-point margin of victory in 2020.Historically, the party out of the White House performs well in the Virginia gubernatorial race. That was the case four years ago, when Youngkin defeated former Governor Terry McAuliffe by fewer than two percentage points.What People Are SayingA Spanberger campaign spokesperson told Newsweek: \"This poll echoes what Abigail has been hearing from families across the Commonwealth — that the high cost of living continues to be top of mind for Virginians. During this moment of uncertainty, Virginians deserve a Governor who is laser-focused on making life more affordable.\"That's why Abigail rolled out her Affordable Virginia Plan to lower costs for Virginia families across the board — including healthcare, energy, and housing costs. As the next Governor of Virginia, Abigail will work tirelessly to make sure every Virginian can afford to call the Commonwealth their home.\"Former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, wrote in the polling report: \"Virginia voters are not buying political spin. They want action on the issues that hit hardest: the rising costs of living, threats to women's rights and immigration policies. The shift from education to economic and personal freedoms shows an engaged electorate.\"Dr. Harry Wilson, interim director for Roanoke College's Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, wrote in a May poll write-up: \"Six months in a gubernatorial election season is an eternity in politics, but one would prefer to be ahead by 17 points. More than a quarter of Virginians are undecided, and there is good news for both candidates.\"Spanberger is obviously leading at this point, and she leads among independents, but a large number of Republicans are undecided, and they will most likely end up voting for Earle-Sears. The favorable rating for Earle-Sears, however, should be cause for concern.\"What Happens NextThe Virginia gubernatorial election is on November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report currently classifies the race as Lean Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive races, but one party has an advantage.\"","summary":"A new poll showed Spanberger with a double-digit lead in the Virginia gubernatorial race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-chances-governor-virginia-polls-winsome-earle-sears-2099914","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2684661/abigail-spanberger-poll-virginia-governor-race.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e9b6f931a1f60841a7a10ed474a980a7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 20:36:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":342303904,"title":"Jill Biden aide refuses to answer questions on former president’s decline","text":"A former senior aide of Jill Biden has declined to answer questions on her husband’s mental state while he was in office.\n\nAnthony Bernal, who served as chief of staff to the former first lady, pleaded the fifth amendment when questioned by House Republicans on Wednesday.\n\nMr Bernal was subpoenaed for his testimony by the House oversight committee as part of an investigation into Joe Biden’s mental decline.\n\n“Well, unfortunately, that was quick,” said James Comer, chairman of the House oversight committee, when Mr Bernal invoked the amendment, which prevents people from being forced to testify against themselves.\n\nMr Comer, a Kentucky representative, added: “I believe the American people are concerned.

Kamala Harris became notorious for vehemently opposing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 ahead of her 2020 presidential run, and a woman who advised Harris during the Kavanaugh confirmation now serves in the Defense Department under President Trump.\n\nSamantha Goldstein, who gave more than $19,000 to Democrats in the past three years and called Trump “unfit to hold office,” nonetheless works as an associate deputy general counsel in the DOD under him. She previously served as a special counsel for Harris in 2018.\n\nAccording to one national security source with a history in the Pentagon, Goldstein joined then-Sen. Harris’ staff in 2018 to advise the senator on the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nO’Melveny & Myers, one of Goldstein’s previous employers, says in a staff profile page archived from 2020 that Goldstein indeed participated in the Kavanaugh confirmation under Harris.\n\n“In 2018, Samantha served as special counsel to U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris,” the profile read. “In that position, Samantha was part of the small team that helped prepare the senator for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearings on a U.S. Supreme Court nomination.”\n\nHarris’ Record on Kavanaugh\n\nCritics like Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino described Harris as “a ringleader” in the Kavanaugh hearing “circus.”\n\nSeverino noted that Harris “blanketed Facebook with thousands of ads fundraising off the Kavanaugh nomination, surpassing every other senator,” apparently “looking ahead to a presidential run.”\n\nKavanaugh faced multiple sexual assault accusations from named and unnamed accusers, none of whom presented evidence corroborating their claims.\n\nAn anonymous accuser sent a letter to Harris’ office, claiming that Kavanaugh and a friend “took 2 turns raping me” in the backseat of a car. Harris’ office forwarded the letter to the full Senate committee. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the claim, calling the accusation a “crock, farce, wrong, didn’t happen, not anything close.”\n\nThe woman who identified herself as the letter’s author later admitted she “only claimed authorship ‘as a way to grab attention.'”\n\nPolitiFact faulted Harris for falsely claiming that Kavanaugh had referred to popular contraceptive methods as “abortion-inducing.” Harris’ video clip falsely attributed to Kavanaugh a position taken by Priests for Life. \n\nIn a particularly notorious exchange, Harris asked Kavanaugh whether he had discussed the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller (into allegations of Trump-Russia collusion) with anyone at a specific law firm.\n\nHarris acted as though she had evidence of Kavanaugh speaking with a specific person, but she declined to name anyone.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, raised an objection, noting that “this town is full of law firms.”\n\n“There is no possible way we can expect this witness to know who populates an entire firm,” he added.\n\nThis Russiagate question may have originated with Goldstein.\n\nA few months after the hearings, when Goldstein had left Harris’ office and returned to O’Melveny, she co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed mentioning the Mueller probe and insisting that Trump is “unfit to hold office.”\n\nGoldstein wrote that the Mueller report “demonstrates that the president and his closest aides violated … fundamental duties imposed by their oaths of office,” namely the duty to protect and defend the Constitution “against all enemies foreign and domestic.”\n\nGoldstein did not respond to The Daily Signal‘s request for comment about why she serves at DOD if she thinks Trump is unfit to hold office.\n\nGoldstein entered the Justice Department in 2021. She became deputy legal advisor on Biden’s National Security Council in July 2024, and joined the Defense Department in February.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission records, she gave $6,600 to Harris’ campaign in 2024 and another $5,000 to the Harris Victory Fund. She also gave $5,800 to the campaign and victory fund of Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., in 2022.\n\nFactoring in the $1,700 she sent to the Democratic National Committee in 2024, Goldstein gave $19,100 to Democrats in the past three years.\n\nWhile federal employees may contribute to whichever political campaigns they support, Goldstein’s contributions seem to reveal opposition to the president she serves.\n\nSome bureaucrats may seek to remain in the federal government to undermine Trump’s presidency from within, though there is no evidence Goldstein is doing this.\n\nAn April poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to O’Melveny & Myers, the Defense Department, and the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats for comment, but did not receive responses.\n\nThis is the latest in a series on bureaucrats burrowing in. Part one covers eight appointees. Part two focuses on a former Russiagate advisor who works at the Federal Aviation Administration. Part three reveals a former lawyer for then-Sen.

A representative for Ellison did not immediately return a message for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIt would be easier to get rid of Stewart, since he works one night a week at a network that no longer produces much original content. Colbert is the ratings leader in late-night broadcast television, however, and is a relentless Trump critic.\n\nThe antipathy is mutual.

Together with ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, all three nominees are tough on Trump.\n\nCBS News journalists have largely been quiet publicly since the settlement’s announcement. Two top executives, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, both quit or were forced out prior to the settlement for making their dissatisfaction about the idea known internally.\n\nReporting about the settlement on the day it was announced, “CBS Evening News” anchor John Dickerson said viewers would have to decide on their own what it meant to them.\n\n“Can you hold power to account after paying it millions?” Dickerson asked. “Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\nHe said the technical name in legal circles for the deal was “big fat bribe.”\n\nJon Stewart terms it ‘shameful’\n\nStewart began discussing the “shameful settlement” on his show a week earlier when he was “interrupted” by a fake Arby’s ad on the screen. “That’s why it was so wrong,” he said upon his “return.”\n\nHe discussed the deal in greater detail with the show’s guest, retired “60 Minutes” correspondent Steve Kroft, making his views clear through a series of leading questions.\n\n“I would assume internally, this is devastating to the people who work in a place that pride themselves on contextual, good journalism?” Stewart asked.\n\n“Devastating is a good word,” Kroft replied.\n\nA handful of media reports in the past two weeks have speculated that Skydance boss David Ellison might try to curry favor with Trump by eliminating the comics’ jobs if the sale is approved. A representative for Ellison did not immediately return a message for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIt would be easier to get rid of Stewart, since he works one night a week at a network that no longer produces much original content. Colbert is the ratings leader in late-night broadcast television, however, and is a relentless Trump critic.\n\nThe antipathy is mutual. Trump called Colbert “a complete and total loser” in a Truth Social post last fall, suggesting CBS was wasting its money on him. “HE IS VERY BORING,” Trump wrote.\n\nColbert slips in a quip\n\nColbert alluded to reports about his job security in his monologue, pointing to the mustache he grew during his vacation. “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert, if they can’t find him?” he joked.\n\nColbert and Stewart both earned Emmy nominations this week for outstanding talk series. Together with ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, all three nominees are tough on Trump.\n\nCBS News journalists have largely been quiet publicly since the settlement’s announcement. Two top executives, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, both quit or were forced out prior to the settlement for making their dissatisfaction about the idea known internally.\n\nReporting about the settlement on the day it was announced, “CBS Evening News” anchor John Dickerson said viewers would have to decide on their own what it meant to them.\n\n“Can you hold power to account after paying it millions?” Dickerson asked. “Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

I think he does a terrible job. He's costing us a lot of money,” Trump said.\n\nBut the president noted that he isn’t planning to fire Powell, an affirmation that critics are sure to liken to another notion that has ruffled the president’s feathers of late, that “Trump always chickens out” after taking a hard stance on an issue, earning him the acronym, TACO.\n\n“No, we're not planning on doing anything,” he said. “So he's doing a lousy job. But no, I'm not talking about that. We get, fortunately, we get to make a change in the next, what, eight months or so, and we'll pick somebody that's good.” \n\nThe president’s denial appeared to be a reversal of his attitude compared to less than 24 hours before, when according to CBS News, he polled a group of Republican lawmakers on whether he should sack the central bank boss during a Tuesday night meeting in the Oval Office after the 12 House Republicans blocked a cryptocurrency bill favored by the president.\n\nThe New York Times reported separately that Trump had shown lawmakers a draft of a letter to Powell informing him that he’d been fired. \n\nOne of those lawmakers, Representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, took to X following the meeting to proclaim that Powell’s ouster was “imminent,” causing sell-offs in futures trading overnight. \n\nTrump confirmed the reporting on the meeting, telling reporters on Wednesday : \"I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are.”\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent and standing federal law, the chairman of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed \"for cause.\" \n\nSome of Trump’s allies in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been assailing Powell over a longstanding effort to renovate the Fed’s Washington, D.C. headquarters, accusing the central banker of unspecified fraud over the costly fix-up project.\n\nLast week, Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought sent and released publicly a letter to Powell in which he claimed that Trump was “extremely troubled” by what Vought called his “mismanagement of the Federal Reserve System.”\n\n“Instead of attempting to right the Fed’s fiscal ship, you have plowed ahead with an ostentatious overhaul of your Washington, D.C. headquarters,” he added. \n\nVought also suggested that Powell had misled Congress about the renovation project, writing that his testimony “raises serious questions about the project’s compliance with the National Capital Planning Act.”\n\nTrump alluded to the controversy even after he denied plans to fire Powell, telling reporters he wasn’t categorically ruling out sacking him. \n\n“I don’t rule out anything but I think it’s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud,” he said. \n\nThe president has continued to lash out at Powell, who he first named to his position during his first term, with epithets ranging from calling him “very stupid” to insulting him as a “low IQ” person and suggesting that the central banker “hates” him.","summary":"The president’s public about-face on firing Jerome Powell is sure to have critics call it another TACO, or ‘Trump Always Chickens Out,’ moment.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fed-chair-powell-firing-b2790306.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/16/17/16-d167eee938ed4e2f95298b0e11aaed45.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/saJhCZTT-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-16 18:10:31","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":342252576,"title":"Hunter Biden Directs His Most Intense Criticism Towards Kamala Harris to Date","text":"Former President Joe Biden’s close advisors are striving to clarify the events surrounding the 2024 Democratic setback that paved the way for President Donald Trump’s impressive triumph.\n\nBiden’s son, Hunter, has ended his silence following the election, criticizing the party for failing to support his father after his notably poor debate showing at the end of June.\n\n‘We lost the last election because we did not remain loyal to the leader of the party,’ Hunter Biden said. \n\n“That’s my stance. We enjoyed the benefits of incumbency and led a highly successful administration, yet the Democratic Party effectively collapsed,” he remarked.\n\nThe so-called party ‘meltdown’ led to his father ending his presidential campaign and passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the election to President Donald Trump. \n\nHarris, Hunter Biden implied, did not have the same draw with the American electorate as his father did. \n\nHunter Biden unleashed his criticism of Democrats in a new ‘At Our Table’ podcast hosted by Jaime Harrison, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which was shared with The Hill.\n\nHunter Biden also raged at the best-selling ‘Original Sin’ book authored by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that chronicled how Biden’s inner circle covered up the president’s mental and physical decline.\n\nThe book revealed that toward the end of his presidency, Biden struggled to remember the names of close donors, staff members and prominent Democratic figures. \n\nThe president’s son said the ‘idea of a conspiracy’ was made up to sell books.\n\nWashington, D.C., he argued, was a ‘fish bowl’ that would make it impossible to cover up health problems and that the ‘ability to keep a secret in Washington is zero.’\n\nHe questioned the book’s anonymous sources for misleading readers about his father’s competency.\n\n‘Every single day, hundreds of people,’ Hunter Biden said, ‘and you can’t get one of them to go on the record and say, ‘I saw the president do X.’\n\nHunter Biden’s comments emerge as the former president and his aides are stonewalling Republican investigations into Biden’s closest confidants. \n\nFormer First Lady Jill Biden’s longtime personal assistant Anthony Bernal pleaded the Fifth Amendment during testimony at a closed-door Congressional hearing on Tuesday after investigators asked him if he was ever ordered to lie about the president’s health.\n\nLast week, Biden’s personal physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor also pleaded the Fifth Amendment in response to questions. \n\nBiden’s inner circle of advisors are also scrambling to defend the use of the ‘autopen’ in the White House to sign a flood of pardons at the end of his presidency. \n\nThey put the president on the record in a rare interview with the New York Times to defend the pardons, as more questions are raised about their validity. \n\n‘I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,’ Biden told the Times. ‘Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.’\n\nTrump continues to raise questions about the use of the autopen, accusing Biden’s aides of using it without the president’s knowledge.\n\n‘The autopen, I think, is maybe one of the biggest scandals that we’ve had in 50 to 100 years. This is a tremendous scandal,’ Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday. ‘I guarantee you he knew nothing about what he was signing. I guarantee it.’\n\nThe New York Times reported that Biden White House emails from Jan. 19 show that it was Chief of Staff Jeff Zients who approved the last-minute pardons late before the last day of Biden’s presidency.\n\nBut Biden insisted he approved the last-minute controversial pardons that included Anthony Fauci, Gen. Mark Milley, and Reps. Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff, Adam Kinzinger on the January 6th investigation committee.\n\n‘Everybody knows how vindictive he is, so we knew that they’d do what they’re doing now,’ Biden said to the Times. ‘I consciously made all those decisions.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Joe Biden&#8217;s close advisors are striving to clarify the events&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hunter Biden Directs His Most Intense Criticism Towards Kamala Harris to Date first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hunter-biden-directs-his-most-intense-criticism-towards-kamala-harris-to-date/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hunter-Biden-takes-strongest-aim-at-Kamala-Harris-yet.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 17:07:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.037},{"id":342251874,"title":"Joe Biden Investigation: Second Person Pleads the Fifth to House Oversight","text":"A former top aide to Jill Biden invoked the Fifth Amendment on Wednesday, becoming the second individual to do so in House Republicans' investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental fitness and alleged use of an autopen for official documents.Anthony Bernal, Jill Biden's former chief of staff, declined to answer questions during a closed-door deposition with the House Oversight Committee, citing his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\"Well, unfortunately, that was quick,\" said Committee Chair Rep.

Bates scoring her 15th nod from the Television Academy wasn’t necessarily surprising, mind you. Her performance as Madeline “Matty” Matlock garnered strong reviews, as well as a shot at a Golden Globe in January. Her nomination also earned the 77-year-old actor a spot in the industry’s record books, making her the oldest best drama actress Emmy nominee.\n\nThe late Angela Lansbury, another revered CBS drama alumna, was the previous record holder. She earned her final nomination in 1996 at the age of 70. But then, Lansbury was a regular nominee thanks to her iconic portrayal of Jessica Fletcher on “Murder, She Wrote,” which tells you just how different the TV landscape was 30 years ago.\n\nIt would be three more years before a couple of American cable drama actors cracked the category in 1999, when Lorraine Bracco and Edie Falco scored nominations for their work on “The Sopranos.”\n\nFalco ended up winning that Emmy, five years before Academy voters gave “The Sopranos” and HBO their first best drama Emmy in 2004. Within 10 years, the prestige TV era had critics wondering whether cable would render broadcast primetime obsolete.\n\nTurns out that fear was a tad overstated, and more than a decade early. According to Nielsen’s monthly Gauge report, broadcast TV plummeted to 18.5% of overall viewing in June as streaming climbed to claim 46% of all total TV usage. This measure also marks the first time that broadcast TV’s audience share sank below 20%, a stat that begs for a pulse check.\n\nNevertheless, anyone who’s been watching streaming’s audience numbers creep upward may see that and shrug. Linear viewership has been steadily declining since Tony Soprano ruled television, with cable and broadcast usage dipping below 50% for the first time in July 2023. The true milestone hit in May of this year when the Gauge report indicated that streaming’s viewership surpassed broadcast (20.1%) and cable (24.1%) to claim 44.8% of that month’s audience.\n\nThat happened before Peacock’s “Love Island USA” became this summer’s social media sensation, to say nothing of the final season of “Squid Game” on Netflix (which failed to score in major categories).\n\nIn defense of those critics predicting broadcast’s demise, not even Netflix, Inc. could have predicted that streaming would conquer the small screen. Back then, CEO Reed Hastings was probably patting himself on the back for his role in murdering Blockbuster Video with his company’s innovative DVD rental-by-mail system.\n\nToday, all of Bates’ category competitors work for streaming services, including Keri Russell, of Netflix’s “The Diplomat,” “Severance” star Britt Lower and “Bad Sisters” lead Sharon Horgan, whose shows are on Apple TV+, and Bella Ramsey of “The Last of Us,” with episodes premiering on HBO and HBO Max at the same time.\n\n“Matlock” is the second highest-rated drama on CBS, which is the most-watched broadcast network, according to Nielsen. Yet Bates’ inclusion in this top category still counts as a minor miracle.\n\nThe last time a broadcast show scored a best drama actress nomination was 2019, when Viola Davis’ performance in ABC’s “How to Get Away with Murder” earned a nod along with Mandy Moore for NBC’s “This Is Us,” which was the last network drama to get a top drama Emmy nod in 2021.\n\n“This Is Us” star Sterling K. Brown scored a lead drama actor nomination in 2021, too. On Tuesday he showed up on the best drama actor list for his turn on Hulu’s “Paradise,” joining Noah Wyle (“The Pitt,” from HBO Max), Adam Scott (“Severance”), Gary Oldman (Apple TV+’s “Slow Horses”), and Pedro Pascal (“The Last of Us”).\n\n“Severance” scored 27 nominations for the 2025 Emmys, with HBO Max’s limited series “The Penguin” landing 24, including individual nods for stars Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti as well as a slot in the best limited or anthology series race. There, it will compete against FX on Hulu’s “Dying for Sex,” along with Netflix’s “Black Mirror,” “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” and “Adolescence,” which earned 13 nominations.\n\nApple TV+’s comedy “The Studio” earned 23 nominations, with Disney+’s “Star Wars” drama “Andor” landing 14, and FX on Hulu’s “The Bear” nabbing 13.\n\nEven so, HBO and HBO Max still claim leadership bragging rights courtesy of 142 Emmy nominations spread across 20 of its shows, led by 23 nods for “The White Lotus,” 16 for “The Last of Us,” 14 for “Hacks” and 13 for “The Pitt.” Netflix racked up 120 nominations overall, while ABC led the broadcasters’ haul with 38.\n\nNone of this is news by awards season standards. Cable started devouring broadcast TV’s Emmy nominations breakfasts from the mid-aughts onward, until Netflix and Amazon showed up in 2013’s races. In our current “post-peak, but still too much TV” era, it’s commonly accepted that broadcast is an award season afterthought, although critical stalwarts like “Abbott Elementary” continue to muscle their way into competitions.\n\nIndeed, broadcast comedies have consistently held at least one slot in the top Emmy categories in recent years; ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” and its star Quinta Brunson scored nods this year, with Brunson’s co-stars Janelle James and Sheryl Lee Ralph claiming best supporting actress nods.\n\nRounding out the list of Brunson’s competition in the best comedy actress category are Uzo Aduba for “The Residence” and Kristen Bell for “Nobody Wants This,” two more Netflix entries, along with Ayo Edebiri for “The Bear” and Jean Smart for “Hacks.”\n\n“Abbott,” meanwhile, is the sole broadcast TV comedy going up against “The Bear,” “Hacks,” “Nobody Wants This,” Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building,” Apple TV+’s “Shrinking” and “The Studio,” with FX’s “What We Do in the Shadows” repping basic cable. . . and streaming, since it also runs on Hulu.\n\nWhile “Love Island USA” superstars Huda Mustafa and Chris Seeley are dominating your coworkers’ break room conversations at the moment – if you know, you know – markedly fewer folks are yapping about the reality and game shows currently keeping the lights on at CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox. That may not rank highly on our list of pressing concerns at the moment, but it may be worth paying attention to as one indicator that our widening wealth gap is showing up on TV.\n\nAfter all, if streaming is where the audience is going, why continue to devote resources to broadcast? The eternal, rock-solid reason is that broadcast TV is still freely available to everyone, including viewers who can’t afford streaming subscriptions and/or live in areas lacking stable broadband access. It’s an especially vital resource for accessing news and information.\n\nIn rural areas lacking local stations with newsrooms — which describes around 34% of such communities, according to a 2024 local news survey conducted by Pew Research — broadcast news remains the primary TV source of news and information. And primetime ad revenue supports those newsrooms. As those audiences shrink, so do the dollars networks can command for ads, and the paychecks they can offer top talent. (For example, Lester Holt recently left his anchor chair at “NBC Nightly News” where he reportedly earned $10 million a year. His replacement, Tom Llamas, is estimated to earn around $2.5 million annually, according to The Ankler.)\n\nOn top of that are the political threats. While President Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States hasn’t significantly moved closer to reality since he tossed that grenade in May, he has threatened major broadcasters’ licenses.\n\nTrump sued ABC for defamation and CBS on even flimsier grounds concerning that network’s “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris before the 2024 election. ABC’s parent company, Disney, and CBS’ owner, Paramount Global, paid multimillion-dollar settlements to Trump instead of standing up for the First Amendment in court.\n\nParamount is believed to have done so to prevent the Federal Communications Commission’s chairman, Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, from stalling its pending merger with Skydance Media. Regardless, the FCC’s probes into right-wing-generated complaints against ABC, NBC and CBS are ongoing.\n\nFor those reasons and others, voices that are calling for the death of broadcast networks both from within the industry and on Capitol Hill will likely get louder.\n\nThere are always caveats to consider when it comes to the summertime ratings and the Emmys. Since the conventional broadcast season is over, there are no live sports telecasts to boost overall network numbers. When the NFL’s pre-season kicks in, the networks will recoup some of those losses. Sports’ perpetually robust viewership proves that conventional broadcast still dominates the live TV space, even now.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nRegarding the Emmys, creativity and originality always play a part in swaying voters, along with popular sentiment. The Wrap’s Steve Pond also notes that there were fewer overall submissions for the second year in a row, which meant less competition for major category nominees than usual, yet fewer inspiring surprises.\n\nHowever, our definition of good TV is always subjective. The most-watched broadcast TV show of the recently ended 2024-2025 season, according to Nielsen, is “Tracker,” which is highly entertaining, but not a significant source for divining meaning about America’s political and cultural health. Nor is it an unexpected interpretation of a vintage TV title anchored by a superb performance, a la “Matlock. Those are the details that sway Emmy voters.\n\nTuesday’s top drama list includes two series that straddle cable and streaming, HBO’s “The Last of Us” and “The White Lotus,” which drive conversations about our deteriorating humanity and rising classism.\n\n“Andor,” “Severance” and its fellow Apple TV+ drama “Slow Horses,” as well as Netflix’s “The Diplomat” and “Paradise” comment on our cultural politics and anxieties in their respective ways. So does “The Pitt,” which found its rhythm by replicating the tone and the release cadence of a superb if conventional network medical show.\n\nYet the best drama race doesn’t include any hour-long series currently airing on broadcast, including “Matlock.” All the more reason to root for Bates, one of the few contenders in this mix proving that worthy institutions earn their status by demonstrating their durability in rapidly changing times. We’d be foolish to count them out too soon.\n\nThe 77th Emmy Awards will air Sunday, Sept. 14 on CBS and stream on Paramount +.","summary":"Broadcast ratings hit record lows, but Kathy Bates' role in \"Matlock\" sends a signal in a sea of streamers","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/07/16/kathy-bates-matlock-emmys-nod-says-a-lot-about-the-state-of-tv/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/07/Matlock_0653bc-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 16:00:33","author":"Melanie McFarland","authors":["Melanie McFarland"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.251},{"id":342228736,"title":"Democrats to Introduce ‘Anti-Corruption’ Legislation for Presidential Library Donations in Wake of Paramount Settlement","text":"After previously warning she would introduce legislation to “rein in corruption through presidential library donations,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren is leading the charge with a group of Democrat lawmakers on the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act of 2025.\n\nThe bill, which is aimed at closing loopholes allowing for unchecked donations to presidential libraries, is co-sponsored by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).\n\n“Presidential libraries should be monuments to history, not backdoor vehicles for influence,” the group said in a brief outlining the legislation.\n\nA new analysis released by Warren found that companies have pledged to funnel at least $63 million into Trump’s future presidential library. \n\nAmong them are Paramount, which agreed to settle a lawsuit over its “60 Minutes” interview with former vice president Kamala Harris for $16 million, and Disney, which paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. \n\nWarren’s report also cites Meta, which paid $25 million – including a $22 million library donation per the Wall Street Journal – to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and X, which paid $10 million to settle a similar suit. \n\nWarren also called out other gifts and in-kind donations, including a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, expensive candlelight dinners at Mar-a-Lago, leftover inauguration donations, and more which she says brings the total value of gifts for Trump’s library to at least half a billion dollars. \n\nThough she acknowledged that past presidents have also accepted suspicion donations while in office, Warren argued Trump is “doing so at a magnitude that makes glaringly clear the need for common-sense guardrails around donations.” \n\nMore to come…","summary":"The move, led by Elizabeth Warren, comes after Disney and Paramount agreed to make donations to a future presidential library as part of lawsuit settlements with Donald Trump\n\n\nThe post Democrats to Introduce &#8216;Anti-Corruption&#8217; Legislation for Presidential Library Donations in Wake of Paramount Settlement appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/democrats-elizabeth-warren-anti-corruption-legislation-presidential-library-donations/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 15:53:47","author":"Lucas Manfredi,Senator Richard Blumenthal","authors":["Lucas Manfredi","Senator Richard Blumenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.175},{"id":342255150,"title":"Promises Made, Promises Kept: Egg Prices Fell 19.8% in June, Down 61% Since February","text":"The price of fresh eggs plunged in June, the third time in the past four months in which prices have declined by around 20 percent or more.\n\nThe Department of Labor said the index for fresh eggs fell 19.8 percent compared with the previous month. Prices fell by 21.3 percent in March and 39.3 percent in April. In May, they inched up 1.4 percent.\n\nBecause of the extreme price increases that mostly occured during the Biden administration, egg prices are still up year-over-year, Wednesday’s producer price index report showed.\n\nSince February, the price of eggs has fallen by 61.2 percent. By contrast, in the final months of Joe Biden’s presidency, the price of eggs rose by 227.1 percent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down prices, a promise that was widely attacked by liberal economists and legacy media outlets.\n\n“Grocery prices have skyrocketed. Cereals are up 26 percent, bread is up 24 percent, butter is up 37 percent, baby formula is up 30 percent, flour is up 38 percent, and eggs are up 46 percent,” he said in August. “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.”\n\nDuring the campaign, J.D. Vance focused on the skyrocketing prices of egg as a symbol of how inflation was squeezing American households during Biden administration.\n\n“Eggs, when Kamala Harris took office, were short of $1.50 a dozen. Now a dozen eggs will cost you around $4. Thanks to Kamala Harris’s inflationary policies, Pennsylvania actually has seen some of the worst grocery price increases of the entire nation, and again, it’s because she cast a deciding what vote on the inflation explosion act,” Vance said in a grocery store in Pennsylvania in September.\n\nIn January, just 11 days after Trump took office, a group of Democrat lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote a letter lambasting Trump for not having brought down the price of eggs.\n\n“We write to ask about your Administration’s plan to lower food prices for American families. Americans, in the first days of your new presidency, are facing egg shortages amidst an avian flu outbreak and still-high prices at the grocery store. During your campaign, you repeatedly promised you would lower food prices ‘immediately’ if elected president,” they wrote.\n\nNow it looks like Warren and company have egg on their faces.

So it’s very important to pay attention from the very beginning … [and] to mobilize.”\n\nHungary, a European Union and Nato member, is often cited as an example of a formerly liberal democracy devolving into a competitive autocracy. Orbán – who has trumpeted his belief in “illiberal democracy” – has cemented his power over the courts, the media and universities during 15 years in office and four consecutive election victories.\n\nAddressing a webinar organized by the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based thinktank, Cseh warned US voters against believing their country was immune to such developments.\n\n“I do believe that many Americans think this is something that also only happens to others, and I think that mindset has to be fought,” she said.\n\n“Start preparing for the midterms like yesterday. Go to every protest, go to every march, stand right beside everybody who is being attacked, no matter if it is a group you belong to, or something that you do not share personally. You have to stand side by side [with] each other and help and support those who might feel isolated and alone.”\n\nShe urged Democrats and activists to form a widely inclusive “movement” and find “candidates for the midterms or any election that is coming your way who can get people excited – not necessarily the same old faces they have been seeing all the time that they don’t really trust that much, but visionary leaders … who are part of a community, who are being persecuted.”\n\nLeaders such as Trump and Orbán could only be effectively opposed, she said, by ditching a “legalistic, technical, technocratic approach” in favor of “something for the electorate to be excited about”.\n\n“Autocrats are not always good in governing. So cost of living, crisis of healthcare, education – if the focus is shifted to these areas, and not only technical descriptions of what’s going on in the courts, this is something that people can relate to more.”\n\nThe parallels with Hungary came as opinion polls show Orbán on course to lose next year’s general election to the opposition Tisza party, led by Péter Magyar, a former member of the prime minister’s party.\n\nIn a striking sign of Orbán’s declining authority, his government’s attempt to ban last month’s annual Pride march in Budapest backfired when an estimated 100,000 people took to the streets in defiance. Previous such events have been attended by a few thousand LGBTQ+ activists.\n\nSzabolcs Panyi, a journalist with the Hungarian website Direkt36, said Trump’s approach to the media drew on a playbook used by Orbán, who deployed a range of measures to curtail journalists’ independence.\n\nThese included banishing established outlets from briefings in favor of friendly journalists and “propagandists”, an approach emulated by the White House, which has excluded journalists from the Associated Press and invited representatives from rightwing organizations and social media influencers.\n\n“What particularly rings out is how certain large media outlets or owners or large conglomerates try to appease Donald Trump by settling lawsuits or by firing journalists [or] editors,” he said. “It really resembles what happened in Hungary in the 2010s.”\n\nParamount Global, the owners of CBS, reached a $16m settlement with Trump this month after he lodged a $10bn suit over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, his 2024 Democratic presidential opponent. ABC agreed to pay Trump $15m last December after he sued over an inaccurate characterization of his conviction over sexual assault allegations brought by the writer E Jean Carroll.\n\nPanyi said Trump’s attempts to slash funding for public broadcasters such as PBS and Voice of America were also inspired by Orbán.\n\n“[Orbán] went after public radio, public TV, and in a matter of a couple of months, it was already transformed into propaganda,” he said. “It’s scary to see similar things happening in the United States. Solidarity is especially important, so whenever there are similar things happening, there should be protests. Journalists should support their colleagues and tell readers that if it happens to one outlet, it can happen to others as well.”\n\nCeylan Akçe, a member of Turkey’s pro-Kurdish People’s Equality and Democracy party, said more than two decades of rule under the country’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had demonstrated that political opponents should not “wait for the storm to pass”.\n\n“It’s going to continue to rain,” she said. “If you wait for it to stop, it won’t, and while you’re in the eye of the storm, you have to continue to mobilize and never be discouraged.”\n\nTamara Tripic, an opposition parliamentarian in Serbia, where Aleksandar Vučić, the president, is accused of instituting an autocracy that has provoked waves of opposition protests, warned that modern authoritarians camouflaged their actions behind a cloak of legality.\n\n“We have to be aware that they are using [tools that] are usually legal but misused, institutional but hollowed out, democratic in appearance but authoritarian in essence,” she said. “It doesn’t look like dictatorship, but it’s functioning like one. Our problem, especially if you are progressive, is that … usually people are afraid of the freedom we are offering. They are willing to trade some … freedom for the illusion of order, identity and security.”","summary":"Forum speakers said Donald Trump’s second term resembles strongman Viktor Orbán’s first years in power\n\nDemocrats must organize urgently for the 2026 midterm elections and avoid a “it can’t happen here” mentality to stop Donald Trump from staging a full-scale autocratic takeover, a Hungarian opposition parliamentarian has said.\n\nKatalin Cseh, a critic of Hungary’s strongman prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told a forum on authoritarianism that the central European country’s experience held vital lessons for Trump’s opponents in their attempts to resist his assaults on US institutions and democratic norms since his return to the White House.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/hungary-democrat-authoritarianism","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf9d50c019743898606c8e13180d062a93ffb77/252_2_4001_3202/master/4001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 15:23:44","author":"Robert Tait","authors":["Robert Tait"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":342212228,"title":"Hunter Biden takes strongest aim at Kamala Harris yet as inner circle brushes off Joe's competency 'cover-up'","text":"Former President Joe Biden's inner circle continues its efforts to set the record straight on the 2024 Democratic disaster that fueled President Donald Trump's smashing victory.\n\nBiden's son Hunter broke his post-election silence, angrily scolding the party for abandoning his father after his historically bad debate performance in late June. \n\n'We lost the last election because we did not remain loyal to the leader of the party,' Hunter Biden said. \n\n'That’s my position.

This is how I think I could pull it off.’ And then the American people are supposed to look at this person saying it and that person saying it and decide.”\n\nRogan continued: “But that’s not what we were getting.

We had the advantage of incumbency, we had the advantage of an incredibly successful administration, and the Democratic Party literally melted down,” he added in what appears to be his first public interview of the year.\n\nHarrison, who helmed the DNC from 2021 to 2025, is launching a new podcast, “At Our Table” on Thursday.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running-mate, will be among his podcast debut guests as well as Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), another close Biden ally, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\nThe younger Biden underscored that Democrats need to coalesce behind a leader and griped that because his father was sacked, the party will be mired by internal fighting for most of President Trump’s second term. \n\n“You know what, we are going to fight amongst ourselves for the next three years until there’s a nominee. And then with the nominee, we better as hell get behind that nominee,” he argued. \n\nHunter Biden also fended off speculation that he held a pronounced role in his father’s administration, telling the former DNC boss that he “stayed as far away as I possibly could — which, by the way, broke my heart.”\n\nHarrison, who was widely seen as a Biden loyalist, later signaled that he agreed with Hunter Biden’s assessment, telling Semafor that the outcome may have been different if Democrats had the loyalty that “Republicans have for Donald Trump.”\n\n“There are a lot of podcasts out there, but I don’t think any of the folks on our side have the relationships that I have,” Harrison told the outlet about his new podcast as he jumps into a crowded market. \n\nThe former first son has largely kept a low public profile and rarely sits down for interviews. Throughout his father’s presidency, his legal troubles and scandals loomed large. On his way out of the White House, former President Joe Biden gave his troubled son a sweeping pardon over an 11-year period.\n\nThat marked an about-face from the former president’s public claim that he wouldn’t give his son clemency.\n\nHunter Biden had been staring down the specter of jail time after being found guilty of all charges in the illegal possession of a firearm case against him and pleaded guilty to charges in another indictment for willful refusal to pay $1.4 million in taxes.\n\nHis father has similarly laid low since leaving the White House, though earlier this week, The New York Times published a rare interview with him in which he defended his use of autopen, insisting that he made all the clemency decisions despite aides admitting that he didn’t necessarily approve every single name.\n\nThe 46th president had been dogged by questions of his infirmity after his fumbling debate performance against President Trump in late June of last year. \n\nEventually, as an outpour of Democrats urged him to step aside, the former president did so, paving the way for former Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party’s standard bearer and lose to Trump.\n\nConcerns about the 46th president’s mental acuity were revived earlier this year following the release of “Original Sin,” by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. But Hunter Biden disputed the premise that there was a cover-up to conceal his father’s decline. \n\n“What sells, Jaime? What sells is the idea of a conspiracy,” the former first son told Harrison, contending that the “ability to keep a secret in Washington is zero.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden shocked the world earlier this year by revealing his prostate cancer diagnosis that had metastasized to his bones. \n\n“Every single day, hundreds of people,” the former first son continued. “And you can’t get one of them to go on the record and say, ‘I saw the president do X?’”","summary":"“We had the advantage of incumbency, we had the advantage of an incredibly successful administration, and the Democratic Party literally melted down,” the former first son said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/16/us-news/hunter-biden-blames-dems-disloyalty-to-his-father-for-their-defeat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108234524.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uLQx0amQ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-16 14:12:59","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":342179476,"title":"Beyoncé Charts An Unlikely Hit Alongside A Country Legend","text":"Beyoncé and Dolly Parton’s “Tyrant” debuts at No. 83 on the U.K. Official Singles chart and earns ...

Cowboy Carter was quite the artistic risk for the superstar, but it paid off. The album was well received by critics and many fans, performed well commercially, and even earned the singer the coveted Album of the Year Grammy — an honor she had been working toward for decades.\n\nWhile Cowboy Carter may feature Beyoncé’s signature take on the classic American genre, not every track on the project is categorized specifically as country. The powerhouse earns a new hit in the United Kingdom with one of the collaborations from the full-length… but it doesn't bring her to any country tally.\n\nDolly Parton Joins Beyoncé on the U.K. Charts\n\nDolly Parton is credited on two of the 27 songs featured on Cowboy Carter. One is essentially just a spoken word piece, while “Tyrant” sees the two musicians teaming up for a proper song. That track debuts on multiple tallies in the U.K. this week, after recently going viral as Beyoncé tours Cowboy Carter around the world.\n\n“Tyrant” launches on the Official Singles chart at No. 83. The tune also reaches the Official Hip-Hop and R&B Singles list, coming in at No. 17.\n\nBeyoncé Vs. Dolly Parton\n\nParton has only racked up 11 wins on the top list of the most consumed songs in the U.K., while “Tyrant” brings her to the Official Hip-Hop and R&B Singles tally for the first time.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nBeyoncé’s list of hit songs is significantly longer than Parton’s. She has accrued 74 solo smashes on the Official Singles chart — a number that doesn’t include her work with Destiny’s Child or The Carters. She has also snagged almost as many appearances on the list of the bestselling hip-hop and R&B tracks, as “Tyrant” marks her sixty-third career win.\n\n“Tyrant” Lands Ahead of “Crazy in Love”\n\nBeyoncé fills two spaces on the Official Hip-Hop and R&B Singles chart with tracks that couldn’t sound less like one another. “Crazy in Love,” often remembered as her breakout solo smash, lives on the list and even advances this frame. “Crazy in Love” sits one space behind “Tyrant,” placing one of her oldest cuts next to one of her newest.\n\nBeyoncé and Dolly Parton on the Country Charts\n\nInterestingly, both Beyoncé and Parton score hit albums on the country charts in the U.K., but not the same ones. Cowboy Carter rises to No. 8 on the Official Country Artists Albums list while dipping from No. 1 to No. 3 on the Official Americana ranking. Parton, meanwhile, claims four spaces on the Official Country Compilations tally, and her The Very Best Of project returns to the summit.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Beyoncé and Dolly Parton’s “Tyrant” debuts at No. 83 on the U.K. Official Singles chart and earns Parton her first placement on the Hip-Hop and R&amp;B ranking.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/07/16/beyonc-charts-an-unlikely-hit-alongside-a-country-legend/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67f7d14477ede58317ae01a9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 13:45:40","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Justin Sullivan,Senior Contributor","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Justin Sullivan","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.589},{"id":342186920,"title":"Higher education in trouble: Political repercussions","text":"This also confounds the optimistic projections of optimistic Democrats like pollster Stanley Greenberg that Democrats would benefit from an “ascendant majority” of groups — Hispanics, Millennials, college graduates — destined to be a growing share of the electorate. \n\nThe AP, Catalist, and Pew reports also take note of what is now old news: the sharp polarization of white college graduates and white non-graduates. That came as a surprise in 2016: there was so little difference between these groups in previous elections that most pollsters didn’t disaggregate results according to levels of education. \n\nNow the contrast is stark. AP’s Vote Cast showed Kamala Harris carrying white college grads 53-45 and Trump carrying non-college whites by a whopping 65-34. And while white college grads moved slightly toward Trump in 2024, the education gap hasn’t narrowed nearly as much as the racial/ethnic gap.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Hispanics and Millennial and Generation Z voters will be an increasing proportion of voters in coming years, and that their reduced or vanishing Democratic margins are bad news for that party. But will that be offset by continuing growth of white college grads casting relatively steady Democratic margins?\n\nDon’t count on it. Current trends suggest the population of college graduates may be starting to decline, after more or less constant growth since World War II, from 5% of the adult population in 1940 to 38% in 2022. \n\nNow the population of future college graduates looks set to decline. Births in the U.S. peaked in 2007 at 4.32 million (almost identical to the baby boom peak of 4.31 million in 1957).\n\nThe number of births then dropped through the Great Recession, down to 3.62 million in 2024, a 16% drop. That means fewer Americans graduating from high school and applying to college in 2025 and 2026, with numbers declining into the 2040s.\n\nThat’s not just a projection; it’s a continuation of a dozen-year trend. Higher ed (college and university) full-time enrollment peaked in 2012 at 11.6 million, dropped to 10.1 million in covid-stricken 2020, a 13% drop, and has rebounded only slightly since.\n\nWith surveys showing that as many as one-third of corporations drop college degree requirements for job applicants, one significant incentive for enrollment may be declining. \n\nMoreover, the job market for recent graduates has been declining over the last dozen years, as Derek Thompson noted in The Atlantic this spring, and may continue to deteriorate as Artificial Intelligence becomes more common. As he noted, the lifetime earnings gap between college and high school graduates stopped widening back in 2010. \n\nYoung people may be getting the news. An increasing number of teens are expressing interest in trade schools and apprenticeships, which can lead to higher-paying work than many college majors. Young men especially, may be taking this route, avoiding 60-percent-plus female colleges with, as one conservative put it, “campuses patrolled by the feminist thought police.”\n\nThere seems little question that the “woke” perspective of both high-paid professors and low-paid adjuncts has had some effect in shaping the political views of college grads and widening the chasm between those of white grads and non-grads. \n\nThere’s also little question that many young people are not wired to benefit from higher ed. The G.I. Bill of Rights beginning in the 1940s and the post-Sputnik scholarship school aid beginning in the 1950s enabled many Americans with the requisite skills and temperament to earn college and professional degrees, to great national benefit.\n\nBut such individuals are never going to be 100 percent of the population, and if 5% is too low, perhaps 38% is too high. Generous student loans and promised loan forgiveness may have overshot the mark, and today the Biden loan forgiveness program is gone and Trump limits on student loans have become law. \n\nFor the larger society, subsidizing “woke” colleges and universities, with their speech codes and racial quotas, may have become not a value-added but a value-detracted segment of the economy. Higher ed, long a growth industry, is at risk of decline.\n\nIn any case, in electoral politics, the promise of an ever-increasing body of college graduates permanently swelling an ascendant Democratic majority seems uncertain of fulfillment, even as long-standing 9-1 majorities among blacks and 2-1 among Hispanics have been regressing toward the national mean.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Republicans are guaranteed anything like a permanent majority. Far from it. It means that our partisan politics will continue to be sharply divided, with developments that help one party with one group sooner or later helping the other party with another. And election results will continue to be affected, in ways that almost no one anticipates, by developments like those that followed that escalator ride ten years and one month ago.","summary":"Nine months after the 2024 election, we’ve been graced with definitive dissections of the electorate, and how it has changed since that escalator ride ten years and one month ago.

You have the crazy, conservative nuts, racist loons, nationalists. Then you have the fiscal responsibility people. It’s all over the place. And that frustrates Trump.”\n\nAs to why Trump has chosen to downplay the inquiry regarding Epstein, a one-time friend, financier and child sex offender who died by suicide while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, O’Reilly deflected, calling it “a mystery.”\n\n“The people that I talk to don’t really know why he’s so defensive about this,” he told TheWrap.\n\nO’Reilly characteristically reserved his harshest critiques for the mainstream press in our wide-ranging conversation, which was completed over the course of two interviews. He claimed, for instance, that liberal media has “destroyed” itself by throwing away any pretense of objectivity due to its Trump hatred — and he foresees a major reckoning for all media once Trump is out of the picture, arguing that focusing on rifts among conservative voices overlooks how those personalities market themselves.\n\nTrump is a unique phenomenon. Without him, everything changes again. \n\nTrump has long argued that he represents a ratings gift to the mainstream media, and O’Reilly concurred. Yet he expanded that critique to entities on the right, like Fox News, predicting a “revolution” when Trump exits the spotlight.\n\n“If Donald Trump disappeared tomorrow, some alien got him and took him away, how do you think Fox is going to do? The network’s built around him,” O’Reilly said. “In three-and-a-half years, there will be a total realignment of television news. Once he’s off the stage, the networks and cable will all have to recalibrate how they market themselves.\n\n“Trump is a unique phenomenon. Without him, everything changes again.”\n\nOn the Epstein files\n\nO’Reilly asserted his support for Trump’s stance not to release the “Epstein list” for which right-wing figures are clamoring, saying it’s unfair to attach names without “compelling, chargeable evidence.”\n\nAs it happened, O’Reilly was initially interviewed for this column right before the frenzy unleashed when the Justice Department announced it wouldn’t release additional files related to Epstein. That move spectacularly backfired, causing fury within the MAGA movement while prompting media figures who normally toe the Trump line to blast the administration, if less so the president directly.\n\nDuring a testy July 14 exchange with NewsNation’s Leland Vittert, O’Reilly dismissed the Epstein story as a “curiosity,” arguing that “the media would run wild” with any names released and potentially “destroy” anyone who might have crossed Epstein’s path. That said, he conceded Trump is “hurting himself” with his resistance to providing more details and the “tabloid wave” stemming from it, “and I just wonder if there’s anybody in the administration that is telling him that.”\n\nTrump’s detractors have plenty of theories, including his well-documented relationship with Epstein, though O’Reilly rejected the notion that anything harmful to Republicans might be in the government’s possession, given the long time the Epstein material spent within the custody of Democrats.\n\nIn comments that would surely provoke snickers from liberals accustomed to “Democrats in disarray” headlines, O’Reilly also insisted the political right is less cohesive than the left in seeking to explain the eruption among Trump loyalists on this issue.\n\nBased on his conversations with Trump, O’Reilly concluded, “He’s very interested in his legacy, but I don’t believe that he feels this rises to that level.”\n\nO’Reilly’s reach\n\nOnce cable’s ratings kingpin, O’Reilly still makes his voice amply heard via radio and his “No Spin News.” He boasts access to Trump and generally shares his views, which includes accepting the president’s rationale for not releasing the Epstein files strictly to silence the criticism.\n\nWithout providing hard figures, O’Reilly notes that his current operation — which charges $6.95 a month for premium members — employs 60 people as a sign of its prosperity.\n\nO’Reilly held forth on a variety of topics, among them a relationship with Trump that goes back 35 years, and the observation that the president appears to have honed his migration into politics by internalizing lessons gleaned from watching O’Reilly’s show and blunt, tough-talking style, which appealed to many of the same people who became Trump’s loyal base.\n\nWhatever Trump learned from O’Reilly, the host sees the president as a uniquely charismatic and media savvy figure in the political world, someone who “knows how to deliver a message, and understands that you have to keep it interesting at all times.” In the spirit of keeping things interesting, O’Reilly offered thoughts on several recent media issues.\n\nThe MAGA media meltdown\n\nEven before the Epstein fallout, many of Trump’s high-profile supporters recently found themselves at odds — from Tucker Carlson feuding with Fox News’ Mark Levin and podcaster Ben Shapiro over whether the U.S. should join Israel in attacking Iran to Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal editorial page and New York Post contradicting Murdoch’s Fox network.\n\nNothing has highlighted those divisions more than the recent Epstein debate, yielding rare blowback toward the administration that Trump has struggled to quell. On Tuesday, Fox News host Laura Ingraham blamed the tumult on “conservative influencers eating their own.”\n\n“The fissures within MAGA world are becoming clear,” MSNBC’s Alicia Menendez recently observed. “They do seem more willing to articulate where the points of differential are.”\n\nTo O’Reilly, though, conflict sells. As a consequence, he saw little downside in pundit-on-pundit disputes, saying of skirmishes like the Carlson-Levin divide over attacking Iran, “Levin’s not putting his finger up to the air. If it clashes with Carlson, as he has recently, they both win. There’s no loser in that for those guys.”\n\nPerhaps not, but the notion exists that many conservative influencers and intellectuals are essentially piggybacking on Trump’s cult of personality for fun and profit. \n\nAs The Atlantic’s Yair Rosenberg put it, “The thought leaders of the Trump movement are merely political entrepreneurs trying to appropriate the president for their own purposes.” If there are disagreements, he noted, it’s because Trumpism ultimately boils down to “whatever Trump says it is.”\n\nFox’s strength, and failings\n\nAlthough O’Reilly spends most of his time deriding the traditional press, he’s not above taking conservative outlets to task. Let go by Fox in 2017, his imprint on the network can still be seen, having nurtured such talent as Jesse Watters, who started as a comic-relief ambush producer on “The O’Reilly Factor” and now occupies his former boss’ old time slot.\n\nWhile lauding the superiority of Fox’s talent relative to its cable-news channels, O’Reilly said the network erred with coverage of the 2020 election that led to its $787.5 million settlement with Dominion voting systems, maintaining he would have been able to curb those excesses had he still been around.\n\n“That would have never happened if I was there,” he said. “There’s no proof of fraud in that election. And we lost a lot of premium members when I said that.”\n\nParamount’s “60 Minutes” settlement\n\nAddressing another politically fraught media litigation, O’Reilly also made recent headlines by agreeing that Paramount Global settled with Trump over his “60 Minutes” lawsuit to grease the wheels for its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nGranted, O’Reilly contends“60 Minutes” was clearly pulling for Kamala Harris and that correspondent Scott Pelley (who didn’t conduct the Harris interview) “hates” Trump. \n\nHe also balked at characterizing Trump’s demands as a “a shakedown,” as former “60 Minutes” correspondent Steve Kroft recently described it on “The Daily Show.” But he added, “What I do know is this: CBS probably would have won the case had it come to a jury trial,” describing Paramount’s reasoning regarding the merger as follows: “If we settle, he won’t hold it up. So we’ll settle, right? That’s what it is.”\n\nThe Mamdani factor\n\nGiven the time he spends bashing liberals, perhaps the biggest surprise was hearing O’Reilly dismiss New York Democratic mayoral primary winner Zohran Mamdani’s candidacy as much ado about nothing. Fox’s reams of coverage sounding alarms about the prospect of a Democratic Socialist leading the U.S.’ largest city would certainly suggest otherwise.\n\nWhile Mamdani has seemingly become a poster child for the conservative stereotype of big blue cities — drawing fire from Trump and his media acolytes — O’Reilly’s response amounted to a bemused shrug. “Nobody outside of New York cares about New York City,” he contended.\n\nOne suspects millions of Americans and more than a few producers and executives at his former network disagree, but O’Reilly has a history of making such pronouncements, and it’s gotten him this far.\n\nAfter decades under the security of a corporate umbrella, O’Reilly has joined the ocean of voices (including several Fox alumni) seeking attention on the outside. To hear him tell it, he finds the water just fine, expressing respect for “the mavericks who go out and forge their own way in the wild west of the internet,” as long as they’re not “dishonest.”\n\n“So I don’t agree with a lot of these guys, but that’s fine,” O’Reilly said. “They got their point of view, and I have mine, and that’s that.”","summary":"The former Fox host speaks with TheWrap about a post-Trump reckoning in media, the “60 Minutes” settlement and how he’d have prevented that Dominion suit\n\n\nThe post Bill O’Reilly Says Trump&#8217;s Response to Epstein Drama Is a &#8216;Mystery&#8217;: &#8216;Don&#8217;t Know Why He&#8217;s So Defensive About This&#8217; | Exclusive appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bill-oreilly-interview-epstein-trump-maga-division-mamdani/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071125-Bill-Tucker-Jesse.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 13:15:00","author":"Brian Lowry","authors":["Brian Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":342169302,"title":"Hunter Biden says Democrats lost 2024 election because they weren’t loyal to his father","text":"Hunter Biden, the son of former president Joe Biden, attributed the Democratic Party’s 2024 election loss to the fact that they abandoned his father as the party's leader. \n\nSpeaking for the first time since his father lost the presidential election, Hunter Biden offered a different perspective about the election on At Our Table, a new podcast hosted by former Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison. \n\n“We lost the last election because we did not remain loyal to the leader of the party,” Hunter Biden said. \n\n“That’s my position. We had the advantage of incumbency, we had the advantage of an incredibly successful administration, and the Democratic Party literally melted down,” he added.\n\nAfter Joe Biden gave a disappointing and concerning debate performance against President Donald Trump last June, Democrats scrambled to create a “Plan B” – ultimately replacing Joe Biden with former vice president Kamala Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket. \n\nBut it took weeks for Joe Biden to agree to drop out of the presidential race. \n\nDemocratic party leadership, as well as voters, pressured Joe Biden, then the oldest person to serve as president, to let a younger candidate take the reins. In that time, Trump continued to aggressively campaign, picking up undecided voters who viewed the Democratic Party in turmoil. \n\nAt that point, Joe Biden was already behind Trump in the polls, and while Harris revitalized support among young people, it wasn’t enough to defeat the Republican nominee. \n\nHunter, however, believes that if the party had stood beside Joe Biden, the outcome would have been different.\n\nHowever, other reports say differently, suggesting that Joe Biden was mentally preoccupied with Hunter Biden’s federal gun trial – and the possibility of his son going to federal prison. According to the authors of 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, Joe Biden was “distracted” by his son’s legal battle which was taking place amid the campaign.\n\nSeveral books have been written and released since the tumultuous 2024 campaign, one of the most prominent being Original Sin, written by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which alleges that the White House and Biden family tried to conceal Joe Biden’s declining health. \n\nHunter Biden denied any allegations that he played a role in helping his father. He told Harrison he “stayed as far away” from his father as possible during his campaign. \n\n“Which, by the way, broke my heart,” Hunter Biden said. \n\nThe former president’s son suggested that the allegations of Joe Biden’s declining health are incorrect, saying the books were sold on “the idea of a conspiracy.”\n\nHunter Biden told Harrison it would have been impossible to cover up his father’s health problems because secrets rarely stay quiet in Washington, D.C. \n\nHunter Biden and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who served as Harris’s vice presidential pick, are among Harrison’s first guests on his new podcast, which is set to debut on Thursday.","summary":"Democrats chose to elevate former vice president Kamala Harris over former president Joe Biden for the Democratic ticket, throwing the party into momentary chaos","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hunter-biden-democrats-joe-election-loss-b2790049.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/16/12/11/GettyImages-2160497887.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NluXo7sU-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-16 13:13:41","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":342184838,"title":"CAA, WME, UTA Investigated as Justice Department Probes Ticket Refunds During COVID | Exclusive","text":"Talent agencies CAA, WME, UTA and Wasserman have been roped into a Justice Department investigation into AEG and Live Nation’s handling of concert cancellations and refunds at the start of the COVID pandemic, TheWrap has learned.\n\nJustice Department attorneys led by Trump-appointed deputy assistant attorney general Omeed Assefi interviewed CAA partner and music division head Rob Light and singer-songwriter Jon Bon Jovi in June, according to an individual with knowledge of the investigation. Several other talent agents have been interviewed, according to this individual. \n\nTalent agencies CAA, WME, UTA and Wasserman all declined to comment. The Department of Justice did not respond to multiple attempts to get comment.\n\nThe criminal antitrust probe is investigating whether Live Nation, AEG and potentially the talent agenices colluded illegally on refund policies for canceled concerts. The prosecution has weighed bringing charges against Live Nation and its CEO Michael Rapino, according to Bloomberg, which first reported on the case in May. \n\nThe talent agencies appeared in emails related to an earlier investigation into alleged monopoly power in the concert ticketing space. That led to the federal inquiry, according to a knowledgeable individual. The agencies were part of a ticketing “task force” alongside AEG and Live Nation that coordinated cancellation and refund efforts as the live music business faced the COVID crisis. \n\nShutdowns during the pandemic were catastrophic for the live events industry. According to a 2020 end-of-year report from Pollstar, the live events industry should have hit a record-setting $12.2 billion that year but instead incurred $9.7 billion in losses. When factoring ancillary revenue such as sponsorships, concessions and more, Pollstar estimated the total loss surpassed $30 billion.\n\nThe talent agencies’ involvement signals a broadening of the investigation, which is just the latest example of the government’s increased scrutiny into the power that a few key players have over the entire live music industry. Live Nation acquired Ticketmaster in 2010 to form a powerhouse venture that controls a majority of concert and venue ticket sales; it is also the subject of a civil antitrust lawsuit that was filed by the Justice Department last year. \n\nThe suit also represents another example of President Donald Trump’s combative relationship with the music industry. While former Vice President Kamala Harris walked out to Beyoncé on the presidential campaign trail, Trump was met with several “cease and desist” letters from artists asking the president not to use their music at his events and could only rely on a handful of musicians for support. The president has shown a willingness to go after enemies for perceived slights.\n\nLive Nation has denied any wrongdoing in the investigation and stated that they did not collude with AEG over refund policies.\n\n“It is not illegal for artist agents, promoters and ticketing companies to work together to solve the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic,” Dan Wall, Live Nation’s executive VP of corporate and regulatory affairs, said in a statement to TheWrap. “While Live Nation contributed to this industry effort in good faith, we set our own unique policies and refund terms to support fans and artists. We did not collude with AEG or anyone else.”\n\nAEG has yet to make a public statement on the matter and a spokesman did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nInside the investigation\n\nThe Justice Department started investigating potential collusion under President Joe Biden, according to Bloomberg. Efforts to convict the live music giants and the attached agencies intensified under the Trump administration as the five-year statute of limitations on criminal charges is coming up. \n\nWhen the DOJ sent subpoenas for documents in the Live Nation-Ticketmaster investigation in 2023, the department found email exchanges between agents and promoters over COVID refund and cancellation policies, leading to this second antitrust investigation to take hold during the Biden administration.\n\nThe investigation specifically analyzes whether the companies dealt with artists to limit losses on behalf of their clients or colluded on refund policies for canceled concerts, as live performances account for a significant portion of artists’ income. \n\nAmong those interviewed by the DOJ was rock legend Bon Jovi. The artist was one of the first to cancel his North American summer tour in April 2020 to give fans a full refund and help them cover other more pressing costs. \n\nBon Jovi slighted the ticketing industry when he announced his personal refund policy and outright tour cancellation. Live Nation and AEG were slower to make firm decisions on cancellation policies and delayed or denied refunds to fans, offering vouchers or “Concert Cash” instead. \n\n“Given these difficult times, we have made the decision to cancel the tour entirely. This will enable ticketholders to get refunds to help pay their bills or buy groceries,” the singer tweeted after the cancellation in April 2020. \n\nThe antitrust probe will not necessarily lead to criminal charges being leveraged against Live Nation, AEG or Rapino. So far, the parties have yet to be accused of wrongdoing. \n\nAn individual with knowledge of the investigation told TheWrap that the general sentiment around the investigation and specifically in the music industry is confusion as to why the government would fault the companies for having similar refund policies.\n\n“People are a bit in disbelief,” the person said. “The government is investigating live music and the best they can come up with is they discussed how to return money for tickets?”\n\nJoint response to COVID\n\nThe task force came together after the world came to grips with the impact of COVID and the need for social distancing. \n\nOn March 12, 2020, Live Nation, AEG, CAA, WME, Paradigm (whose North American music arm was acquired by Wasserman) and UTA released a joint statement, noting that they had joined forces to form a global task force to determine the cancellation protocol in the “best interest of artists, fans, staff and the global community.” The group’s first recommendation was to cancel all large-scale events through the end of March.\n\n“At this time, we collectively recommend that large scale events through the end of March be postponed. This recommendation is specific to the U.S. and countries deemed Level 3 by the CDC,” the statement read. “We continue to support that small-scale events in these regions follow guidance set by their local government officials. We feel fortunate to have the flexibility to reschedule concerts, festivals and live events as needed, and look forward to connecting fans with all their favorite artists and live entertainment soon.” \n\nThe task force included Live Nation CEO Rapino, Dan Beckerman (president and CEO, AEG and board member, ASM Global), Jay Marciano (chairman and CEO, AEG Presents), CAA’s Light, Marc Geiger (partner and head of music, WME), Sam Gores (chairman, Paradigm), Marty Diamond (head of global music, Paradigm) and David Zedeck (partner and global head of music, UTA).\n\nAs the pandemic persisted and gathering for live events proved impossible, Live Nation and AEG offered similar refund policies on tickets for postponed concerts. \n\nFor AEG, fans had a 30-day window to apply for refunds for AEG-produced concerts that had already confirmed their rescheduled dates starting May 1, 2020. \n\nLive Nation and Ticketmaster’s plan was similar, giving ticketholders 30 days to apply for a refund for rescheduled shows. Additionally, Live Nation offered a so-called Concert Cash policy which allowed fans to receive up to 150% of their ticket value that they would receive once they attended the new date. Both AEG and Live Nation also gave ticketholders the option to donate their tickets to charity. \n\nOther ticket resale companies like StubHub, SeatGeek and Vivid Seats did not give fans cash back, instead giving them a credit.\n\nAEG, who partnered with promoter Golden Voice, postponed Coachella 2020 to October of that year. The festival did not return until April 2022. \n\nLive Nation’s legal troubles\n\nThis pandemic-era investigation is an outgrowth of the Justice Department’s broader civil antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, part of the larger legal issues the company still faces. \n\nLive Nation has been accused of monopolistic behavior for its vast ownership of the venues – it handles 60% of the promotions for major U.S. concert venues and directly owns 265 venues in North America – as well as their control of ticketing through Ticketmaster, allowing the company to hike prices and add junk fees with impunity. Through the popular ticket platform, Live Nation controls 80% of venues’ primary ticketing for concerts.\n\nThe broader antitrust lawsuit is seeking to force Live Nation to divest itself of Ticketmaster, the dominant ticketing platform it acquired in a $2.5 billion merger in 2010. Under American law, companies can face up to $100 million fines for criminal antitrust violations and individuals, such as Rapino in the Live Nation suit, could face up to 10 years in prison — although no one has been sentenced to more than five.\n\n“Rather than investing in better products and services, we allege that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live concert industry in the United States for far too long,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a 2024 news conference. “It is time to break it up.”\n\nBeyond the Justice Department, Live Nation in March agreed to pay $20 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging that it had made misleading comments about industry competition and its compliance with federal regulations. \n\nThe pandemic-related case just adds another wrinkle to a company embroiled in one legal battle after another.","summary":"Trump's DOJ is investigating Live Nation, AEG and Hollywood’s talent agencies over refund policies during the pandemic, when the live music industry lost an estimated $10 billion in concert revenue\n\n\nThe post CAA, WME, UTA Investigated as Justice Department Probes Ticket Refunds During COVID | Exclusive appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/caa-wme-uta-investigated-doj-covid-ticket-refunds/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071525-DOJ-Investigation-into-Live-Nation-AEG-Hollywood-Agencies-v2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 13:00:00","author":"Tess Patton,While Live Nation","authors":["Tess Patton","While Live Nation"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":342130972,"title":"Americans Want Order, not Cruelty, at the Border","text":"Many missteps by the Biden–Harris administration and Democrats eased the path to victory for Donald Trump and the GOP, but Trump may be best known for embracing immigration and border control as his signature issues. His administration acted quickly to round up undocumented migrants and to publicize its activities, so you'd expect voters to be delighted. But surveys find declining concern about the border, lower support for deportations, and growing favorability for increased immigration. What gives? If you look at the data, it's clear that most Americans like immigration and favor order at the border—not cruel overreaction.\n\nLast year, it was obvious that immigration worries boosted Trump's candidacy. In October, a majority of respondents told YouGov pollsters that they trusted the GOP candidate to do a better job on immigration than then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. The most important immigration concern for respondents—at 51 percent—was \"border enforcement.\"\n\nIn office, the Trump administration stepped up border controls. It militarized sections of the border, toughened screening of would-be migrants, increased deportations, and staged high-profile Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids to arrest undocumented immigrants. Unauthorized border crossings are now down \"to a level not seen in at least 25 years\" according to CBS News.\n\nDeclining Support for the Administration's Immigration Crackdown\n\nThat's pretty much what Trump said he'd do, so you'd expect the plurality that put him in office to be happy. Instead, though, Gallup finds support \"lower today for deporting all undocumented immigrants, with 38% now favoring this as the administration is attempting it, down from 47% last year when it was a Trump campaign promise.\" At the same time, \"support for allowing undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens has risen to 78%, up from 70% last year.\"\n\nReducing immigration overall has dropped from a goal favored last year by a majority to a position favored by just 30 percent of respondents. A full 79 percent say that immigration is a good thing.\n\nThis is quite a turnabout. The public appears to be amazingly fickle. Or maybe Trump is delivering something different than people expected.\n\nLast year, much of the discussion of undocumented migrants revolved around crimes—often horrendous—committed by gang members, many from Venezuela. The much-publicized alleged takeover of Aurora, Colorado, apartment complexes by gangsters played a big role, as did the murder of Laken Riley, and several vicious rapes. And there lies the key to understanding the public mood.\n\nIn the YouGov poll, tied for second place as immigration concerns after \"border control\" were \"pathways to citizenship\" and \"drug smuggling.\" That suggests respondents worried about crime, not migrants.\n\nJust after Gallup, Harvard CAPS/Harris released a poll this week that also asked about immigration. Consistent with Gallup, the Harvard CAPS/Harris pollsters found 59 percent support for \"more due process and guaranteed hearings to prevent unfair deportations.\" Fifty-five percent support allowing \"the children of those who are here illegally in the United States automatically becoming U.S. citizens.\"\n\nAmericans Are Worried About Criminals, Not Immigrants in General\n\nBut a full 79 percent are in favor of \"deporting immigrants who are here illegally and have committed crimes\" and 70 percent support \"closing the border with added security and policies that discourage illegal crossings.\" Seventy-nine percent believe \"convicted criminals who are here illegally should be deported after their sentence is over.\"\n\nAs in the Gallup poll, there's support for creating pathways to citizenship for migrants in general—even those who crossed the border illegally. But respondents don't want other countries' criminals here, want enforcement efforts at the border that could keep criminals out, and favor tough efforts to remove those who have been convicted of crimes.\n\nImportantly for the outcome of last year's elections, 67 percent of respondents to the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll believed there was an \"open border\" under the Biden administration and 69 percent say that was \"deliberate policy.\"\n\nSo, Americans' attitudes aren't fickle, they're nuanced. When asked, people are rather enthusiastic about immigration and immigrants. But they want order at the border, not chaos. They support screening would-be migrants for criminal backgrounds, to exclude those who have preyed on people in the past and are likely to do the same in the future. And they want immigrants who have committed serious crimes in the U.S. to be sent back to their home countries.\n\nTrump Went Too Far Beyond His Border Policy Assurances\n\nThat's not what the Trump administration has delivered. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller famously tore into ICE officials in May for not arresting enough migrants. He urged them to look for undocumented migrants to round up at Home Depot and 7-Eleven—places you're more likely to find hopeful laborers than gang-bangers—with a goal of scooping up 3,000 people per day.\n\nThe result has been much-publicized raids of meatpacking plants and farms. Among those caught in the dragnet have been U.S. citizens. People working difficult jobs in fields and factories are unlikely to be trigger-pullers for international criminal syndicates. Unsurprisingly, when it crunched the numbers on the arrests, the Associated Press found \"the majority of people currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. Of those who do, relatively few have been convicted of high-level crimes.\"\n\nAccording to the data, that's not what Americans voted for when they turfed-out Biden, Harris, and their cronies in favor of Trump and his crew. On the immigration issue, voters wanted to get rid of an administration that people believed was deliberately refusing to enforce border controls. Trump won on a promise to impose order and target dangerous criminals who'd been allowed into the country.\n\nThe Trump administration actually did that, and if it had stuck with that policy, the public would likely be happier. But then it started scooping up anybody who crossed the border without authorization (and some who were authorized) and lost support. No matter what Miller and company's sentiments are, Americans like immigration and favor admitting more peaceful and productive migrants.\n\nUltimately, Americans want order, not cruelty, at the border, and that's how they voted. The Trump administration sheds support when it abandons one extreme on immigration for another.","summary":"Trump promised to target violent criminals.

The California governor's race waits on Kamala Harris","text":"The Democrats running for California governor have spent the spring and summer working to win over the powerful donors and interest groups who could help them squeak through a competitive primary election. But the candidates, and many deep-pocketed Democrats, are still waiting for the decision that will have the biggest impact on the race: whether former Vice President Kamala Harris is running. Since Harris lost to President Trump in November, the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom has been in suspended animation, with candidates trying to plan their campaigns without knowing who their biggest opponents will be. A few are making contingency plans to run for other offices. And some major donors are waiting to write big checks. \"It creates a little bit of a limbo situation,\" said Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction who launched his gubernatorial campaign in 2023. The Democrats in the race are talking to many of the same potential donors, Thurmond said, and most have the same question: \"Is she going to run?\" The only answer, Thurmond said, is an unsatisfying one: \"We don't know.\" Since leaving Washington in January, Harris has mostly stayed out of the public eye, settling back into her Brentwood home with her husband, Doug Emhoff, and talking to close friends and confidantes about what she should do next. She is weighing whether to leave politics, run for governor or run for president for a third time. She is expected to make a decision about the gubernatorial race by the end of summer. The Democrats who are already running for governor lack Harris' star power, and her entry could upend the race. But the former vice president would also face questions about her 107-day sprint to the White House, what she knew about President Biden's decline and whether someone who has run unsuccessfully for president twice really wants to be California's governor. \"She is looking closely where is the best place to put her energy and focus and her time,\" said Debbie Mesloh, a longtime Harris ally. The few public appearances Harris has made this year — meeting with firefighters in Altadena, attending a high school graduation in Compton and headlining a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in the Bay Area — have been fodder for those trying to read the tea leaves. What does it mean that Harris skipped the state Democratic Party convention? That Emhoff has taken a teaching job at USC? Harris had originally planned to take a two-week vacation at the end of this month but has canceled her trip, according to someone familiar with her plans. Harris has also been in New York, where she attended Broadway plays and the exclusive Met Gala; in San Francisco, where she dined with her niece Meena at the high-end Japanese restaurant Shoji; and in Los Angeles, where she has shopped for groceries at a 99 Ranch Market in Westwood and the Brentwood Farmers Market. As the months have worn on, some gubernatorial campaigns have started to think that Harris' victory feels like less of a foregone conclusion than if she'd announced in January after leaving office. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Biden Cabinet secretary Xavier Becerra and former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine have said that they will stay in the race no matter what. Veteran state Senate leader Toni Atkins of San Diego said she is also staying in if Harris runs, saying in a statement that \"while the vice president has her own path, our campaign is moving full speed ahead.\" Former state Controller Betty Yee said in an interview this week that even if Harris runs, she is staying in, too. \"No, no, no,\" Yee said, of the possibility of seeking another statewide office. Being governor, she said, \"is what I feel like I've prepared to do. I will be staying in the race and really leaning into my fiscal and financial background.\" Yee said when she talks to donors, they want to know two things: how California can push back against the Trump administration, and what she will do if Harris enters the race. Dan Newman, a political strategist who's worked for Newsom, Harris and several of the gubernatorial candidates, said that the race is at an odd inflection point, with candidates who \"don't know who their potential voters are, because they don't know who they're running against,\" and some donors who are waiting — at least for now — to write big checks. \"They've got a good excuse to not give, because even if they are a big fan of a candidate who's in the race now, they don't know if the candidate will stay in the race,\" Newman said. \"Then there are others who don't want to give to someone who might run against her.\" Eric Jaye, a political strategist who previously worked for Villaraigosa's 2018 gubernatorial campaign and advised Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco, said he's hearing \"frustration\" from donors who are ready to see the race pick up speed. \"They’re not going to wait much longer,\" Jaye said. \"There are going to be donors who say, 'We have to go. We’re not going to wait for you.'\" But even if Harris entered, that wouldn't be a guarantee that donors would back her again, including those who are angry that she spent nearly $1.5 billion in campaign funds in her compressed campaign for the White House in 2024. \"The money is very, very upset with her,\" said gubernatorial candidate Stephen Cloobeck, a businessman and Democratic donor who is running for California governor. \"They're my friends. I'm part of that money. Everyone is thoroughly reeling.\" The amount of money that candidates raise is one way to gauge their support — and prospects. That picture remains a little fuzzy, though, since gubernatorial candidates have until July 31 to report their fundraising hauls from the first half of the year. The only candidate to release numbers so far is Becerra, who said he raised $2.4 million since entering the race in early April, including a $1.1-million transfer from his congressional campaign account. Becerra's campaign has $2 million on hand, including the largest contributions allowed by law — $39,200 — from the politically connected Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and Pechanga Band of Indians. Campaigns are required to report contributions of $5,000 or more shortly after they receive them. Those figures don't represent total fundraising, but can still show a campaign's trajectory. Three of the eight candidates have raised less than $100,000 this year in chunks of more than $5,000 at a time, state data show. Yee reported $71,900 and Thurmond, $32,500. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis reported raising $70,000, including $5,000 from Google. Her campaign said Kounalakis, who has been raising money since entering the race in April 2023, has $9 million on hand. \"I want to be clear that I'm in this race to win,\" Kounalakis said. Villaraigosa, who entered the race last summer, has raised almost $1 million this year through large donations, data show. Atkins reported about $381,000 this year, and Cloobeck, about $132,000. Porter, who entered the race in March, reported almost $475,000 in larger contributions, according to state data. She also transferred $942,000 from her U.S. Senate account to her gubernatorial account, according to federal filings made public Tuesday.","summary":"The 2026 governor's race is in suspended motion as donors and powerful Democratic interests await former Vice President Kamala Harris' decision about whether she will enter the contest.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-07-16/californias-2026-race-for-governor-is-in-stasis-waiting-on-kamala-harris","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad4a85/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3192x2128+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fcc%2F7a638102446b8cc4428ba15fa990%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 10:00:00","author":"Laura J.

Tim Walz told him to kill Democratic lawmakers: report","text":"Vance Boelter, the man accused of killing Democratic Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in June, told FBI Director Kash Patel that Gov. Tim Walz instructed him to kill other Democratic lawmakers as part of an elaborate plot, according to a newly released letter.\n\n“Dear Kash Patel. My name is Dr. Vance Luther, Boelter E.d.D. I am the shooter at large in Minnesota,” Boelter wrote in the letter, according to the FBI. The letter was unveiled by federal prosecutors Tuesday after his indictment. \n\nOfficials say they recovered the memo from a car near his home a day after the shooting, though it was not confirmed whether the car was his.\n\nProsecutors say Boelter, 57, was driving a fake police cruiser car, wearing a rubber mask that covered his head and wearing tactical gear around 2 a.m. on June 14 when he went to the home of Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin. \n\nHe then allegedly shot the senator and his wife nearly 20 times, but they both survived. He then stopped at the homes of two other lawmakers, say prosecutors. \n\nOne, in Maple Grove, where no one was home, and a second, in New Hope, where a police officer is thought to have scared him off.\n\nBoelter then allegedly went to the Hortmans’ home in nearby Brooklyn Park, shooting and killing them both, police said. Their dog was so gravely injured that he had to be euthanized.\n\nHe was arrested after a two-day manhunt near his family home in Green Isle, Minnesota.\n\n“I was hired by U.S. Military people off the books starting in college,” he allegedly states in the letter, before claiming that he “was approached about a project that Tim Walz wanted done,” alluding that other senior lawmakers were aware of the alleged plot.\n\n“Tim wanted me to kill [Minnesota Senator] Amy Klobuchar and Tim [blank]. Tim wants to be a senator, and he already hired [blank] to retire as planned,” Boelter wrote, according to the FBI.\n\nBoelter was indicted Tuesday by a grand jury on six federal charges in connection with the stalking and murders of Hortman and her husband, as well as the stalking and the shooting at the Hoffmans’ home, as well as the attempted shooting of their daughter Hope Hoffman, said acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson.\n\nIf convicted, he could face the death penalty.\n\nIn the letter, the suspect reportedly claimed that Walz, Kamala Harris’ former running mate, instructed him to “remove [Minnesota Attorney General] Keith Ellison with a double poisoning method.”\n\nThe accused said he refused the deal and “called off that plan,” but said that Walz promised to blackmail him, “If I didn’t play ball.”\n\nBoelter then said he met with Walz and had “some people waiting to kill me” when he returned home – an incident that informed his decision to shoot the lawmakers. \n\nHis public defender, Manny Atwal, who was appointed last month, refused to comment on the defendant's mental competency and insisted that Boelter “will be pleading not guilty” when he returns to court for formal arraignment. \n\n“Vance Boelter planned and carried out a night of terror that shook Minnesota to its core,” the U.S. attorney said. \n\n“He carried out targeted political assassinations the likes of which have never been seen in Minnesota. We grieve with the Hortman family and continue to pray for the recovery of the Hoffmans. Today, a grand jury indicted Boelter with the most serious of federal charges for these heinous political assassinations. \n\n“Let me be clear: Boelter will see justice.”\n\nThompson reaffirmed Tuesday that authorities have still not determined a clear motive but believe Boleter acted alone. \n\nAn investigation is ongoing.","summary":"A grand jury indicted the 57-year-old Tuesday after he embarked on ‘a murderous rampage targeting Minnesota’s elected officials and their families’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/vance-boelter-kash-patel-letter-walz-b2789916.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/27/22/54/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-6-23-29-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ui6Xdy9L-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-16 09:43:16","author":"Madeline Sherratt","authors":["Madeline Sherratt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.524},{"id":342086676,"title":"\"Y’all might wanna chill\" — Punch reacts to DJ Akademiks saying \"SZA snake a** cant cry to Drake no more\" ","text":"On Wednesday morning (July 16), DJ Akademiks shared a tweet warning the fans of SZA and Kendrick not to tweet him.

I’m Jon Wiener. Later in the show: If the Supreme Court won’t overrule Trump’s executive order abolishing birthright citizenship, it’s hard to imagine them saying ‘no’ to anything he wants. David Cole, former Legal Director of the ACLU, will explain why they will say ‘no’ to him when they get the new birthright citizenship class action case. But first: Elon Musk is starting his own political party to challenge Trump. Will that work? Maurice Mitchell of the Working Families Party will comment – in a minute.[BREAK]There’s trouble in Trump world. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is launching a third party to challenge Trump’s Republicans in the midterms and maybe in 2028. He says the Republicans passing Trump’s budget – he called it “this insane spending bill” – convinced him that “our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty, so that the people actually have a VOICE,” in all caps, he’s calling it, “the America Party.”The polls show a lot of support, at least in the abstract, for a new third party. Last October, 58% said the two parties do such a poor job representing people that a third party was needed. And for years, most independents have said a third party is needed. Last year it was 69% of independents. For comment we turn to Maurice Mitchell. He’s National Director of the Working Families Party. We saw him recently with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now talking about Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Maurice Mitchell, welcome to the program.\n\nMaurice Mitchell: It’s good to be here.\n\nJW: Is the Working Families Party a third party?\n\nMM: Yes, we are. We’re a nationwide, bottom up, third party movement. We started 26 years ago in New York leveraging fusion voting so that we could have ballot access as a third party.\n\nJW: Explain fusion voting for those of us who live in states like California, where fusion voting is banned.\n\nMM: Sure. I mean, it used to be the Law of the land. It was very, very popular in the United States. Fusion voting allows parties to cross endorse the candidates of others. So in 2020, Joe Biden wasn’t our first choice or our second choice, it was our third choice, and we endorsed him against Donald Trump.In 2024, we endorsed Kamala Harris against Donald Trump, and our voters in New York and Connecticut were able to vote on the Working Families Party line for those candidates. And what it allows us to do is to be able to signal a very specific message Yes, in this binary between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, no question, we align with Harris and we have some notes, we disagree with her on her policies around Gaza and her relationship to unions. We want it to be stronger and we’re able to say all those things through the Working Families Party ballot line.So hundreds of thousands of people in those states are able to vote their conscience while being strategic voters against the right wing in the general election. And also, we as a party are able to cycle after cycle, year after year, build our strength, build our name recognition, build our party brand, and organize on the local level so that more and more voters are able to come together and use their voter power to signal that, and then up and down the ballot, it has a real impact. So post-election, when our candidates, our preferred candidates win all the way from president down to city council, we’re able to say this specific amount of voters voted for you, and oftentimes we’re the difference maker. There are congressional races where the Working Families Party voters were the difference makers. There are city council elections where the Working Families Party voters where the difference maker, and that absolutely allows us to leverage that when it comes time to govern.\n\nJW: Now, what Musk has in mind is what most people think of as a third party running separate candidates, not endorsing candidates on a separate line. And it did happen once before that a single rich person launched a third party campaign against deficit spending. Same issue, got on the ballot in all 50 states, took votes from the incumbent Republican. That was Ross Perot in 1992, ran as an independent against George HW Bush got almost 20% – that’s the most any third party candidate has gotten since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, Perot did not run any candidates for House or Senate. It was just a presidential campaign. Now, Elon Musk can’t do that. He can’t run for president. He wasn’t born in the United States, but do you think a Musk third party effort focused on some House and Senate seats could have some success starting with the midterms next year?\n\nMM: You might be surprised at my skepticism. And so, he’s doing what we call ‘the Ross Perot play’ at the Working Families Party. It’s a top-down billionaire backed strategy. We’ve seen it fail. You’re right, Ross Perot didn’t break 20%. He got to around 19% and then he ran again, and he got less votes. He got 11 million less votes in 1996. And so, to me, it’s a strategy that is kind of like a spectacle. It’s more of a communication strategy versus a serious organizing strategy. If you’re going to build a third party in America, we believe you have to work from the bottom up. Then also, when you think about who Elon Musk is, right, he has this track record of making really bold promises and predictions, and he tends not to deliver on them. They tend to kind of fall through. I mean, I don’t know, like he said, that humans will be on Mars by 2026.Now granted it’s not 2026 yet, so he has a few months, right? I mean, he also said that there’ll be a hundred million robot taxis by 2020. Maybe there are, and I haven’t seen them. But the other thing about Musk, what do we know about Musk? He has a hard time with his attention span, and so this is something that’s fascinating him today. What we’ve learned over 26 years is that the way to build third party politics in our very rigid two-party system is it’s a generational process and you have to really look at the long haul, and we have no problem with third party candidacy in the general election. I mean, Tish James famously got her entrance into politics as running as a WP only candidate for city council in Brooklyn, right? It can be done, but not on the presidential level and not through a billionaire and his money. It’s like billionaire plus money plus crazy idea does not equal a third party. So I would just, I’m highly skeptical and also billionaires have their choice of two of the parties already. We don’t need a third billionaire party.\n\nJW: Okay? Musk, however, seems to have thought about the Perot campaign, or at least somebody has told him about it, and he does have a plan that is different from the parole plan that’s not completely crazy. He does not want to run candidates everywhere. He’s aiming for what he calls surgical disruption of the two-party system by targeting just a handful of key races, two or three Senate seats, eight or 10 House districts. His goal is to flip just enough seats to hold the balance of power in the next Congress so that there could be a swing block in a closely divided Senate and House, and they could be the deciding force in passing legislation, especially on spending and taxes. We even know what states he’s thinking about. The Senate seat in Michigan is being vacated by a Democrat, Gary Peters, it’s kind of a 50/50 state. In Georgia, Democrat Jon Ossoff is up for reelection and the Republicans don’t have a strong candidate to challenge him. In North Carolina, famously, Thom Tillis, Republican is stepping down after clashing with Trump over spending. And in the House, just to run this down briefly, The Cook Political Report lists 18 toss-up seats, Musk is looking just at eight supposedly. My favorite is he says he wants to target Elise Stefanik in that corner of New York state up there by Vermont and Canada. It would be great to see her defeated. He also wants to run somebody in. He wants to challenge Marcy Kaptur, the Democrat in Toledo and longest serving woman in congressional history, 79 years old to serve 42 years. So he’s got some ideas that aren’t completely crazy about how to get power in a closely divided Congress, so it’s not like Perot.\n\nMM: Sure, those are all interesting theoretical ideas, but when you bring it into the world as it is, and you imagine if the medium voter in any of these districts have an appetite for a wholly billionaire backed race-scientist backed Elon Musk sort of fever, dream play, right? Look, the voters of Wisconsin didn’t just reject MAGA and the Republicans and the prospect of a conservative majority in their Supreme Court. They also roundly rejected Elon Musk and the idea that our politics should be completely and wholly captured by oligarch.\n\nJW: That’s a great example. The Wisconsin Supreme Court case where Musk put in what, 20 or $25 million. No one had ever done anything like that before in any state Supreme Court race and campaigned personally himself. There was that rally in Green Bay where he ended up speaking for two hours and barely mentioned the candidate. And the candidate then lost by 10 points. The Republican lost by 10 points in a state that – it is basically a 50/50 state. So you’re absolutely right. Wisconsin shows that Musk himself is a terrible political leader, and candidate – plan seems to be though to get “better candidates” than himself.\n\nMM: I feel like that’s a distinction without a difference because ultimately, they will be candidates for the wholly Elon Musk-backed “America party” – and they will immediately be drawn down by all of the baggage that comes with Elon Musk. I think most voters, including the Republican Party primary voter, are not likely drawn to the very bizarre politics of Elon Musk. And what we’ve seen, and we’ve been a third party for 26 years and we’ve grown in every one of those 26 years. We started in New York; we now do politics all across the country, we endorse close to a thousand candidates up and down the ballot everywhere that voters aren’t stupid. There are some basic core American values, and I think we saw them in Wisconsin. Most voters when they understand that their votes are being bought, reject that. So I could already imagine the ads that will be played against his candidates. I could picture two or three really good ones. Apparently, according to the Supreme Court, he’s entitled to do anything he wants to do politically with his money, but there’s a ceiling on that.We saw that also in New York City, and this is another example of where billionaires and their hubris come up against the will of everyday working people. They spent $25 million against the Working Families Party, our ideals against directly against Zohran Mamdani in order to ram through a Cuomo victory in the New York City primary for mayor. And ultimately, the people of New York rejected the big money politics. I mean, if you were a voter in New York, I mean you couldn’t watch TV, you couldn’t stream on any of the platforms without getting all of the scary imagery about Zohran Mamdani, and people rejected it. And so there’s a point where big money can’t trump the power of organizing and good ideas and just like the basic decency of everyday American voters.\n\nJW: And there’s one other issue. Musk seems to have kind of a single-issue campaign that he has in mind here: deficit spending, reduce the deficit, which means cut spending or raise taxes. Is that a winning issue in swing districts in America?\n\nMM: Look, I mean—\n\nJW: You’re laughing. \n\nMM: There are certain issues and platforms that are really powerful, debated, really popular in two places, corporate C-suites and in the halls of Congress. [Laughter] One of them is this obsession with deficit spending. There is no constituency in America that is electorally significant, let’s say that votes on this abstract idea around deficit spending. What we’ve done is we’ve gone out and we’ve talked to working people. What they care about is affordability. What they’re concerned with as it relates to their government is they want a government that works for them. And so what that means is they don’t want government to do less. They want government to do more, consistently. The American people, independents, Democrats, Republicans want government to do more for them, and they want a government that is effective, which means they’re not interested in abstract ideas around efficiency. Sure, efficiency sounds good, but in practice, if it means that you, you’re actually taking away the needed programs and the services of the government, the people reject that.And so if he plans on running on DOGE and more DOGE, I think he’s going to find that there’s not going to be an appetite by very many voters for that. What people have experienced that to be is chaos. Voters don’t like chaos; is hardworking government workers who provide services losing their jobs. It turns out voters don’t like that in terms of people don’t like that. So if he’s going to run on his record and he’s going to run on deficit spending and doing more of what DOGE has done and he attaches his candidates to that, they’re going to run on with this albatross of Elon Musk, his horrible record in government, his obsession with deficit spending at a time when people are concerned with affordability. That seems like a very poor recipe for politics in this moment where people are frustrated across the board with the oligarchs.They’ve had it with the billionaire class. People want the government to do more, not less. And people want a politics that focuses like a laser on affordability, helping them to afford rent, childcare, healthcare, at a time where working people are struggling and feel like they’re trying to overcome a mountain of medical debt and college debt and just trying to get by. Right now, in most cities, it’s hard for even people who feel like they’re solidly middle class to get by. And if you could imagine all the people who are struggling even to enter the middle class, but just like majority of Americans, I just don’t see there to be an appetite. Abstractly, people do want more options; abstractly, people do want more choice. I think the particular choice instead of the Democratic Party, which is partially oligarch-inspired, and the Republican party, which is wholly oligarch-inspired, this one is like run by one oligarch. There you have options, right?\n\nJW: There is one more significant third party candidate on the scene right now. Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York City in November. I know that WFP was a big organizer for Mamdani in the Democratic Party primary, of course, where he defeated Cuomo, the favorite of the party establishment, as you said, they spent $25 million trying to get Mamdani defeated. Now, Cuomo has declared he will remain in the race running on, what’s his line called, the ‘Fight and Deliver’ party. And he’s got a scheme here. I don’t know if this’ll work, but there seems to be a pact shaping up between all the other challengers to block Mamdani that the other challengers agree they will drop out if they are not the top anti-Mamdani candidate with the most support in the polls in mid-September. That’s Mayor Eric Adams, he’s running on the ’End Antisemitism’ party line and the ‘Safe and Affordable’ party line. This is an only-in-New-York kind of a story. Cuomo himself is running as the candidate of the Fight and Deliver Party. Curtis Sliwa is running as a Republican. Jim Walden is an independent. What do you think of this pact shaping up to block a Mamdani victory in November?\n\nMM: Well, “vote blue no matter who,” right? Remember that? [Laughter] Knowing Andrew Cuomo and knowing him to be singularly obsessed with power, and being animated like few others by ambition, and by his path to the presidency, I’m not surprised that he’s found another path.Look, we are witnessing every single day, more and more labor unions, more and more elected officials from across the coalition, the pro-democracy coalition, consolidate around Zohran Mamdani – that’s where the momentum is. He continues to campaign; we continue to campaign with him. Between now and November, we anticipate making clear to the people of New York that there is an opportunity on the ballot to move forward, and we think that that’s what most people want. There’s an opportunity on the ballot to get away from the politics, the very dour politics of Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Adams, and actually focus on their affordability.And so those contrasts, if it’s two contrasts or three contrasts with five contrasts, politics is often about contrast, those contrasts aren’t necessarily bad for us, and we plan to engage in a very rigorous set of conversations with New Yorkers, including the ones that voted for Zohran in the primary and all the others that are now waking up to a new set of politics because it’s been seismic, and are very, very curious about the values of Zohran’s campaign, how he plans to govern the city of New York and the coalition that he’s going to build around him.So look, in most normal politics, you would imagine that people would consolidate around the candidate, but again, the clown car that they want to assemble inside of, they’re more than happy to, and I think we’re feeling pretty bullish about the argument that we’re going to make in November.\n\nJW: Maurice Mitchell – he’s National Director of the Working Families Party. Mo, thanks for talking with us today.\n\nMM: Good to be with you.[BREAK]\n\nJon Wiener: It’s been a bad week for Donald Trump. His MAGA base is in an uproar over his denials about a Jeffrey Epstein client list. His tariffs are increasingly chaotic and unpopular. His bromance with Putin seems to be over. And in the courts, we have a new nationwide injunction blocking his efforts to abolish birthright citizenship, and an injunction against ICE in Los Angeles, Trump’s ground zero for attacking immigrants. For comment on the court rulings, we turn to David Cole. He recently stepped down after eight years as national legal director of the ACLU to return to teaching law at Georgetown. He writes for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The New York Review, and he’s legal affairs correspondent for The Nation. David, welcome back.\n\nDavid Cole: Thanks for having me, Jon.\n\nJW: Trump’s executive order abolishing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional – pretty much everybody agrees about that, including even The Wall Street Journal editorial page – and maybe, maybe, even the Supreme Court. It’s the simplest case where the court should say ‘no’ to Trump. And if they don’t do that, it’s hard to imagine they would say ‘no’ to anything.The court this term had a chance to say ‘no’ to Trump on abolishing birthright citizenship. His order had been blocked temporarily by a nationwide injunction issued by a district court, which cited the 14th Amendment, which explicitly says if you’re born in the United States, you’re a citizen of the United States. But instead of settling the case at that point, the Supreme Court left it open — and instead issued a sweeping ruling on a related issue, striking down nationwide injunctions issued by district courts, including this one. But the court did point to one alternative they said would be acceptable for nationwide injunctions: class action suits. So the ACLU filed one the same day. And then a district court, as they say, ‘certified the class.’ Please explain what that means and where we stand today.\n\nDC: Sure. So the previous cases that had been filed against the Birthright Citizenship Executive order were not class actions. They were suits on behalf of, one of them was on behalf of an organization that had a number of immigrants who were members and they sued on their behalf. Some states sued saying they had obligations to citizens, and they had to determine who is a citizen. And this sort of upended that. And in those cases, the courts found the order unconstitutional and enjoined it nationally, not just as to the parties before the court. And what the Supreme Court said was you can’t do that. The court has the power to issue injunctive relief for the parties before it and not to parties that are not before it. But if it has the proper parties before it, it can issue a nationwide injunction. And in particular, if there was a nationwide class, if the suit was brought essentially on behalf of all people in the country who would be subject to this order and that’s an appropriate class, then the court can issue relief to that entire class. And so actually that decision came out on a, I don’t know, Thursday or Friday, I can’t remember now, but within hours the ACLU had filed a class action in New Hampshire and that has now been certified and the judge has now granted a nationwide injunction to that class. So that’s very likely to go back up to the Supreme Court. But nothing in the decision that the court rendered earlier this summer would bar relief in that case.\n\nJW: The response of the Trump administration was that the New Hampshire judge was wrong because “the American people voted for this agenda.” Is that the basis on which judges make decisions?\n\nDC: I don’t think so. It is the Constitution, Mr. President and the Constitution says if you are born here, you are a citizen as long as your parents are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. And pretty much everybody except for diplomats are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. And I have no doubt you suggested you thought maybe this Supreme Court would rule the birthright citizenship order unconstitutional. I actually have no doubt this court will strike it down as unconstitutional when it comes before it in a proper case. And I think one of the reasons that the Trump administration only appealed to the Supreme Court on the scope of relief question, the nationwide injunction question and not on the merits of the birthright citizenship was because they realize they’re very likely to lose on that ground and they didn’t want to go up on the first major case and lose.\n\nJW: The Trump spokesman also said the judge who certified the class for birthright citizenship was not paying attention to the Supreme Court ruling in this case. Do you agree with that?\n\nDC: I think whoever made that statement was not paying attention to the Supreme Court ruling in this case because the Supreme Court expressly said that if there’s a proper class action you can have nationwide relief. And they also left open other avenues for nationwide relief. And particularly they said if the states can show that in order to get complete relief for the states, a nationwide injunction is necessary, it’s appropriate.\n\nJW: So what are the next steps now with the birthright citizenship class action? Does this just go to the Supreme Court next term, and they’ll decide?\n\nDC: Well, I think it is sort of up to the Trump administration. They have the right to seek an emergency stay of this district court injunction first from the Court of Appeals and then from the Supreme Court and that could all be done this summer.\n\nJW: Now the rules about what a class action suit has to be are very well established. It’s a very familiar part of litigation. If the Trump administration challenges the certification of a class in this case, has the court met the requirements for what makes for a class action case?\n\nDC: That’s a great question. That will be the issue I think going up. Is this an appropriate class? I think it’s a pretty clear example of an appropriate class where, because basically everybody who’s subject to the law is subject to the law in the same way and for the same reason. And therefore, the claims are all identical. And in that context where you’re seeking an injunction against a national policy and that national policy affects all the people subject to it in the same way a class action is appropriate. The Supreme Court has made it much more difficult to pursue class actions where you might have differing factual circumstances, employment actions for example, where different people could be fired for various different reasons, very difficult to get class actions there. But on this kind of a case where it’s a challenge to a rule that applies the same way to every person to whom it is applied, I think this is a strong case. I think the injunction will be affirmed when it goes up.\n\nJW: Let’s go back to the ban on nationwide injunctions issued by district courts. And a lot of our friends said this ruling was a total disaster. It’s a tremendous help to Trump and a blow to all the rest of us. But there are a few things people need to know about that. I just want to clarify. This ban does not apply retroactively to the existing nationwide injunctions blocking Trump. Isn’t that right? There are over a hundred of them and they stay in force. Those injunctions blocking Trump’s executive orders remain in effect till they are litigated if the Trump administration brings them back to court. Isn’t that right?\n\nDC: Yes and no. It is a Supreme Court precedent on the appropriate circumstances in which district courts can issue nationwide relief. And so yes, there are a number of other nationwide injunctions against Trump. Trump can now go back in, he will have to go back in those cases to raise those claims. But if he goes in and raises those claims in many circumstances, he’ll have a decent argument that can be made. But again, what the court said was the court’s power to issue injunctions is limited to the parties before it. And so there’s two ways in which you can get a nationwide injunction. If the parties before you are a nationwide class that is, it’s a class of people across the country, then the court can afford relief to those parties. And the second way is if providing relief to the parties before the court requires nationwide relief in order to afford the parties before the court complete relief, it’s appropriate to issue complete nationwide injunction.And that issue was present in the Supreme Court case, and they sent it back down to the lower courts with respect to the states saying the lower courts will have to decide in the first instance whether in order to provide effective relief to the states that sued the court needs to in effect provide a national injunction. And if it’s necessary to provide complete relief, it’s permissible. So yes, Trump can go back into any court where there’s a nationwide injunction and challenge that injunction, but the Supreme Court in Trump v. CASA laid out a number of avenues that permit lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions when the proper plaintiffs are before them or when the relief is necessary. So I don’t think it’s as outrageous a decision as many people have said. I think there’s still plenty of ways to get nationwide relief.\n\nJW: For example, there has been a nationwide injunction blocking Trump’s executive order cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities, cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE. And Trump’s legal team is now I understand trying to narrow those injunctions to apply only to the plaintiff cities. That was a case that was brought by San Francisco and some Bay area of cities and suburbs. Now 34 more cities and counties have joined that case including Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Denver – and it seems like the courts are likely to say, ‘well. that’s appropriate’ — don’t you think?\n\nDC: Exactly. So that’s right. It’s essentially those who need the relief can just join the case as co-plaintiffs and then they are before the court and the court can afford them the same relief that is already afforded to San Francisco. Again, that’s another way in which you can extend the relief is that you just join other plaintiffs. So it does put greater burdens on plaintiffs and courts to justify nationwide relief, but it does not block nationwide relief where it is necessary. And oftentimes when it is a federal policy that has been called into question and the court has found that that federal policy is just across the board unconstitutional, that is a situation in which it’s appropriate to provide nationwide relief as long as you have a class that represents that the people who would be affected.\n\nJW: And hasn’t our side complained in the past about nationwide injunctions issued by right wing district court judges? There’s that judge in Texas I remember blocked a vaccination mandate for federal employees and we were outraged and said, this is misuse of the law. So this cuts both ways.\n\nDC: Yeah, absolutely. This is – when Biden was the president, the right wing legal apparatus used nationwide injunctions to block many of his actions. The courts today have issued nationwide injunctions to block many of Trump’s actions. And again, what the Supreme Court said was you just have to have the right parties before you. And sometimes that’s actually really hard, getting the right parties all together on the same page in the same case. But where it’s appropriate, you can still get nationwide relief.\n\nJW: And I want to talk just briefly about one big immigration case. The federal court in Los Angeles that found late Friday afternoon that the federal government’s ongoing immigration raids in Los Angeles and around Southern California likely violated the Constitution by singling out Latinos for arrest and detention on the basis of their race or ethnicity. And the federal court prohibited ICE from continuing this kind of raid throughout southern California. This was a case brought by the ACLU of Southern California along with Public Counsel, ImmDef and CHIRLA and some other immigrants’ rights groups. And then it was joined later by the city of LA and seven other cities and LA County. They argued ICE was arresting people based on their ethnicity and race: Latinos. Picking up people at car washes, swap meets, day laborers gathered outside Home Depot, farm workers in the strawberry fields in Ventura County — just because they looked like Latinos — and then denied them contact with attorneys. Seems like a pretty strong case to me.\n\nDC: Yeah, I think very strong case. The way that ICE has been carrying out its enforcement authority is outrageous. And to treat looking Latino as illegally in the country is just, is basis. And particularly in a place like Los Angeles where you have a massive Latino population, many of them citizens, many of them permanent residents, many of them legally here, to treat someone as suspect simply because of their ethnicity is unconstitutional and unethical. And then to deny them access to counsel. Everyone has the right to consult with counsel once they’re arrested. So you had a situation in which ICE was just running roughshod over the rights of these people and the courts have said, no, you got to respect their rights. The Constitution protects all of us in the United States. It protects those who are citizens and those who are not. It protects those who are legally here and those who are illegally here. The whole idea of due process and of right to counsel is so that we just make the right decisions about who is properly subject to the authority of the state and who is not. So a great decision and I hope ICE will transform and reform its practices. My guess is that they’ll instead appeal and keep engaging in what they’re doing, but we’ll see.\n\nJW: One last thing. What Trump and ICE are doing is massively unpopular. People really don’t like these raids in LA on residents who’ve been here for a decade who have jobs and families. The most recent polling on this comes from Gallup where the findings are worse than any poll in Trump’s second term. This is a month-long survey in June — Americans were asked whether they approve or disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration. Disapprove 62%, approve 35%. And as for strongly approve and strongly disapprove, more than twice as many Americans strongly disapproved as strongly approved, 45% strongly disapproved, only 21% strongly approved. This is especially the case for independents. Nearly 70% of people who called themselves independent voters said they disapproved of what Trump’s been doing on immigration. These are the worst numbers Trump has ever gotten on polls on immigration. The trend has been clearly downward.Another fascinating finding, a record number of adults say immigration is good for the country. 79% say immigration is good; 17% say immigration is bad. And the big change in the last few months has been among Republicans. Now 64% of Republicans say immigrants are good for the country. The percentage of Americans who say immigration should be reduced has dropped down to 30% – the lowest it’s been in recent decades. So the ACLU often does not represent the majority. Usually, they’re defending minority rights. It seems like right now on immigration, the ACLU represents a great majority of Americans.\n\nDC: In some sense Trump has performed a miracle – because for a long time it seemed like there was no good politics around immigration, other than being tough on immigration. And this was a real weakness for the Democrats, and one that Trump exploited. But he clearly has overread his mandate, he’s overreached. And when you see people — people that they know getting caught up in this, they see it on the news. They see ICE agents wearing masks, arresting college students for writing op-eds in the newspaper. That kind of overplaying of one’s hand is precisely the kind of thing that gets Americans, gets their backs up, and they say, ‘wait a minute. We may not have liked the chaos at the border, but we didn’t want you to be coming into our schools and our churches and into courts and picking up people who are not illegally here. You have gone way too far.’ And if it leads to fundamental restructuring of our politics around immigration, that would be a great thing.\n\nJW: David Cole – you can read him at The New York Review.

Raúl Grijalva\n\nAdelita Grijalva, daughter of the late US Rep. Raúl Grijalva, has won the Democratic primary in Arizona’s 7th Congressional District, securing a decisive victory Tuesday night(July 15) and positioning herself to succeed her father in Congress.The Associated Press called the race with Grijalva winning 62 percent of the vote, defeating a crowded field that included a high-profile Gen Z and progressive activist, Deja Foxx, and former state lawmaker Daniel Hernández Jr. The deep-blue district, which spans parts of Tucson and southern Arizona, is considered a safe seat for Democrats in the September 23 special general election to fill the vacant seat following the death of longtime Representative Raúl Grijalva in March 2025.The win marks a powerful continuation of the Grijalva political legacy. Her father, Raúl Grijalva, passed away at age 77 from complications related to cancer treatment. A progressive stalwart and former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he represented the district for more than two decades and was a leading voice on progressive issues, including environmental justice and Indigenous rights.Who is Adelita Grijalva?Live EventsAdelita Grijalva, 54, brings more than two decades of experience in public service to the race. She served for 20 years on the Tucson Unified School District Governing Board, where she was a staunch advocate for bilingual education and ethnic studies, and later as a Pima County Supervisor, where she championed affordable housing, climate resiliency, and early childhood education.She is the eldest of Raúl Grijalva’s three daughters, and a graduate of Pueblo High School and the University of Arizona, where she earned a degree in political science.She became the first Latina to chair the Pima County Board of Supervisors in 2023. She resigned from that role earlier this year, in compliance with Arizona’s resign-to-run law, to launch her congressional campaign.Grijalva lives in Tucson with her husband, Sol Antonio Gómez, a librarian, and their three children, Adelina, Raúl, and Joaquín.Grijalva’s campaign received swift backing from progressive heavyweights, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a statement posted on Instagram after her victory, Grijalva said, “This is a victory not for me, but for our community and the progressive movement my dad started in Southern Arizona more than 50 years ago.”Deja Foxx in opposition Foxx, a Gen Z activist with nearly 400,000 TikTok followers, entered the race calling for generational change. She previously served as one of the youngest staffers on Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign and gained national attention as a reproductive rights advocate. Her campaign earned the backing of progressive groups like Leaders We Deserve, founded by Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg, who has led efforts to challenge Democratic establishment candidates nationwide.Despite a surge in grassroots enthusiasm and digital momentum, Foxx struggled to overcome Grijalva’s deep name recognition and local political roots.In a statement Tuesday night, Grijalva said her victory “honors the legacy of my father and recommits to the communities we’ve both served.” If elected in September, she will become Arizona’s first Latina in Congress, a historic milestone in a district that is over 60 percent Latino.Grijalva now faces Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in what analysts call a “solid Democratic” race.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onAdelita GrijalvaAffordable HousingKamala HarrisArizona Democratic primaryRaúl Grijalvaspecial general electionDeja FoxxLatinaDemocratic Partyuniversity of arizona\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Gavin Newsom come in next.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and fellow Tri-State agitator Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) fill out the progressive field.\n\nYou might as well toss in Bay State Sen. Elizabeth Warren because the lack of new thinking by the left is stunning. The party remains paralyzed and this is the moment Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio have been waiting for.\n\nEarly forays into New Hampshire and Iowa by Democrats won’t help this time around. President Donald Trump has upended the electoral process and candidates who act instead of pontificate will appeal to voters for years to come.\n\nDavid Hogg, a gun control advocate who split with the DNC, is onto this tired old act. The Parkland school shooting survivor and Harvard grad is trying desperately to shake up the Democratic party. This poll shows he’s failing.\n\nHogg bombards inboxes with urgent appeals that he’s “tired of the same old excuses, the same politicians cashing checks from the gun lobby or dragging their feet while our planet burns.” So Kamala Harris is the answer?\n\nHogg will soon come to the realization that the Democratic Party has lost the working-class vote. They have ceded the ballot box to Republicans who come with ideas on trade, illegal immigration, jobs, taxes, the military, and foreign affairs.\n\nThe Democrats can’t run the government and are stuck in a loop with a verbally awkward Kamala Harris, a younger version of an out-of-touch Joe Biden.\n\nThe real race to watch in 2028 is Vance vs. Rubio. Both have time before they need to declare their candidacy, but they are positioned to immediately capture the attention of voters who are pleading for America to be proud again of who we are and what we stand for. It’s no secret why Trump won both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote in 2024: He made promises that he’s now grinding to keep.\n\nBiden was weak and Harris didn’t have a primary battle needed to sharpen her message. Giving her a do-over is futile.\n\nThe GOP can run the table for the next eight years and David Hogg can’t do anything to stop that.\n\nTrump continues to show he’s prepared every day for whatever the job brings. Juxtapose that to wondering if Biden could even make it through a speech or any public event without forgetting where he was.\n\nTrump showed guts and decisiveness by ordering the bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites. We doubt Biden would have even moved off the beach for that crisis.\n\nTrump not only watched out for the world’s safety with that decision, but he also pushed through his Big Beautiful Bill that pumps more money into ICE to fix the illegal immigrant flood that Biden ignored.\n\nAll this and more will be up for debate as 2028 rolls around. The Democrats can try to pick apart Trump’s every move, and not every decision will be popular, but it will all circle back to one foundational point: The Biden-Harris administration was AWOL.\n\nThat’s a form of government that must never be repeated.","summary":"Stick a fork in Democrats, they are done!","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/16/editorial-presidential-race-a-layup-for-gop-in-2028/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Harris_Electoral_College_74599-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 06:15:04","author":"Boston Herald editorial staff","authors":["Boston Herald editorial staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":342090356,"title":"“Disgusting Creep”—Donald Trump Under Fire for ‘Gross’ On-Air Comment to Female Reporter Amid Epstein Fallout","text":"President Donald Trump has had a history of inappropriate behavior towards women, and this goes back to the days when he wasn’t even in politics. He has also been charged with sexual assault allegations against E.Jean Carrol, and he was found guilty. He has spoken ill towards women’s modesty and respect several times over the years, and then has it labelled as locker room talk.\n\nTrump also famously cheated on all three of his wives, numerous times. Therefore, it did not come as a surprise to anyone when he slipped back into his old ways during the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit held in Pittsburgh.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is facing backlash after he spoke to Fox News reporter Alexis McAdams during the summit.\n\nDonald Trump was addressing the attendees of the meeting when he suddenly singled out McAdams and asked where she was.\n\nHe said,” Where’s Ms. McAdams? We’re gonna do one with her too. She’s great. With Fox. Stand up. Young and smart and vibrant. You’ve done a great job. I’ll see you in a couple minutes.”\n\nThere was a minor applause in the audience; however, the general mood was not favorable. Even worse was the reaction online. Responses came fast and severe.\nJournalist Aaron Rupor shared a clip on his X platform, which then prompted users to call Trump a disgusting loser.\n\nWTF? I am getting creepy, old man, Perv vibes. Disgusting.\n— Denison Barb (@DenisonBarbs) July 15, 2025\n\nOne of the commenters called him disgusting, creepy, and another called him an old man who gave perv vibes and then called him disgusting.\n\nPeople were quick to connect this behavior to Trump’s history of controversial interactions with women. People have emphasized that the comments are completely out of line and inappropriate, especially in a public setting with a very formal undertone.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time Donald Trump has found himself enchanted by a reporter. Just weeks earlier his exchange with Hariana Veras stirred a controversy. Veras is a reporter of Congolese descent. Upon seeing her Trump said, “I’m not allowed to say this… but you are beautiful—and you’re beautiful inside.”\n\nTrump appreciates a reporter’s face card despite his press secretary’s advice against it:\n‘You’re very beautiful.

How rules differ for men and women in politics. People were quick to point out how if Kamala Harris had been the President, she would have been under far greater scrutiny.\n\nCritics also argue that such comments cause a dismissive culture toward women in media where they are not taken seriously. This kind of behavior undermines their work and credibility is based on appearance more than substance.\n\nIn the last few days, the Trump administration has also been dealing with the fallout after refusing to acknowledge the existence of Epstein files.\n\n‼️🇺🇸 BREAKING: AG Pam Bondi REFUSED to answer questions about the EPSTEIN files during a DoJ press conference. 👀\nShe also REFUSED to speak about Dan Bongino and the “fallout” RUMOR over the Epstein case.\nMost transparent Presidency in history huh? 🤨 pic.twitter.com/Gv1pQaXUeu\n— Diligent Denizen 🇺🇸 (@DiligentDenizen) July 15, 2025\n\nThe combination of Trump’s controversial personal behavior and the skewed Jeffrey Epstein narrative is creating friction within his administration. There have been reports suggesting that Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino might resign unless Attorney General Pam Bondi either changes her position on these files or is removed from her post.\n\nAs Trump’s public behavior continues to draw criticism and the promises made to his base remain unmet, the coming weeks could prove pivotal in shaping both his political legacy and future ambitions.","summary":"When praise crosses the line Trump's words spark outrage, as political fallout mounts from all sides.\"","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/disgusting-creep-donald-trump-under-fire-for-gross-on-air-comment-to-female-reporter-amid-epstein-fallout","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump-reporter.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-16 04:05:05","author":"Divya Verma","authors":["Divya Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.104},{"id":341996358,"title":"Arizona Republicans choose nominee to replace late rep in deep-blue border district","text":"Arizona Republicans nominated contractor and small business owner Daniel Butierez in the special primary election to represent Arizona's 7th congressional district on Tuesday night. Because the district spans hundreds of miles along the U.S. border with Mexico, all three Republican candidates made border security a central issue in their campaigns and vowed to carry out President Donald Trump's robust crackdown on illegal immigration. The Republican nominee will challenge the Democrat's Tuesday night winner, former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva, in the race to replace her father, the late Democratic Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, this November. Grijalva died of lung cancer-related complications in March.

Former Arizona representative Daniel Hernandez, progressive businessman Patrick Harris Sr. and environmental justice scholar José Malvido Jr., also vied for the Democratic endorsement. In a reliably blue district along the U.S. border with Mexico, representing parts of Tuscon, Yuma and Nogales, Butierez is likely to face an uphill battle in the special election this September. Grijalva won his re-election by 27 points in 2024, despite Trump defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris by more than five points statewide in Arizona last year. Butierez, a contractor and small business owner, received about 37% of the vote as the Republican nominee against Grijalva in 2024. Running again in the special election this year, he has vowed to \"fight to keep our border secure, slash taxes where appropriate, and crush the fentanyl crisis destroying Arizona families.\" Also competing in the Republican primary was Jorge Rivas, a Salvadoran-born restaurant owner based in Tucson.

There was talk about invoking the 25th Amendment. Biden’s enemies — and then even some of his friends — painted him as a husk of a man: barely lucid, tragically unaware, propelled only by hubris toward a second term.\n\nBut now Donald Trump is back, and aren’t things different? Or wait, are they? \n\nDuring a speech in Pittsburgh Tuesday afternoon for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, the 47th president certainly had his faculties on full display.\n\nTo start, the president claimed, without blinking, that he had already secured $16 trillion in investments into the U.S. economy. For reference, the entire GDP of the United States is under $30 trillion. Now, we all know that Donald is prone to exaggeration. We’ve all heard that his latest idea/bill/haircut is the greatest thing ever, and that some people are saying it’s the most incredible idea/bill/haircut the world has ever seen. \n\nBut this was clearly not delivered for melodramatic effect. This was the president of the United States claiming that he had single-handedly funded half of capitalism, in six months.\n\nMoments later, Trump attempted to introduce Republican Rep. Dan Meuser. \n\n“Where’s Dan?” he asked, scanning the crowd. Dave McCormick, seated beside him, had to quietly inform him that all the representatives had stayed in Washington. \n\n“Oh, they’re in Washington working on our next bill? Good!” Trump replied. “Now I don’t have to mention their names, although they’re watching on television, I guarantee.” \n\nHe laughed nervously as he said it, in quite an uncharacteristic way, and then trailed off while muttering, again, that it was “good” that “they” are working on something in D.C. It was oddly difficult to watch.\n\nThe 79-year-old president then struggled to pronounce the name of one of his own White House aides, before saying, “They tell me you’re doing great.” And, as the spicy dressing on the word salad, he added a bizarre aside about Unabomber Ted Kaczynski being a great student (“It didn’t work out too well for him” in the end, however, according to Trump, a conclusion that clearly demands intellectual rigor beyond the everyday man or woman.)\n\nIf Biden had said any of this, Fox News would have launched a live countdown to impeachment. But it’s unlikely we’ll see these gaffes dominate the news cycle — even though President Donald J. Trump, supposedly the sparkiest 79-year-old who ever damn lived, began to visibly struggle to stay awake while seated behind the microphone.\n\nThere’s something to be said here about gerontocracy, and the fact that the last election felt like watching two bald grandpas fighting over a comb, and the awfulness of having people on both sides of the aisle (the late Dianne Feinstein and the clearly struggling Mitch McConnell as two examples) hold on to power rather than relinquish it to people who have the mental and physical capacity to wield it. \n\nThere’s something to be said about Republicans sticking together, even in the face of clear dereliction of duty, and Democrats routinely turning on their own. There’s even, perhaps, something to be said about how one can sleepwalk (quite literally) into stupid-sounding lies if one is accustomed to just saying whatever one wants all the time, until eventually it becomes clear that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nTrump is vulnerable at this moment, writing as he has on Truth Social that he’s disappointed in his “boys” and “gals” for not letting themselves be gaslit into believing there was no Epstein list after all. Elon Musk is calling for a new party, as Laura Loomer and Tucker Carlson are being periodically, and loudly, more disloyal. Vice President J.D. Vance isn’t exactly coming to a resounding defense of his running mate each time controversy rears its head, either.\n\nSo it really might’ve been a good idea for Trump to bring his A-game to events right now. Instead, he showed, in a few short remarks, that he has very little knowledge of the reality of the American economy; is incapable of remembering where his own representatives are, to the point that he’ll invite one onstage who is literal states away; doesn’t appear to have heard of his aide; and cannot stay awake during an early afternoon public appearance. \n\nIt’s hard to sell “disruptor” and “firebrand” when you’re falling asleep at the table and muttering people’s names semi-coherently. \n\nBut of course, as we know, all of this will simply be absorbed into the MAGA mythos: just another quirk of the ever-evolving, benevolent Trumpian character. The Republicans will carry him, even if they saw ten times less from Biden and called it reprehensible. And they won’t do it because they truly think he’s sharp. They’ll do it because, in the end, they no longer think that matters.","summary":"In a few short remarks, the president revealed he has very little knowledge of the U.S. economy; is incapable of remembering where his own representatives or aides are and cannot stay awake during an early afternoon public appearance, Holly Baxter writes.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-pennsylvania-speech-mental-biden-b2789677.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/15/23/54/GettyImages-2224623687.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UvfaqppF-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-15 23:43:35","author":"Holly Baxter","authors":["Holly Baxter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":342054772,"title":"Mark Z. Barabak: He tried to keep Trump from a second term. But six months in, ‘I’m very impressed.’","text":"DENVER — Roger Hutson was never a huge fan of Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2016, he supported Marco Rubio for president, helping raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his Republican primary bid.\n\nIn 2024, Hutson worked with “No Labels,” a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents, to forge a bipartisan ticket with the express purpose of keeping either Trump or Joe Biden from winning the White House.\n\nIs this “really the best we can do in a country of 330 million people?” Hutson asked in a Denver Post opinion piece after the effort collapsed and another Trump-Biden matchup seemed inevitable. The failure, he suggested, was “a sad commentary on the status of leadership in America.”\n\nBut something unexpected happened over the last six months. Trump won Hutson over.\n\nHe’s not gone full-fledged MAGA. “No, no, no!” he insisted, scoffing at the notion of driving down the street, Trump flag waving. And he’s not about to jump on JD Vance’s political bandwagon, the likeliest vehicle for extending Trumpism in 2028 and beyond.\n\n“I’m acknowledging the accomplishments of the man in the office,” Hutson said, with emphasis on the White House’s current occupant, whom he supported over Kamala Harris. “I’m very impressed.”\n\nIt’s not, as one might suppose, because the Denver oil and gas executive is enamored of Trump’s exhortations to “Drill, baby, drill! (“No, baby, no!” is more like it, as Hutson believes oversupply would drive prices down.)\n\nRather, Hutson credits Trump with achieving a good deal of what he promised during the 2024 campaign.\n\nSecuring America’s borders. Forcing U.S. allies to cough up more for defense. Bringing Iran’s nuclear program to heel. Taking on the country’s unfair trade partners.\n\nHe still doesn’t much care for Trump’s abrasive personality, the name-calling and denigrating of people.\n\nBut Hutson’s conversion shows that in a country deeply dug into oppositional camps, where political views appear cement-hardened into place, there are still those open to persuasion and even willing to change their minds.\n\nAs confounding as that might seem.\n\nA Republican for most of his life\n\nHutson, 65, was a Republican his whole life, until leaving the party sometime in the 2010s. Or, more precisely, he felt “the party left me.”\n\nA growing stridency around abortion and same-sex marriage was particularly off-putting to Hutson, who describes himself as a conservative on fiscal issues and a live-and-let-live type on social matters. “If you’re lucky enough in life to find somebody you love,” he said, “God bless.”\n\nHutson has long been active in civic and political affairs, serving on various boards and commissions under Democrats and Republicans alike. He recalled attending a meeting some years ago when GOP leaders gathered to discuss Colorado’s increasingly blue coloration.\n\n“If winning means nominating an African American lesbian with antennae coming out of her head,” then Republicans should do so, Hutson suggested.\n\nThat didn’t go over well.\n\nBut it fit Hutson’s approach to politics.\n\nHe grew up an Army brat, moving around the world until his father completed his military career and settled in Golden, Colo., to take a job at a family lumber business. For all the impermanence — packing up and relocating just about every two years — Hutson said his upbringing was in many ways ideal, shaping his outlook to this day.\n\nThe military, he said, reflects the best of America: unity, shared purpose, teamwork. “I think it teaches you a lot of tolerance,” he said. “I think it teaches you a lot of acceptance.”\n\nHis GOP pedigree came from his father, the Army colonel. But it wasn’t the scorched-earth version of today’s Republican Party, in which Democrats and their philosophy are regarded as the root of all evil.\n\nLong ago, as leader of the Jefferson County Republican Men’s Club, Hutson invited Colorado’s governor, Democrat Roy Romer, to speak.\n\n“I was catching such hell from people. ‘How dare you invite a Democrat to speak to this group?’ ” Hutson remembered being chastised. “And I said, ‘Well, he’s our governor, isn’t he? I think it’d be an honor.'”\n\nAfter some initial puzzlement from the governor’s office — are you sure? — Romer came and spoke, holding just the kind of cross-party conversation that Hutson wishes occurred more often among politicians in worlds-apart Washington.\n\n“I’d love for Trump to have a weekly meeting with (Democratic House leader) Hakeem Jeffries,” Hutson said as he sat high above downtown Denver, his office decor — dark leather, rugged mountain landscape, a display of amber liquids — suggesting a Western cigar bar theme.\n\n“I would love for Trump to sit down weekly with (Chuck) Schumer” — the Democratic Senate leader — or bring Schumer and the GOP Senate leader, John Thune, together and say, ” ‘How do we work our way through this?’ ”\n\nCould you imagine that, Hutson asked, before answering his own question.\n\nNope. Never gonna happen.\n\nAccepting the trade-offs\n\nNothing, and no individual, is perfect. But Hutson looks to the bottom line, and he’s willing to accept trade-offs.\n\nTrump is loud and uncouth. But he’s respected on the world stage, Hutson said, in a way the shuffling Biden was not.\n\nTrump may be toying with tariffs — up, down, all around. But at least he’s addressing the country’s one-sided trade relationships in a way, Hutson said, no president has before.\n\nHe may be off base calling for a drastic ramp-up of domestic oil production. But in general, Hutson said, Trump’s welcoming message to business is, “What can we do to be more helpful?”\n\nIt’s unfortunate that innocents are being swept up in mass immigration raids. But maybe that wouldn’t have happened, Hutson said, if local officials had been more cooperative and criminal elements weren’t allowed to insinuate themselves so deeply into their communities in the first place.\n\nBesides, he said, haven’t Democrats and Republicans both said a secure border and tougher enforcement is needed before comprehensively overhauling the nation’s fouled-up immigration system?\n\n“We need to bring in the workers we need,” Hutson said. “I mean, if somebody’s coming here to work and be a meaningful part of society, God bless, man.”\n\nNot perfect. But, all in all, a better and stronger presidential performance, Hutson suggested, than many with their blind hatred of Trump can see, or are willing to acknowledge.\n\n“I’ve got to look at the results,” Hutson said, “and despite his caustic attitude and behavior, I think he’s done a really, really good job.”\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected president, Hutson recalled, one of his Democratic friends, a Black man, said to him, ” ‘Roger, you’ve got a Black president.’ And I said, ‘You know, Kevin, you’re right. And he’s my president, just like he’s your president.\n\n“‘We don’t have to agree on everything but, by God, he’s the president of the United States and we respect that office.'”\n\nHutson paused. His eyes narrowed, disapprovingly. “We’ve lost that,” he said.\n\nMark Z.

Over the next 70 years, conservative pastors self-censored, while liberal pastors ignored the rule, knowing the IRS would never enforce the law on them. This greatly benefited Democrats.\n\nDespite the code’s blatant unconstitutionality, it stood until this past week, when the IRS announced it would no longer enforce it. Congress needs to follow this up with full repeal.\n\nAnyway, a conservative columnist whom I regard highly and won’t name is lamenting this long-overdue reprieve.\n\nHe wrote that pastors who practice “partisan politics” would “dilute their primary mission,” and said he would leave any such church. “Politicians and preachers should mostly stay in their own lanes,” he wrote.\n\nThis might explain why a survey last fall indicated that millions of self-identified Christians don’t bother with elections.\n\n“The 32 million Christians sitting in the pews each week who refuse to vote are a game-changer,” concluded pollster George Barna. “It’s low hanging fruit for pastors as they try to motivate those congregants to carry out their civic duty and honor God through their influence for things that matter in our culture.”\n\nOver the years, Christian leaders such as Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Rev. Franklin Graham have been excoriated for encouraging more Christian activism, especially on social issues like marriage and abortion.\n\nWithout Mr. Falwell’s Moral Majority, Ronald Reagan may not have won his presidential races in the 1980s.\n\nChristian activism from the pulpit helped Virginia Republicans elect conservative statewide officials in 2021. It was a key element of President Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris and the GOP’s capture of both houses of Congress in 2024.\n\nAt the end of the aforementioned column, my colleague quotes Jesus telling Pontius Pilate, “‘My kingdom is not of this world’ (John 18:36). That ought to be good enough for everyone to put their priorities in the right order.”\n\nYou can just hear the ACLU and other Democrats cheering, “Yeah, what he says – stay out of these fights!”\n\nIn practice, that means Christian pastors taking the easy way out and ignoring pressing realities instead of being “salt and light.” Meanwhile, functional atheists enact immoral policies.\n\nIf you want to see what that looks like, check out any Planned Parenthood abortion mill or a public library’s drag queen story hour.\n\nI have several questions: Where in the Bible is there any limit on Jesus’ influence in this world? Where does it say that Christian pastors can address any and all sectors of life except public policy?\n\nJesus said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, but that doesn’t give Caesar a license to commit evil without opposition.\n\nShould William Wilberforce, the outspoken Christian in Great Britain’s Parliament, have stayed silent instead of working from 1790 to 1807 to end the transatlantic slave trade? After all, it was a political matter.\n\nShould pastors have been barred from supporting abolitionists in the United States before the Civil War ended slavery? Perhaps they should have “stayed in their own lane.”\n\nThe same goes for pastors who spurred enactment of the civil rights laws in the mid-1960s with a greater percentage of Republican support than from Democrats.\n\nLikewise, opposing abortion in the pulpit while declining to expose the politicians who facilitate it (the entire Democratic Party and some Republicans) is ineffectual at best.\n\nCongregations look to their clergy for guidance. If the pastors don’t bother to mention politics or elections, these must not be important. Yet, as we see every day, elections have profound consequences.\n\nAll laws have a moral dimension. Compliance, as with taxes, is not voluntary. Laws are enforced by potential violence from the state – even for traffic violations. If you don’t pay your fine, you can be jailed.\n\nIn 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court said in McCulloch v. Maryland, “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.”\n\nI don’t want pastors to “stay in their own lane.” They should speak out more forcefully against politicians who enact evil policies in the name of euphemisms such as “reproductive freedom,” “gender-affirming care,” or “social justice.”\n\nAt the same time, with the fig leaf of IRS fears gone, they can and should openly endorse upstanding candidates. This could change the world for the better.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"'They should speak out more forcefully against politicians who enact evil policies'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/pastors-should-be-more-involved-politics-not-less/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pulpit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 22:44:43","author":"Robert Knight","authors":["Robert Knight"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":341947570,"title":"Gen Z Content Creator Deja Foxx Could Become One Of The Youngest Members Of Congress","text":"A popular social media influencer is seen as a contender in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the special election to replace an Arizona congressman who died in office in March—which could make her one of the youngest members of Congress and the first of a new generation of content creators running for office to succeed.\n\nDeja Foxx, a 25-year-old political content creator, is a contender for an Arizona congressional ... More seat.\nVariety via Getty Images\n\nDeja Foxx, a 25-year-old political content creator who has over 395,000 followers on TikTok, is running for Democratic nomination in Arizona’s 7th District after only turning the minimum age to serve in Congress in April.\n\nFifty-four-year-old former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late Rep. Raul Grijalva, was widely seen as the frontrunner in the race to replace her father, but recent internal polling from Foxx’s campaign first published by Politico suggests the race is much closer—Foxx was only eight points behind Grijalva in polling done in May.\n\nFoxx was one of the youngest campaign staffers on Kamala Harris’ first presidential campaign in 2020, and has continued to produce political content on liberal issues.\n\nFoxx was also chosen as one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in media for her work on social media campaigns for companies including Prada and Nike, as well as her political work.\n\nKey Background\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., a 22-year veteran of Congress, died in March from complications from his cancer treatment, leaving a key seat open in a swing state Trump won with 52% of the vote in 2024. Arizona’s 7th district is heavily Democratic leaning, according to the Cook Political Report, meaning whoever wins Tuesday’s primary will be a heavy favorite in the Sept. 23 general election. Republicans only hold a slim majority in the House and are keen to pick up any available seats.\n\nFoxx is also one of the candidates endorsed by Leaders We Deserve, the political organization founded by former Democratic National Committee vice chair David Hogg with the intention of winning primary elections against sitting Democrats “unwilling or unable to meet the moment and are asleep at the wheel.” Hogg, another Gen Z political activist who rose to prominence after surviving the Parkland shooting in 2018, raised as much as $20 million for these primary campaigns, The New York Times reported in April. The organization also endorsed Zohran Mamdani, who came from behind to win the Democratic primary in the New York City mayoral election against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month. Mamdani was behind in the polls before defeating the former governor and Democratic Party mainstay by 12 points. Hogg left his DNC position after clashing with leadership over his primary efforts, and said he would not run for reelection after an internal committee voided his prior election to vice chair in June.\n\nHow Different Are Foxx And Grijalva?\n\nHogg’s PAC is dedicated to “electing young progressives,” but both Foxx and Grijalva are vying for progressive support in the primary campaign. Raul Grijalva was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and reliable supporter for liberal causes in the House. Adelita Grijalva has sought to portray herself similarly, and the candidates’ policy positions are similar. Both Foxx and Grijalva have extensive policy platforms dedicated to opposing President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, expanding affordable housing and fighting for environmental justice and tribal sovereignty. Foxx’s campaign also points to support for other popular left-wing causes, including Medicare for All. But Grijalva has also racked up endorsements from major progressive organizations and leaders, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as well as both of Arizona’s sitting Democratic senators, Sen. Mark Kelly and Sen. Ruben Gallego. Foxx has centered her criticism on establishment Democrats circling the wagons for establishment candidates, noting that three senior Democratic members of Congress died within the first six months of Trump’s second term, handing Republicans a larger advantage.\n\nGot a tip?

The murder counts in the deaths of former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, could carry the federal death penalty.\n\n“This political assassination, the likes of which have never occurred here in the state of Minnesota, has shook our state at a foundational level,” acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said.\n\nHe said a decision on whether to seek the death penalty “will not come for several months” and will be up to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Minnesota abolished its state death penalty in 1911, but President Donald Trump’s administration says it intends to be aggressive in seeking capital punishment for eligible federal crimes.\n\nProsecutors initially charged Boelter with the same counts. But under federal court rules they needed a grand jury indictment to take the case to trial.\n\nBoelter’s federal defender, Manny Atwal, did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the indictment and the new allegations.\n\nPolitical extremism as a motive\n\nThompson also disclosed new details at a news conference. He said investigators had found a handwritten letter by Boelter addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the shootings and made bizarre claims.\n\n“In the letter, Vance Boelter claims that he had been trained by the U.S. military off the books and he had conducted missions on behalf of the U.S. military in Asia, the Middle East and Africa,” Thompson said.\n\nBoelter also said in the letter that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had approached him about killing the state’s two U.S. senators, fellow Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith.\n\nAsked by a reporter if all that was a fantasy, Thompson replied: “Yes, I agree.”\n\n“There is little evidence showing why he turned to political violence and extremism,” Thompson said. “What he left were lists: politicians in Minnesota, lists of politicians in other states, lists of names of attorneys at national law firms.”\n\nFriends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views who had been struggling to find work. At a hearing July 3, Boelter said he was “looking forward to the facts about the 14th coming out.”\n\nIn an interview published by the New York Post on Saturday, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for Trump, but he declined to discuss why he allegedly killed the Hortmans and wounded the Hoffmans.\n\n“You are fishing and I can’t talk about my case…I’ll say it didn’t involve either the Trump stuff or pro life,” Boelter wrote in a message to the newspaper via the jail’s messaging system.\n\nBoelter also faces state murder and attempted murder charges in Hennepin County, but the federal case will go first.\n\nOther details of the case\n\nProsecutors say Boelter, 57, who has lived in rural Sibley County south of Minneapolis, was driving a fake squad car, wearing a realistic rubber mask that covered his head and wearing tactical gear around 2 a.m. on June 14 when he went to the home of Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin. He allegedly shot the senator nine times, and Yvette Hoffman eight times, but they survived.\n\nProsecutors allege he then stopped at the homes of two other lawmakers. One, in Maple Grove, wasn’t home while a police officer may have scared him off from the second, in New Hope. Boelter then allegedly went to the Hortmans’ home in nearby Brooklyn Park and killed both of them. Their dog was so gravely injured that he had to be euthanized.\n\nBrooklyn Park police, who had been alerted to the shootings of the Hoffmans, arrived at the Hortman home around 3:30 a.m., moments before the gunman opened fire on the couple, the complaint said. Boelter allegedly fled and left behind his car, which contained notebooks listing dozens of Democratic officials as potential targets with their home addresses, as well as five guns and a large quantity of ammunition.\n\nLaw enforcement officers finally captured Boelter about 40 hours later, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from his rural home in Green Isle, after what authorities called the largest search for a suspect in Minnesota history.\n\nRemembering the victims\n\nSen. Hoffman is out of the hospital and is now at a rehabilitation facility, his family announced last week, adding he has a long road to recovery. Yvette Hoffman was released a few days after the attack. Former President Joe Biden visited the senator in the hospital when he was in town for the Hortmans’ funeral.\n\nBiden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined mourners at the Hortmans’ funeral June 28. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Melissa Hortman as “the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.”\n\nHortman led the House from 2019 until January and was a driving force as Democrats passed an ambitious list of liberal priorities in 2023. She yielded the speakership to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the November elections left the House tied, and she took the title speaker emerita.","summary":"The indictment handed up lists murder, stalking and firearms charges against Vance Boelter.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/15/us-news/federal-grand-jury-indicts-vance-boelter-accused-of-killing-former-minnesota-house-speaker-melissa-hortman/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/2025-via-social-media-ramsey-108210075.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vvbiPHaC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-15 22:07:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":341940954,"title":"Comedian podcaster says he's breaking free from Trump 'cult' after massive betrayal","text":"Podcaster and comedian Andrew Schulz unleashed a viral rant against President Donald Trump for failing to release the 'list' of financier and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein's clients. \n\nSchulz and his co-host Akaash Singh kicked off their Flagrant podcast on Tuesday discussing the big scandal of the week: the administration's handling of the Epstein files.\n\nThey compared their own experiences dealing with critics calling them 'idiots' and 'bad Americans' online and Trump's MAGA haters coming for him about his 'failed' Epstein promises.\n\nEarlier in the week, Schulz and his crew wore tin-foil hats on their show as they criticized the president's failure to keep his promises to release the Epstein list, get out of foreign wars and cut spending. \n\nTrump recently bombed Iran's nuclear sites and also got his signature big, beautiful bill passed which is estimated to add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit. \n\n'I voted for none of this. He is doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. I want him to stop wars, he's funding them. I want him to shrink spending, reduce the budget, he's increasing it,' Schulz said. \n\nThe comedian had hosted Trump on his podcast in October in the weeks leading to the election despite backlash at the time.\n\nBut now he's admitting he's disappointed by Trump's actions in his second term. \n\n'I wanted something different. I was hoping for some sort of change,' he said, but he then defied anyone who tried to recruit them in their political camp. \n\n'I just want to let you all right now, I'm in neither one of your f**king cults if you want me to be in your cults you can go f**k all, I'm not a Dem cult, I'm not a Republican cult, I'm a free American I'll make my own f**king decisions, and I'll say what ever the f**k I want about whatever president is in power,' Schulz said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Schulz and his podcast crew went viral for their hilarious interview with Trump as he detailed how he used 'the weave' to respond to questions and revealed how he came up with snappy nicknames for his opponents.\n\nThe pair of hosts mocked Democratic critics who accused them of helping the president win simply by sitting down with him for an interview during the campaign and 'humanizing' him. \n\n 'You just wanna take no accountability for the fact that you ran a dead guy and a woman that couldn't speak,' Schulz said, referring to former President Joe Biden and former vice president Kamala Harris respectively. \n\nBoth hosts reminded their audience they were not surprised that a politician appeared on their show and did not keep his promises.\n\nSchulz said he wanted Trump to do three things, stop the endless wars, stop government spending into oblivion, and to release the Epstein files.\n\n'If Trump did one of the things, yeah. We would've been happy,' he said. 'Unfortunately the only one he chose was the immigration one, the one we were not that enthusiastic about.'\n\nWhen they spoke with Trump during the campaign about their distaste for his promise to deport all illegal immigrants, Trump famously promised them he would start with criminals.\n\nSchulz said he did not regret his vote for Trump, but was disappointed with the results.\n\n'Yeah. So he's done nothing on those fronts in terms of the promises he made us. But I don't regret it at all,' he said. 'I don't even regret voting for him at all. Because what you see is all these Democrats that are starting to take up the issues that he was the one campaigning on.'\n\nThe hosts noted that the White House responded to Schulz by name in a statement to Fox News, and trumpeted their newfound influence.\n\n'Andrew Schulz knows life is far better in President Trump’s America than it would have been under a weak and incompetent President Harris. As a guest on the Flagrant podcast, millions of listeners heard the President lay out his vision for America, and many voted in support of it—that’s exactly what President Trump is successfully executing. Name the issue, and the President is solving it. From the border to Biden’s inflation to fostering world peace—the results speak for themselves,' White House spokesman Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital last week.\n\n'It was the dumbest thing that the White House has ever done. I just wanna point that out, never respond to us,' Schulz joked.\n\nThey joked that in the future, they would demand a statement from the White House every time they had something critical to say about Trump.\n\n'Listen, something we say now, we expect an immediate response from the White House. Yeah. A precedent has been set. If we talk about the White House, they fu**ing respond,' Schulz laughed.\n\nSchulz welcomed former Obama White House aides Tommy Vietor and Jon Favreau from the podcast Pod Save America on the show to talk about politics, indicating it was more important than ever to talk to the other side of the political aisle.\n\nThey also welcomed Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna on the show to talk about his proposed Congressional amendment that would release all of the redacted Epstein files. \n\nSchulz said he would continue to criticize political figures and say what he thought when it came to politics. \n\n'When people fail us and fail us on the promises that they make, we should criticize them. Like what is the alternative? We just vote and then agree with every single thing that person does?' he asked. 'You know, so it's like, and you should hold the elected officials accountable. And we live in this like weird time where any measure to hold them accountable comes with immediate criticism.","summary":"Podcaster and comedian Andrew Schultz responded to the online reaction on Tuesday after he unleashed a viral rant against President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14908873/comedian-podcaster-andrew-schulz-white-house-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/15/21/100341767-0-image-a-7_1752609962674.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 21:48:47","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":341944284,"title":"Minnesota lawmaker shooter could face death penalty after federal grand jury indictment","text":"A Minnesota man was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that he fatally shot former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. \n\nThe indictment handed up lists murder, stalking and firearms charges against Vance Boelter after the deaths of Hortman, a prominent Minnesota state representative, and her husband.
