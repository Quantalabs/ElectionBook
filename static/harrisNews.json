White has also been a strong supporter of Trump over the years, including appearances on the campaign trail and speaking at several rallies. TRUMP ‘EMBODIES WHAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS ALL ABOUT,’ UFC'S DANA WHITE SAYS Prior to his inauguration in January, White praised Trump calling him the embodiment of \"what being an American is all about.\" \"Think of all the things President Trump had to go through to get back here. All the powerful forces that tried to take him down: the mainstream media, partisan prosecutors, assassins. It’s absolutely insane what this man has been through.

We are the most toughest, resilient people on Earth and nothing can stop us when we unite.\" Trump is expected to walk out to a raucous UFC crowd on Saturday night, much like he saw in November at New York City's Madison Square Garden (MSG). It came more than a week after defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election. A thunderous applause rained down, as he entered MSG for UFC 309.

Kennedy Jr. called out establishment media attacks against him in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, saying that he believes “it’s always ironic how the liberal media weaponizes woke cancel culture to safeguard the interests of Big Pharma and Big Food.”\n\nKennedy was responding to a baseless onslaught after several publications misquoted him Friday in his use of the word “retarded” to evoke the proper name of a New York state mental facility.\n\nThe deluge of condemnation came after reports of the Secretary’s remarks to a gathering of the staff of the Food and Drug Administration at the agency’s headquarters in White Oak, Maryland.\n\nMediaite spun his appearance with the headline: “FDA Staffers Dish on Unhinged Meeting With RFK Jr. Where He Called Special Olympics Athletes ‘Retarded.’”\n\nThe Daily Beast headlined it: “Staffers Walk Out of RFK Jr.’s Slur-Ridden Speech About Deep State.”\n\nKennedy told Breitbart News the coverage is yet another demonstration of the axiom by 17th century satirist Jonathan Swift: “Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it.”\n\nThe mischaracterization of Kennedy’s remarks came from the 33-minute mark of his 40-minute speech where he was explaining his passion for solving autism and other mental health issues. There, according to the speech’s official transcript, Kennedy said:\n\nBecause of my family’s commitment to these issues, I spent 200 hours at Wassaic Home for the Retarded when I was in high school. So, I was seeing people with intellectual disabilities all the time. I never saw anybody with autism. We, you know, we prided ourselves on Special Olympics about being able to take care of every child, no matter how.\n\nThe HHS Secretary said Politico reporters first mischaracterized his remarks, writing he’d used a disparaging term for the mentally disabled. Early versions of the story were corrected after Kennedy’s staff repeatedly complained to editors there. However, using anonymous sources, Politico is still reporting:\n\n“The remark jolted several FDA employees in the audience, who misheard the reference and thought he was making a derogatory remark about people with intellectual disabilities, according to two employees granted anonymity for fear of retaliation. By the end of the event, billed as a welcome from the new commissioner, Marty Makary, several FDA staffers had walked out of the rooms where the speech was being broadcast…”\n\nIn fact, Kennedy was talking about the New York state facility in Wassaic that’s gone by several names over the decades, including for many years the “Wassaic State School for the Mentally Retarded.” It was founded in 1931. Other historical names could be considered equally outdated, including the school for “Feeble Minded Children” and the “School for Mental Defectives.”\n\nAs late as 1973, the New York Times was calling it the “School for the Retarded” in its headlines.\n\n“I was referring to an institution,” Kennedy told Breitbart News. “They turned it into a vile slur of a vulnerable group that my family has spent generations championing.”\n\nThe HHS Secretary was no doubt referring to his aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics in 1968. His uncle President John F. Kennedy also pushed research into intellectual disability, including the establishment of the “President’s Panel on Mental Retardation.” The word “retarded” eventually fell out of favor as a medical term.\n\nPolitico, meanwhile, clarified its coverage of RFK Jr.’s remarks in a mid-afternoon Friday post on X:\n\n“For the record: This article and headline have been updated to make clear that Kennedy was referring to the Wassaic State School for the Mentally Retarded where he worked in high school, not using a derogatory term for people with intellectual disabilities.”\n\nBy then, however, the out of context reporting had taken flight in damning copycat headlines, tweets and comments under stories featured on news websites.\n\nMore generally, this fake attack on Kennedy comes amid a broader debate on the use of the word “retarded” and whether it should be acceptable. While Kennedy’s use of the word does not seem to fit into that debate–he was literally using the proper name of a major institution when he said the word–podcaster Joe Rogan has argued it should be culturally acceptable to use the word in a manner to describe undesirable things. Rogan has called the word’s renewed acceptance culturally in that framing as a cultural victory against cancel culture:\n\nEven with its clarification, the Politico story and others painted a negative picture of the Kennedy FDA appearance. Its Friday story also implied Kennedy insulted his audience by telling FDA employees they were the “sock puppet” of industry and that he was a conspiracy theorist for saying the “Deep State is real.”\n\nAccording to the official transcript of the speech, Kennedy was referring to the immense influence the food and drug lobby has had on the FDA as well as its revolving door of directors who have come from and gone back to those industries.\n\nKennedy told attendees: “It (the FDA) was created out of the most idealistic impulses. But it, like every agency, became captured by the industry and at one point really became a sock puppet of the industry it was supposed to regulate.”\n\nKennedy laughed when Breitbart News asked him about his emotional reaction to the coverage. He’s had to develop a thick skin. “It’s not the first time,” he told Breitbart News.\n\nKennedy has long been attacked by the establishment media, even before he abandoned the Democrat Party to first run as an independent for president last year and then endorse now-President Donald Trump.\n\nLoosely portrayed for years as an “anti-vaxxer,” Kennedy continues to maintain he’s not opposed to shots but is for “safe vaccines” and wants them studied more thoroughly.\n\nAfter a 2019 speech at a rally in Washington he was called an antisemite because he said the state surveillance ability with modern technology was far more powerful than the secret annex Anne Frank had hiding from the Nazis.\n\nWhen he suggested the COVID virus was hatched from a lab in Wuhan, the Scientific American labeled Kennedy an anti-Asian racist and “known conspiracy theorist.”\n\nLegacy Media took him to task for arguing that scientific papers showed COVID-19 was attacking certain races disproportionately, specifically blacks and Caucasians, while Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese had higher immunity. Kennedy later had to refute reports that he was hatching a bioweapon conspiracy, saying he never implied one was engineered to target groups.\n\nOther disparaging stories in 2024 reported Kennedy went looking for a job with a future Kamala Harris administration, was rebuffed, and settled for Donald Trump. Kennedy has said it was never about a job, which would pay much less than what he made as an environmental attorney, but who would commit to bringing the USA back to good health.\n\nAny other version could be nothing further from the truth. Ironically, for many years he was a harsh Donald Trump critic.\n\n“Every morning I prayed for 19 years,” he’s said in several settings. “I have been praying every day when I get out of bed that God will put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic so we can restore health to our children. And God sent me Donald Trump.”\n\nKennedy added in his conversation with Breitbart News about all this that he was “lucky” he didn’t mention the National Association of Colored People (NAACP) or the United Negro College Fund in his speech at the FDA. “The media outrage would have been predictable,” he said.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

We don’t even see ‘impact documentaries’ anymore. We see them at festivals, but they’re not being sold. The buyers aren’t really interested in impact documentaries anymore. So, it’s particularly meaningful and important that the Miami Film Festival has given me this award at this time in history.”\n\nThe presentation of the award, made by MFF executive director James Woolley, came after a screening of Williams’ 2023 feature Stamped From the Beginning – one of the rare ‘impact documentaries’ to be backed by a streamer, in this case Netflix (would Netflix acquire it today, were it were being released now, in Trump’s America? A hypothetical for another day). The film, based on the book by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, examines structural racism in the U.S. stretching from before the country’s founding up to the present day.\n\n“I think Stamped From the Beginning is particularly important now, but I also think it’s kind of inspiring for folks who are down about what’s going on in the world because this isn’t new,” Williams says. “Throughout history, especially for Black Americans, we have always fought. We’re always the people who are fighting for democracy, fighting for human rights, and in Stamped you see when we have big setbacks and historical setbacks that have happened over and over and over and over and over again to Black Americans, there’s a resistance. We get inspired, we get motivated, then there’s a [backlash], and the pendulum swings the other way. So, we’re looking at the backlash right now from the Obama years, Biden years, Kamala Harris. We’re looking at the pendulum swing, but there will be a resistance to that.”\n\nHe adds, “This isn’t permanent, what’s happening. And when someone as brilliant as Ibram X. Kendi, a historian, can look at the bigger history — that’s what’s great about seeing the film, you see it in a new light. You’re like, ‘Oh wait, this isn’t something new. This isn’t something that’s happening to us for the first time, to marginalized people, people of color.’ This has happened before, and we fought back, and we’ve won. So, I look at it as an inspirational, positive call to action.”\n\nStamped From the Beginning was shortlisted for the Academy Awards and earned a nomination for a primetime Emmy Award. It’s consonant with Williams’ 2023 Emmy-winning documentary series The 1619 Project, based on the sensational Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times series created by Nikole Hannah-Jones. In fact, Stamped connects with a great deal of the Williams canon.\n\n“There’s no one in America more resilient than Black Americans. And that’s what The Apollo was about, that’s what 1619 is about. Stamped From the Beginning, High on the Hog, all of it,” he observes. “The theme of my work is Black resilience, and that will continue in future work and will continue to be the reality of Black people. There’s no one more resilient than us. There’s no one who’s been through more than we have been through — dragged here against our will, through the Middle Passage and slavery, and thrived and defined culture in many ways in America. We’ve had a president, culture-defining music, jazz and rap, and R&B, and dance. Every fabric of American life is built on Black culture and Black labor.”\n\nStamped From the Beginning, winner of the National Book Award, was published in 2016, the year Donald Trump was elected president the first time. Now, in his second term of office, Trump has made a top priority of dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion programs – and, indeed, scrubbing mention of diversity or the achievements of African Americans from anything that falls within the purview of the federal government or that benefits from government funding. According to a New York Times report published Friday, just over a week ago the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD purged books from its library shelves related to the Holocaust, gender, LGBTQ identity, and Maya Angelou’s memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, among hundreds of other books. But it left untouched Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf and other books with a racist ideology.\n\nPer the report, “Political appointees in the Department of the Navy’s leadership decided which books to remove.”\n\nSimilarly, the Trump administration is investigating Yale, MIT and dozens of other colleges and universities “for alleged racial discrimination,” according to reports in Fortune and other news outlets, “as part of President Donald Trump’s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs.”\n\nLast week, Williams traveled to Yale for a screening of Stamped From the Beginning hosted by the university’s Office of Inclusion and Diversity.\n\n“They said to us, ‘Well, you’re probably one of the last events because Diversity and Inclusion is being renamed,’” Williams shares. “And even the Afro-American Center, which has been there for 55 years, is under threat of losing their space and shutting down.”\n\nWilliams was joined for a Q&A at Yale by Stamped producers Alisa Payne and David Teague; Dr. Kendi participated via Zoom. “The questions [from the students] were all, ‘Can you give us words of encouragement to keep fighting? How do we find the strength to keep going when all this is happening to us?’” Williams notes. “And Dr. Kendi said, ‘If you do nothing, terrible things will happen to you. You will keep suffering. But if you get out and you fight and you do something, terrible things may happen to you. So, they’re going to happen regardless. If you fight, you actually may make a difference and create change. You can sit back and let it all happen to you and do nothing, or you can go out and fight and let it all happen to you and actually maybe make a difference…’ They were very inspired by that.”\n\nWilliams says neither he nor the African American community as a whole has abandoned hope.\n\n“We going to continue to fight to uphold the ideals of democracy,” he says. “But we’re also going to continue in our lives and Black joy and the positive things and community.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor a documentary filmmaker, there’s no greater compliment than to hear the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Miami Film Festival Honors Roger Ross Williams with Impact Award for &#8216;Stamped From The Beginning&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/miami-film-festival-honors-roger-ross-williams-with-impact-award-for-stamped-from-the-beginning/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-‘Stamped-From-The-Beginnings-Roger-Ross-Williams.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 21:56:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.272},{"id":310531076,"title":"Supreme Court bows to Trump, and the Bible says he can do what he wants","text":"Now that some cases against the Trump administration are reaching the Supreme Court, it’s time to find out whether the conservatives on the nation’s highest court will remember how checks and balances work.\n\nThus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory, even though these cases only deal with early stages and preliminary relief. \n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court paused a California lower court’s ruling reinstating 16,000 probationary employees displays similar confusion about what constitutes an emergency. Six agencies being hobbled by illegal mass firings? Not an emergency. The Trump administration’s desire to keep six agencies hobbled by illegal mass firings? Totally an emergency. \n\nRelated | Supreme Court blocks order for Trump to reinstate federal workers \n\nTo be fair, the meager two-paragraph ruling doesn’t say that. Instead, it’s about standing—that the organizations that brought the lawsuit are not the proper parties to do so. That standing discussion let the court sidestep a key basis for the lower court’s reinstatement ruling: the Office of Personnel Management, which dictated and oversaw the mass firings, has no authority to do so, as one agency can’t hire and fire employees in another agency. It also rewards the Trump administration’s obviously false assertion that the individual agencies, not OPM, made the firing decisions. \n\nThe Supreme Court also decided to do Trump a solid by temporarily blocking two lower court orders reversing the removal of appointed members of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. \n\nThe removal of Cathy Harris from the MSPB destroyed that board’s quorum, so it can’t hear any matters about wrongfully fired federal employees. \n\nThe removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB means that body also has no quorum and therefore can’t hear any cases about private sector unions and labor disputes. Again, there seems to be no sense of urgency that public and private employees be allowed to pursue the remedies they’re entitled to under law. The only urgency is that Trump be allowed to do what he wants. \n\nThe Trump administration’s legal theory here is that the Supreme Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor, the nearly 100-year-old case that makes it illegal for Trump to remove the heads of these boards without cause. Normally, parties do not get to defy existing law outright and then, after being ruled against, race to the Supreme Court to make an argument about why the law should change while still refusing to follow existing law. Harris, Wilcox, and workers everywhere are the ones who are out of luck here, not the administration. \n\nAllowing the administration to change its story every time it gets caught out or to break the law whenever it suits Trump is just as much of a problem for the Supreme Court as it is for the lower courts. \n\nIt’s unimaginable that any other party—or any other administration—would be allowed this much grace. These aren’t theoretical discussions over timeless legal principles. These are cases where the administration is doing everything it can to flout the law, and everyone else is just trying to stay afloat. But somehow, it’s the administration that keeps getting its way. \n\nHouse GOP votes to ban nationwide injunctions, forgetting how much they love nationwide injunctions\n\nRepublicans are unhappy federal district courts are issuing nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration rather than narrow orders that only apply to the parties in the lawsuit. To fix that, the House GOP pushed through a bill that would bar federal district court judges from making those nationwide rulings. \n\nRelated | House Republicans rally around 'idiotic' plan to punish judges\n\nConservatives, however, love nationwide injunctions when they get to pick who does the enjoining. That’s why they file cases in two Texas courts where they’re guaranteed to get results. \n\nJudge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, has issued nationwide rulings blocking Obama-era guidance on student access to bathrooms based on gender identity, invalidating a Biden administration restriction on ghost guns, and striking down many of the Affordable Care Act’s requirements for preventative coverage. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump appointee and anti-choice fanatic Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk singlehandedly blocked the sale of mifepristone across the country, albeit only briefly.\n\nThe real issue here isn’t nationwide injunctions. It’s that the Trump administration keeps getting handed losses by pesky lower court judges who don’t understand that their job is to let Trump do whatever he wants. How dare they. \n\nTrump stays losing, defamation edition\n\nIt’s not just the Trump administration that keeps losing in federal court. \n\nTrump still faces civil cases where he’s a defendant for personal, not official, behavior. Last week, he was handed a loss when a federal judge in Pennsylvania refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by the long-exonerated Central Park Five. \n\nDuring the September 2024 presidential debate, after then-Vice President Kamala Harris brought up that Trump took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the boys, Trump doubled down, “They pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.” \n\nAfter the exonerated men sued him for defamation, Trump argued the case should be dismissed because his statement was substantially true. \n\nOf course, none of them pleaded guilty, none of them hurt anyone, and no one was killed, period, which makes Trump’s statement not even remotely true. \n\nThis ruling means their lawsuit against Trump can continue. Well, at least until Trump figures out how to get the Supreme Court to invent a new kind of presidential immunity that covers his actions as a private citizen. \n\nThe Bible says Trump can target law firms. Checkmate, libs.\n\nIf you ever wanted to see what it would look like if a Daily Caller comment section gained sentience and wrote a legal brief, look no further. \n\nA motley collection of fringe gun types joined forces with a couple of the more low-rent conservative legal groups to file a truly breathtaking amicus brief in Perkins Coie’s lawsuit against the Trump administration over the executive order targeting that law firm. \n\nTypically, amicus briefs are intended to provide additional expertise or context beyond what is presented by the parties in the case. \n\nThis … isn’t that. Instead, it’s a wild ride that cites multiple random Bible verses that happen to mention judges, leans heavily on a Dan Bongino book from 2018, and stitches together a bunch of news articles about the Steele Dossier and former Perkins Coie attorney Marc Elias. It also has a list of injunctions and restraining orders issued against the administration. Actual law, not so much. \n\nTaken together, this is all supposed to prove that the lower federal courts hate Trump and “are working at the behest of Big Law and Democrat state Attorneys General to resist the very changes which the American People elected President Trump to implement.” \n\nIt’s tough to develop a conspiracy theory that sounds more unhinged than those floated to support Trump’s contention that he won the 2020 election, but this one might just take the cake. \n\nBig Law watch: Which knees this week?\n\nBy this time last week, another two big firms, Milbank and Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, had each agreed to give the administration $100 million in pro bono work to avoid the now-familiar attack by executive order. \n\nThis week, mega-firms Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett are reportedly preparing to do the same. Trump boasted about his latest victory on his social media platform on Friday, claiming the firms will provide “$500 Million Dollars in pro bono and other free Legal services, during the Trump Administration and beyond.” \n\nAt least the earliest firms to buckle didn’t know yet that Trump would make a mockery of their vague agreements about shared pro bono goals. But the Trump team spent this week crowing about firms that “bend the knee”—an actual quote from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt—saying they’ll provide free legal services to implement his so-called America First agenda, perhaps by representing coal companies or negotiating tariff deals. \n\nSomehow, that didn’t deter more of America’s highest-paid and highest-profile lawyers from lining up for the same treatment. Meanwhile, their willingness to let Trump take over their firms just emboldened him further. \n\nHis latest executive order is against Susman Godfrey, saying the firm “spearhead[ed] efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.”\n\nRelated | Trump targets law firm that made Fox News pay for 2020 election lies\n\nSusman isn’t a firm associated with representing mostly Democrats or employing lawyers Trump hates. Nor is it a firm that usually handles election matters. However, Susman represents Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuits against Fox News, Newsmax, Rudy Giuliani, and other 2020 Big Lie types. Susman also represents Media Matters in its lawsuit against Elon Musk’s X. \n\nSo now, even if a firm steers clear of Democratic clients and election work and never employs someone Trump is mad at, it’s still not enough.","summary":"Now that some cases against the Trump administration are reaching the Supreme Court, it’s time to find out whether the conservatives on the nation’s highest court will remember how checks and balances work.\n\n\n\nThus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory, even though these cases only deal with early stages and preliminary relief. \n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court paused a California lower court’s ruling reinstating 16,000 probationary employees displays similar confusion about what constitutes an emergency.

The party paid for some of the influencers' travel costs, but it insists there was no requirement for the attendees to post, let alone share something positive.\n\nRather, it was part of an influencer outreach program that has been running for a year. As part of this, Labor is continuing to consider how it can engage with content creators as part of its on-the-road campaign, but so far none have joined them.\n\nLabor also appeared to have sent an early copy of its press release about a mental health policy announcement to Bannister, as is common with mainstream media outlets.\n\nCollaborative posts across the parliament\n\nOther parties and candidates are engaging in the influencer space too.\n\nOlympic diver and social media star Sam Fricker was invited to attend Peter Dutton's budget reply speech, and filmed a video with him afterwards. Fricker said he was not paid.\n\nGreens senator Larissa Waters has also filmed videos with supportive content creator Holly MacAlpine, who is a party member but said she had never been paid to create political content. Both Greens leader Adam Bandt and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also made high profile appearances on Abbie Chatfield's podcast It's A Lot, but she too said no payment was involved.\n\nAs politicians continue to engage with podcasters and other social media personalities, the Australian Electoral Commission has updated its guidance, telling politicians and parties they must authorise co-authored Instagram posts with influencers.\n\nHow much influence does an influencer have?\n\nWhie some politicians have sought to raise concerns about the rise of influencers in the political space, there's acknowledgement from all sides that they are a useful communication vehicle to connect with younger and online audiences. \n\nParticularly podcasts. The general consensus is it's an hour of their time, can result in hundreds of thousands (if not more) of ears and eyes across various platforms, and largely doesn't have the same combativeness a journalist might apply. It's also just a chance to meet Australians where they are: online.\n\nHannah Ferguson is a 26-year-old podcaster and commentator who delivers \"news that talks back\" through her business Cheek Media. Across her Instagram accounts, her following is 200,000 strong.\n\nFerguson says she's talking to an audience of largely young women — a demographic that can be hard to capture through traditional media. That makes her and Cheek Media influential, and politicians know it.\n\nIn recent weeks she's landed interviews with both PM Albanese and Greens leader Bandt. \n\nIn a sign of how influential those in the halls of Canberra think content creators have become, nearly a dozen politicians cleared time in their schedules during a busy sitting week in February to meet her, including Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.\n\nFerguson was also one of the social media influencers invited to the federal budget lock-up, where they received a briefing from Senator Gallagher. She said her travel was not paid for.\n\n\"I think that the new wave is Instagram and TikTok and…what they [voters] are consuming defines their view of the news and their view of politicians, so I think it's hugely important,\" Ferguson says. \"It could define the federal election in 2025.\"\n\nPolitical marketing expert Andrew Hughes called this election a \"tipping point\" because of how many people consume news through their devices.\n\n\"That means now you have to have knowledge of online platforms and methods to be effective at changing behaviour in politics,\" he says.\n\nThe political influence of influencers is growing\n\nFerguson's page posts news, but she says she's not a journalist. She's openly biased and admits she's trying to sway voters to the left.\n\n\"I would describe it as incredibly left wing, progressive feminist content, I don't think there's any point in shying away from that language,\" she said.\n\n\"I am a young, 26-year-old woman with my own company, and I am talking, especially, to an audience of young women, predominantly about the issues they are facing.\"\n\nShe's a former Labor party member, current Greens member and supports the independent cause. So much so, she sits on the advisory council of Viva Fund — which distributes money to female independent candidates.\n\nShe's also fiercely anti-Peter Dutton — to the point she had T-shirts made.\n\nAustralian laws not keeping up\n\nAhead of the upcoming election, political marketing researcher at the Australian National University, Andrew Hughes, has been observing the influence of content creators and is concerned transparency isn't top of mind for everyone.\n\n\"If you're a person on TikTok [and] you've got 100,000 people watching you and watching your content, when you put a view out — are you influenced by a political party, or are you doing it because you're a person?\" he questioned.\n\n\"I think that point will become very hard to spot in the years ahead.\"\n\nHe said Australian laws had failed to keep pace with the changing online environment.\n\n\"There's been no clarity at all provided in Australian legislation on having podcasters identify their brand partnerships, and particularly whether or not they're being paid any money for a brand partnership to do an interview which is friendly or not towards a leader,\" he said.\n\n\"That's the scary thing.\"\n\nPodcasts allow personality over policy\n\nNovember's US election saw both Presidential candidates turn to podcasts to connect with an audience they may not otherwise have been able to — and they clocked up millions of views.\n\nJoe Rogan's interview with Donald Trump was watched on YouTube by more than 60 million people, while Shannon Sharpe's chat with Kamala Harris reached 1.7 million eyes on YouTube. Dr Hughes warned the pivot to podcasts put greater emphasis on the person rather than their policies.\n\nHughes warned it put a greater emphasis on the person rather than their policies.\n\n\"It means we move away from policy analysis,\" he said.\n\nThat was already becoming clear in the Australian campaign, Hughes said, with both leaders appearing in a series of podcast interviews.\n\n\"The leaders have come out quite clearly with a plan to make people like them, make people see that other side to them — the non-political side to them.\"","summary":"Politicians are on a mission this election to connect with voters online like never before.

Shapiro appearance hints about future of Democratic Party","text":"Believe it or not, the 2028 presidential election isn’t all that far off, especially in this modern era of political fundraising and positioning. On the Republican side, one might assume that Vice President J. D. Vance is a strong favorite to be the party’s nominee to succeed President Donald Trump. On the other side, the Democratic Party is in shambles, lacking a standard-bearer, a message, or policies that register on the common-sense meter. That doesn’t mean that the jockeying hasn’t begun. On the West Coast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has started distancing himself from progressive policy and ideology, publicly admitting that biological men competing against biological women in sports is unfair. Newsom has even started a podcast, on which he has featured right-wing commentators such as Charlie Kirk.\n\nHere in Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro has begun to do the same thing. He recently appeared on Bill Maher’s HBO program to position himself as a moderate Democrat. Shapiro spoke with the host of “Real Time” on a variety of subjects, including the Democratic Party’s struggle with male voters, whether his Jewish heritage played a role in losing out to Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate, and other issues.\n\nShapiro and Newsom’s gradual slide rightward is part of a plan to separate themselves from Democrats’ left-wing faction in light of new polling that shows an historic decline for Democrats. According to CNN, the Democrats’ favorability rating has plummeted to just 29%, the lowest mark since 1992, and it represents a twenty-point drop in just four years.\n\n“Common sense is going to be what wins the election. Trump has already said, ‘I want a revolution of common sense.’ The fact that he can appropriate that term!” Maher marveled. “I’m not sure he’s the arbiter of common sense,” Shapiro replied. “That’s certainly one reason why he won the election,” Maher said. “People saw Democrats as less commonsensical.”\n\nMaher is right: Trump won because his policies made sense. A thriving economy, reducing inflation, cutting spending, creating energy independence, securing the border, stopping pointless wars and restoring law and order. That message resonated. It won.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party decided to label straight, white, male voters as the definition of toxic masculinity. The question remains: How will Democrats win those voters back, after alienating them and speaking down to them? It’s not by nominating a Jasmine Crockett, J. B. Pritzker, or even a Gavin Newsom. Josh Shapiro is likely their best chance in 2028. But bridging the great American political divide will be easier said than done.\n\nAccording to Steve Kornacki of NBC News, the largest divide in the American electorate is between white, non-college-educated male voters and white, college-educated female voters. The data reflect a massive ideological gap that might not be correctable in one election cycle. Trump enjoys a +41 rating with non-college white males. He registers a -38 with college-educated white women. That’s a 79-point difference. The same pattern and trend exists between the two demographics when the personalities or topics are replaced. Swap out Trump and insert J. D. Vance, Elon Musk, DOGE, Ukraine, or DEI policies and the results are almost identical.\n\nFactor in Trump’s gains with the Latino community as well as the gains he made with African-American male voters, and the Democrats face an uphill battle, to say the least. They have fallen out of favor with common-sense, middle-of-the-road, working-class men.\n\nMaher asked Shapiro if Democrats have a problem courting male voters. Shapiro denied it. “I don’t think we do,” he said. “I think it’s about giving everybody equal opportunity.”\n\nThe evidence points the other way. The female vote is not enough to carry Democrats over the finish line. Neither is the support of coastal elites or fringe communities. They need more male voters to abandon the GOP – or overcome their voting apathy and come out and support Democrats. If Shapiro’s appearance on Maher’s program was a preview of the case he’ll make nationally a few years from now, it doesn’t bode well for the Democratic Party.","summary":"'Gradual slide rightward' called part of a plan to distance from 'left-wing faction'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/shapiro-appearance-could-hint-about-future-of-democrat-party/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/josh-shapiro-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 17:02:45","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":310523430,"title":"‘Kookin’ with Kamala’: Marlow Suggests Harris Starts New Career as Social Media ‘Chef-luencer’","text":"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Ingraham Angle,” “Alex Marlow Show” host and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow talked about the prospects for Kamala Harris and her possible future endeavors.\n\nMarlow stated, “[S]he’s dominating the Democrat polls right now for 2028, but she’s actually fading really fast relative to the field.

The former Biden official made the point on Friday's \"The Weekly Show with John Stewart Podcast.\" Buttigieg discussed with the host how Democrats could better get their message out to voters following the 2024 presidential election loss. \"My party’s all up in arms about who’s our Joe Rogan. We’re not going to have a Joe Rogan of the left. That’s not how it works,\" he said. THEO VON ATTENDS TRUMP'S 'INSPIRING' INAUGURATION, DECLARES IT'S 'TIME TO PUT AMERICA FIRST' Stewart agreed with the statement, offering his view that the party can’t just produce at will a top global podcast that will amplify liberal thought. \"It’s also not something you can conjure in the way that – they just think, ‘Oh, let’s inorganically build this thing.’ Those positions have been built over time, and they’ve earned their credibility, and they’ve earned their authenticity, and they’ve earned all those things that they have. You can’t just poof them into existence,\" the Comedy Central host stated. Buttigieg offered this assessment of his fellow Democrats: \"The other big thing that my party is terribly behind on is where we say it. And by this I mean what media spaces we are in.\" \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" is one of the world’s most influential podcasts and has a massive audience of male viewers – a demographic that was considered crucial to President Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory. JOE ROGAN CALLS OUT LIBERALS FOR INSISTING MUSK USED NAZI SALUTE: ‘BULLS--- GAME’ Bloomberg reported in January, \"Over the past two years, a set of massively popular podcasters and streamers cemented themselves as the new mainstream source of information for millions of young men, and, according to a new Bloomberg analysis, used their perch to rally these constituents in support of Trump and the political right.\" Trump’s own interview with the podcast giant in the final weeks of his campaign drew tens of millions of viewers. The conversation and Rogan’s ultimate endorsement of Trump’s candidacy were seen as a boon for Trump. Even the Democratic Party knew the importance of Rogan’s platform, looking to get former Vice President Kamala Harris on his show before Election Day. Those plans fell through, though the former Democratic presidential candidate appeared on other prominent podcasts like \"Call Her Daddy\" before the end of the race. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Despite some of the party’s desire to replicate Trump’s success with Rogan, Buttigieg told Stewart it needs to focus on its own original strategy of finding new voters, including going into more conservative spaces. \"I think we are really struggling to find people where they are,\" Buttigieg said. \"I could be the tenth person to say roughly the same thing on a liberal show, or I could literally be the first time somebody heard a certain idea if I’m in a more conservative space,\" he added, noting the party should be reaching out to people who are \"not always looking for politics.\" \"People who have other s--- to do!\" Stewart said. \"Yeah,\" Buttigieg replied.

On social media or on big awards show stages, Hollywood stars have let viewers know where they stand on hot-button issues – whether they wanted to know or not. Peter singled out Rachel Zegler and Selena Gomez as two of the more recent vocal celebrities. In January, Gomez posted a video to her Instagram in which she cried over the state of immigration in the U.S. Based on her next moves, including walking the Oscars red carpet in an expensive ensemble, Peter suggested her teary message was for show. \"People are kind of just tired of Hollywood telling us what we're supposed to do,\" Peter told Fox News Digital. \"I think this past year has been pretty indicative of that. You know, Hollywood virtue signaling and pretending that they care about these causes. Like Selena Gomez, remember when she was just a few weeks ago crying about immigration and then two weeks after that, she's on a red carpet dripped out in jewels and suddenly immigration is just not important to her anymore?\" SELENA GOMEZ POSTS, QUICKLY DELETES VIDEO CRYING ABOUT TRUMP'S ICE DEPORTATIONS AND DISPLAYING AMERICAN FLAG \"All my people are getting attacked, the children,\" Gomez said through tears in the Instagram video. \"I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something, but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise.\" She deleted the message shortly afterward, before posting another, now-deleted Instagram story with a caption reading, \"Apparently it’s not okay to show empathy for people.\" \"So I think people just feel like it's fake, right?\" Peter said. \"It's a lot of virtue signaling. It's a lot of pandering that I think people are just tired of. We don't want to be lectured to.\" \"Snow White\" star Rachel Zegler's own controversial social media posts were partly blamed for the underwhelming box-office performance of Disney's remake of the 1937 animated classic the past few weeks. In the months leading up to the film's release, Zegler posted \"Free Palestine\" on X, and wished on Instagram that President Donald Trump and his supporters \"never know peace.\" ‘SNOW WHITE’ STAR RACHEL ZEGLER BLUNTED DISNEY'S ‘MAGIC’ WITH OUTSPOKEN POLITICS, ‘NO FILTER’ HOST SAYS When asked how Hollywood has reacted to Trump's second term, Peter again questioned celebrities' motives and whether they're actually helping to solve the issues they're sounding off on. \"So I think people have kind of tuned out when celebrities make their political-pandering comments on social media, unless you're really like Rachel Zegler where you're coming out strong with an opinion that is kind of polarizing,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to share your support for something without isolating people at the same time. And so I think we need more of that. If you're going to talk about it, at least try to make the message unifying rather than creating more political division.\" \"And then when it comes to Trump specifically, I mean, I don't know, I haven't seen many – I think what you have like the Jane Fondas who are going to go out and use the award stage to make a comment about how woke just means empathy, but I see a lot of Hollywood doubling down on things that I think clearly just missed the mark,\" he added. JANE FONDA DEFENDS ‘WOKE’ AT SAG AWARDS, RALLIES HOLLYWOOD TO ‘RESIST’ TRUMP While accepting her Life Achievement Award at the 2025 Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards, veteran actress Jane Fonda defended the word \"woke\" as simply meaning that one \"cares.\" \"What we [actors] create is empathy,\" Fonda said. \"Our job is to understand another human being so profoundly that we can touch their souls.\" Despite how prominent their perches are, Peter noted, liberal celebrities' influence is clearly limited based on who won the 2024 election.

But time is ticking. Aside from public service pensions, former vice presidents don’t receive the same post-office funding as ex-presidents, and Harris may soon need to line up new income sources—especially after burning through campaign cash during her failed 2024 run.\n\nThe idea of starting a policy institute — a common move for former politicians — has raised eyebrows even within her own camp. Allies warn that fundraising for such a center could expose her to political headaches down the line, especially if she chooses to run for California governor in 2026 or take another shot at the White House in 2028. Harris has told people she sees those two paths as mutually exclusive — and must decide soon.While she’s stayed largely out of the spotlight since November, she’s made a few public remarks — including a speech earlier this month warning against “capitulating” to Trump’s use of executive power. She also addressed Democratic activists in Wisconsin by Zoom ahead of that state’s Supreme Court election, but local operatives declined her offer to visit in person, fearing it could become a distraction.\n\nFormer second gentleman Doug Emhoff, 60, has returned to the legal world with a lucrative gig at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, pulling in a reported $6 million a year — even as the firm struck a Trump-approved deal that Emhoff opposed behind the scenes.\n\nThe New York Post reached out to the former VP’s office.","summary":"The former vice president is weighing whether to launch an “institute for policy and ideas,” with longtime adviser Brian Nelson quietly reaching out to universities.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/12/us-news/kamala-harris-mulls-launching-think-tank-reports/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-mnaiftnyu-1744473476705.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744459084&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 15:58:12","author":"Jack Richards","authors":["Jack Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":310461856,"title":"Why the end of obnoxious influencer culture may finally have arrived","text":"Influencers — those obnoxious (and increasingly) political hype beasts who’ve defined much of internet life in the last decade — may finally be going the way of the Apple Watch: once a flashy trendsetter, now a garish relic. \n\nWhen a jacked-up fitness bro went viral in late March for a video flaunting his daily six-hour morning saga of 4 a.m. pushups, mineral water ice plunges, and banana peel facials, it was mocked into oblivion.\n\nHipsters posted their own derisive morning routines, huffing on flavored vapes and chugging Red Bull; grannies filmed themselves putting in their dentures before settling in on the john. One man from India did his take: dunking his face in a bowl of chutney then hopping on the phone to scam Westerners for their banking info. \n\nFrankly, even the most devoted followers are finally becoming fed up with just how fake influencing has become. \n\nAccounts like Instagram’s Influencers In The Wild (now with 5.2 million followers) became the first to gain popularity by sharing candid, alternate-angle videos taken of clout chasers doing their thing in public — usually exposing how staged and ridiculous they are.\n\nRecently, eight influencers in China contracted a foot fungus around the same time — it was later revealed they’d been sharing the same pair of Gucci tights for content where they pretend to be rich and glamorous. \n\nInternet sleuths have found fake private jet studios where influencers pay around $60 to rent the space to create polished illusions of private air travel. And some luxury hotels have moved to ban influencers altogether, tired of them begging for free accommodations or pooling their money together to rent suites to stage their phony fabulousness. \n\nPlenty of other digital tastemakers are being exposed as just plain jerks: like the couple who asked a London-based musician to fly to their extravagant wedding in Ibiza, write a personalized song for them, and perform a one-hour set. They couldn’t offer money but promised to pay him in “promo posts.” \n\nNot only are people sick of being made to feel bad about themselves by those who, more likely than not, have more sordid lives than the average person, the greatest currency in media today is authenticity.\n\nThat’s one reason cable news has tanked, and podcasts are dominating — the latter provides buttoned-down conversations from personalities with whom the audience feels a connection. \n\nCompare that to the nipped, tucked, scripted bells and whistles of television — or a travel vlogger gushing about a “remote paradise” that’s actually just an AI-edited tourist trap.\n\nAnd increasingly, we expect authenticity from our politicians, too. Trump’s matter-of-fact style and ad-libbed three-hour-long rallies couldn’t have been a greater contrast to Kamala Harris’s fine-tuned duplicity and fake laugh. \n\nSocial media audiences haven’t only caught on to rented Birkin bags and phony housewives agonizing over, say, their child’s artisanal packed lunch featuring a gold-dusted bento box. Political influencers are feeling the backlash, too. \n\nLast month, as the DOGE revolution slashed government waste and Trump’s HHS Secretary RFK Jr. aimed to Make America Healthy Again, several prominent MAGA X accounts suddenly defended using food stamps for junk food products like Coke. \n\nExploiting a “small government”/anti-authoritarian angle, the campaign was likely buoyed by payments from Big Soda, especially since sugary drinks account for 10% of the USDA’s $113 billion annual food stamp spending and an estimated 20-40% of Coke’s revenue.\n\nFor the influencers, it was a misstep that risked their credibility, presuming their audience would gracefully accept that welfare recipients buying junk food with taxpayer funds actually aligned with the finer points of libertarianism. \n\nWorse, many tried to weaponize the president’s notorious love of Diet Coke in their arguments — suggesting that if you don’t support taxpayer money going to Coca-Cola, you fail the MAGA purity test.\n\nBeyond pay-for-play, X has turned into a relentless engagement mill since it started financially rewarding interactions, amplifying the post-election aimlessness of political influencers and transforming daily news into a shrill echo chamber of simplistic, click-chasing noise.\n\nMore people seem to be tuning out from all of this grasping artificiality; 34% of Gen-Zers have quit one or more social media platforms, according to advertising giant Hill Holiday. \n\nAnd that might be good news for parents. \n\nA 2023 survey found 56% of Zers wanted to pursue influencing as a career, compared with another study noting that the same number of Chinese kids considered astronauts to be their dream job.\n\nAmerican kids appear to view influencing as an easy path to wealth. Parents, it’s time to have the talk — reality clearly tells a different story.","summary":"Influencers may finally be going the way of the Apple Watch: once a flashy trendsetter, now a garish relic. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/12/opinion/why-the-end-of-influencer-culture-may-finally-have-arrived/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/influencer-culture-postscript-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744449017&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gdsFwgmf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-12 15:00:00","author":"Chadwick Moore","authors":["Chadwick Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.103},{"id":310469414,"title":"Kamala Harris mocked on social media for reported interest in creating an institute for policy and ideas","text":"Social media commentators had a field day after a report that former Vice President Kamala Harris was considering starting a center for \"policy and ideas.\" The New York Times released a piece on Thursday, headlined, \"Sidelined and Still Processing Her Defeat, Harris Looks for a Way Back In.\" The article observed how Harris and her husband are \"weighing each new opportunity with the potential political blowback in mind\" as they chart a course for the future. \"One possibility: establishing an institute for policy and ideas,\" The Times reported. \"Brian Nelson, an adviser to Ms. Harris since she was California’s attorney general, has broached the idea with several universities, including Howard and Stanford.

This makes him the oldest president yet. Trump started his presidency in January after defeating Kamala Harris. He underwent the first physical exam of his second term as the president on Friday.\n\nThe results of the test will be released by Sunday. He said the test went well. This test was conducted at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He said he was prodded and poked for several hours.\n\nThe test has been important due to his age and how people have seen him decline over the years. Even the experts have weighed in that he may have an onset of Alzheimer’s. He has exhibited the symptoms in public and it’s not hidden from everyone. There seems to be a cognitive decline in him that often comes with age. He was seen slurring his speech during his Musk interview, to which he said it was a technical glitch.\n\nBesides, Trump often prefers fast food, which isn’t good for health. We saw his McDonald’s photograph as a part of his campaign last year.\n\nAbout his physical exam, Trump revealed to the reporters, “It went, I think, well! Every test you can imagine; I was there for a long time, the yearly physical.” He concluded that he did well and the reports will be released on Sunday. Their Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also declared the tests to be released at the earliest.\n\nThe liberal panic about President Trump’s health is ABSURD considering what Democrats and the media did to cover up Joe Biden’s mental and physical decline. pic.twitter.com/OkvxwM47vN\n— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 11, 2025\n\nWe don’t know what data will be included in the report as Trump is not under an obligation to release any information. Trump has claimed to be younger and fitter than Biden. In 2018, he underwent a check-up and doctors advised him to change his diet, exercise and shed some weight to maintain his health. He may be advised the same things even now so he can be healthy.\n\nAlong with physical tests, Trump also underwent a cognitive exam. He said he got all the answers right. He wanted to do something different than what Biden did during his last term as the president. He claims he is in good shape, and his heart and soul are both in good health. Trump was so confident after the test that he bragged, “I don’t know what to tell you other than I got every answer right.”\n\nAnnual physical shows President Trump ‘remains healthy’ – https://t.co/5BRMc5i2MI #OANN pic.twitter.com/SAcQ5Mmn6W\n— One America News (@OANN) June 4, 2020\n\nThe physical test is a good way to assess Trump’s health. Earlier, he was grazed by a bullet during his campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Although the injuries were not serious, he is still 78 and has physical limitations. At one event, he had to be herded back from the stage and also had a change in the way he walks, which often comes with age.\n\nAging does have an impact on the cognitive and behavioral ability of a person. Netizens see how Trump has been in public. One of them commented on how he has access to the nuclear codes. Another one says this is our president when Trump fumbled saying his own name.","summary":"Donald Trump reveals he feels good and did well in the physical exam conducted during his second term as the President.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-says-he-did-well-in-first-physical-of-second-term-results-coming-soon","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Donald-Trump-undergoes-physical-checkup.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 11:51:33","author":"Diksha","authors":["Diksha"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":310413802,"title":"Neither Trump Nor The A.P. Controls Our Words","text":"The Associated Press recently won in court, challenging President Donald Trump's decision to exclude the news organization from the White House press pool. The dispute began over the president's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and the A.P.'s refusal to fully adopt the renaming in its style guide.\n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden—a Trump appointee—ruled that the president's unconstitutional actions amounted to viewpoint discrimination by the government. \"The Court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists—be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere—it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,\" wrote McFadden in his decision. \"The Constitution requires no less.\"\n\nBefore this decision, Julie Pace, the A.P.'s executive editor and senior vice president, encouraged Americans to look at the big picture. \"For anyone who thinks the Associated Press's lawsuit against President Trump's White House is about the name of a body of water, think bigger,\" wrote Pace in The Wall Street Journal. \"It's really about whether the government can control what you say.\"\n\nPace is spot-on. Americans shouldn't lose sight of the big picture: The principles of free speech—codified by the First Amendment—protect individuals from an onerous, censorial government seeking to control what words citizens use. \n\nBut this debate is bigger than overly spray-tanned authoritarians and fussy grammarians duking it out in court. \n\nEven Trump's War on the Media Has Its Limits\n\nTrump's legal dispute with the A.P. is just one episode in his ongoing war against journalism, an institution he has called \"the enemy of the people.\" \n\nThough he often decries the \"weaponization\" of the judicial system, the president rarely passes up the opportunity to use lawfare as his go-to cudgel. Over the past three decades, Trump has been involved in more than 3,500 legal battles in federal and state courts, according to one report. In 2023 alone, Trump sued 20 media organizations. \"The consistent theme is his willingness to use the court system, even as a public figure and a public official, to silence people, to force them to correct statements, to just generally make them uncomfortable,\" Kevin Goldberg, vice president at Freedom Forum, a free speech organization, told Axios. \n\nAnd this litigious strategy has, for the most part, paid off for him.\n\nIn March 2024, Trump sued ABC News for George Stephanopoulos's questions directed at Rep. Nancy Mace (R–S.C.) about her support for a president found \"liable for rape by a jury.\" (Technically, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse, not rape.) In December 2024, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump, agreeing to pay $15 million to his presidential library and $1 million in legal fees. \n\nTrump also filed a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News' parent company, Paramount Global, for a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The president claimed video editors deceptively edited the footage, calling the segment a \"news distortion\" and accusing the show of engaging in \"partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference.\" In addition to the suit against Paramount, the Trump administration has pursued a parallel Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigation into how 60 Minutes edited the Harris interview. \n\nBut Trump's authority, especially over the media, is far from limitless. \n\nConcerned about the partisan tables turning in the future, a coalition of center-right organizations—including the Center for Individual Freedom, Americans for Tax Reform, and Taxpayers Protection Alliance—encouraged the Trump administration to stop the FCC investigation of CBS, stating that an \"adverse ruling against CBS would constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs.\" \n\nOther right-leaning entities have also expressed their concern about blowback from a future, less ideologically aligned administration. Fox News and Newsmax, both vocal supporters of Trump, joined 40 other news organizations—many of whom Trump frequently refers to as \"fake news\"—in opposing Trump's exclusion of the A.P. \"We fear a future administration may not like something that Newsmax writes and seeks to ban us,\" stated Newsmax representatives. \"This is why news organizations like Newsmax and Fox News are supporting the A.P.'s First Amendment rights though we may disagree with its editorial point of view from time to time.\" \n\nThe A.P.'s legal victory draws a clear line in the sand that no amount of executive authority can cross. But the A.P. has its limits, too. \n\nTo A.P. or Not to A.P.\n\nThe A.P. style is ubiquitous in journalism. Publications ranging from The Washington Post to Breitbart follow A.P. style. Truthfully, if Trump barred press access based on A.P. style guidance, very few outlets would remain in the White House press pool. \n\nBut even adherents of the A.P. style don't follow every single stylistic recommendation. Many have unique stylistic carveouts. Even Reason, which mostly follows the A.P.'s guidelines, maintains some bespoke exceptions. \n\nEven anti-Trump partisans don't fully embrace all of the A.P.'s guidance. \"You can't get mad at the A.P. for not using your stupid name,\" Stephen Colbert joked on The Late Show. \"The thing you should get mad at the A.P. about is not using the Oxford comma in their style guide.\"\n\nDespite Trump's claims, A.P. style neither bans using the Gulf of America nor fully endorses the Gulf of Mexico. Instead, the entry splits the difference, advising to \"refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.\" The A.P.'s guidance is no different than modifying references to other popular rebrands, such as X, or the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nInterestingly, the A.P. aligns with Trump on his other controversial landmark rebranding: Mount McKinley, or the mountain formerly known as Denali. \"The Associated Press will use the official name change to Mount McKinley,\" wrote Amanda Barrett, the A.P.'s vice president of standards and inclusion. \"The area lies solely in the United States and as president, Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country.\" \n\nYet, local usage diverges from A.P. style. Only 26 percent of Alaska—a state that Trump won by 13 percentage points—supports the president's name change. The 20,000-foot mountain is a source of local pride for Alaskans and represents the region's indigenous culture, so their linguistic intransigence is understandable. Though the mountain's \"official\" name has ping-ponged since 1917, Alaskans haven't deviated from Denali. \"In Alaska, it's always been Denali,\" Holly Cusack-McVeigh, an anthropologist at Indiana University, Indianapolis, explained in The Conversation. \n\nThe same goes for the Gulf of America. A Reuters poll found seven out of ten Americans oppose renaming the Gulf of Mexico. Other polling mirrors these numbers. \n\nGeographic rebranding has often struggled to bridge the gap between officialdom and usage. Vietnamese people refer to their largest city as Saigon informally, but write Ho Chi Minh City on official documents. Though Myanmar attained its official name following the 1989 military junta, 68 percent of the country still uses the informal name Burma, with some claiming the name change \"reeks of government\" and is a \"form of censorship.\" India has also struggled with city names, such as Mumbai and Kolkata, because of its colonial past. \n\nLanguage doesn't abide by official proclamations. Instead, popular usage—or, as defined by the Chicago Manual of Style, \"the collective habits of a language's native speakers\"—owns the naming rights. Moreover, usage better reflects human communication. \n\nThe Spontaneous Order of Language\n\nAustrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously said, \"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\" The same can be said about the limits of power. \n\nLanguage lacks a central authority. Neither the traditional literary gatekeepers (e.g., linguists, lexicographers, and grammarians) nor political leaders (especially the ones barking Orwellian newspeak like \"tariffs are tax cuts\") are the final arbiters of how humanity communicates. \n\nInstead, language follows the principles of creative destruction and spontaneous order—the social phenomena long championed by classical liberals and libertarians. Words are the currency of the marketplace of ideas. Their values ebb and flow like tickers on the stock exchange—and arguably have more value than most 401(k)s at the moment. Newly coined terms gain value as they capture this moment in time better than old words. This is why words like doggo and bussin' now grace the pages of Merriam-Webster.\n\nBut this moment is always fleeting, and dictionaries and style guides offer only a snapshot of a unique time in language. Today's neologisms will soon become tomorrow's cliches. And this ceaseless linguistic churning will wax and wane until we disappear as a species. \n\nUntil then, language remains the final frontier of human liberty, and no amount of coercion can genuinely contain it.","summary":"The Associated Press’s legal victory highlights the limited power presidents and the press have over the creative destruction and spontaneous order of our language.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/12/neither-trump-nor-the-a-p-controls-our-words/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/zumaglobalfifteen571256-scaled-e1744406543441.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 11:00:08","author":"Jay Stooksberry","authors":["Jay Stooksberry"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":310389870,"title":"Lucas: Trump looms large in Massachusetts governor’s race","text":"They are either with him or against him.\n\nThe “him” being President Donald Trump.\n\nSo, any Republican running for governor in 2026, with any remote chance of victory in liberal Massachusetts, must choose to run with Trump or against him.\n\nThere is no middle ground, not with Trump and not in Massachusetts.\n\nSo that is the dilemma facing Mike Kennealy of Lexington, the first Republican to announce that he is running to unseat progressive Democrat Gov. Maura Healey in 2026.\n\nOther potential GOP candidates will face the issue as well. Only one of them will win the Republican convention endorsement and nomination.\n\nHardly had Kennealy, a former member of GOP Gov. Charlie Baker’s cabinet, announced than the Democrats immediately labeled him as a Trump supporter, calling him “MAGA Mike.”\n\nKennealy, attempting to walk a tightrope on Trump, did not mention him in his video announcement. He has said he did not vote for Trump in the last election but would work with the Trump administration if elected.\n\nThat will not cut it among Trump’s diehard supporters who will be a major presence at the GOP convention and in the primary.\n\nBesides, by the year 2026, Trump, a most consequential president, may have accomplished many of his goals, ranging from shutting down the border and deporting criminal illegal aliens, to bringing home thousands of manufacturing plants and millions of jobs under his tariff initiatives.\n\nAnd if jobs become an issue — as it usually is — then Trump supporters could be searching for a gubernatorial candidate who is a full-throated supporter of the Trump agenda as opposed to some wishy-washy Republican.\n\nOr they could seek out a Trump-supporting Democrat to run against and topple anti-Trump Maura Healey in a Democrat primary. That Democrat would most likely be elected in the November election in Democrat-controlled Massachusetts.\n\nThat Democrat challenger could be Massachusetts native Sean O’Brien, 53, the fiery and outspoken head of the powerful 1.3 million International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who has a solid relationship with Trump.\n\nO’Brien last July became the first Teamster president to address the Republican national convention that endorsed Trump. He urged delegates to respect and support the American working class.\n\nHis earlier request to speak at the Democratic convention was ignored despite the union’s history of supporting Democrats and contributing heavily to their campaigns.\n\nFollowing the GOP convention, the Teamsters decided not to endorse either presidential candidate, which was a victory for Trump.\n\nO’Brien later revealed that an internal poll showed that 60% of its members supported Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nO’Brien, with roots in Medford and Charlestown where his father and grandfather were Teamsters, is an aggressive advocate for jobs for the middle and working class. He believes that Trump, not the Democrats, can bring those jobs back from overseas.\n\nThe outspoken Democrat labor leader, who worked his way up from the bottom of the union ladder to the top, has taken the Democratic Party to task for abandoning the labor movement and American workers.\n\nHe told the Boston Herald that he speaks to Trump three to four times a month.\n\n“The Democrat Party is not the party I grew up in,” he said.\n\nIn 2011 Democrat Gov. Deval Patrick appointed O’Brien to the board of directors at Massport.\n\nWhile battling for workers, O’Brien has also raised millions of dollars for charity, including “Light Up the Night, an annual fundraiser for children with autism.\n\nThe interesting thing is that O’Brien could run for governor as a Trump Democrat — or even run as a Republican. That’s a dilemma too. Either way, he would have the support of a grateful Trump.\n\nPolitical reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at peter.lucas@bostonherald.com.","summary":"Any Republican running for governor in 2026, with any remote chance of victory in liberal Massachusetts, must choose to run with Trump or against him.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/12/lucas-trump-looms-large-in-massachusetts-governors-race/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25100665201607.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 09:18:44","author":"Peter Lucas","authors":["Peter Lucas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":310384746,"title":"Rosie O’Donnell on Ireland, Trump and Her New Hulu Documentary","text":"“It’s not my cello,” Rosie O’Donnell said over a video call, sitting on a gray love seat in a gray hoodie and a pair of chic brown glasses.\n\nIn New York, it was a Thursday morning.

However, with apparatchiks installed in many districts, there might be enough barely legal challenges to cherry-pick votes. This isn’t your mother’s Department of Justice. Will the dollars of CEOs reeling from trade wars still flow to the GOP in tight races? As Ernest Hemingway said, “How do you like it now, gentlemen?”\n\nIf the House doesn’t get flipped in 2026, all bets are off in 2028. We are likely to be blessed with compliant judge advocate generals, a Supreme Court friendly to executive power and an invertebrate GOP caucus in need of spinal surgery. Though we’ve been dancing around it, welcome to Constitutional crisis — particularly if social media and academia are silenced or complicit, along with law firms like Paul Weiss. When it comes to small details such as the future of the republic, I’m an optimist only because I can’t live long on that lonely avenue.\n\nThe year 2028 will see the World Series of democracy. Spring training has begun years early, with Democratic hopefuls lining up to get scouted. Roll in the kegs, because it’s looking like a tailgate party of presidential wannabees. Is there anything more dispiriting than California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Bay Area progressive once upon a time, surfing the waves of podcasting with the likes of Steve Bannon? Newsom’s blue suit is barely visible through the purple haze over the Golden Gate.\n\nThe Dems will need more than business-as-usual in 2028. They might take a page from the GOP playbook. Remember that dog-whistling B-actor who also served time as California governor: Ronald Reagan? The Gipper showed that name value and a pretty face matters — a lot. He rode in atop a Trojan horse of small-government Reaganomics. Many still buy the myth. Consider a couple of illuminating facts: Under President Reagan, when Elon Musk was still just a kid in Pretoria, the federal workforce grew by more than 300,000. And the federal deficit, hobbyhorse of the old GOP? It was $78.9 billion when Reagan assumed office; eight years later, it had ballooned to $152.6 billion. Lean and mean Ronnie, indeed.\n\nLet’s dial back to the close of the Dwight Eisenhower era. It was a tough presidential race in 1960. The winner, over Eisenhower’s vice president, was a Boston Brahmin with whom America fell in love. John F. Kennedy’s victory held off the criminality of Richard Nixon for eight years. To many thoughtful voters in the autumn of 1960, Ike’s VP looked far more solid than the relatively untested senator from New England. But TV held sway over radio. Nixon’s 5 o’clock shadow on the debate stage looked too much like Humphrey Bogart’s in “The Desperate Hours.” TV viewers went all the way with JFK. The era of image over experience had dawned.\n\nIf Donald Trump has proven one thing, it’s that you don’t even require a California gubernatorial stint to bulk up your resume. Fame alone will do it. If we want to get democracy back on track, we may need to suffer through a political newbie’s administration. Just to be safe, we’ll take away their Signal app. If the best we can look forward to on the GOP side is Vice President JD Vance, it feels like any Dem in the phone book will do.\n\nBut the Democrats’ usual suspects won’t cut it. The electoral machinery is stacked against them. We need a unicorn. In a better world, governors like Wes Moore, of Maryland, and Gretchen Whitmer, of Michigan, might appeal. Assemble your own police lineup. These are not normal times. Democrats should consider a prominent person outside of politics: someone voters already love; a Reagan-meets-Kennedy for our times; a player who’ll meet Trump, Mark Burnett’s Frankenstein, and raise him. I happen to have a list in my make-a-wish pocket. The trick is getting them to run. Most won’t consider it, so it’s up to you, fellow Americans, to light up social media.\n\nLet’s put a funhouse mirror to the Democratic primaries, starting with a dynamic star, Beyonce. Points for her, having earned her country music stripes for middle America. She can play her own inauguration. Then there’s Taylor Swift, who’s got the football vote and the daughters of a new American revolution. Visualize these in the Oval Office: George Clooney; Leonardo DiCaprio; Tom Hanks; Scarlett Johansson; John Legend. Who doesn’t love Clooney, arguably the last of the matinee idols? DiCaprio has a titanic following. Hanks? Say no more, Mr. America. Johansson could break the glass ceiling in several ways. And as for Legend, EGOT trumps MAGA.\n\nImplausible, you say?

Throughout the world, there are many who take it for granted that it is certain to be dominated by China, a country which boasts an enormous population that is as talented and industrious as any on Earth. To reach the goals set by their ambitious and increasingly autocratic president Xi Jinping, the Chinese would only have to be a bit more than a quarter as productive as their North American rivals.\n\nFor understandable reasons, the prospect thus opened up has never gone down well in Washington. Like the British before them, North Americans have grown accustomed to the idea that nature has decreed that they should always be top dogs and that it would be terrible for humankind if they were to be pushed aside. Though some North Americans of a philosophical bent allow themselves Kipling-esque thoughts about the transience of power which, sooner or later, will “melt away” so “all our pomp of yesterday is one with Nineveh and Tyre,” most prefer a less gloomy approach to the challenges facing their country. In his often outlandish way, Donald Trump embodies the optimism so many want to feel.\n\nTrump’s strategy towards China is broadly similar to those of Barack Obama and Joe Biden; both assumed that the huge Asian country’s rapid economic rise posed an existential threat to the “rules-based” order the United States put together after the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II and seemed to have consolidated itself when the Soviet Union imploded and bit the dust in December 1991. The difference is that, in Trump’s view, any arrangement that does not guarantee continued US supremacy must be worse than useless, which is why he is using a sledgehammer to smash the one his predecessors tried so hard to defend. Needless to say, the principal target of his onslaught is China. He evidently hopes to cripple her by denying her access to the lucrative US consumer market.\n\nAs far as Trump is concerned, almost everything can be seen as a zero-sum game in which one side wins and the other loses. He is distinctly unimpressed by those who tell him that international trade can benefit everyone involved. His economic ideas, such as they are, seem to be like the ones that prevailed in Europe and the Far East before Adam Smith demolished most of them. At heart, he is what Smith called a mercantilist who believes that, unless a nation sells more material goods than it buys, it will impoverish itself.\n\nUnlike the Europeans, who have no desire to get caught up in a vicious trade war with the US, the Chinese have reacted by swearing to “fight to the end” and slapping big tariffs on their foe. No doubt they will try to make themselves the leaders of an international bloc similar to the one the North Americans have just decided to render obsolete. Unfortunately for them, this will not be at all easy. Most countries, whether they are prosperous like Japan, Australia or those in Europe, or poor like most of the rest, will not take kindly to being swamped with relatively cheap Chinese products, so they too may have little choice but to build protectionist barriers as high, or even higher, than those set up by Trump. After all, they too have companies, and the jobs they provide, that their governments have to take into account.\n\nThe gleeful destruction of the “globalist” order by the US president poses Javier Milei with several unpleasant dilemmas. After having gone out of his way in an attempt to make himself a member of Trump’s inner circle, the “anarcho-capitalist” simply cannot run the risk of letting him know that – as a fervent free trader – he is dead against what he is doing and thinks it is utter folly. What is more, by throwing world markets into turmoil, Trump has made it far harder for Milei to repair Argentina’s broken financial structures, something which, until very recently, he was doing with considerable success. Although Argentina is very much a minor player when it comes to international trade, her financial markets suffered more than many in Europe and East Asia the moment Trump got down to business. Milei will also have to choose between kowtowing to Trump by moving away from China or running the risk of annoying him by welcoming Chinese imports and investments.\n\nMany, perhaps most, respected economists agree that the problems Trump is trying to solve are genuine but that his way of going about it is likely to prove counterproductive. There can be no doubt that the running down of the US industrial base had had many harmful social effects by ruining the lives of millions of men and women whose incomes, and sense of personal worth, had depended upon it; the notion that unemployed coal miners or steel workers should “learn to code” was always ridiculous. It has also been bad for strategic reasons; awareness that the US relied on other countries, especially China, to manufacture items needed for military purposes worries those who are unconvinced that hard power is no longer necessary,\n\nTrump says that, thanks to his efforts, the US will be able to rebuild its industrial sector behind insurmountable tariff walls. He insists many big companies have already got the message and are beginning to repatriate their activities. However, for this to happen he would have to persuade almost all businessmen that the new order he is frantically putting in place will last for many decades to come. Presumably this is why he muses aloud about staying in the White House for longer than the constitutional provisions that are now in force permit. He apparently thinks that cunning lawyers will let him bypass them so he can emulate Franklin Roosevelt, who died before his fourth term in office reached its conclusion.\n\nSceptics warn that, thanks to Trump’s tariffs, consumer prices of most goods in the US will soon shoot skywards, with the result that public support for his policies could nosedive. Seeing that one reason why most North Americans were unwilling to let Biden and his would-be successor Kamala Harris stay in power was their inability to reduce “grocery prices,” a sizeable increase in them would spell big trouble for Trump who, if the opinion polls have it right, still enjoys majority backing because most people like his hard-line approach to illegal immigration and his contempt for everything that can be deemed woke.","summary":"The 19th century belonged to the United Kingdom, the 20th to the United States.

A conservative think tank has mapped out where they could go.","text":"On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump promised to bring down the cost of housing.Some of the new housing he's proposed that could help lower prices would be built in brand-new cities constructed from scratch on federally owned land. Trump's proposed \"Freedom Cities\" would be manufacturing hubs featuring flying cars and plentiful single-family housing, delivering a \"quantum leap for America's standard of living,\" he said in a 2023 video.The proposal, which was light on details, received a muted response and even some criticism from conservatives. But a prominent conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, is taking the idea seriously. The group's housing center recently published an ambitious blueprint called \"Homesteading 2.0\" that identifies hundreds of potential locations for 20 new \"freedom cities\" and sites for 3 million new homes on federal land.Prospective sites for the new cities are largely in Western states, where demand for homes has surged and the US government controls much of the land mass. To incentivize the rapid development of homes, infrastructure, and private industry, proponents of the cities say they should be exempt from all kinds of government laws and regulations. While there's some bipartisan support for repurposing federal land for housing, Trump's vision would require local support, including from those concerned with environmental protection.The AEI analysis focuses largely on metro areas in Western states like Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho. The report envisions major new population centers in the outskirts of places like Las Vegas; Bend, Oregon; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado.The researchers created an interactive map showing where they've determined the new cities could be built. The dark green locations shown below are the best fit for freedom cities.\"In areas where we have plenty of land, why shouldn't we be using it?\" Tobias Peter, co-director of AEI's housing center, told Business Insider. \"These cities with high prices, they have shown over time that they have little interest in promoting housing supply.\"Some proponents of freedom cities want them to be designed to attract developers and private industry by offering government incentives and exemptions from many state and federal laws and regulations.They would feature \"targeted regulatory relief, perhaps focused on different emerging and critical technologies,\" Jeffrey Mason, head of policy at the nonprofit Charter Cities Institute, told BI.Mason has been working with AEI and other groups to draft legislation that would create a legal framework for the new cities. He said they've had a few informal conversations with the Trump administration.The administration has so far made some tentative moves in this direction. In March, the secretaries of the US Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, announced a joint task force to explore opening up federal land for housing construction.\"Working together, our agencies can take inventory of underused federal properties, transfer or lease them to states or localities to address housing needs, and support the infrastructure required to make development viable,\" Turner and Burgum wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the effort and pointed BI to the op-ed.AEI's proposal focused on finding prospective locations for new cities in areas where housing is in demand near pre-existing jobs and infrastructure.Sin City is among the most attractive contenders. The federal government manages about 86% of Nevada's land and some neighborhoods in metro Las Vegas are built right up to the border of land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management that currently sits empty but could be developed.AEI found an area just north of the city has room for about 200,000 new homes — for about 600,000 people.\"Las Vegas is almost entirely bound by this BLM land, it functions as a growth constraint,\" said Arthur Gailes, manager of housing supply initiatives at AEI. \"There is no barrier that would prevent this land from being built on, except that it is rendered illegal by the fact of being managed by the BLM.\"Building housing on federal land, in theory, has bipartisan support.Former Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned on continuing the Biden administration's efforts to open up certain parcels for dense affordable housing.\"It speaks to the underlying agreement over there being a housing supply issue,\" Matthew Murphy, executive director of NYU's Furman Center, told BI last year. \"And then the following logical question being, what can the government do about it?\"But opening up federal land for entirely new cities has a slew of critics, including conservation groups concerned about adverse impacts on wildlife and the natural environment.There's some precedent for this kind of development. Freedom city proponents point to mid-20th century master-planned US cities — including Columbia, Maryland, and Reston, Virginia — and major mixed-use developments like the Woodlands in Texas and Teravalis in Arizona as models. But these cities weren't built on federal land or subject to their own regulatory framework.Some see in Trump's proposal echoes of authoritarian projects abroad. Max Woodworth, an urban geographer at the Ohio State University who wrote a paper on Trump's freedom cities, compared the undertaking to China's ambitious, and not always successful, city-building projects.\"The desire to emulate China emerges out of a sense of quite evident anxiety that China has gotten a jump on the United States,\" Woodworth told Business Insider. \"These are the types of new cities that are specifically designed to short-circuit any kind of democratic process of creating a new city, really in favor of making top-down corporate structures that masquerade as cities.\"","summary":"On the campaign trail, Trump suggested building 'Freedom Cities' on federal land to boost housing and jobs.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-freedom-cities-housing-costs-nevada-las-vegas-plan-2025-4","image":"https://i.insider.com/67f54a02c6ad288d147d8a0c?width=1147&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 08:07:01","author":"Eliza Relman","authors":["Eliza Relman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":310552744,"title":"Muslims rallying voters have a message for party leaders: avoiding important issues could cost you votes","text":"Every Friday afternoon, Mustapha Ramadan stands outside the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) mosque in Mississauga, Ont., organizing a long line of cars arriving for prayers. \n\nHe's one of many Muslims who say they plan on voting in the upcoming federal election, but haven't decided who will earn their ballot. One reason for this indecision is what many Muslims say is the lack of attention party leaders have been paying to the community and the issues that matter to them during this campaign. \n\nAs the chair of ISNA, Ramadan has welcomed many politicians to the mosque, which is one of the largest in Canada — Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attended their summer Eid festival in 2023, and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was at the mosque in 2022, serving food for iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal during the holy month of Ramadan. \n\nISNA is a popular stop during election campaigns, but this time around, Ramadan says, things are different. \n\n\"We haven't seen anything yet,\" he said, noting none of the federal party leaders have visited the mosque during the campaign so far. \n\nThis lack of attention concerns Ramadan and other Muslim leaders who say they want politicians to engage with the community on issues that matter to them, like the ongoing war in Gaza, Islamaphobic attacks or Quebec's secularism law. One expert suggests that because these topics are often seen as controversial, politicians steer clear for fear it could cost them at the ballot box, but those working to mobilize Muslim voters warn that avoiding these issues could have the same effect. \n\nPushing Muslim issues to the forefront\n\nMore than 100 Muslim organizations across the country have signed a joint statement urging Muslims in Canada to vote in the upcoming election, make their voices heard and push politicians to address what they see as crucial issues. \n\nReem Sheet, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), says Muslims here have been watching the horror of war unfold in Gaza, as well as witnessing Islamophobia closer to home, like the 2021 truck attack that killed four members of the Afzaal family in London, Ont., and an unprovoked attack on a hijab-wearing woman at an Ajax, Ont., library late last month. \n\n\"I think our community just wants to see that Canada is taking the right steps forward to make sure that these horrors don't continue for our community,\" said Sheet.\n\nCBC News reached out to the three main parties for comment. The Conservatives did not respond in time for publication. \n\nThe NDP said it has taken the strongest stance of any major party on defending human rights and international law by calling for a permanent ceasefire. Singh himself sponsored a motion in March 2024 calling for the federal government to recognize Palestinian statehood that passed after the Liberals introduced amendments. \n\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Liberal Leader Mark Carney said he has regularly met with Muslim communities, called for the completion of the ceasefire agreement, and \"the return of all hostages, and a safe resumption of humanitarian aid at scale so that Palestinians in Gaza can rebuild their lives.\" \n\nIn a statement, NCCM acknowledged that Carney had met with their organization and many others to discuss issues that matter to Canadian Muslims, but they urged him to take more concrete actions to address their concerns. \n\nSheet says those concerns include the fact that Muslims are still waiting for federal leaders to present a national strategy on combating Islamophobia, and to make clear their stances on the war in Gaza. \n\nAisha Sherazi, a community volunteer in Ottawa, says while voters want to hear from the party leaders on issues that matter to them as Muslims, there are other things that affect their daily lives, too. \n\n\"We're regular citizens,\" she said. \"So of course, you know, affordable housing is important … what happens with the economy is going to impact everyone.\" \n\nBalancing act\n\nMany politicians view talking about the war in the Middle East as a divisive issue, especially during an election, according to Ruby Dagher, an assistant professor in international development at the University of Ottawa. \n\n\"I think if you're looking for votes, it is absolutely dangerous territory,\" said Dagher. \"It's the need to win certain votes, but at the same time the fear of losing other votes that makes it … difficult to find that balance.\" \n\nThat balancing act was on full display at a Calgary rally for Carney on Tuesday, when a protester shouted, \"Mr. Carney, there's a genocide happening in Palestine!\" In the moment, Carney responded, \"I'm aware, which is why we have an arms embargo.\" \n\nLater, asked to clarify if he saw genocide in Gaza, he said it was noisy, so he \"didn't hear that word,\" and said he meant he was aware of the situation in Gaza. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Carney's words \"irresponsible\" in a post on X. \n\nSherazi, who's already decided how she'll vote, says though the leaders naturally command a lot of attention, people should also focus on their MPs. \n\n\"A lot of the coverage is on the leaders themselves, and you're not really voting for them,\" she said. \"When you vote, you've got to vote for your local individual whose responsibility is to advocate for you, and I think that people forget that.\" \n\nThough the party leaders may not have visited ISNA, other politicians have turned out. Charles Sousa, the incumbent Liberal candidate for Mississauga-Lakeshore where ISNA is located, was at the mosque during Eid prayers this year. \n\nDalia Hashim, the mosque's public affairs manager, says he received a round of applause when he vowed to support the Muslim community.\n\nThe power of the Muslim vote\n\nThe power of the Muslim vote is not something that should be taken lightly, according to Umair Ashraf, the executive director of Canadian Muslim Votes, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on political education and civic engagement. \n\nDuring the 2024 U.S. election campaign, many Arab American and Muslim voters in Michigan who helped Joe Biden win in 2020 told CBC News they wouldn't support Kamala Harris's election bid due to the administration's response to the crisis in the Middle East. \n\nIn the end, Michigan flipped for the Republicans and ultimately helped send Trump back to the White house. \n\nAshraf says that power exists in Canada as well.\n\n\"There are almost 1.8 million Muslims across Canada, and at times there can be anywhere between 60 to 80 ridings where there can be a Muslim swing,\" he said, referring to ridings where Muslim voters make up a significant portion of the population.\n\nDagher says that while that may be true, a Muslim voting block here may not be as powerful as those in the U.S., partly because issues like the war in Gaza have been overshadowed by Donald Trump's tariffs and threats to annex Canada, but also because Muslims don't all vote the same way. \n\nShe notes that the community's support appears to be spread out enough that Muslim voters are unlikely to tip the scales in any one direction. \n\n\"I'm not saying it's nothing, but I also don't see it as a major factor that's going to influence, given that each group has been able to attract some Arab electorate specifically.\"\n\nWhen it comes to courting the Muslim vote, Sherazi suggests that politicians should take a strong stance about what's happening in the Middle East and be deliberate about using language that unifies rather than divides. \n\n\"It's incumbent upon our leaders to really speak up and kind of reassure people that as Canadians, we feel passionately about international law, that those things matter, that humanity matters,\" she said. \n\n\"I think that's going to be really, really important to a lot of voters, not just the Muslim community.\"","summary":"Muslim leaders are mobilizing their communities to vote in the upcoming federal election, but some say party leaders haven’t done a good job of addressing issues that matter to Muslim Canadians.

Appearing on “The Record With Greta Van Susteren,” Dershowitz said that the Central Park Five men were not completely innocent and that new scrutiny could expose details they’d rather keep buried.\n\n“This is going to be a very hard case for the plaintiffs to win. They were not innocent people. They were doing things in the park that certainly were not commendable, at least some of them were,” Dershowitz said. “They did not admit their guilt. But it’s a much more complicated, nuanced case. And I think they will regret having brought it. Because if this case actually goes to trial, we’re going to get depositions that show exactly what they did and where they were every minute of time.”\n\nWith some of the plaintiffs now pursuing political careers, Dershowitz warned the case could expose uncomfortable truths.\n\n“These are all people now with political ambitions. They’re running for office. They’re presenting themselves as the most wonderful people on the face of the earth. They were not. And so the more we dig into this case, the more we’re going to see this as a case of gray area,” Dershowitz said. “And the big issue is going to be if they are public figures, if the plaintiffs are public figures and have to demonstrate that they were not only falsely accused, but they were falsely accused with reckless disregard of the truth. It’s not going to be so easy.”\n\nWhile Dershowitz said the case might ultimately settle, he also said that a full trial could serve the public interest. (RELATED: Alan Dershowitz Breaks Down How Trump Secured ‘Partial Victory’ In SCOTUS Deportation Case)\n\n“My feeling is probably, in the end, the case will settle, but the public would be served by having this case actually litigated and seeing the real dynamics of what went on that terrible, terrible night when that innocent woman was almost killed while jogging in Central Park,” Dershowitz said.\n\nDershowitz added that the suit hinges on the plaintiffs proving that Trump knowingly and intentionally lied about them.\n\n“They also have another problem. He said the same thing years earlier. They were damaged years earlier by his full-page ad in the New York Times. And they have to show that it was the repetition of the damages during the debate, which is what caused the new damages,” Dershowitz said. “Trump was entitled to call for the return of the death penalty. He was entitled to use this case. Now, you know, the New York Times versus Sullivan established the principle that you don’t have to name the person specifically in order to be guilty. All you have to do is describe them in ways that make them recognizable. So this is going to be a complicated case.”\n\nThe lawsuit highlights Trump’s long-running feud with the Central Park Five, who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 attack on investment banker Trisha Meili during her evening jog. The assault was so severe that doctors feared she wouldn’t survive, leading prosecutors to initially treat the case as a potential homicide.\n\nThe five men filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump in October, accusing him of falsely linking them to the 1989 crime. They cited Trump’s comments during his Sept. 10 debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris, where she also brought up his past call for their execution.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Obama was responding to recent rumors that she and former president Barack Obama were getting a divorce. The internet chatter stemmed from the fact that the forever First Lady and her husband of 33 years haven’t been seen together in public much lately. Barack Obama attended several basketball games, including Team USA’s exhibition game prior to the Olympics last summer, and has made other public appearances without his spouse. Michelle has also been solo at various events and appearances. Obama drew some criticism for not accompanying her husband to former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral or attending President Trump‘s second inauguration. Her representative said that a “scheduling conflict” kept her from Carter’s ceremony but provided no explanation for not attending Trump’s swearing-in. At the Democratic National Convention in August, which formally announced Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee, Obama said Trump engaged in fear-mongering when it came to the couple. “Unfortunately, we know what comes next. We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort [Harris’] truth,” Obama said. “My husband and I, sadly, know a little something about this. For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.” She added, “His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.” The Obamas were last seen together in a photo celebrating Valentine’s Day in February, but they have not been seen together much since. However, it is believed that they still share their three residences—one in Chicago, one on Martha’s Vineyard, and one in Washington, D.C. However, as they are now private citizens, they are under no obligation to share the details of their personal lives. Obama calls the rumors ridiculous. On a recent podcast, Work In Progress, hosted by Sophia Bush, she said she’s simply carving out a life for herself that no longer prioritizes her husband’s or kids’ needs. Instead, she says she’s able to do as she pleases more than ever before. “I chose to do what’s best for me, not what I had to do,” she told Bush, adding that the public “couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing. This couldn’t be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that is what society does to us.” While she had little else to say about her husband or her marriage, she says that she is at the age and stage where she believes her choices should only reflect her desires. “Now is the time for me to start asking myself these hard questions of, ‘Who do I truly want to be every day?’” she said. “And that changes.” Obama started her own podcast IMO (In My Opinion) with her brother Craig. So far, it has explored non-political topics in favor of interpersonal ones, including caretaking and friendship. Guests have included empowerment guru Jay Shetty, actress Keke Palmer, and author/influencer Elaine Welteroth.

Vance on Saturday Night Live. \n\n The Wicked actor first played the vice president of the United States in September 2024 — a mere two months before Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. On Thursday, Yang appeared on The Daily Show and said that despite playing the character for less than a year, he would be more than happy if Lorne Michaels recast the role of the Republican politician on SNL.\n\n “Loren asked me [to play Vance] and, I said, ‘Please, please, please don’t make me do this,’” Yang explained to host Desi Lydic. “I really do my best with him, but every time I have to play him, I go to Lorne and I say, ‘You can do a buyback, You don’t have to stick with me.’” \n\n The actor and comedian offered the SNL creator a few options for his replacement: “Please reach out to Zach Galifianakis. Please reach out to Taran Killam. But no, that’s my charge.” Yang said he’s found it “challenging” to portray the vp, partly because of Vance’s accent. \n\n “You know what, I worked with an accent coach,” he revealed. “We had to find the middle between Appalachian and Ohio. We really had to find the right [accent]. I was like, I don’t want to screw this up.” \n\n At the beginning of the live sketch comedy show’s 50th season, Yang debuted the role of Vance alongside James Austin Johnson as Trump, Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris, Jim Gaffigan as Tim Walz, Dana Carvey as Joe Biden and Andy Samberg as Douglas Emhoff. \n\n Aside from his Vance’s dialect, Yang said he had “such an uphill battle” playing Trump’s right-hand man because he anticipated that “everyone in America is going to be like, ‘This Asian guy is playing that guy?’” \n\n He added, “I was like, I really got to nail this down.

I don't think Musk will be speaking favorably of Donald Trump 12 months from now,' the former White House communication director said on Friday.\n\n'I think Elon is between a rock and a hard place.

I had to face my ego. I had to face my human frailty... I think Musk's gonna get there.'\n\nScaramucci said the tariff war would help drive Musk away from Trump, adding that it would be 'very bad' for Musk if Trump continues with his tariffs. \n\nThe billionaire hasn't been shy about sharing his opposition to the president's sweeping international tariffs.\n\nScaramucci, who had a chaotic tenure as White House communications director in 2017, claims Trump fired him after he disagreed with him on national security policy. \n\n'I was the first person on Wall Street to offer Trump support, but it became impossible [to continue supporting him], and I said, for my family, for my country, I have to speak out against what he's doing,' he recalled on Welcome to MAGAland.\n\n'Six years later, and I said if he returned to the presidency, he would wreak havoc on the global economy. He would try to pull us away from our allies.

What New Poll Shows","text":"Several conservative podcasts, including those hosted by Charlie Kirk, Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and Dave Portnoy, have built significant audiences among Gen Z Americans, particularly those who voted for President Donald Trump in last year's election, according to a new survey.The Axios-Generation Lab poll's findings suggest that partisan media consumption trends are firmly established among young adults, with many aligning their podcast choices with political preferences.Why It MattersDuring his successful 2024 campaign, Trump appeared on numerous podcasts to speak directly to voters, a strategy that reflected the increasing influence of the medium on political engagement.Gen Z and younger millennials are turning to podcasts not just for entertainment, but for political commentary and news. These platforms offer unfiltered access to voices they trust, shaping perspectives outside of traditional media frameworks.What To KnowAccording to the new poll, there is a clear partisan divide in podcast preferences.The Axios-Generation Lab poll, conducted from February 21-28 among a representative sample of 972 18- to 34-year-olds nationwide, found that in the past month, 34 percent of Trump voters in this group had listened to a Barstool Sports podcast—making Trump supporter Portnoy's shows the most popular among young people who voted for the president.That figure dropped to just 9 percent among those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.Other conservative-leaning podcasts also showed a strong skew toward Trump voters.Roughly 27 percent said they listened to The Joe Rogan Experience monthly, 19 percent to The Charlie Kirk Show, and 18 percent to The Ben Shapiro Show.Among Harris supporters, only 3 percent said they listened to Kirk or Shapiro, and just 6 percent tuned into Rogan's show monthly.The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Kirk's rapid rise in conservative media—he now holds the number 1 spot among conservative podcasts, according to Salem Media—underscores his resonance with young right-leaning Americans.\"This isn't just a win for Charlie,\" David Santrella, CEO of Salem Media Group, said in a press release. \"This is a defining moment for conservative media. The torch has been passed, and we're not looking back.\"While some podcasts like The Daily, TED Talks Daily, and Call Her Daddy drew more balanced audiences, Axios noted that entertainment and leisure preferences were also split along political lines. Harris supporters, for example, were more likely to attend concerts, while Trump supporters leaned into sports.What People Are SayingConservative influencer Charlie Kirk said in a March statement: \"We're not just talking. We're activating a generation.\"Generational expert and HR consultant Bryan Driscoll told Newsweek: \"I see this not as a podcast story but rather an echo chamber story. We've spent the last decade or so watching people silo themselves on social media, and now they're doing it with podcasts.\"He added: \"Gen Z, like many generations today, are seeking out voices that confirm what they already believe. And that goes for both sides of the aisle. Everyone is just reinforcing their own worldview with a pair of earbuds.\"What Happens Next?With podcasts growing as a primary source of news and opinion among Gen Z, political campaigns on both sides are likely to double down on appearances in these spaces.Trump's repeated use of podcast interviews in 2024 could set a precedent for future candidates seeking to bypass traditional media filters and connect with young audiences directly.\"The political divide is about identity,\" Driscoll said. \"Podcasts have become ideological accessories. When two people can listen to two different shows about the same issue and walk away with opposite 'truths' I'm terrified, because we're not just polarized—we're post-reality.\"","summary":"The Axios-Generation Lab poll's findings suggest that partisan media consumption trends are firmly established among young adults.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-popular-are-conservative-podcasts-gen-z-what-new-poll-shows-2058898","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2626071/ben-shapiro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 22:02:56","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.184},{"id":310258428,"title":"Trump Denies FEMA Aid Extension in State He Won Three Times","text":"Democratic Gov.

I got this news while I was in Newland with families who lost their homes in the storm. The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored. I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA's bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.\"In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, President Donald Trump voiced sharp criticism of FEMA's response in North Carolina, accusing the agency of being too slow to release recovery funds and failing to coordinate effectively with state officials. Trump repeatedly claimed that federal bureaucracy was delaying critical aid, saying in one press briefing, \"The people of North Carolina deserve faster, better action. FEMA needs to cut the red tape and get the job done.\"He also suggested that political bias might be influencing the pace of assistance, given Trump's staunch support in hard-hit areas of western North Carolina, though FEMA denied the allegations.Trump has consistently secured North Carolina's electoral votes in the past three presidential elections. In 2016, he defeated Hillary Clinton with 49.83 percent of the vote to her 46.17 percent, a margin of 3.66 percentage points.

That marks a sharp decline from early January, when his net favorability was nearly even.Why It MattersMusk's slide in public opinion has been both steady and significant, particularly following his appointment by President Donald Trump as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new federal task force designed to, according the White House, slash government spending.Since DOGE's launch, Musk has faced mounting criticism over several controversies: the firing of federal employees, accusations of DOGE workers accessing sensitive payment information of Americans and concerns that Musk may eliminate vital public programs. His involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election also appears to have backfired.What To KnowSilver Bulletin aggregates national polling data and updates its average several times a week. Its methodology, developed by Silver during his time at 538, adjusts for polling house effects and sample types, making it among the most authoritative sources of U.S. political data.\"Musk's numbers have been on a downward trend—especially since Trump took office,\" Silver Bulletin's team wrote. In January, Musk's net favorability stood at -0.2 percent. His public image has since eroded as he became more politically active, most notably after taking the helm at DOGE.On Silver's chart, three key moments mark his decline: his endorsement of Trump in mid-2024, Trump's victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and the start of Trump's second term in early 2025. According to Silver, the correlation between these events and Musk's growing unpopularity is difficult to ignore.What Other Polls ShowPublic opinion data from other sources supports Silver's findings. A Morning Consult poll conducted from March 28 to March 30 found Musk's unfavorable rating had climbed to 54 percent, up from 45 percent after the 2024 election. Among Democrats, his unfavorability rose from 71 percent to 83 percent, and among independents from 48 percent to 59 percent. Even among Republicans, while 73 percent viewed him favorably, only 47 percent had a strongly favorable opinion—less intensity than for Trump.A Reuters/Ipsos poll from the same period found 57 percent viewed Musk unfavorably and 39 percent favorably—nearly identical to Silver's numbers. Pollster Charles Franklin told Reuters, \"It's a strong argument that Musk's net impact was negative. He gave Democrats a foil for campaign messaging.\"The Harvard/Harris Poll in late March reported a 10-point drop in Musk's net favorability in just one month, from an even 44-44 split in February to 49 percent unfavorable and 39 percent favorable. CNN analyst Harry Enten remarked, \"I have rarely, if ever, seen a shift this dramatic ... Musk's net favorability dropped from +24 to -19 between 2017 and 2025.\"Future of Musk and DOGEDespite Trump calling Musk a \"GREAT PATRIOT\" on Truth Social, the association with the administration appears to be harming the Tesla CEO more than helping. Tesla recently reported a 13 percent drop in first-quarter sales, and critics argue that Musk's political alignment is undermining his brand.According to media reports, Trump has privately told advisers and Cabinet members that Musk will soon step back from his prominent role as a key adviser.Musk's heavy involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race appears to have been a tipping point. A poll conducted by Democratic firm Blueprint and shared with The Washington Post found that 30 percent of voters said Musk's multimillion-dollar intervention made them less likely to support the Trump-endorsed candidate, Brad Schimel, compared to just 5 percent who said it made them more likely. Musk had heavily funded and promoted the campaign of Schimel, who lost to liberal candidate Susan Crawford.The backlash prompted national Democrats to make Musk a centerpiece of their messaging, casting him as a symbol of Trump-era government overreach.What People Are SayingSilver, in his Silver Bulletin: \"Although Musk may eventually leave the government, he'll remain an exceptionally important and controversial public figure even if he does. Until then, he could be a liability for Trump.\"Democratic pollster Evan Roth Smith, analyzing the poll for The Washington Post: \"The verdict from the race appears clear: The closer Musk is to an election's central narrative, the worse Republicans do. And while the president might seek to distance himself from Musk in the coming weeks and months, the impression that Musk is currently a central figure of the Republican Party seems indelible. Democrats are already trying to goad him into a larger public-facing role for a reason.\"Carter Wrenn, longtime Republican strategist, told Newsweek: \"Polls are showing Musk's popularity is upside down. That could definitely be a problem—especially with swing voters, independents, and ticket-splitters. Musk, personally, carries some negative baggage that could hurt.\"What Happens NextTrump's DOGE initiative was launched via executive order on his first day back in office and is poised to sunset in July 2026. After Musk's exit, Cabinet secretaries are expected to continue the department's work.","summary":"According to the latest data from newsletter Silver Bulletin, a project by polling expert Nate Silver, 53.5 percent of Americans now view Musk unfavorably.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musks-favorability-sinks-new-low-polling-average-shows-2058871","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2626043/elon-musk-wisconsin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 21:35:08","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":310262662,"title":"Judge refuses to dismiss Central Park Five’s defamation case against Trump","text":"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge has rejected President Donald Trump’s effort to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against him filed by the men formerly known as the Central Park Five who were exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison for the 1989 rape and beating of a woman who was jogging.\n\nU.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia denied Trump’s motion to dismiss in a brief Thursday night order.\n\nThe five men sued Trump in the midst of last fall’s presidential election campaign, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter, saying “They admitted, they said, they pled guilty. And I said, ‘well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we’re not guilty,‘” Trump said.\n\nThe men — Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise — never pleaded guilty; they were convicted after jury trials. Also, no victim died.\n\nIn a statement, their lawyer, Shanin Specter, said they are “gratified by the Court’s ruling and thorough analysis and look forward to discovery, trial and the ultimate vindication of these five fine men.”\n\nThe men had asked for compensatory and punitive damages, saying Trump had knowingly defamed them, purposefully made false statements about them and sought to inflict severe emotional distress on them.\n\nJudge Beetlestone’s order dismissed the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nTrump’s lawyer, Karin Sweigart, in a statement called the lawsuit an “unfounded and meritless attack” on Trump. The judge’s dismissal of certain claims is a “victory,” Sweigart said, and vowed to ”continue fighting to protect the First Amendment rights of not just the President, but all Americans.”\n\nIn the request to dismiss the case, Sweigart had said the president’s statements were protected under Pennsylvania laws that grant civil immunity over statements made on a “matter of public concern.”\n\nSweigart’s request to dismiss also said Trump’s statements were “substantially true,” that he didn’t dispute the men were ultimately exonerated and that he had only intended to portray his thinking in 1989 when, following the men having confessed, Trump purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty.\n\nAt the time, many in New York saw Trump’s ad as calling for the teens to be executed.\n\nThe five men had been teenagers when they were accused of the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in New York City’s Central Park. The five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after another person confessed to the crime.\n\nRichardson, the youngest member of the five, was honored by Syracuse University in 2019 after he told Oprah Winfrey that he dreamed of going to SU as a music student when he was jailed at age 14.\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, Specter said Trump “defamed them in front of 67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names all over again.”\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson attacked it at the time as a “frivolous election interference lawsuit.”","summary":"The group was exonerated after spending more than a decade in prison.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/04/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-central-park-fives-defamation-case-against-trump.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/QTL7UNTMQ5G7HOLFHVRHB3PQ3Q.jpg?auth=0af253b6bc83806988cfdf3267d937e70401dfafe6f97e9e1ef93e5aee41bc11&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 21:10:53","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":310257988,"title":"Karoline Leavitt says what everyone at White House is thinking after Trump's roughest week so far","text":"Press secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing by telling reporters 'thank God it's Friday' after President Donald Trump's roughest week so far. \n\nLeavitt spent just 21 minutes at the podium Friday - an abnormally short time for a White House briefing - before breathing that sigh of relief. \n\nShe had been peppered with questions on a variety of topics including the most obvious - tariffs, the Russia and Iran talks, Fox News' Peter Doocy getting attacked by a bird, and the physical Trump was getting at Walter Reed presently. \n\nCara Castronuova, a former champion boxer turned White House correspondent for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell's Lindell TV, asked Leavitt if the White House planned to release the president's 'fitness plan' as part of his annual physical. \n\n'He actually looks healthier than ever before, healthier than he did eight years ago, I'm sure every one in this room can agree. Is he working out with Bobby Kennedy and eating less McDonald's?' Castronuova asked, cuing laughs. \n\nLeavitt chuckled as well.\n\n'I can confirm the president is in very good shape, as you see on a near daily basis here,' she answered. 'And in that vein, thank God it's Friday. It's been a very long and busy week here at the White House, we'll see you all on Monday.'\n\nShe added that the White House would release Trump's physical results 'as soon a we can.' \n\nThe president will head directly to Joint Base Andrews after departing Walter Reed - heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. \n\nLeavitt said he wouldn't be put under anesthesia during Friday's medical exam - which in the past has meant the vice president has briefly taken over, including when Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman to hold presidential power when President Joe Biden was getting a colonoscopy. \n\nTrump leaves Washington after a chaotic week - of implementing tariffs - and then delaying some of them, but escalating a trade war with China. \n\nLeavitt was asked Friday why Trump wouldn't just call Chinese President Xi Jinping and get the ball rolling. \n\nShe answered by saying that the U.S. would be 'gracious' if China intended to make a deal.\n\n'If China continues to retaliate, it's not good for China,' she added. \n\nLeavitt was then asked again if China needed to make the first move. \n\nShe punted. \n\n'I'm not going to comment on communications that are happening or may not be happening or either way, we'll leave it to our national security team to get these discussions underway,' she said. \n\nThe press secretary was also pressed on how much medical information about Trump the White House would release. \n\nTrump had publicly called on Biden to receive a cognitive exam in June 2024 - even before his disastrous debate - after the Republican included them as part of his White House physical in 2018. \n\nLeavitt wouldn't expressly say how much of Trump's medical records the public would see - and didn't answer a question directly about whether Trump's new White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, would address the White House briefing room. \n\nShe did hammer the Biden White House for what she called 'one of the greatest cover-ups and frankly political scandals this nation has ever seen.' \n\n'Well I can tell you there was certainly a lack of transparency from the former president, from the entire former administration, and frankly, a lot of people in this room when it came to the health and the confidence of the former President of the United States Joe Biden,' Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued: 'This president is clearly committed to transparency. You in this room see him and hear from him on a daily basis. You in this room know from covering him, it's hard to keep up with him.'\n\n'He is a machine working around the clock every single day and the physician after today's physical will provide an update on the report in the effort of transparency,' she added. \n\nDuring Trump's first term, Dr. Ronny Jackson held court in the briefing room for an hour after the president's first physical in January 2018. \n\nDr. Sean Conley didn't do the same, but did brief reporters during Trump's hospitalization with COVID-19 in October 2020.\n\nLeavitt did commit to 'releasing all of the results, as many of the results as possible' from the physical, according to a reporter's question.\n\n'Of course, yes, the physician will do that, I spoke with him this morning,' Leavitt said.","summary":"Press secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing Friday with a telling sign of how chaotic President Donald Trump's tariff week had been.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14600577/karoline-leavitt-thank-god-week-over.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/21/97187267-0-image-a-9_1744402635498.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 21:08:35","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":310253240,"title":"Rep.

I think that she is a tremendous talent. I think she ran a great campaign. I think she was ill-served in that campaign by people who should have listened to some of us who saw and felt things,” Clyburn began. \n\n“Listen to Bill Clinton when he told them what was going on.

In other words, Joe Biden was to blame,” the authors wrote.","summary":"Rep.

With a cheeky grin, she made an unexpected visit to Orange County, where she confidently exclaimed her foresight about Donald Trump possibly regaining political power. Her talk was concise but powerful, leaving a clear impression that she had no plans to step away from the national political stage.\n\nAccording to a recent article in Vanity Fair, Harris is drafting a more comprehensive speech and working on a new book. These actions are widely considered as early signs that she’s gearing up for a potential comeback in the political arena.\n\nBut what lies ahead for Harris is not just about sharing her thoughts and feelings. According to people who know her well and talked to Vanity Fair, she’s considering two big options for her political future: running for California’s top job, the governor’s seat, in 2026 or trying once more for the presidency in 2028.\n\nOne person close to her said she’s earned the right to put her thumb on the scale. At the moment, Harris is being patient and thinking hard about how much say she has in the political world and what she can do that would be best for the party that’s trying to figure out who they are after Joe Biden.\n\nThe former second-in-command is carefully setting the stage for her return to the public eye. Vanity Fair reports that her staff is crafting a substantial new speech, which will tackle the chaotic state of politics today and the type of guidance needed following the tumultuous start of Trump’s latest stint in office. As such, speeches often pave the way for a political comeback and offer the chance to redefine one’s public persona.\n\nThis was brutal. Kamala Harris looked directly at Trump and told him he is easily manipulated with flattery and his own generals call him a disgrace.\nFact check: True pic.twitter.com/BBsMDwoO2n\n— Unfiltered☢Boss (@Unfilteredboss1) September 11, 2024\n\nAshley Etienne, who used to manage her communications, noticed a shift in her recent address. Harris seemed more at ease in how she presented herself, yet the content was denser with meaning, reflecting a seriousness of purpose. Furthermore, she’s been actively engaging with the foundation of the party—grassroots organizers and donors. Her focus is on strengthening the Democrats’ support system rather than dwelling on past events.\n\nHer former VP communications director, Jamal Simmons, emphasized that she’s not stuck in the past. Instead, she’s “always thinking about what’s next.”\n\nWhile Harris has kept a relatively low profile in political matters since admitting defeat in November, her political team has certainly not been taking it easy. She has until the close of the summer to decide whether she wants to throw her hat into the ring for the California governor’s race, which is a position that many Democrats are eager to claim.\n\nIf she chooses to run, she’s expected to be a top contender right from the start. But within her inner circle, there’s a divide. Some think that becoming a state’s top leader could be a strategic move to bounce back, while others are concerned that if she doesn’t go for it now, she might miss out on something significant politically.\n\nOn the flip side, Harris hasn’t closed the door on the idea of running for President again. In fact, her recent actions hint that she’s keeping a close eye on the 2028 race. The speech Harris is preparing, and her upcoming book serve as ways for her to rebuild her presence across the country gradually. By doing this, she can avoid the intense competition that’s already heating up among potential candidates like Cory Booker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and, surprisingly, her ex-running mate, Tim Walz.\n\nKamala and Tim Walz were stunned that they lost the election, according to a new book out about their 2024 campaign.\nApparently, their people on the inside were telling them that they were winning and winning handily.\nHarris even asked if they needed to do a recount only to be… pic.twitter.com/r6D5kQ2UA1\n— David Joe May (@TheGrayRider) April 4, 2025\n\nThe Democratic Party is keeping a keen eye on Kamala Harris. Although her 2024 bid managed to secure an impressive 75 million votes and came close in the Electoral College, there are whispers of doubt about her strategy and “Biden baggage.” Sheila Nix, who used to be Harris’s chief of staff, is confident that Harris’s focus on healthcare, housing, and supporting small businesses hit home with voters. “The values she talked about… were important to the people who heard them,” she told Vanity Fair.\n\nYet, the longer Harris waits to make her next move, the more opportunity other hopefuls have to stake their claim on the party’s direction. One ex-strategist from the Biden-Harris team explained, “Right after the election, people were like, ‘Oh, she did everything she could.’ Now the consensus is building that the future of the party isn’t someone like her.”\n\nBut Harris isn’t throwing in the towel. In a recent speech, she made it clear: “I’m not going anywhere.” Her future choices, be it running for California’s top spot again or setting her sights on the White House, will play a part in how the Democrats’ story develops before 2028.","summary":"Kamala Harris is back in the conversation—and possibly back on the ballot.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/im-not-going-anywhere-kamala-harris-teases-2028-comeback","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kamala-Harris-2028-Book-speech-orange-county-april-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 20:42:07","author":"Sohini","authors":["Sohini"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.204},{"id":310240410,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Next Chapter: Starting a Think Tank?","text":"A New York Times article on Thursday presented a surprising possible next move for former Vice President Kamala Harris—establishing a think tank for “policy and ideas.”\n\nAccording to the report, “Brian Nelson, an adviser to Ms. Harris since she was California’s attorney general” has proposed the idea of Harris “establishing an institute for policy and ideas” to “several universities, including Howard and Stanford.”\n\nThe Times’ postelection profile also discussed alternative paths for Harris, such as a second run for president in 2028 or a run for governor of California in 2026.\n\nHarris was often mocked during the 2024 presidential election by supporters of President Donald Trump for what they characterized as incoherent “word salads.” \n\nDetractors on X ridiculed the idea of Harris establishing an “institute for policy and ideas.” \n\n“NYT: Kamala Harris, known for her deep knowledge and ability to articulate complex issues, is thinking about launching ‘an institute for policy and ideas,’” wrote Washington Free Beacon writer Andrew Stiles sarcastically.\n\nStiles later riffed on the topic, suggesting the name, “The Kamala D.

Every time Donald Trump sets fire to another piece of the global order, I find myself staring at the same spot, wondering how we got here – and what I’ve missed in the script of modern politics.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to “teach a lesson” to all of America’s trading partners. True to form, he didn’t waste time testing that theory. In February, he launched a trial balloon by slapping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The pretext? They weren’t doing enough to curb migration and drug trafficking. Ottawa and Mexico City quickly came to the table, validating Trump’s belief that the tariff stick could beat other nations into talks. That success emboldened him to try the same strategy globally.\n\nSo he did. And what followed was, frankly, more entertaining than many had expected.\n\nMarkets crashed. Oil prices plunged. Economists predicted a recession. Americans started stockpiling food and supplies. The media raced to outdo one another with the most ridiculous nicknames for the unfolding chaos. Meanwhile, the White House calmly insisted everything was “going to plan.”\n\nAnd what exactly was the plan? Trump himself made it quite clear: to make the world “kiss his ass.”\n\nThis, in essence, is the classic Trump playbook – what some call his “psychopath strategy.” He creates a crisis, then offers to dial it back as a “goodwill gesture,” demanding concessions in return. In this case, those concessions were to include correcting America’s trade deficits and forcing production to return home.\n\nBut this time, Trump may have overplayed his hand. Starting a trade war with the entire world simultaneously didn’t just rattle governments – it shook Americans at home. As the reality of a potential recession hit, Trump’s approval ratings plummeted. Many in the public began to view the president and his team as, to put it mildly, lacking in competence.\n\nThe widespread backlash gave Democrats a rare opportunity to go on the offensive. Anti-tariff rallies sprang up across the country, organized by liberal groups and activists. Trump faced public rebukes from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris. Congressman Al Green even announced plans to introduce articles of impeachment – for a third time.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the left sounding the alarm.\n\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, warned of a potential “bloodbath” for the GOP in the 2026 midterms if the tariffs triggered a full-scale recession. Billionaires on Wall Street – many of whom had backed Trump – voiced their displeasure. Most notably, Elon Musk, a longtime Trump ally, publicly criticized the president’s trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling him “an idiot” and “dumber than a bag of potatoes.”\n\nFaced with political, financial, and public pressure, the Trump administration acted quickly. On April 9, Trump announced that 75 countries had contacted him requesting deals. In response, he reduced tariffs to 10% for a 90-day window, framing it as an opportunity for negotiation.\n\nBut not everyone is budging.\n\nChina, in particular, has proven to be a far more resilient adversary. The US–China trade war continues to escalate, with tit-for-tat tariffs now reaching 140% – and climbing. If it goes on unchecked, trade between the world’s two largest economies could shrink by 80%, with catastrophic consequences for both sides.\n\nSo what’s next?\n\nTwo scenarios seem likely. Either Trump pressures his trading partners into quick concessions and declares victory, or he walks away halfway through and finds a new distraction – much like he did with Ukraine.\n\nRemember the fanfare when Trump promised to deliver peace in Ukraine “within 24 hours”? Or even “within 100 days”? The moment it became clear that wasn’t going to happen, the White House stopped talking about it altogether.\n\nThat’s Trump’s style. Create a spectacle, dominate the headlines, then quietly move on once it stops working.\n\nAnd let’s not forget – he still has a few cards left to play. Gaza, for instance, which he once dubbed the “Riviera of the Middle East.” Or the Iranian nuclear issue, another favorite of his unrealized “brilliant ideas.”\n\nSo no – I won’t say I’ve seen everything. If anything, recent events have taught me that with Trump, there’s always more madness just around the corner.\n\nAnd the scariest part? Sometimes it works.\n\nThis article was first published by the online newspaper Gazeta.ru and was translated and edited by the RT team","summary":"Did the President of the United States get what he wanted? \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/615636-why-trump-quickly-rolled-back/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/67f9789485f54040840b33a3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 20:18:03","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":310237092,"title":"Fox News hires Hugh Hewitt after messy exit from Washington Post","text":"Hugh Hewitt, the veteran conservative commentator who quit the Washington Post in a huff this past fall after an on-air argument with left-leaning colleagues, has joined Fox News Media as a contributor, the network announced Thursday.\n\nHewitt will provide political analysis across all Fox News platforms and is set to make his debut appearance on Thursday’s edition of the evening news wrap-up show “Special Report with Bret Baier.”\n\nFox News, which shares common ownership with The Post, released a statement citing Hewitt’s experience as a nationally syndicated radio talk show host as well as a contributing columnist for several publications.\n\nHewitt’s arrival at Fox comes months after he walked off the set of the online Washington Post program “First Look” following a heated exchange with liberal columnists Jonathan Capehart and Ruth Marcus over claims surrounding President Donald Trump and the recent election.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Capehart had questioned whether Trump was “laying the groundwork” to contest the election by citing alleged irregularities in Bucks County, Pa.\n\nMarcus agreed, saying the former president had been preparing for such a challenge for months.\n\nHewitt attempted to respond but was interrupted by Capehart, who insisted Marcus finish her point.\n\nWhen given the opportunity to speak, Hewitt defended the Trump campaign’s legal efforts, pointing out that a judge had sided with Republicans in extending voting hours in Bucks County after voters were reportedly turned away after a 5 p.m. deadline.\n\n“We are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,” Hewitt said.\n\n“So yes, he’s upset about Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court. That’s the story.”\n\nCapehart then accused Hewitt of spreading misinformation.\n\n“I don’t appreciate being lectured about reporting when, Hugh, many times you come here saying lots of things that aren’t based in fact,” he said.\n\nThe remark appeared to be the final straw.

position as editor after she said that a column criticizing Bezos for overhauling the editorial page was spiked by his top executive at the publication.\n\nIn late February, Bezos announced that he would reorient the Washington Post editorial page so that it would tout “personal liberties and free markets” — a move that prompted the resignation of opinions editor David Shipley.\n\nDozens of prominent staffers have left the paper in the wake of its controversial decision to block its editorial board from publishing an endorsement of the Democratic nominee, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, just prior to the Nov. 5 election.","summary":"Hewitt will provide analysis across all Fox News platforms and is set to make his debut appearance on Thursday's \"Special Report with Bret

appearance on Got To Get Out comes months after President Donald Trump claimed that he only hired the Apprentice star Omarosa as a White House aide as an ‘experiment’ and fired her because everybody ‘hated’ her and she was ‘late all the time.’\n\nThe revelation came in the book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass by Variety’s

2016 campaign trail, Trump announced he was hiring the former reality star just weeks before his 2017 swearing-in – as assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nShe lasted until December – fired by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly over overuse of the White House car service, Politico reported, and other bad behavior, DailyMail.com explained.\n\nTrump told Setoodeh the issues were even more broad.\n\n‘I saw her very little in the White House. The White House is a very big place! It’s buildings, actually. But the people hated her in Washington,’ he said.\n\n‘Her personality – she was late all the time. She wouldn’t show up,’ the ex-president continued. ‘Look, I tried to rehabilitate her reputation as an experiment.’\n\n‘And when I did, I said, “This probably won’t work out but let’s see what happens,”‘ Trump added. ‘And I also said… “When she gets fired, you always have to pay a price.” It’s too bad. In the White House, she didn’t cut the mustard.’\n\nOmarosa had worked in the White House before – under Democratic President Bill Clinton – but entered Trumpworld in 2004 as a contestant on season one of The Apprentice.\n\nIn 2018, she released a book titled Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House, which detailed her time working under the President.\n\nShe endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nControversial figure Omarosa Manigault-Newman has revealed why appearing on the new reality show&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debt-Stricken Former Trump Aide from The Apprentice Discloses Her Urgent Move for Fast Cash first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/debt-stricken-former-trump-aide-from-the-apprentice-discloses-her-urgent-move-for-fast-cash/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-Debt-ridden-Trump-aide-who-met-President-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 19:59:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.171},{"id":310392664,"title":"Democrats don’t want Kamala Harris","text":"Which brings the story to Kamala Harris. The former vice president lost the 2024 presidential election. Yes, she started late, and yes, she had to follow the enfeebled President Joe Biden. But Harris had a hugely enthusiastic base, all the money in the world, and glowing press coverage in her short race against a man Democratic prosecutors had indicted not one, not two, not three, but four times. And she still lost. Compared to 2020, the Democratic presidential ticket lost ground in state after state, lost all the critical swing states, and lost standing among important Democratic constituency groups, like black and Hispanic voters. \n\nHarris’s defeat, combined with the Democratic loss of the House and Senate, caused the party to begin a soul-searching exercise that continues to this day. Democratic strategists are torn between a visceral desire to base the party’s entire reason for existence on attacking President Donald Trump, or trying to reform the party’s positions and reconnect with lost voters. So far, the attack-Trump side is winning.\n\nFor 2028, the first question Democrats must grapple with is: Do we want to renominate Kamala Harris? The answer lies in the party’s history, for all to see. And it appears Harris has gotten the message. \n\n“Friends, former aides, and advisers say Ms. Harris, 60, still thinks she would have beaten Mr. Trump if she’d had more than 107 days to campaign — the implication being that former President Joe Biden should have quit the race earlier,” the New York Times reported this week. “Yet some of her closest allies say she is leaning against another White House run in 2028 and, instead, toward a campaign for governor of California in 2026. Her political choice is binary, she has told people: She can run for governor or president, but not both.”\n\nThe first part of that passage suggests Harris has settled on the belief that she didn’t really lose the 2024 election — Biden did. But the second part suggests that, whatever the truth, Harris has gotten the message that another presidential run would not succeed, even in securing the Democratic nomination.\n\nOf course, victory in a race for governor of California is not guaranteed, either. On the one hand, to quote a recent Los Angeles Times analysis, “Polls show that Harris would become the instant front-runner if she decides to jump into the governor’s race. Not only is Harris known nationwide as a former vice president and presidential nominee, but she has a well-established track record of winning statewide races in California.”\n\nOn the other hand, the governor’s race is already well underway. The front-runner is former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has big money support from celebrities such as Rob Reiner, as well as business figures such as former Walt Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, according to the Los Angeles Times. Would a Harris entry cause everyone to stop and support her? \n\nWhat’s more, Harris is already making clear that she regards the position of governor of California as a platform from which to attack Trump. “She has watched with horror as institutions Democrats care about — universities, law firms, and more — have caved under pressure,” the New York Times reported. “And she believes that as governor of the nation’s most populous blue state, she would have a powerful platform from which to push back against Mr. Trump and his policies, and to defend Democratic priorities and values.”\n\nIf that is what Harris is thinking, she’ll have two problems. One, she’ll have to get in line to bash Trump; that’s already clear. And two, Trump will leave the White House after the first two years of her term. She can spend the remaining two years blaming the guy who is gone, but California voters may want more forward-looking leadership.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Harris is considering other paths that don’t involve running for office. She might want to write a book and give speeches if there are publishers and audiences willing to pay enough for it. She also might want to establish a “policy institute” at a university, a Kamala D. Harris Institute for Advanced Political Studies, or something like that. She hasn’t decided.\n\nMeanwhile, the former vice president’s husband, Douglas Emhoff, is said to be making $6 million a year from the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which he recently joined. Which means Kamala Harris might have another option for something to do: Nothing. She doesn’t have to run for office. She doesn’t have to give speeches. She doesn’t have to set up an institute. She can dabble in things she enjoys. Travel. Give advice to aspiring politicians. And, of course, dump on Donald Trump. She would probably do that for free, anyway.","summary":"DEMOCRATS DON&#8217;T WANT KAMALA HARRIS. Here is a simple fact: The Democratic Party does not like to renominate presidential candidates who lost in the last election.

Despite having five children from three marriages, he never imagined that 31-year-old Tiffany and 18-year-old Barron would be more instrumental in his return to the White House than his three older children—Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. The three had been deeply involved in his 2016 campaign and first term, yet in 2024, they were almost irrelevant. This time, it was the moment for the family’s 'black sheep'. Once in a while, while riding in his limousine or private jet, Barron would call Trump and give him helpful strategic advice. \"There have been many times I've been traveling in the course of the campaign with my father-in-law in the car going to places\", said Lara Trump, Eric’s wife and one of Trump’s closest confidantes. “And Barron would call and say, 'Dad, I've an idea as to how you can get more votes. You need to go to this football stadium or appear on that podcast', or whatever it was. He was always throwing ideas, focusing on young voters. We have to give Barron some serious credit.” Barron's mother, Melania Trump, said after the election that he deliberately stayed out of the spotlight, but he makes everyone else look small. He’s smart, very funny, and is going to do amazing things. “He was very vocal” in giving advice to his father on what media appearances to make in order to gain a more favorable shift among younger people. He knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to,” Melania said, \"He knows his generation, because nowadays the young generation, they don’t sit in front of the TV anymore,” Melania said. \"They rely on podcasts, social media, and live streamers to get information. As a result, Barron brought in so many young people”, she added.

According to election night polling, there was a sharp shift rightward among Generation Z, particularly among young men, and especially young white men. Vice President Kamala Harris still won more than half of the votes from this generation, which came of age during the COVID-19 pandemic, but her share was significantly lower than what Democratic candidates typically receive from young voters. Trump, an aging 78-year-old who may or may not know how to send emails, and whose last known favorite song is Y.M.C.A. by the Village People, ran a campaign that was more relevant to young voters than Harris, a 60-year-old who aligns herself with Beyoncé. And much of that, it turns out, was thanks to Barron. Tiffany Trump’s influence was more indirect but still highly significant, she simply married someone whose father knew exactly what Trump needed to win Michigan, the critical swing state. Tiffany's husband, Michael Boulos, is the son of Lebanese-born billionaire Massad Boulos, who now serves as a special adviser to Trump on Middle East affairs. The chemistry between Trump and Boulos Sr. was immediate, ever since Tiffany first introduced her boyfriend, who is four years younger than her. During the campaign, Boulos Sr. became an influential figure in Trump’s inner circle. Most notably, he worked tirelessly in Michigan, spending time in Muslim communities and helping to persuade them, at the very least, not to vote for Harris, whom he accused of committing “genocide in Gaza”, while making vague promises that Trump would help the Palestinians. When Trump secured a victory in Michigan, with a significant portion of the state’s Muslim population voting for him, Boulos got all the credit. On election night, Tiffany and Barron stood onstage at Mar-a-Lago, facing a crowd of cheering supporters. They had both been there also when Trump won the election in 2016, but back then, Barron was a silent ten-year-old, and Tiffany was the daughter Trump rarely mentioned. Eight years later, they had helped him orchestrate what is being hailed as the greatest political comeback in American history. The story feels like a plotline from Succession, but now the question is, what does it mean for their future? Tiffany’s transformation: the jabs, the revenge, and the rise in her status During Donald Trump’s first term, the White House operated like a revolving door, with staff coming and going at an unprecedented pace. Few departures were as memorable as that of Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted just 11 days as White House communications director. Most firings stemmed from Trump’s insistence on absolute loyalty if you strayed even slightly from his line, you were out. But the dismissal of Madeleine Westerhout, a name largely unknown outside Trump’s inner circle, was different. It was a scandal even by Trump-world standards. Westerhout had been a loyal Trump aide since 2015, back when his candidacy seemed too implausible to even be a punchline. Once in the White House, she held a critical position as a key gatekeeper to the Oval Office, screening Trump's official calls and controlling the access of outside advisers. “Madeleine is the key. She's the secret,” Trump once said. So when she was abruptly fired, there had to be a serious reason. It turned out that two weeks before her dismissal, Westerhout had been drinking with reporters at a bar and had a little too much. She opened up to the reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany. \"Trump couldn’t pick Tiffany out of a crowd\", she said, adding that \"the President did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he perceived her as overweight.\" Westerhout was fired, not personally by Trump, who prefers to have others do his dirty work, but by his aides, who correctly saw that drunkenly gossiping with journalists was unacceptable for someone who had access to the president’s every move. But it’s doubtful Trump himself was particularly offended by her remarks about Tiffany. After all, at his wedding to Melania, he had assigned Tiffany the task of handing out the ceremony programs to guests. Tiffany was born in October 1993, at the height of Trump’s affair with model-actress Marla Maples. The romance had started while he was still married to Ivana, the mother of his three eldest children. Trump did cut Tiffany’s umbilical cord, which already made her more special than Ivanka, Donald Jr., Eric, or Barron, none of whom he had bothered to show up for at birth. Twenty minutes after she was born, he was on the phone with The New York Times, announcing his newborn daughter, whom he planned to name after the jewelry store located beneath Trump Tower. Trump’s marriage to Maples lasted four years. When they divorced, Maples took Tiffany to California, raising her alone in a Los Angeles suburb. Trump paid child support and covered her tuition, but Tiffany’s relationship with her half-siblings -Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka - was distant. “Her father wasn’t able to be there with day-to-day skills as a parent\", Maples told PEOPLE. \"He loves his kids. There’s no doubt. But everything was a bit of a negotiation. As far as time, it was just me, but it was important for me that Tiffany would form her own relationship with him.\" Trump never wanted a child with Maples, and for much of Tiffany’s life, he made sure she knew it. In one interview, she admitted, “It will be … a chance to be Tiffany, not just ‘Tiffany Trump.'” Just a month before the 2016 election, Trump sat for an interview with Melania and his four eldest children. Tiffany spoke only once during the entire interview, visibly searching for a way out the rest of the time. On election night in 2016, Trump took the stage and said, \"I'm very proud of my children. I mean, I'm just looking at them right now as an example... but I'm very proud 'cause Don and Eric and Ivanka and, you know, to a lesser extent 'cause she just got out of school, out of college, but, uh, Tiffany, who's also been so terrific.\" On Trump's inauguration night in January 2017, Tiffany stayed at a Washington hotel, while her siblings stayed at the White House. But she got a small moment of revenge in one of her rare public appearances alongside the family. When Trump was looking to get a kiss from her, she very visibly dodged him. The clip went viral. On election night in 2016, Trump referred to Tiffany: \"I'm very proud of my children. I mean, I'm just looking at them right now as an example... but I'm very proud 'cause Don and Eric and Ivanka and, you know, to a lesser extent 'cause she just got out of school, out of college, but, uh, Tiffany, who's also been so terrific.\" Whether by coincidence or not, Trump’s attitude toward Tiffany started to shift around the time she began dating Michael Boulos, whom she met in 2018 at a Mykonos club owned by Lindsay Lohan. Boulos was born in Houston, but when he was young his family moved to Nigeria, where his father, Dr. Massad Boulos, founded a conglomerate across West Africa. Boulos Jr. attended an American school in Lagos and became a celebrity in Nigeria, a country Trump infamously referred to in 2018 as a “shithole.” When asked about the remark, sources close to Tiffany told PEOPLE, “Tiffany’s not keeping her finger on the pulse of that BS\". Almost everything about Boulos’ background seemed like it would trigger someone who is as racist as Trump. But as always, Trump made exceptions when it suited him. He had long done business with wealthy Arab investors and enjoyed rubbing shoulders with them. The entire Trump family has close ties to Saudi royals and Gulf billionaires. Boulos came from money - the ultimate Trumpian prerequisite. Boulos gifted Tiffany a $600,000 bracelet, which greatly impressed Trump. After meeting the father Massad Boulos, Trump fully embraced the match. Tiffany announced her engagement to Boulos on January 19, 2021, the day before Trump left the White House. In the Rose Garden, Boulos slipped a $1.2 million ring on her finger, and Tiffany posted beautiful pictures on Instagram. Trump, notably, stopped mocking her in public, and two years ago he hosted a lavish wedding for her at Mar-a-Lago. Her new standing within the family likely won’t change her preference for staying out of the spotlight, but she can now walk into Trump family gatherings with far more confidence. Tiffany and Boulos live in Miami, not far from Ivanka and Jared Kushner, Donald Jr. and his ever-changing partner, and, of course, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Last October, Trump proudly announced that Tiffany was expecting her first child - his 11th grandchild. She’s no longer the black sheep. Barron stayed in the shadows but brought in the youth vote Like Tiffany, Barron was not a child Trump had planned. Melania once recalled breaking the news to her husband: \"He came home, and I told him he'd be a daddy, and his reaction was...at first he needed to take it in. It was a real surprise. And then he was very happy.\" Barron was just a few months old when Trump famously spent several nights in the company of adult film star Stormy Daniels. On the other hand, at least he got to choose his son’s name. Children of U.S. presidents don’t choose the spotlight, and American media traditionally respects their privacy, especially while they are under 18. When Trump entered the White House, four of his five children were already adults, but Barron was just ten, and his early years there were difficult. Katie Rich, a writer for Saturday Night Live, posted a tasteless tweet that \"Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter.\" Comedian Rosie O’Donnell, whose own daughter is on the autism spectrum, tweeted: “Barron Trump Autistic? If so - what an amazing opportunity to bring attention to the Autism epidemic.” The tweet included an edited video that suggested Barron was autistic. The backlash was swift and justified. Melania Trump threatened to sue YouTube, and the video was removed. Barron received unexpected support from Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary, who had faced similar treatment from the right-wing media in the 1990s when she was just 12. \"It's high time the media and everyone leave Barron Trump alone and let him have the private childhood he deserves.\" Speculation about Barron being on the autism spectrum stemmed largely from photos of him as a solemn-faced child who rarely smiled and often appeared disengaged. Melania dismissed the rumors outright: \"He is a very strong-minded, very special, smart boy. He is independent and opinionated and knows exactly what he wants. Sometimes, I call him Little Donald. He is a mixture of us in looks, but his personality is why I call him little Donald.\" From what little is known about his childhood, he loved playing with cars and helicopters, enjoyed soccer when he went outside, and was highly skilled with computers. Eight years after being mocked by liberal corners of the internet, Barron is getting his quiet revenge. He still avoids the spotlight, doesn’t give interviews, and rarely speaks in public, but his presence on social media is significant. In one of his rallies, Trump said to Barron: “You’re pretty popular, he might be more popular than Don and Eric. So Barron, it’s good to have you. Barron, had such a nice, easy life. Now, it’s a little bit changed.\" Now a freshman at New York University’s prestigious Stern School of Business, Barron spends his days on campus before returning to his “dorm” - an entire floor at the Trump Tower penthouse on Fifth Avenue. He also has a designated room at the White House, should he choose to visit, though that seems unlikely to happen often. \"I feel as children, we have them till they are 18, 19 years old. We teach them, we guide them, and then we give them the wings to fly,\" Melania said. \"I always respect Barron’s yes and no, and what he likes to do, where he would like to be.\" \"It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York and study in New York and live in his home. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be. His strength. His intelligence. His knowledge, his kindness. It's admirable.\" Last summer, Barron made his first-ever appearance at one of his father’s rallies. From the stage, Trump turned to him and said: “You’re pretty popular, he might be more popular than Don and Eric. So Barron, it’s good to have you. Welcome to the scene, Barron, I don’t know,” Trump said. “He had such a nice, easy life. Now, it’s a little bit changed.\" And indeed, it has changed. Barron, towering at 6-foot-8, walks the NYU campus accompanied by Secret Service agents, drawing attention wherever he goes. According to sources at the university who spoke to PEOPLE, dating hasn’t been an issue for him: \"He’s really popular with the ladies. Even liberal people like him.\" Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram","summary":"In Trump’s first term, Barron was just 10, and Tiffany was largely out of sight, now, Barron’s in college, Tiffany’s married to a Lebanese billionaire’s son—and both are gaining influence in Trump’s new government after helping fuel his historic comeback - The family’s former outliers aren't stepping aside","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/bk0ta20nyl","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/02/11/ByMdY9OYyx/ByMdY9OYyx_556_85_1578_888_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 19:42:46","author":"Tzippy Shmilovitz","authors":["Tzippy Shmilovitz"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.079},{"id":310224612,"title":"Did this Trump cabinet member win the ‘Grovel Gold’?","text":"Which of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet members praised him the most during the latest meeting?\n\nPolitical pundit Norman Ornstein said Thursday that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was going for the “Grovel Gold” when she delivered her remarks to Trump during the latest Cabinet meeting. Trump had each department deliver a brief report during the meeting that lasted for more than an hour.\n\nThe secretaries used the opportunity to laud Trump for his leadership style despite the stock market reeling from his unpopular tariff policies.\n\n“We are more than friends. We’ve all become family. I think what you have assembled in your vision is a turning point, inflection point in American history. Just being a part of that is the greatest honor, so thank you for that,” Rollins said during the meeting. \n\nOrnstein responded to a clip of her remarks, writing: “Going for the Grovel Gold!”. \n\nHowever, Rollins appeared to have some competition for the “Grovel Gold.”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick praised Trump for his work on tariffs despite his decision to roll back most of the tariffs earlier this week. This comes despite the stock market plummeting and warnings from Wall Street executives of a possible recession. \n\n“We have so many countries to talk to. It’s incredible. I’m not sure we could ever have enough time in a day because we have so many to talk to. And they come with offers that they never, ever, ever would have come with but for the moves the president has made, demanding that people treat the United States with respect. We’re getting the respect we deserve now,” Lutnick said.\n\nAnd Attorney General Pam Bondi applauded Trump’s win over former Vice President Kamala Harris in November. \n\n“You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority. Americans want you to be president because of your agenda. And the courts are ruling that you have the authority to determine how the money of this country will be spent,\" she said. \n\nTrump narrowly won the 2024 election over Harris. According to a report from The Washington Post, Trump’s margin of victory over Harris in the national popular vote was “the smallest of any president who secured a popular-vote win since Richard M. Nixon in 1968.\"\n\nTrump’s Cabinet members were mocked online for their unwavering praise of the president.\n\n“If you can watch even these short clips of Trump’s cabinet meeting without having a wave of foreboding wash over you, I’m not sure you’ve ever understood what is great about this nation.

This isn’t leadership—it’s a cringe cult of personality.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama’s adviser, Tommy Vietor, also weighed in. \n\n“Everyone should watch these Trump admin cabinet meetings.

Murray did not just use his appearance on the popular, increasingly influential podcast to debate Smith, though. He also used it to question Rogan for his habit of inviting guests on his show who harbor “counter-historical” views.\n\n“I just feel we should get it out straight away,” Murray told Rogan. “I feel you’ve opened the door to quite a lot of people who have now got a big platform who have been throwing out counter-historical stuff of a very dangerous kind.”\n\nMurray argued that Rogan should be more careful about platforming guests who share opinions about global conflicts and global history without being experts on the matters in question. The British cultural commentator specifically called out said guests’ tendency to claim they are “just asking questions” when they are, in fact, promoting misinformation or dangerous conspiracy theories.\n\n“If you throw a lot of s—t out there, there’s some point at which ‘I’m just raising questions’ is not a valid thing anymore,” Murray argued. “You’re not asking questions. You’re telling people something.”\n\nRogan countered that he does not choose his guests based on their personal beliefs but in his interest in them. “I don’t think about it that way,” the podcast host said. “I just think, ‘I’d like to talk to that person.’”\n\nMurray is not the first to criticize Rogan for his guest selection over the years. The podcast host’s tendency to focus on conspiracy theories and interview conspiracy theorists has been called out by plenty of figures both prominent and not, particularly during America’s recent election cycles and the COVID pandemic.\n\nRogan has never shied away from wading into political matters with his guests on his podcasts. Near the end of 2024, he even famously endorsed Donald Trump over Kamala Harris for president.

U.S. Dist. Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia denied Trump's motion to dismiss in a brief Thursday night order. The five men sued Trump in the midst of last fall's presidential election campaign, accusing him of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter, saying, “They admitted, they said, they pled guilty. And I said, ’well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty — then they pled we're not guilty,'” Trump said. The men — Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise — never pleaded guilty; they were convicted after jury trials. Also, no victim died. In a statement, their lawyer, Shanin Specter, said they are \"gratified by the Court’s ruling and thorough analysis and look forward to discovery, trial and the ultimate vindication of these five fine men.” Trump's lawyer did not immediately respond to an inquiry Friday. The men had asked for compensatory and punitive damages, saying Trump had knowingly defamed them, purposefully made false statements about them and sought to inflict severe emotional distress on them. Judge Beetlestone's order dismissed one of the claims, for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In the request to dismiss the case, Trump's lawyer had said the president's statements were protected under Pennsylvania laws that grant civil immunity over statements made on a “matter of public concern.” The request to dismiss also said Trump's statements were “substantially true,” that he didn't dispute the men were ultimately exonerated and that he had intended to portray his thinking in 1989 when, following the men having confessed, Trump purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. At the time, many in New York believed Trump’s ad was akin to calling for the teens to be executed. The five men had been teenagers when they were accused of the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in New York City’s Central Park. The five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after another person confessed to the crime. When the lawsuit was filed, Specter said Trump “defamed them in front of 67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names all over again.\" A Trump campaign spokesperson attacked it at the time as a \"frivolous election interference lawsuit.” Levy writes for the Associated Press.","summary":"The five men accuse Donald Trump of making 'false and defamatory statements' about them during the Sept. 10 debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-04-11/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-central-park-fives-defamation-case-against-president-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b44773/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+255/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2Fa6%2Fbc01811ce6b9d31862fd48c86be1%2Fb43e3a4c81a043dca532","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 18:24:27","author":"Marc Levy","authors":["Marc Levy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":310221636,"title":"Rep. Clyburn throws Kamala Harris campaign under the bus, says team failed her","text":"Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., called former Vice President Kamala Harris a \"great candidate\" who was ill-served by her campaign team, during an interview on Friday. The Democratic congressman was responding to CNN anchor Kate Bolduan asking about a New York Times report which said that since Harris' loss in the 2024 election, the former vice president has been mulling over another bid for the White House or entering the 2026 California gubernatorial race. Clyburn said he wasn't going to advise Harris on her next steps but praised her as a \"tremendous talent\" who had been let down by her campaign staff during the presidential race. TOP KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN ADVISOR ADMITS SHE WAS FLOORED BY DEMOCRAT'S MAJOR FLUB ON 'VIEW' \"I will say this. I think that she is a tremendous talent. I think she ran a great campaign. I think she was ill-served in that campaign by people who should have listened to some of us who saw and felt things,\" Clyburn began. \"Listen to Bill Clinton when he told them what was going on. Listen to yours truly, when I was going around these rural communities, I knew what we needed to do and was not doing it,\" he continued. \"She was a great candidate, and I think she will make a great candidate in the future, whatever she decides to run for. But I‘m not going to give any advice as to whether or not she should or should not.\" Harris' office did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment. HARRIS WAS ‘COMPLETELY SHOCKED’ BY DEFEAT, BELIEVED SHE COULD'VE WON WITH MORE TIME, AUTHOR SAYS According to the bombshell new book, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" by journalists Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen, Harris \"bought the hype\" she was going to win the election. \"She was completely shocked, and [Harris' running mate] Tim Walz was shocked,\" Parnes said on the podcast \"Somebody's Gotta Win with Tara Palmeri,\" last week. \"They thought that they were going to win. And so, you know, when they come back now and say, 'Oh, no, we didn't really have a chance.' No, that's not what they were thinking. They thought they were going to win,\" she added. Harris campaign staffers felt \"gaslit\" by leadership about Harris' chances at winning after being told that \"things were looking good\" for the candidate ahead of the election, according to Parnes. Harris has reportedly told friends in the aftermath of her defeat that she could've won the election if she had more time and if Biden hadn't run for re-election.
