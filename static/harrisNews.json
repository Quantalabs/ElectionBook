One ad said Cuomo \"harassed and intimidated the women who dared to speak out\" against him.\n\nMariann Wang, a lawyer for Brittany Commisso, who accused Cuomo of groping her while she worked in his office, said in a statement: \"An unrepentant sexual harasser who resigned in disgrace and who has spent the past four years spending millions in taxpayer money to vindictively litigate against his victims should not be the mayor of New York City.\"\n\nCuomo has denied the allegations, fighting them in court and characterizing them as politically motivated efforts to damage his reputation.\n\n\"From Day 1, the governor maintained he never harassed anyone,\" said Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo. \"Years later, the facts have borne that out. New Yorkers aren't naive and understand that ugly political situation for exactly what it was.\"\n\nCuomo did not directly address the allegations in his campaign launch video Saturday but did refer to unspecified mistakes.\n\n\"Did I make mistakes, some painfully?\" he asked. \"Definitely, and I believe I learned from them and that I am a better person for it and I hope to show that every day.\"\n\nThe power of the #MeToo movement has seemed to wane in recent years, with the reelection of President Donald Trump, a Republican, a visible example. A Manhattan jury had already found him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nDemocrats have typically been less accepting of politicians accused of sexual misconduct than Republicans. But some voters might be more worried about issues such as subway crime and immigration. Cuomo has regularly led in polls against the embattled incumbent, Eric Adams, showing that many New Yorkers may consider giving him a second chance.\n\nThe Democratic mayoral primary in June will pose a test of voter tolerance of sexual misconduct allegations: Cuomo is one of three mayoral candidates who have faced them. A woman filed a lawsuit last year accusing Adams of sexually assaulting her in 1993. Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller, was accused of sexual harassment by two women during the 2021 mayoral race. Adams and Stringer have denied the allegations.\n\nCharlotte Bennett, the first of Cuomo's aides to accuse him of harassment, and Commisso sued Cuomo and several of his top aides for sexual harassment, as did an unnamed state trooper who said Cuomo touched her inappropriately.\n\nIn December, Bennett dropped her federal suit against him, shortly before she was slated to be deposed; her separate suit against the state remains active. Lawyers for Bennett and the trooper declined to comment about Cuomo's candidacy.\n\nThe state has spent $25 million representing the legal interests of Cuomo and several aides in various investigations, including fighting to clear his name from the 11 sexual harassment accusations that prompted his resignation in 2021. His team often cites how, despite criminal investigations by several district attorneys, none resulted in charges.\n\nIn 2021, as pressure built for him to step down, Cuomo apologized for making \"people feel uncomfortable\" and said he was embarrassed. He acknowledged in his resignation speech that there were \"11 women who I truly offended\" and that there were \"generational and cultural shifts that I just didn't fully appreciate and I should have.\"\n\nBut not long after leaving office, Cuomo began more aggressively defending his legacy. In his legal fight against Bennett, his lawyers have sought records from her gynecologist, college and family therapist.\n\nCuomo's lawyer Rita Glavin said Bennett's gynecological records were part of a \"pro forma request for medical records, which included a range of doctors.\" She added that Wang's statement calling Cuomo an unrepentant harasser was \"demonstrably false and defamatory\" and that the civil cases had \"actively fallen apart as a result of discovery that gutted the cases.\"\n\nSome accusers are hesitant to speak out against Cuomo for fear of reprisal after he filed notice in December of intent to sue Bennett for defamation.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nBoylan said in an interview that she was comfortable speaking up for those fearful of retaliation. She said the harassment allegations were an important part of Cuomo's record.\n\n\"His abuse of his female staffers is central as an example of his abuse of New York,\" she said.\n\nSome of Cuomo's opponents plan to hold a women's rally Sunday to \"remind New Yorkers of his history of sexual harassment and abuses of power.\" The left-leaning Working Families Party posted a video Saturday featuring women saying, \"Hell no to Cuomo.\"\n\nCuomo plans to hold a fundraising event Friday led by a large group of women, including his daughters.\n\nSeveral candidates running against Cuomo have raised concerns over the harassment allegations, his handling of nursing home deaths during the coronavirus pandemic and ethical issues during his time as governor. A pollster working with a left-leaning anti-Cuomo coalition argued in an essay that Cuomo's support could quickly erode once voters were reminded of his record.\n\nA new super PAC launched to attack Cuomo, New Yorkers for Better Leadership, released a memo Friday criticizing Cuomo's record. It also hired Lauren Hitt, who has worked as a spokesperson for former Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nLander released a video criticizing Cuomo's decision to seek records from Bennett's gynecologist. Other candidates have criticized Cuomo, including Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund executive who was asked recently on CNN if the harassment allegations disqualified Cuomo from being mayor.\n\n\"Well, the women I've talked to in New York sure seem to think so,\" Tilson said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nWhen Cuomo released a campaign-style video on Valentine's Day showing him holding a rose and hugging women, it struck some as tone deaf. But it also reinforced the idea that many women still like him.\n\nCuomo was viewed favorably by about 55% of female voters -- higher than his standing among men -- in a poll by The New York Times in October. Views about sexual harassment vary by age; women younger than 30 were the age group most inclined to support #MeToo, according to a Pew Research survey.\n\nKaren Hinton, a former consultant for Cuomo who also claimed that he touched her inappropriately, called his approach toward the accusers \"horrid\" and said he should not be mayor. She added that she was disappointed that the #MeToo movement had grown less powerful.\n\n\"It's a city full of progressive women and men who do not approve of his behavior, but they will likely say, 'Cuomo is all we've got,'\" she said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"NEW YORK -- In the months before he joined New York City's mayoral race, Andrew Cuomo sought to create as much distance as possible from the sexual harassment scandal that forced him to resign as governor more than three years…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/cuomos-foes-look-to-renew-focus-on-sexual-harassment-scandal/article_466bd282-efe7-5403-89ea-c4d38408bfa1.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 23:03:28","author":"Blox Content Management,Emma G.

One sign read, \"Vance is a traitor. Go ski in Russia.\"\n\nFanning the opposition to Vance’s visit to the Mad River Valley, a day after Vance and President Donald Trump appeared to side with Russia over Ukraine in an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, was Sugerbush snow reporter Lucy Welch.\n\nAccording to Kottke.org, Welch emailed daily-report subscribers with a morning message criticizing the Trump administration for slashing Forest Service jobs and pointing out that Sugarbush is on National Forest land and threatened by climate change.\n\n“Right now, National Forest lands and National Parks are under direct attack by the current Administration, who is swiftly terminating the positions of dedicated employees who devote their lives to protecting the land we love, and to protecting us while we are enjoying that land,” Welch wrote.\n\nWelch's email continued: “This Administration also neglects to address the danger, or even the existence of, climate change, the biggest threat to the future of our industry, and the skiing we all so much enjoy here.”\n\nVideo clips showing protestors lining the roads and sharing their feelings have been circulating via social media. Some are shown carrying flags as a show of support for Ukraine.\n\nFox news reported that the presence of protestors was so great that the Vance family was moved \"to an “undisclosed location.”\n\nAt nearby Mad River Glen, a sign outside informed, “Sorry VP. Sold out.”\n\nVermont was won by Kamala Harris over Donald Trump by a landslide margin in the 2024 presidential race. So it’s not surprising that some protestors wondered why Vance chose Sugarbush for his family vacation.\n\nThreads user Catsonacouch wrote, “JD Vance choosing Vermont to ski is still so baffling to me: 'I'd like to go away with the fam for the weekend, I KNOW, I'll go where LITERALLY everybody hates me.' \"\n\nIt was not clear if the Vance family was able to enjoy quality time on the slopes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: JD Vance and family met by protestors during Vermont ski vacation","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/jd-vance-receives-ice-cold-214153836.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QvX6FLDEJbWd0Fxb0WRhZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03NDU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ftw_outdoors_usa_today_article_609/1d81bdaae8028967347234c4c9a14e52","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 21:41:53","author":"Pete Thomas, For The Win","authors":["Pete Thomas, For The Win"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.154},{"id":295714218,"title":"Bettors on Polymarket are picking 'Anora' to win Best Picture at the Oscars","text":"Betters are banking on Sean Baker's \"Anora\" to win big at the 97th Academy Awards.Hollywood stars will descend upon the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday to attend the Oscars.

Why?","text":"One common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies.\n\nIt began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there.\n\nBut Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.\n\n\"If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,\" he said.\n\nThe audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified.\n\nThis was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security.\n\nThis was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent.\n\nNot for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party.\n\nHis speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics.\n\nYet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson.\n\nVance accused him of \"moralistic garbage\", \"historical illiteracy\" and - worst of all - of being a \"globalist\".\n\nAnd if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week.\n\nOut of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\".\n\nThe prime minister pushed back firmly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\".\n\nThis was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms.\n\nThe aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.","summary":"Is the US vice-president doing Trump's bidding or looking to the future?","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewkg71d8rlo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3594/live/1dd22500-f6cb-11ef-a811-cd286d96b2f6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 18:30:48","author":"James Landale","authors":["James Landale"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.161},{"id":295695110,"title":"They Help Make the Hamptons the Hamptons, and Now They're Living in Fear","text":"The party dresses must be double-pressed, the hedges shaved into sharp rectangles. The hand soap and lotion dispensers must be formed into neat lines along bathroom sinks. Caterers need to slip out of view as soon as the oysters and cocktails are served.\n\nWealthy residents of the Hamptons demand perfection. Now, many of the people who make it so -- Latino immigrants, some of them in the country illegally -- are panicking about President Donald Trump's deportation orders.\n\nThe fear is on display outside a convenience store where day laborers sprint into a nearby field when a stranger approaches. It is present in the nervous apologizing of a longtime housekeeper when she interacts with police after a minor automobile scrape. And it courses through a small encampment in the woods where a landscaper is awaiting warmer weather so he can start cutting grass again to send money home to his family in Mexico.\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear,\" said Sandra Melendez, a trustee for the village of East Hampton and an immigration lawyer. \"They think Immigration is coming out to get them.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has begun carrying out his plan for mass deportations across the nation, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents forcing immigrants living in the country illegally back to their countries of origin.\n\nKristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, and federal officers arrived in New York City in January in a show of force that resulted in more than three dozen arrests. Although it is unclear whether arrests are being executed in New York en masse, the actions have terrified people who work in factories, farms and schools.\n\nIn the Hamptons, with miles of privet hedges and luxury homes, Latino immigrants make up the bulk of the workforce, logging 12-hour days flipping mattresses, scrubbing toilets and hanging drywall, and in the summer tending vineyards and assembling patio furniture under the hot sun.\n\nSome of the workers arrived illegally, crossing the U.S. border after grueling desert or jungle treks. Some have legal working papers but are worried they could be swept up in raids or that their unauthorized family members and friends could. Some believe Trump is only going after criminals; others aren't sure that's true.\n\nLatinos also are an established part of the Hamptons community. In the town of East Hampton, which encompasses many of the villages at the east end of Long Island, Latinos make up more than one-fourth of the population, according to U.S. census figures. The student population in several local schools is more than half Latino.\n\nBut to most of the world, the Hamptons are best known for celebrity-studded parties and megamansions that dot the seashore, such as one house in Sagaponack that has been valued at $425 million and has 29 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms. It's a community where diner patrons wear Balenciaga booties and Aston Martin sports cars cruise past strip malls. On sale at one popular grocery store: an 18-ounce tin of caviar for $1,300.\n\nThe disappearance of some of the Hamptons' most vulnerable residents would have an immediate effect on some of the nation's wealthiest.\n\n\"The community on the East End of Long Island -- it's an understatement to say it's way dependent on the Latino population,\" said Lee Skolnick, a celebrated architect who lives in Sag Harbor. \"They're part of the community. They have as much of a role in our beneficial existence as anyone else.\"\n\nLast fall, billionaire hedge fund managers, financiers and various glitterati hosted fundraisers there for both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, although voters across much of the Hamptons favored Kamala Harris in November. If some residents support Trump's broad crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally, most couch it in terms of deporting violent criminals.\n\nLocal officials have tried to calm the worries of the people who make the Hamptons the Hamptons, both workers in the country illegally and wealthy residents. At public meetings, the officials have explained that local police don't have the authority to deport anyone, urging anyone who needs police or medical help to feel safe seeking it out.\n\nBut officials are carefully choosing their words to indicate that they won't stand in the way should ICE agents arrive.\n\n\"I don't think there's anybody who wants criminals living in our community,\" said Jerry Larsen, mayor of East Hampton village. \"Everybody is on the same page for that. But the misinformation is driving the fear, and that's what we're aiming to clear up.\"\n\nResidents who had been working to find more affordable housing for local workers are shifting their efforts to finding legal help for immigrants who are afraid.\n\nSome, including Prudence Carabine, believe the local government should provide that assistance. At a public meeting of East Hampton town officials last month, she laid out her case.\n\n\"I think of my friends and people who have been in this town for 30, 40, 50 years who are now huddling in their houses, sometimes keeping their children out of school, afraid to shop,\" said Carabine, whose family arrived in the Hamptons from Europe in the 1600s. \"And I think: What a terrible place we have come to.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAfraid to Go Out\n\nThe special symbiosis of the Hamptons is on display every morning and evening, when long lines of pickup trucks clog Montauk Highway, shuttling Latino workers between job sites and homes in less expensive areas. Some residents call it \"the trade parade,\" a phrase that some workers consider derisive.\n\nBut Latinos in the Hamptons are more than a commuter population. They own popular businesses such as John Papas Cafe, a Greek diner offering a $21.50 Parthenon omelet. The owner, from Ecuador, started as a kitchen worker, employees said, and worked his way up.\n\nLeo Cruz arrived in the United States from Costa Rica in 2007 on a tourist visa and has since become a U.S. citizen. He and his siblings own Cruz Brothers Construction, an East Hampton firm that works on high-end projects. Cruz opposes open borders but thinks there should be an easier pathway to citizenship for immigrants who can contribute to American society.\n\nHis firm can't find enough workers at the moment, he said.\n\nThe area is quiet now, with snow blanketing vineyards and beaches. Lobster shacks and ice cream shops are shuttered. Rows of small trees and bushes are wrapped snugly in covers to protect them from the elements.\n\nIn Latino neighborhoods, fewer people are shopping at the Mexican, Ecuadorean and Dominican markets and eating in the diners thumping with cumbia music tucked out of sight from the luxury stores and fine-dining establishments.\n\nSome of the wealthy are quietly beginning to make calculations about what it would mean if their workers living in the country illegally were deported. Who would mow the lawn?\n\n\"Everyone relies on housekeepers and carpenters and tree cutters and grass cutters,\" said Marit Molin, founder and executive director of Hamptons Community Outreach. \"People come to the Hamptons to enjoy their houses, and who is going to take care of their houses?\"\n\nLiving on the Fringes\n\nLocal institutions have made efforts to connect with the Latino community. The Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill offers Latino-themed exhibitions and student programs that include Latino children. A prominent cultural organization called The Church in Sag Harbor has made efforts to reach Latinos through community events.\n\nBut many Latino residents here are largely segregated from their wealthy, mostly white neighbors. Some live on the fringes, sharing tiny rooms or riding bikes to day-laborer pickup sites an hour away.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Molin visited a small group of immigrants in the country illegally who had been living under a tarp in the woods behind an ice cream shop until a manager there threatened to call police. The group moved into the trees elsewhere, nearly in the backyard of an upscale restaurant.\n\nOne of the men living in the woods is a landscaper waiting for summer jobs; another lost his job at a deli after he took time off to treat an injury; another suffers stomach pain and cannot work. They spend their days wandering through stores, warming up and charging their phones. Molin handed them gift cards for food and offered to pay cellphone bills and even purchase plane tickets to their home countries if they wanted to go. None did.\n\nSome Hamptons workers who are in the country legally have spent tens of thousands of dollars to file immigration paperwork but are afraid that they might be harassed or detained regardless of their status.\n\nOne woman, a housekeeper, said that although she could support her family in Ecuador, she did not have the money for a lawyer to help expedite her political-asylum case. She also worries that if she shows up to court, she might be deported. She said she was so exhausted by anxiety that she felt ready to leave the country if ordered to do so.\n\nAnother cleaner said she did not believe she would be deported because her boyfriend is an American citizen and her four children were born in the United States. Besides, she said, she believes Trump is detaining only criminals.\n\nBoth women asked not to be identified because of the stigma of deportation threats.\n\nSusan Meisel, an art collector who owns a Bridgehampton restaurant, said she, too, believed that federal officers would be able to weed out criminals and deport them.\n\n\"Most of the people in the Hamptons are very hardworking, kind, honest people,\" she said, speaking of Latino immigrants. \"They are good people. There is a difference between them and who they say they are going to deport.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nFederal officials have said they intend to prioritize immigrants living in the country illegally who have committed crimes. But Trump has also said that he would deport millions of people who are living in the country illegally -- a characterization that is complicated because many immigrants have temporary permissions that will expire during Trump's term.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSome of the Hamptons' wealthier residents have begun raising money for lawyers to help immigrants avoid an ICE dragnet.\n\n\"I've been trying to encourage people to give a little more money, even if you're a little more stretched,\" said April Gornik, a well-known landscape painter who lives in Sag Harbor with her husband, artist Eric Fischl.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nMinerva Perez, executive director of Organización Latino-Americana of Eastern Long Island, an advocacy group, said school districts and police departments should distribute clearer policies in both English and Spanish about how they plan to respond to federal immigration orders so that residents feel informed.\n\n\"There's sometimes a good degree of empathy,\" she said. \"In this moment, empathy is not enough.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The party dresses must be double-pressed, the hedges shaved into sharp rectangles.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) the other day said what every Democrat truly believes: Your money isn’t yours. In a recent interview, the Texas Democrat dismissed the idea that Americans should keep $5,000 of their own earnings, scoffing, “Americans do not need $5,000.” She went even farther, saying, “We are not in the business of giving out money.”\n\nThat kind of detached arrogance could only come from a career politician — someone who has never had to budget, sacrifice, or work outside the D.C. bubble. But her words go beyond tone-deaf. They are a direct insult to millions of working-class families for whom $5,000 is not spare change. It can mean the difference between paying rent or facing eviction, keeping food on the table or going hungry, fixing a car or losing a job.\n\nFor years, Democrats have convinced voters that they are the party of the working class. But the mask is off. They serve elitist grifters, billionaire donors, and government insiders.\n\nMeanwhile, taxpayers foot the bill for Crockett’s $999-a-month luxury car lease. While she enjoys that perk, she tells struggling families that $5,000 is meaningless. Maybe to her, it is. But for most Americans, it’s a lifeline.\n\nAt a time when inflation and economic uncertainty are squeezing households, she is chauffeured around on the taxpayer's dime, mocking the idea that people should have even a little more breathing room in their bank accounts.\n\nAnd here’s the truth the media won’t say: The Democratic Party serves the wealthy. More than that, Democrats thrive on keeping Americans poor — because poverty means control.\n\nDemocrats claim to fight for the working class, but their bank accounts tell a different story. Bill and Hillary Clinton entered the White House broke and left worth hundreds of millions. Barack Obama was drowning in student debt before politics; now, he’s buying oceanfront mansions while warning about climate change. Kamala Harris, a career civil servant, is suddenly raking in millions. And then there’s Nancy Pelosi, whose stock trades have outperformed Wall Street’s top investors while she helps shape market-moving legislation.\n\nThese aren’t public servants. They are parasitic profiteers. The more Americans struggle, the more power — and wealth — they gain.\n\nThis is why they despise the Department of Government Efficiency. For the first time, someone is exposing how taxpayer money vanishes into slush funds and fraudulent programs, enriching the very politicians who claim to serve the people. Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative isn’t just about efficiency — it’s about cutting off the endless cash flow that keeps these politicians wealthy. That’s why they are in full meltdown mode.\n\nDemocrats have no interest in fixing this. They rely on a bloated, corrupt, and inefficient system that lets them funnel taxpayer money wherever they want — activist groups, left-wing nonprofits, billionaire donors, and even their own pockets.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans foot the bill for their lavish lifestyles.\n\nWe’re paying for Nancy Pelosi’s luxury travel while she profits from suspicious securities trading. We’re paying for Jasmine Crockett’s $999-a-month car lease. We’re paying for D.C. elites to party while they laugh at our struggles.\n\nAnd they have the nerve to tell you $5,000 is meaningless.\n\nLife has only gotten worse under their leadership. Gas prices have doubled since Trump left office in 2021. Food costs are at record highs. Home ownership is out of reach for most young Americans. Yet the same politicians keep voting to raise their own salaries, expand their travel budgets, and fund more luxury perks for themselves.\n\nAnd then they have the audacity to claim that giving you a tax cut, letting you keep more of your money, or making the government less wasteful is somehow dangerous.\n\nThat’s why they are panicked over the DOGE. Once Americans see how much of their hard-earned money is wasted — once they understand exactly how the system is rigged — the backlash will be unstoppable.\n\nJasmine Crockett didn’t just misspeak. She revealed the Democratic Party’s entire strategy: Keep Americans struggling, keep them dependent, and keep them too poor to fight back. That’s how they stay in power.\n\nFor years, Democrats have convinced voters that they are the party of the working class. But the mask is off. They serve elitist grifters, billionaire donors, and government insiders who don’t care if you suffer — as long as they keep getting richer.\n\nSo the next time a Democrat claims he's fighting for “the people,” ask him how much his car lease costs. Ask him how his net worth tripled while in office. Ask him why he is so outraged that Elon Musk is exposing government fraud.\n\nBecause the answer is simple: Democrats are getting rich from your struggle. And they intend to keep it that way.","summary":"Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) the other day said what every Democrat truly believes: Your money isn’t yours.

Surprisingly, Biden did not hold Vice President Kamala Harris responsible for the defeat, despite her leading the Democratic ticket after Biden’s withdrawal.Why did Joe Biden blame Obama and Pelosi for the 2024 election defeat?According to Trump, who revealed the details in an interview with Spectator World, Biden was “very angry” after the Democrats’ crushing loss. When Trump asked Biden whom he blamed for the defeat, Biden responded, “I blame Barack. And I also blame Nancy Pelosi.” This statement underscores Biden’s frustration with the Democratic leadership, particularly figures who had played a significant role in pushing him out of the race.Obama initially supported Biden’s re-election bid despite growing concerns about his age and declining performance. However, following Biden’s disastrous debate on June 27, Obama reportedly shifted his stance and began advising Democratic leaders to consider an alternative nominee. By mid-July, discussions between Obama and Pelosi intensified, leading to Biden’s decision to step down on July 21.How did Nancy Pelosi influence Biden’s decision to drop out?Pelosi was instrumental in Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race. After his weak debate performance, high-profile Democrats, including Pelosi, expressed concerns about his ability to defeat Trump. Pelosi met with Obama and other party elites to discuss the growing pressure on Biden to exit the race, fearing that his candidacy could cost Democrats not just the White House but also key congressional seats.Biden later admitted that he was “nudged out” by senior Democrats, including Pelosi. While he publicly refrained from criticizing Obama, Trump’s recent comments suggest Biden privately held resentment toward both Obama and Pelosi for what he perceived as a forced exit from the campaign.Why did Biden not blame Kamala Harris for the 2024 loss?Despite Harris losing to Trump in the general election, Biden did not hold her responsible. Trump found this particularly surprising, stating, “I asked him, ‘What about the vice president?’ And he said, ‘No, I don’t blame her.’” This suggests that Biden believed the loss was more about internal party decisions than Harris’s performance.One reason Biden may have absolved Harris is that she had only a few months to campaign after he stepped down. Replacing a sitting president on the ballot so late in the election cycle presented significant challenges, and Harris had little time to counter Trump’s momentum. Additionally, Biden’s quick endorsement of Harris upon his withdrawal signaled his commitment to party unity, despite internal conflicts.What were the key factors behind the Democratic Party’s loss in 2024?The Democratic Party’s defeat in 2024 was not solely due to leadership struggles. Several critical factors contributed to the loss:Biden’s debate performance – His lackluster performance in the June 27 debate raised serious doubts about his ability to continue leading the country, leading to increased pressure from party leaders.Voter concerns about age and health – At 82, Biden faced intense scrutiny over his cognitive and physical fitness, which became a focal point of the election.Late campaign transition – Harris had limited time to establish her campaign after Biden’s withdrawal, making it difficult to build strong voter confidence.Republican momentum – Trump’s strong base and strategic campaign efforts, particularly in swing states, played a crucial role in his victory.Democratic Party infighting – Internal divisions and disagreements over Biden’s candidacy weakened the party’s overall election strategy.A divided Democratic Party faces challenges aheadBiden’s reported frustration with Obama and Pelosi highlights deeper fractures within the Democratic Party. While Biden blamed these two figures for his forced withdrawal and the party’s subsequent loss, the 2024 election exposed broader challenges, including voter concerns about leadership, age, and party unity. As Democrats look toward 2028, they must address these internal issues to present a stronger, more unified front.FAQs:Why did Joe Biden blame Obama and Pelosi for the 2024 election loss?Biden felt they pressured him to withdraw, weakening the Democratic campaign.Why didn’t Biden blame Kamala Harris for the defeat?He believed party leadership decisions, not Harris, led to the loss.","summary":"Joe Biden blames Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi for the Democratic Party’s 2024 election loss, according to Donald Trump.

Others saw it as a reason to end American aid to Ukraine. \n\nRepublican Kansas Senator Roger Marshall reposted a video of the interaction on X and added: “Not another penny.”\n\n“From the beginning of this war, I’ve made it clear where I stand: Peace. Zelensky has been a bad actor from the start,” Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X. “What we saw today is the culmination of an arrogant small man’s ego FINALLY meeting world leaders who won’t put up with it. God Bless President Trump and Vice President Vance!!”\n\n“Zelenskyy just learned that Donald Trump and JD Vance are not Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert added. \n\n“Job well done by @realDonaldTrump and our VP @JDVance. Give respect to get respect,” Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett said. \n\n“President Zelenskyy had an epic meltdown in the Oval Office—he crashed and burned,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas argued. “This will go down as one of the most disastrous Oval Office meetings in our nation’s history.”\n\nTwo White House officials said Trump asked Zelensky to leave the complex after the botched talks, according to Politico. No mineral deal was signed. The planned press conference was canceled. \n\nAt the White House, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters that the meeting was an “utter disaster” and that he had told the Ukrainian leader not to “take the bait” by arguing with the president. \n\n“I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again … The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president was just over the top,” said Graham. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with or he needs to change.”\n\nAmid widespread allegations of a “setup” targeting the Ukrainian leader, former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, told Politico that “The American side seemed to be intent on provoking a fight.”\n\nZelensky visited Washington partly to sign a mineral deal that both the Americans and Ukrainians said they planned to complete on Friday. \n\n“To have that kind of a blow up in the Oval Office when you’re getting what you demanded, which is a signature on the minerals deal, cannot be easily explained or understood in terms of American interest,” Fried added. \n\nOne White House aide denied that the criticism against Zelensky was pre-meditated. \n\n“Going in, everyone was expecting the exact opposite of what happened in the Oval,” the aide told Politico. \n\nThe mineral deal was intended to get Ukraine to share some of the country’s mineral wealth with the U.S., with Zelensky pushing for security guarantees from the U.S. as part of the negotiations. But the chat in front of the cameras in the Oval Office went awry when the vice president stepped in to argue for a diplomatic end to the war. \n\nZelensky grew angry as he pointed to a number of failed diplomatic attempts to get to a ceasefire in the conflict on eastern Ukraine, which has been ongoing since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula in the Black Sea. Then, Trump and Zelensky began to talk over each other. \n\n“You’re gambling with World War III,” said Trump as Vance pushed Zelensky to show more gratitude for American support. \n\n“Have you said ‘thank you’ once?” Vance asked.","summary":"‘What we saw today is the culmination of an arrogant small man’s ego FINALLY meeting world leaders who won’t put up with it,’ Rep.

Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., warned on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs could put Michigan’s auto industry in peril. During her seventh State of the State Address, Whitmer sounded the alarm on Trump’s plan to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting the White House to fire back. \"Whitmer seems to be running more for Governor of Canada in her stout defense of a deadly status quo in which over a million Americans have been slaughtered by the Chinese poison of fentanyl pouring across our northern and southern borders,\" White House Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing Peter Navarro said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"President Trump will stop that slaughter even as he will stand up for America’s auto industry, which will once again boom under the Trump tariffs.\" Trump’s tariff plans would impact Michigan, given its shared border with Canada and Detroit’s leadership of the U.S. auto industry. Whitmer has identified economic development and trade with Canada as key priorities for her state this year. MEXICO, CANADA TARIFFS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED DUE TO 'UNACCEPTABLE' DRUG FLOW, TRUMP SAYS \"Industry leaders and top economic minds on both sides of the aisle are warning us about the havoc that 25% tariffs would wreak on Michigan's auto industry, while raising everyday expenses for families,\" Whitmer continued. \"I'm grateful that Republicans, Democrats and private sector leaders are speaking out against widespread 25% tariffs on our neighbors. Because we know saying no to Canada would mean saying yes to China.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER SOUNDS OFF ON PUSH TO CONDEMN US SUPREME COURT'S GAY MARRIAGE RULING: 'HELL NO' Trump confirmed on Thursday that his proposed 25% tariff plan would go into effect next week because \"drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada.\" He said the tariffs will begin on March 4 \"until it stops, or is seriously limited.\" \"...The proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled. China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date. The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect,\" Trump said on Truth Social. Earlier this month, Trump issued a 30-day pause on his 25% tariff plan for Canada and Mexico following negotiations on border security and drug trafficking with the North American leaders. \"I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30-day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured,\" Trump announced on Truth Social. Whitmer said on Wednesday that she was grateful the president had made an initial pause on the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. \"As I've said before, I'm not opposed to tariffs outright. But they're a blunt tool when the Michigan economy is on the line,\" Whitmer added. \"25% tariffs on everything would slow down construction, shutter small businesses, lead to layoffs in the auto industry and cost Michigan families an extra $1,200 a year at the store and the pump because companies will pass their higher costs on to the consumer. It would be a disaster.\" Whitmer said she asked Michiganders how they feel about tariffs and received 3,000 written responses in 48 hours from people who are worried about prices going up. \"For them and every Michigander, let's keep speaking with one voice for smart trade policies to level the playing field and secure American jobs without jacking up costs. On tariffs and every issue, Michiganders expect us to work together in Lansing, because that's how things get done.\" Trump vowed to save the auto industry during his inaugural address, building on a key campaign promise made during his Michigan rallies last year. \"With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers,\" Trump said during his inaugural address. Trump laid out his vision for American auto manufacturing at the Detroit Economic Club in October 2024. \"My goal is to see U.S. auto manufacturing even greater than it was in its prime, and for Detroit and Michigan to be at the center of the action. For generations, this city and state were the world capital of automotive production,\" Trump said. He was criticized by Michigan politicians for calling Detroit a \"developing area\" during that speech. \"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president,\" Trump said of former Vice President Kamala Harris. \"He doesn't have a clue what the hell he was talking about. And you know what I think? He ought to keep Detroit out of his mouth,\" Whitmer fired back last year. Trump argued during the same speech that his tariff agenda would put an end to foreign leaders taking advantage of America’s auto industry. \"Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army,\" he said. \"This was a foreign army invading us, but it was an army of business people, very brilliant business people, that took the candy out of our pockets, just like you take it from a baby. That's how easy it was for them. Factories were left in ruins.\" \"When foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple: Building in America, you don't have any tariffs. Build it right here in Detroit, you don't have any tariffs. Build it in Dearborn or Lansing or Grand Rapids or Flint, you don't have any taxes. You don't have any taxes or tariffs or anything,\" Trump added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump also committed to leading the \"Michigan miracle\" and the \"rebirth of Detroit. \"By the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit that's going to happen,\" Trump said.","summary":"Gov.

We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\n\nAnd with that, all you-know-what-double L broke loose inside the Post. CNN headlined: \n\nWashington Post staffers are in open rebellion against Jeff Bezos\n\nThis jewel of a story reported this - with bold print for emphasis supplied:\n\nCNN — Current and former Washington Post staffers are rebelling against Jeff Bezos after he announced a “significant” editorial shift that will see the paper’s Opinion section focus almost exclusively on personal liberties and free markets.\n\n…The Bezos announcement sent shockwaves through the Post, alarming current and former staffers alike.\n\nMarty Baron, the Post’s revered former executive editor under whom the outlet won 11 Pulitzer Prizes, told CNN in a statement that Bezos has ironically undermined personal liberties by “cravenly yielding to a president who shows no respect for liberty,” writing that the billionaire — whose holdings also include a sizeable chunk of Amazon and space technology company Blue Origin — “has prioritized those commercial interests over The Post, and he is betraying The Post’s longstanding principles to do so.\n\nGot that? “Current and former Washington Post staffers” were rebelling against new owner Jeff Bezos because Bezos was “betraying The Post’s longstanding principles” by “cravenly yielding to a president who shows no respect for liberty.” Bezos has the nerve….the nerve! - to want to publish Opinion pieces that are supportive of “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\nRecall that the Post was a staunch supporter of President Obama, the self-same President Obama featured in this headline of the day over at The Week: \n\nWhy did the Obama administration spy on the Associated Press?\n\nThe Justice Department collected two months' worth of reporters' phone records\n\nThen there was another headline, this one in, of all places, The New York Times: \n\nUnder Obama, a Chill on Press Freedom \n\nThis gem reported: \n\nThis administration has prosecuted more whistle-blowers for leaks and gone after more journalists than any of its predecessors.\n\nNow there’s a President “who shows no respect for liberty”. And guess what? Not a peep from Post staffers about Obama’s “Chill on Press Freedom.”\n\nStories of this nature are well out there in the media/Google universe. Yet with that as hard fact, Washington Post staffers are rebelling now because new owner Jeff Bezos says of columns to be published on the Op-Ed pages of The Post: \n\nWe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.\n\nReally? Seriously?\n\nAnd then there is the Post reporters’ outrage at the alleged relationship between publisher Bezos and President Trump?\n\nClearly they are ignorant (deliberately?) of the history of their very own Washington Post. That would be the self-same Washington Post whose publisher of the day - Philip Graham - played a pivotal role in getting Graham friend and Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson placed on the 1960 Democratic ticket as Senator John F. Kennedy’s vice presidential running mate. Talk about friendship!\n\nHistory counts. And the history of Post leaders with names like owner Phil Graham, wife Katherine Graham and Executive Editor Ben Bradlee -- close friends and influencers all the way around with the leaders of the Kennedy-Johnson era — are way too late to erase or pretend they never existed.\n\nTo now suddenly pretend that current owner Jeff Bezos has some sort of illegitimate relationship with President Trump is laughable on its face. \n\nAll of this “Sturm und Drang” (storm and stress) from Post staffers over the Trump-Bezos relationship is laughable on its face.\n\nAnd, in an excursion into a building utterly lacking self-awareness, this meltdown makes Post staffers look silly if not so seriously biased that they are by definition unable to do their jobs of producing straight-arrow just-the-facts journalism.\n\nIf that was ever the goal.","summary":"Amazing.\n\nOne can easily imagine that the headline writers at the conservative leaning New York Post were laughing as they wrote the following headline about the lefty Washington Post.

Everybody’s gone.” She no longer saw the purpose in performing records like her 1963 classic “Mississippi Goddam,” or other protest songs she believed the music industry punished her for releasing. “I wouldn’t change being part of the Civil Rights Movement, but some of the songs that I sang I would have changed because they’ve hurt my career,” she continued. “It’s hard to incorporate those songs because they are not relevant to the times.” When the journalist interviewing her, a young Black woman named Deborah Crable, asked where that leaves us, Simone responded, “It leaves you in a particularly sad state, my darling. I’m sorry about that.”\n\n In January, just two weeks before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term as president, Simone’s estate shared a clip from this interview on Instagram. It was a curious choice. The musician has no shortage of more inspiring, hopeful moments. “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she said in 1969. “And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved.” In 2025, Simone’s assessment of our despondent state of being is just as resonant, and the role of the artist is no less urgent. They’re still called on to reflect the times, with the underlying expectation that they might even rescue us, too. Only in our current cultural moment, the stakes and outcomes are distorted in ways an artist of Simone’s era could never recognize. \n\n For the past decade, and more significantly in the second half, popular artists have been caught in a paradox. Many bear the responsibility of standing for something, while also knowing their message — and the format in which they choose to communicate it — will be subjected to the fickle criteria of an ever-demanding audience. They’re relied upon to provide hedonistic escape through their music, but also positioned as imperfect civil saviors operating under the structure of capitalism and the inherent parasocial power dynamics at play. And while fans are calling on artists to use their voice, and debating what that’s allowed to look like, politicians and conservative news pundits are engaging with pop stars in the same way they would a political opponent.\n\n When Kendrick Lamar delivered his historic Super Bowl LIX halftime show performance on Feb. 9, his own foremost protest record “Alright” was absent from the set list. But he did have Samuel L. Jackson in character as Uncle Sam, wearing a stars-and-stripes suit and top hat combo. “Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,” Jackson scolded. “Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game?” He might have at one point, but the rules are always changing. The red, white, and blue color scheme that informed costuming and set designs for the performance — watched by 133.5 million viewers, per Apple Music and the NFL — became a point of contention for casual and diehard fans alike. Was it powerful or propaganda? Revolutionary or regressive? Something else entirely? \n\n When the American flag appeared on the cover of Beyoncé’s country opus, Cowboy Carter, similar interrogations followed. Was it an attempt at reclaiming a symbol historically bound to racial violence and imperialism? Or just a nod to rodeo culture? It could be both, or neither. It depends on who you ask and what they need it to mean — whether they align more closely with Crable, still semi-hopeful that a path forward might exist, or Simone in ‘83, resigned to disenchantment. Whether they’re looking for guidance at all. Protest is innately intertwined with projection and reflection. When Beyoncé released Lemonade in 2016, the Lamar-assisted “Freedom” found its strength in that dynamic. Its music video featured the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner. And because little has changed since, the reflection endures.\n\n One week before the Super Bowl, Beyoncé was awarded Album of the Year for the first time at the 2025 Grammy Awards for Cowboy Carter. The album opens with “Ameriican Requiem,” which asks: “Can you hear me or do you fear me?” Co-writer Jon Batiste compared the reading of those words to that of a proclamation. But there seems to be a hesitancy toward extending the same cultural significance of songs like “Freedom,” or even “Formation,” to the messaging of Cowboy Carter. Lemonade, a visual album, has served as the basis of entire college courses and theses informed by race, power, and feminism. The notably visual-less Cowboy Carter is no less rooted in Blackness. Without an explicit showing and telling of the underlying why and how, is it any less reflective?\n\n Lamar’s set might not have seemed particularly radical to anyone familiar with his previous use of politics in music. Save for the rogue dancer who seized the moment to wave Palestinian and Sudanese flags on the field, though off-camera, it didn’t platform any one specific issue. But like protest songs, resistance no longer looks the way it once did. When Lamar played “DNA,” he didn’t include the part where a Fox News anchor proclaims: “Hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years.” He didn’t have to. The reflection endured in its absence: Within hours, there were others similarly using their own ignorance as a basis to condemn his performance. It’s unsurprising at a time when Trump is blaming “diversity” for planes dropping out of the sky and using social media to target musicians who oppose his administration. \n\n In January, a tearful Selena Gomez took to Instagram Stories to share an emotional video reacting to mass deportations happening across the country. In response, the White House uploaded interviews with three mothers whose children were allegedly killed by undocumented people. Their grief was weaponized to tear into Gomez — but also into anyone who saw their own concerns reflected in hers. “All my people are getting attacked, the children,” the singer said in the video. “I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything.” Minutes later, Gomez deleted the post. “Apparently it’s not OK to show empathy for people,” she said. \n\n This is business-as-usual behavior for Trump and his henchmen, who regularly spar with popular artists who refuse to fall at his feet or allow him to use their music during his rallies. He’s slammed Beyoncé and regularly extends an obsessive amount of hate toward Taylor Swift. But there were also echoes of resentment from pop fans who criticized Gomez for feigning helplessness instead of taking action, despite her promising to do so in the clip. It’s likely lingering animosity from nearly a decade ago, when she encouraged people to “use their voice for something that fucking matters” in defense of Swift and was in turn urged to speak out about police brutality and Black Lives Matter. “So that means if I hashtag something I save lives?” Gomez tweeted in 2016. “No, I could give two fucks about ‘sides.’ You don’t know what I do.” \n\n The post was similarly deleted shortly after, but it occasionally resurfaces through screenshots when stan accounts are engaged in battle with other fandoms. Fans have spent years demanding bare-minimum, performative activism online. For a while, an infographic reposted as a soon-to-expire Instagram Story was enough to justify their continued support, or provide their fandom with armor during arguments. But over time, many have raised their standards and grown more critical, while others have become experts at explaining away silence to secure 30 more minutes of guilt-free listening to a new release from their favorite artist.\n\n In January, Swift fans reflected on the evolution — or lack of evolution — in the musician’s activism as her documentary Miss Americana marked its fifth anniversary. In a pivotal scene, Swift discusses her decision to endorse the Democratic candidate in Tennessee’s 2018 Senate election. “It’s not that I want to step into this,” Swift said. “It’s just, I can’t not at this point.” Some fans of Swift have come to resent that, despite all of the ground the film covered, its prevailing legacy has been primarily rooted in her admitted regret about her own political silence, drawing her into what they perceive as undeserved criticism in the years since. “The docu was her story through a period of her life, she felt safe & strong enough to talk about certain issues and so she did, but that was it,” one Swiftie wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “It was never for you to use against her every chance you get, to force her to give her opinion on every single horrible thing happening.”\n\n Recently, fans involved in the #SwiftiesForPalestine movement have found a middle ground — maintaining their allegiance to Swift while also questioning whether she really meant what she said about getting involved. “Just a reminder that the Weeknd has publicly voiced support for Palestine and donated millions and he’s still consistently one of the top two most streamed artists on Spotify, more often #1, dethroning Taylor herself,” another wrote. “Neither his career nor his safety has been jeopardized.” \n\n That some artists appear to be more accustomed to sharing statements of protest online, rather than in their music, would be generally inconsequential (or even acceptable) if not for the rapidly changing natures of the online world itself. The efficacy of these statements and the response they engender has been seriously diminished by the collapse of the social platforms people want these conversations to exist on: There’s the rise of hate speech on Elon Musk’s X, crucial terminology being diluted to prevent censorship on TikTok, and an alarming media literacy crisis across the board. \n\n Of course, social media was always going to be a less-than-ideal space for actual, real-world activism. For a time, it was a valuable tool for organizing. But as it has eroded, its limitations were soon revealed. This became particularly apparent as early as the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. While thousands risked contracting a deadly virus to march in the streets against injustice — including artists like Halsey, Ariana Grande, and Harry Styles — others on social media attempted to frame the posting of a black square on Instagram as a legitimate form of advocacy. Fans online did what they could to show support virtually through awareness-raising trends, but some others shared statements like, “Are we still trending BLM or can we talk about BTS again without censoring?” Around the same time, the 1975 frontman Matty Healy shared a link to their song “Love It If We Made It” on Twitter in lieu of a social media statement. Their own version of a protest record, it was entirely relevant to what was happening in its comments on Trump, BLM, and the failure of modernity. Still, Healy ended up deleting his account after a flurry of backlash accused him of using George Floyd’s death to promote his band. \n\n The albums created during or about pandemic lockdowns were often eerily reflective, like Paramore’s This Is Why, or hedonistic dreamscapes, like Beyoncé’s Renaissance. Not necessarily protest songs, but snapshots of a certain time, nevertheless. Since then, the same things we were reflecting on and seeking escape from in that period — doom-scrolling, rapid declines in empathy, social isolation — have only become more deeply ingrained. The artist’s duty has never weighed more heavily. \n\n Even so, animosity and distrust have still swelled around socially engaged pop stars — even those who couldn’t be less ambiguous about where they stand. In September 2024, Chappell Roan’s refusal to explicitly endorse Kamala Harris, citing “problems on both sides,” sparked accusations about how she would be voting in the election. One X account called her statement “the most cowardly, uneducated and down right embarrassing thing you could possibly say about this election.” On TikTok, the musician clarified her stance across a number of videos. “Honestly, fuck the policies of the right — but also fuck some of the policies on the left. That’s why I can’t endorse,” she said. “There is no way I can stand behind some of the left’s completely transphobic and completely genocidal views.” In February, another account posted: “Chappell Roan wasn’t at the hearing today for the 7 anti trans bills in Missouri, but her Republican uncle was … I’m a huge fan and earnestly want her to show up to hearings for and actually talk about specific legislation trans women in MO are being faced with.”\n\n Roan, a lesbian who has consistently advocated for trans rights and spoken against injustices toward Palestinian people, is one of the most unapologetically outspoken stars pop has seen in years. At the 2025 Grammys, she performed “Pink Pony Club” while pink, blue, and white flags waved in the background of her set, a nod to trans rights. She previously advocated against “cis people making decisions for trans people,” too. That same night, Lady Gaga used her own acceptance speech to declare: “Trans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.” And just days before, Lucy Dacus pledged $10,000 to GoFundMe campaigns for trans surgeries and encouraged her followers on X to donate, too. “The government will never be the source of our validation or protection,” she wrote. “We have to do it ourselves.” \n\n At a time when trans people are being relentlessly targeted by Trump’s administration-wide crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights, all three of these instances — performing a queer anthem on a public stage, voicing support for a marginalized community, posting action items on social media — are valid forms of protest. And when “everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival,” as Simone said, an expansive album evoking Black country history can be eye-opening for someone who needs it to be, as can the subversive use of color and characters in a halftime show. \n\n This doesn’t mean these artists are here to rescue us — our elected representatives barely seem capable of doing so. Organization that doesn’t extend beyond the limited structure and active suppression of social media won’t either. After all, what are protest songs without protests to chant them at? But when we look back on this time years from now, it won’t be devoid of the mark of music, regardless of what that might look like. “We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore,” Simone said in ‘69. “So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and not reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”","summary":"Musicians are expected to reflect their times, but who decides what that looks like?","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/artists-activism-protest-politics-kendrick-lamar-beyonce-selena-gomez-chappell-roan-1235282425/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kendrick-lamar-stan-culture-essay.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 16:00:00","author":"Jon Dolan,Larisha Paul","authors":["Jon Dolan","Larisha Paul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":295664464,"title":"Donald Trump's Doctor Makes Announcement About Annual Physical Exam","text":"President Donald Trump will complete his annual physical exam next month at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, according to a statement emailed to Newsweek.The statement was issued by the White House communications team but was attributed to Dr. Sean Barbabella, Trump's physician.The president appointed Barbabella, 55, earlier this week as his personal physician in a move that some analysts say highlights concerns about threats of violence against the 78-year-old president, according to The Times UK.Trump survived two assassination attempts against him during last year's election campaign.Military doctors often serve as the president's personal physician, but Barbabella lacks pervious experience in the White House medical unit.

The Ukrainian leader departed the White House following the public spat, and a planned signing ceremony and press conference were canceled.\n\nUS officials said the minerals deal – which Trump had cast as a necessary step to repay American support as he sought to negotiate an end to the war directly with Russia’s Vladimir Putin – was not signed before Zelenskiy’s departure.\n\n“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump said in a social media post shortly before Zelenskiy left the White House.\n\nThe clash, played in front of the television cameras, is a major setback for Zelenskiy, who was hoping the in-person meeting with Trump would help smooth out his relations with the American president and commit him to stronger backing for his country following his tilt toward Moscow.\n\nInstead, the vicious tone of the exchange is likely to sow further doubt about Ukraine’s ability to stand up to Russia’s three-year invasion as it struggles with manpower on the battlefield and still relies heavily on US military aid. It’s also likely to alarm European allies, who have already been scrambling to fill the void being left by Washington.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader angered Trump and US Vice President JD Vance when he said he did not believe the planned deal would do enough to deter further Russian aggression.\n\n“Putin will never stop and will go further and further,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the Russian leader “hates Ukrainians” and wanted to destroy the country. “We can do it, but it’s not enough,” he added of the deal.\n\nAs Zelenskiy sought to make his point, Trump and Vance lit into the beleaguered leader, suggesting his approach – delivered in the Oval Office – was disrespectful and inhibiting an end to the bloody three-year war.\n\n“It’s going to be very hard to do business like this,” Trump said, telling Zelenskiy he was not sure the Ukrainian leader could make a deal. “You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us you don’t have any cards.”\n\n“You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump continued. “And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country – that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should,” he said. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it is going to be pretty.”\n\nThe meeting had been intended as a moment of unity between the leaders, who were set to sign the natural resources agreement, which was designed to satisfy Trump’s concerns that US aid would not be repaid.\n\nTrump had touted the agreement as a major commitment from the US to Ukraine as he initially welcomed Zelenskiy to the White House for a high-stakes meeting with stark implications for the fight to repel Russia’s invasion.\n\n“It’s a pathway to peace. It’s a pathway to getting something solved,” Trump said.\n\nThe deal, however, did not offer the explicit security guarantees Zelenskiy had wanted, instead focusing on the economic partnership between the US and Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy told Trump that Putin had repeatedly violated previous agreements and that Ukraine would never accept a simple ceasefire to conclude the war. He insisted to Trump that the mineral deal was not enough to ensure Ukraine’s security.\n\nThe underlying tension between the leaders was obvious. Trump had his eyes closed and was tapping his fingers as Zelenskiy stressed his concerns about Putin reneging on an agreement. When Trump downplayed the threat of a future attack, the Ukrainian leader shook his head.\n\n“I’m in the middle. I want to solve this thing. I’m for both,” Trump insisted. “It’s wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.”\n\nThen the meeting exploded when Vance, sitting nearby, criticised Zelenskiy’s approach.\n\n“Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that’s trying to prevent the destruction of your country?” Vance asked.\n\nTrump said Zelenskiy had “tremendous hatred” for Putin and suggested that the anger could be inhibiting a deal, while also defending his warm relations with the Russian leader as more likely to yield results.\n\n“I could be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen. I’d be so tough, but you’re never going to get it done that way,” Trump said.\n\nThe leaders also sparred after Zelenskiy suggested Trump did not understand the issue because the US was protected by an ocean, and didn’t face the looming threat from Russia.\n\n“You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong. You’re right now not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,” Trump said.\n\n“Have you said thank you once?” Vance added. The vice president went on to suggest Zelenskiy had campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris with his trip last fall to an ammunition plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country,” Vance admonished.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Zelenskiy in a post to social media thanked Trump, Congress and “the American people.”\n\n“Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he wrote.\n\nThe fate of the natural resources deal remained in doubt as the meeting broke.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that he did not know what Zelenskiy could do to get the agreement back on track, saying he had committed “one of the great diplomatic own goals in history.”\n\nBessent said it would be up to Trump to decide whether he wants to continue negotiating with Zelenskiy.\n\n“President Trump’s idea was to show that way with the economic deals, to show that we’re more intertwined. And that would be a symbol to the Ukrainian people, to Russian leadership and to the American people and President Zelenskiy blew that up today,” Bessent added. “I’m not sure what he was thinking.”\n\nSpeaking from the White House after the meeting, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president’s, also sought to lay the blame for the Oval Office blow up on Zelenskiy, saying Trump had been “shocked” by their exchange and questioning whether the US could work with the Ukrainian leader again.\n\n“I don’t know that we can ever do business with Zelenskiy again,” Graham said. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”\n\nThe US president on Friday originally called the minerals deal an “exciting moment” and said funds from the deal could also be used for artificial intelligence and military weapons. He reiterated that he would continue military sales to Ukraine.\n\n“We don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it’s going to be a lot of money,” he said.\n\nStill, Trump has downplayed calls for more explicit security guarantees, suggesting the economic ties between Ukraine and the US would suffice to deter Putin from further aggression.\n\n“I think once we make the agreement, that’s going to be 95% of it, it’s not going to go back to fighting,” Trump said. “I’ve spoken with President Putin, and I think, I mean, I feel very strong. I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they’re very serious about it.”\n\n“I’m not worried about security, I’m worried about getting the deal done,” the president added.\n\nZelenskiy’s visit capped a dramatic week that saw both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visit Washington to push Trump to offer US support for a European “backstop” to protect Ukraine from further attacks.\n\nFrance and the UK have discussed deploying a peacekeeping force but any such initiative will require US assistance, but Trump has declined to provide any assurances of US support and cast it as an issue for Europe to deal with. – Bloomberg.","summary":"The US and Ukraine failed to sign a critical minerals agreement after a Friday meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy devolved into a fiery exchange, fracturing relations between the two countries.

Time to grow anew","text":"The Rising American Electorate? The New American Majority? The Coalition of the Ascendent? Ultimately, they were all really just the Obama Coalition. But, at this point, Democrats need to get over it. Since the 2008 election, the core Democratic political priority has been to hold onto this coalition – loosely defined as voters of color, unmarried women and young voters. These people powered Barack Obama to his historic and historically large win in 2008. The problem is, for the last nearly 20 years, Democrats haven’t had a strategy to grow – the priority was to hold and fortify this coalition that dominated in a moment in time. Well, like most movements, if you don't have a strategy to grow, you’re vulnerable. And, whether intentionally, instinctively or accidentally, Donald Trump has peeled this status quo coalition apart. DEMOCRATS MUST MAKE THE CASE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND GOOD In 2016, he supercharged the swing away from Democrats among White voters without a college degree. In 2024, he made that swing multiracial, especially with Hispanic voters, leading to a 27-point change from Joe Biden in 2020 (+38) to Kamala Harris in 2024 (+11) with Latinos. For example, Starr County, Texas, is the most Hispanic county in the country (98%), yet, in 2024, it voted Republican for the first time. Asian voters, nationwide, shifted from +27 for Biden in 2020 to +15 for Harris in 2024, according to exit polls. And, in what may be the biggest erosion in the \"Obama coalition,\" Harris won voters under 44 by two points while Biden had won them by 19 points. Donald Trump has eroded our coalition with the largest group of voters (White non-college) and the fastest-growing group of voters (Latinos and young voters). Where to Go to Grow? Growth starts with understanding that these voters today aren’t the same as they were 20 years ago or, put another way, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice.\" The young voters of 2008 are now in their 40s. The non-college educated factory worker of 2008 is now retired and looking at assisted living options. The newest voters in the 2028 election might not have even been born when Barack Obama was elected in 2008. AMERICA'S 'SECOND' CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND YOU Our strategy, going forward, can’t be to \"win back\" people who never were with us in the first place. Our strategy has to be to build. Without a doubt, the Democratic growth strategy has to include non- college-educated voters. But, that won’t be by winning back \"White working class\" voters overall. Democrats have not won them since 1964. These days, the growth might not come only from nostalgic tropes of non-college voters on a factory floor but also with the ones who work in the service industry and are more multiracial. Seniors. It used to be that the senior vote was dispositive in national elections and seniors formed the backbone of the Republican Party. In the 2008 election, voters over 65 made up about 20% of the electorate. By 2024, it may have been closer to 30%. And, in 2024, Democrats underperformed 2020 by six points but overperformed with women 65+ by four points. This may be the first presidential election in modern times where Democrats won the senior vote (or were essentially tied). Instead of only lamenting the loss of young voters and how to simply \"recapture\" that, maybe Democrats should turn. College-Educated Men. Democrats may have made some limited gains (or stayed even) with men over 55 in 2024, and that was mostly driven by college-educated White men. Between 2012 and 2020, Democrats gained with college-educated men – winning 42% in 2012 and 51% in 2020. While Democrats may have maximized potential gains with college-educated women, college-educated men represent a slowly growing group and one where Democrats could have room to grow. In every post-mortem on 2024 or planning discussion for the years ahead, the fundamental question every Democrat should ask is, \"How will this help us grow?\" TRUMP'S INFLATIONARY POLICIES MAKING AMERICA EXPENSIVE AGAIN Lower Engagement. One major difference between the 2008 and 2010 elections was that the higher engaged midterm electorate over-indexed Republican in 2010 and the Obama coalition stayed home. Comparing the 2022 midterm to 2024, this trend had flipped. In the final pre-election New York Times poll, people who did not vote in 2020 were poised to vote Trump by four points, while Harris and Donald Trump were tied among the full likely electorate. This is far from an exhaustive list. Maybe it’s Latinos or Asian voters or even next-generation voters (e.g. people turn 18 between 2026 and 2028). We don’t have to slice and dice to grow. We first have to adopt the belief that our priority is to grow. How Do You Grow? The good news is that most of our growth opportunity voters are similar. Their top concerns are the economy and costs while they have a deep distrust of the political system that they think is rigged against them. They’re typically less political, less ideological and less liberal. That’s the common denominator for growth. If we’re going to hold a growth strategy as our North Star, we have to be a party that resonates with these voters. DONALD TRUMP CLAIMED HE WOULD HELP AMERICAN WORKERS. NOW, HE’S BETRAYING THEM In the latest New York Times/Ipsos poll, fully 72% of people think that the \"government is mostly working to benefit itself and the elites.\" If we want to be serious about a growth strategy, it means being the party of reform and the party of results, not the party of the status quo. We can’t be the part of \"saving\" institutions but we can contrast with the people who want to eliminate them. When it comes to government, we can be the party of \"mend it, don’t end it.\" On the economy, in that same poll, 68% of people think the \"economic system in this country unfairly favors the wealthy.\" If we want to have a multiracial, cross-demographic strategy for growth we have to be the party that’s taking on the status quo of the economy and making it work for everyday people, starting with lower costs. The list of strategies to grow could go on, and that’s the debate we need to be having.

In that amount of time, we’ve gone from the original iPhone to the iPhone 16. That original coalition is no more and it’s time to form one anew.

What is Donald Trump’s foreign policy. I think the place to begin to try to untangle what we’ve actually seen here is to listen to the way Donald Trump and Vice President Vance speak about our allies. The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia. It’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America. I mean, look, let’s be honest, the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it. And they’ve done a good job of it. But now I’m president. I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine. They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough. Something is new here. This is not even what Donald Trump’s first term was like. There were hints of it, but something is new here. I wanted to have a bigger picture conversation about what this Trump doctrine is, and the way it’s going to reshape the world. So I’m joined today by Fareed Zakaria, the host of GPS on CNN, a Washington Post columnist and the author of the best selling book, age of revolutions. As always, my email at nytimes.com. Fareed Zakaria, welcome back to the show. Always a pleasure, Ezra. So to the extent you feel you can define it, what’s the Trump doctrine. The part of the problem with Trump is he’s so mercurial, he’s so idiosyncratic that just when you think you’ve figured out the Trump doctrine, he goes and says something that kind of sounds like the opposite of the Trump doctrine. But I do think that there’s one coherent worldview that Trump seems to espouse and has espoused for a long time. The first ad he took out when he was a real estate developer, I think it was in 1985, was an ad about how Japan was ripping us off economically, and Europe was ripping us off by freeriding on security. And what that represents, I think, fundamentally, is a kind of rejection of the open international system that the United States and Europe has built over the last eight decades. If you think about it for a minute. It really is a remarkable achievement. You go back to international relations before 1945, and it’s just constant war, mercantilism, protectionism. The two Yale scholars who tabulated in the hundreds years before World War II, there’s about 150 territorial conquests aggression, taking of territory, legitimization of that since 1945, there have been practically none. You have an open international economy. You have free trade. You have rules, you have trade and travel and patents. I mean, there’s a huge area of international cooperation that people don’t think about but that happens all the time, every day. When you fly, when from one place to another. And what Trump, I think has taken from that whole world is the US has been the sucker. The Uc has been the country that’s had to underwrite it. The Uc is the country that’s opened itself up to the world and everyone takes advantage of the US. So I don’t know that he wants to tear it down, but he wants to seriously renegotiate or perhaps even redo that system. Let me try to reflect what his people tell me. Picking up on something you said. There is this, as people call it, rules based international order. And the thing that Joe Biden says and Jake Sullivan says. And Fareed Zakaria says, is that America benefits from that order and benefits from being part of that order. And there’s long been a critique from the left that America, in fact, dominates that order and doesn’t play by its rules. We break international law, we do the things we want to do, and then use those rules on others when we don’t like what they’re doing. But the critique from Trump is that that’s not true, that of every country, America, as the strongest, is harmed the most by these restraints, by these rules, by these laws. Because we have so much leverage we could be using, we could slap tariffs on anybody for any reason and get them to do what we want. We have the strongest military. Of all of the militaries. Everybody wants to be on our side and everybody fears being on our bad side. And that what Trump is doing is systematically automatically searching out the strength America has, the ways we can wield our weight and leverage, and untying our hands from behind our back. Yeah, there is a certain truth to that the United States does have enormous power, by the way. They’re even right about the fact that the United States is more open to for example, the world’s goods and services than they are to ours. The United States has long practiced a kind of asymmetrical free trade. So after World War II, we decided we would open up our markets to Europe and East Asia, to Japan and South Korea. And the reason we did that was we were trying to build an international system where everyone benefited, where there really wasn’t that feeling of beggar thy neighbor. Zero sum game where everyone went into a competitive spiral, which then ends up in nationalism and war. We were trying to build something different and we thought, we can be a little generous here. Let’s let everyone grow and we’ll do fine in the process. And of course, Europe, and Japan and South Korea and places like that grew. But the United States absolutely dominated the world, because it’s a classic positive sum game. We created a much larger global economy, much larger trading system, huge capital flows, and we were at the center of it. The dollar was the reserve currency of the world, which alone gives us incredible advantages. We’re the only country that doesn’t have to worry that much about debt and deficits, because we know that at the end of the day, the dollar is the reserve currency. And my feeling is if you take that system and say, O.K, we’re going to look at each bilateral relationship and see if we can squeeze this country for a slightly better deal, you probably will get a better deal, but two things will happen. The first thing is you will end up fracturing your alliances because the people with whom you have the most leverage are your allies. We have more leverage with Canada than we have with Russia because Canada depends on us for security. Canada trades with us a lot. Its economy is intricately tied to the US economy. So you can bully Canada. You can’t really bully Russia that much because we don’t do much trade with them. You can’t bully China, even China. It’s another vast continental economy that can survive just fine. So the result of Trump inaction, the Trump doctrine inaction has been a war on America’s allies. But the second and more important part is yeah, you’ll gain a little bit here and there by getting slightly better tariff deals. And just so people understand, tariffs in the industrialized world are around 3 percent They’re very, very low. So the idea we’re not getting penalized in any large ways. You can pick a few. You can cherry pick a few examples to the contrary, but mostly among the liberal Democratic states of the world. It’s a free trade world. But what you will do by squeezing each of these individual countries, humiliating them, making them, forcing them to accept renegotiation of terms, you lose the kind of relationships that you had built over 8 decades that created this extraordinary anchor of stability in the world, which was the Western Alliance. And the gains are not that great. Let’s talk about the tariffs for a minute. This is one of the places where the policy and practices just seemed incoherent to me. And I think I need to do a whole episode on this. But you there were different goals that have been articulated for tariffs. One is you impose significant steady tariffs for a long period of time because you’re trying to make manufacturers make different decisions about where to locate factories. You’re trying to onshore supply chains. To do that have to have them, these corporations expecting tariffs for quite a while. And then you hope that they will respond to those tariffs by insourcing into America. Another is that we’re going to use the tariffs to raise a lot of revenue. That too requires the imposition over a long period of time of significant tariffs. Another is we’re just going to bully small nations and just bully kind of anybody. We might feel like bullying right. The tariffs are an all purpose tool to get other countries to do anything we want them to do. We’ve been using them that way, but not for very significant concessions. We’re on the cusp of maybe they’re about to reintroduce them to Canada and Mexico. So we’ll see where we are in a couple of weeks. But what are they doing, man. So there are two things, I think, are going on. One is, as I’ve said, Trump, if he has a worldview, he’s a protectionist. He’s always felt that want to protect American industries. These foreigners come in and they take advantage of us. Et cetera. Et cetera. The second, I think, is that and this I think he discovered as president, the president has incredible power in the area of tariffs. Technically, it’s meant to be Congress that imposes tariffs. But a long ago Congress delegated that power to the president. And I think Trump loves that. It is an extraordinary unilateral exercise of huge American power, the power of the American market to say, I will just block you from being able to participate in the American market. And you saw him do that in the case of the Colombian president. So I think he’s not sure. At one hand, he loves wielding this weapon. On the other hand, he is something of a protectionist. But as you say, he notices that markets don’t seem to it. So where will it all end up. My gut is that what happens is, so tariffs in the industrialized world, as I said, have roughly been about 3 percent If you assume all of Trump’s tariffs are actually put in place. I think it goes up to about 6 percent And if that stays, which is a big if other countries will all retaliate. This is an area where I think, we do live in it’s not even a bipolar world. It’s a tripolar world. The Europeans and the Chinese are very powerful. And the Europeans on this issue speak with one voice. So they will put on reciprocal tariffs. The Chinese will put on reciprocal tariffs. We end up in a world with more tariffs, more protection. Look, I’m an old fashioned free trader. I think the whole thing is a disaster. I think that it is a complete misreading of the last 30 or 40 years of economics. JD Vance, when he was in Germany, in Europe, one of the few backhanded compliments he played to Germany was, he said, at least the Germans didn’t go along with this Washington Consensus nonsense, and they protected their manufacturing, which is partly true. They didn’t protect it through tariffs, by the way. They protected it by just having very strong apprenticeship programs and what we would call community college type stuff. But look at where Germany is. Germany, the third or fourth largest economy in the world, is stuck in the second Industrial Revolution. What do they make. Cars, chemicals, machine tools. They don’t have any industry in the digital economy, the entire digital economy is totally dominated by the US. Why is that. Because we allowed ourselves to transition to where the frontiers of the economy were. This whole idea of trying to hold on to the 19th century or the 1920s, it doesn’t work. It’s incredibly expensive. Nobody has been able to do it. Manufacturing employment today after Donald Trump’s four years, and Joe Biden’s four years is the same as it was roughly 10, 15 years ago. I think that this whole obsession is fundamentally misconceived. What we should do is much more redistribution, so that the people who lose out in these periods of technological change are taken care of. But the idea that we can go back to 1950 is just nuts. This gets to me, one of the real obfuscations of the Trump presidency of MAGA as a movement. There are a lot of conversations right now that have a term in them that is ill-defined. Let’s call it efficiency. What is the Department of Government efficiency about. What is efficiency. Efficiency of what Towards what. Efficiency requires some other defined ends to be a coherent goal. But here too, what is America first. What would it mean for that to be successful. What are we looking like. The trade deficit is going to be the main output of our foreign policy, which, by the way, he’s not consistent on in any way. He was talking the other day about building a renewed Keystone XL pipeline to Canada, which if we start importing a bunch of Canadian oil, that’s going to increase the trade deficit with Canada. Is it manufacturing employment. Is that what we’re supposed to be targeting here is if America first was working, it would be manufacturing and playing. Is it GDP growth. I have never heard them, and I have listened fairly closely. Describe what this new era, this new golden age of American strength is. Is it median wages for men. They don’t, I think they certainly have not articulated a coherent view of American power or success. Like, is America stronger if AFD takes over Germany. Why like, what does AFD get us. I’m curious how you think about this. If maybe I’m being unfair. Maybe you think there’s a better definition of it. But there is a question, all this of what they’re trying to achieve. Do you feel like, I would guess that America First for Trump and for many of his followers and I wouldn’t put some of the ideologists of MAGA in the same category. But I think for Trump. It’s the idea that the United States has been constrained for too long by globalism, by worrying about the international environment, by worrying about all these alliances constrained by these international organizations that, again, we’ve been the sucker, that what America first means is we’re going to break through all that bullshit and we’re just going to do what’s good for America. But what is left undefined, as you’re saying, is, well, what is good for America. Why would it be good for America to break, to break apart the international trading system. Why would it be good for America to break apart this world that’s created. So that part I think is undefined. But you can see the impulse and what the attraction is to a lot of people. A lot of people who have always felt that the United States, by the way, run by this elite cabal of urban liberals, overeducated urban liberals in places like New York and Washington has been selling America out. This was basically, if you think of the 1950s, this was the McCarthy attack in many ways. So I think in some ways, it’s a harkening back to that idea. There’s another piece of that being restrained by norms. I think a pretty significant difference between Trump’s first term and his second is the intensity of his fascination now with territorial expansion, making Canada the 51st state, making Gaza province. Somehow of America. Taking over Greenland. But I think Trump believes in the people around him. Believe that the norms of the world turned against territorial expansion in a way that was bad for America. America in the 19th century expanded. Other countries did, too. And we are powerful. And there are things we should want that Canada should be the 51st state, or at least it should act like a vassal state of America that if we want Greenland, we should have it. I think Trump really wants, fundamentally wants the landmass of America to be larger when he leaves office than when he came in. How have you taken Trump’s renewed interest in gaining territory. Yeah, I think you have it exactly right. And in a way, he has a kind of fascination, not just with America. I think in the 19th century, in the way exactly the way you described, but also in geopolitics of the 19th century to the extent that I think he understands it, which is the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. To quote Thucydides, and that idea that we are powerful, we should be unconstrained is very familiar in a sense. That’s what the Chinese foreign minister said at a meeting of ASEAN nations where he was telling, I think it was the Philippines or the Singaporeans. You’ve got to understand we are big and powerful. You are not. We are going to tell you what to do. Obviously, it is the way Putin views the world. That’s why I think he has a much more benign view of Putin’s desire to have a sphere of influence, a kind of a group of satellite states around him, including Ukraine. He has a much more benign view, I think, of Chinese expansionism. He very rarely criticizes it. I can’t remember him ever doing it. And so then he looks at it and says, well, the United States should similarly have that kind of sense of the Monroe Doctrine, the Western hemisphere. Again to me, it Mrs. the central point about the transformation of the international system after World War II, which is that you realized you don’t need territory to become rich and powerful and incredibly effective in the world. Look at South Korea. South Korea is, I forget, now 15 times the per capita GDP of North Korea. Look at tiny Israel, which is now essentially an advanced industrial country on a tiny spit of land. Think about all the richest and most powerful countries in the world. Land acquisition has almost nothing to do with, who has a lot of land. Russia it feels to me like a kind of bizarre, anachronistic way to look at the world. But I agree with you. That is the way he’s thinking about it. You could get whatever minerals you wanted to get out of Greenland by just signing a couple of deals with them. You don’t actually need to own it. You could redo the Panama Canal treaty and be much easier, by the way, to let the Panamanians run it. And you’ve just kind of renegotiated it in terms you like. But I think for Trump, part of it is this kind of old fashioned view. And part of it is I do think at the end of the day, there’s a strong element of narcissism that infuses everything that Trump does. And I think he loves the idea that he would be able to put his stamp on history by saying, Trump added Greenland or something like that to the United States. The physical expansion of America would be a great Trump legacy. You mentioned Ukraine and Russia. We’re talking in the week when all that is being negotiated. How would you describe what Trump’s policy towards Ukraine now is. It’s almost impossible to have a kind of again, a clear through line because it’s moved so much. He had a tweet in which he said the Russians better. Putin better realize this war has ruined his country. He better settle. And if he doesn’t, we’re going to put additional sanctions and his favorite weapon tariffs on Russia now. But it seemed to suggest that he understood that the principal obstacle to a peace deal was not Zelenskyy but Putin. But then he shifted entirely and enormously in the last few weeks, where he’s called Zelenskyy a dictator. He said he started the war, all that stuff. I mean, the UN resolution where the United States sided with Russia and North Korea and Belarus. So you could argue that, again, in Trump’s case, so much of it is personal. He doesn’t like Zelenskyy. But if you step back from that, I think that Trump in his heart believes that Russia has legitimate claims over Ukraine and so has a much softer line on Russia. I think he thinks that the Russians should keep the territory they’ve acquired. He thinks Ukraine should not be a part of NATO. He thinks that maybe Ukraine should have a kind of neutrality in foreign policy. These are all essentially the Russian demands. There’s no way to read his mind. But my sense from listening to him and watching him is he thinks all those Russian claims are kind of broadly legitimate. Let me push on this. All this much better than I do. I don’t think he thinks anything about Ukraine and Russia whose claims are legitimate. I think he thinks Ukraine is worthless to the Uc, and somebody at some point persuaded him their mineral rights there. And he thinks Russia is not that there is value for the US, for Trump personally, for the US economy and access to Russia, good relations with Russia, and that there is some part of him that genuinely doesn’t. Understand why we give a shit about Ukraine, as opposed to cutting a deal with Putin. And getting something out of that transaction. Yeah if you think about the countries and the leaders he likes, it’s either the country is very strong or the leader is very strong. It’s Putin Xi. Modi, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Orban Erdogan. Those are the people he speaks, talks about with respect. The more muddled, compromised, weaker leaders of coalition governments in Europe, he finds feckless, he finds uninteresting. I think he likes these more old fashioned countries. I’ve thought about this once, and I don’t know if it’s a reasonable point to make, but the countries he seems fascinated by and respects are countries which you could imagine having lots of Trump towers. The countries he doesn’t like Europe. You couldn’t imagine a Trump. But in that way, is he picking up on something real. And I think you see this a bit with JD Vance. JD Vance is going out of his way to alienate the European governments of the moment. America is weighing in on behalf of the AFD in Germany. Their view is that there are regimes that they have affinity with, and that the proper nature of American Alliance is in some unchanging alliance between America and Europe, because we’re all quote unquote, liberal democracies. Trump doesn’t want us to be a liberal democracy. The proper nature is between regimes of affinity. And in that way, Putin sees a world more like Trump does than Keir Starmer in the UK. Erdogan sees a world more like Trump does, and Justin Trudeau does that the nature of the alliances they’re seeking is a nature of regimes that are like them, regimes that could actually support, have a genuine ideological affinity for who Trump is and what he wants and the world that he wants to see. Yeah I think you’re raising something very important. I think that part of what’s going on here, this new dynamic in international relations we’re watching, is that it’s not all about power. It’s about ideology. So if you think about what is it that Putin is reacting to in the rise and hegemony of the West after the collapse of communism, some of it is Western power, the expansion of NATO, for sure. But a lot of what Putin has been obsessed by has been the expansion of Western liberal ideas and ideology. So if you notice, the things that he talks so much about are the rise of multiculturalism in the West. The rise of a kind of libertine gender ideology. The idea of gender fluidity even weighed in on the JK Rowling controversy. These issues are central to the way that Putin thinks about Russian power. The power of his regime. And so he’s viewed the rising tide and the spreading of Western liberal ideas as much a threat as the expansion of NATO. So notice that when he really reacted with force against Georgia in 2008 and then against Ukraine in 2014, in both cases, the issue was not actually that these countries were about to join NATO. They were not. It’s that they were going to join the European Union, or at least wanted to have better relations with the European Union. What is the European Union represent It represents some kind of idea of a Western style capitalist liberal democracy. And so the way he looks at it is he doesn’t want to be surrounded by those kind of countries. He wants to be surrounded by countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan, quasi authoritarian, somewhat kleptocratic regimes that he can control and manipulate. And I think she also, if you listen to Xi Jinping, a lot of the things he’s talked about is the dangers of too much westernization, too much liberalism. The Chinese have not just cracked down on the private sector, they’ve cracked down on what they called the effeminacy of men. He’s talked about the virtues of motherhood and women going back to raising families. So again, he views this rising tide of Western liberalism as much a threat, I think as Western hard power. And here the irony is Trump and Vance agree with them. And so for the first time now, you have in America a party or an ideology that says, Yes, that’s right. And in a strange sense, as Steve Bannon would explicitly say this. Our real allies should be Russia, and that becomes the new alliance system. Now that takes it further than we are right now. But it’s those inclinations. But that’s I think, where this is really going. And I think the way you see it is in Vance and Musk in Trump’s first term. Trump is surrounded, particularly on the National security and foreign policy side, by members of the traditional Republican establishment. Your HR McMaster’s, your Rex tillerson’s Mike Pence as his vice president. And none of them want this move, right. This is not why John Kelly got into politics. And so it doesn’t really happen. What there is instead are these weird moments in interviews and elsewhere where Trump seems to talk about Putin with real affection in a way that he never talks about anybody in Europe that way. Fast forward. You have Trump’s second term, in which he is surrounded by people who have been spending the intervening years building the ideology for what Trump intuitively was moving towards. And it’s not a complete purge in the Republican Party. But what’s left is too weak, even if the Senate Republicans don’t love it in every instance. And so now you see this the war between autocracy as an ideological phenomenon and liberal democracy as an ideological phenomenon isn’t now between America and Europe. And these other countries. It’s inside America, too. And now you really see it, right. These people who are more framework oriented, going there and actively weighing in, as Elon Musk did on behalf of the AFD in Germany. JD Vance going to the Munich Conference and really telling the Europeans that the great security threat is the way they run their governments, not Russia, not climate change. It is the temperament and the policy of European liberalism. Yeah, many years ago, I wrote an article called The Rise of illiberal democracy in Foreign Affairs, and I was trying to describe this phenomenon of countries where with majorities, with pluralities, we had elected leaders who then systematically degraded the rule of law and individual rights and individual liberties. And of course, I meant it as a term of condemnation. Viktor Orbán gave a speech a few years after he came to power. He didn’t he didn’t quote me, but he cited the phrase illiberal democracy. And he said, people have talked about illiberal democracy. That is what we want to achieve. That is our goal. We want to be an illiberal democracy because we don’t believe in the tenets of Western liberalism. And I think that is where some impulses of the Trump administration go. Now, I do want to say there are two possibilities. And you have outlined them yourself because when you first started the conversation, you said, the Trump people tell me, look, we just want to use unused American power and get a better deal within this framework that we’ve built up. Like, we’re O.K with the liberal international system. We just think we got screwed. So that’s one theory of where Trump is going. And I actually had a conversation with a very senior Republican this week who was hoping, and I would say was arguing that that’s where Trump is going. Yeah, there’s a lot of noise. It’s very messy. He does things. He negotiates out in the open in ways that you never would by demeaning Zelenskyy. But what he’s trying to do is to get a better deal. But then there’s the second view, which is the one we’ve just been talking about, which is no, no, no, he’s not trying to get a better deal. He is trying to systematically remake the international system, and it it reminds me there was a period in the 1870s and 80s when the three great conservative monarchs of Europe, the Russians, the austro-hungarians and the Germans got together and created a 3 emperors league. It was called the dry Kaiser Bund. And they got together because they feared the rise of liberalism in Europe after the revolutions of 1848. And it was meant to be these three conservative monarchs holding back the tide of liberalism. And to a certain extent wonder whether for some of The people involved here, that is the way they are thinking about it. And Putin and maybe even Viktor Orban and people like Erdogan and Xi. We need to hold back all this kind of godless, reckless, libertine liberalism that is engulfing the world. I do think there’s a why not both to this, as you were saying at the top of the show, it is very hard to say anything definitive about Donald Trump, because he actually is flexible and he starts in one place and it ends in another, and he says, we’re going to annex Gaza and use it to build hotels. And I do want to talk about this in more detail. But he also seems perfectly happy with the situation where the Arab League steps up. He says he wants to slap huge tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but he also seems kind of happy if they just give him some concessions. And I think two things are happening at once. He takes deals. He doesn’t want a lot of friction. He doesn’t want markets to freak out. He doesn’t want to be committing US troops in places where they’re not wanted. He Trump has a real sense that the tolerance of the American people for pain and bad headlines is low. And on the other hand, there is an erosion to what he is doing. He is pushing and pushing and pushing and the rock slowly give way. And so even as he’s taking these deals, he’s also alienating the Europeans. Even as he’s taking these deals, he’s changing the way people think about America, even as he’s taking these deals. Maybe he cuts the deal on minerals with Ukraine. He’s also signaled to Moscow that he’s open for a transaction. And so even if he doesn’t go all the way in the first deal, I mean, we’re a month into his second term. He’s sending signals to every other player on the field to reimagine their strategies. And for some that’s going to mean reimagining their strategy to create countermeasures to the US. I think you’re seeing that among the Europeans. For some that is going to mean reimagining their strategies, their offerings, their positioning to come closer to the US, to give Trump a deal that he can sell here. I think that’s for Putin, right. I think that’s for potentially China, somewhat to my surprise, given Trump’s historic feeling that China is going to destroy the American economy. And this game will be repeated again and again and again, and by the end of it, by the end of turn after turn after turn of this, the entire system is in a very different place, not a place you could have gotten it into in one month, but a place you could definitely get into in four years. Yeah, and I think NATO has essentially been eroded already because what is NATO. NATO is not the buildings. The treaty. NATO is something very simple. It is the question, will the United States of America come to the defense of a small European country if attacked by Russia. And I think the events of the last few weeks have left. I can tell you, having talked to many Europeans, have left the Europeans in no doubt that if Lithuania were attacked tomorrow by Russia, there is almost no chance that Donald Trump would do everything it took to defend Lithuania. So that means they start asking themselves, what. What is this new world we’re living in. So you’re seeing I mean, this is really historic that the guy who’s going to become the chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Mertz, has said the most urgent task for Europe now is to begin a step by step independence from the United States, because the United States, or at least Donald Trump, have shown themselves to be indifferent to the fate of Europe, that is seismic for what was really America’s most important ally in Europe. To say that our principal strategic task now is to find a strategy of independence away from the United States, and you’re going to see other countries do variations of that. And in some cases, those countries will be probably doing private kind of hedging in a way that they can’t publicly admit to. The one part I don’t agree with you is I think there are countries that are going to do deals with America. Everyone is going to be wary of a long term relationship because they realize that certainly in this new world, those don’t mean that much. I was in Australia last December. And I met with a senior official there who said to me, we’re very happy to be in this closer relationship with the United States. We’re delighted that you’re sharing your nuclear technology with us. Those nuclear subs deal that we made with them. But the big question we wonder about is we have now put ourselves in a structurally confrontational role vis a vis our principal trading partner, China. We didn’t have to do that. China is a long way away. We were happily trading with them. We hope to continue to do that, but it has completely changed the relationship we have with China. That’s O.K if you have our back, but if in a few years you decide to cut a deal with China, we will have made a generational strategic error, and I think that is what’s going to be in every country’s mind, about getting close to the United States in a long term. That’s why I say these alliances took eight decades to build. Let me take the other side of this. What are the chances that Trump is exactly what Europe needs right now. That Europe is a mess, that it has not invested nearly enough in its defense for decades. That it has been watching its productivity numbers functionally collapse, that in something JD Vance was saying, it is overregulated. And that is one reason it has almost no strong technology companies right now. That Europe was not getting stronger under Joe Biden’s protective umbrella that we’ve been watching, actually, Europe weaken. We have been encouraging a kind of dependence from it. And that here, I guess I’m sounding like the senior Republican you were talking to. But I’ve heard this, and I don’t think it’s crazy that you may not ideologically like why Donald Trump is doing this. But if the end result of it is a more independent Europe that spends more on defense and takes its own economic revitalization more seriously, that would be good for all parties, and that it is frankly unlikely that Putin, when he’s trying to build better relations with America, is going to invade a bunch of other countries and embarrass Donald Trump. So the Moscow problem is not that big of a problem in the near term. And a stronger Europe would be good for deterring that in the long run. And was not going to happen under Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. I broadly agree with what you’re saying, that Europe needed a kind of a kick in the pants. And interestingly, the threat from Russia has turned out not to be big enough to get Europe kind of energized because of us. Well, it couldn’t it could only not be big enough because of us. And the threat of the abandonment of the United States is actually more significant than the threat of Russian aggression. And so they will probably spend more. They will coordinate more on defense. Maybe they’ll even do more. I think that the fundamental issue with productivity in Europe is much larger than the US or Russia seeing where the total factor productivity rises in Europe over the next five years may be unrelated, but I do think they will coordinate more in defense. They’ll coordinate more in foreign policy. They’ll get they’ll get more. They’ll spend more. What you will lose is they will be less deferential to the United States. I think it might be bad for us. I was about to say we had a system where we kind of ran the world. We ran the world because the European Union essentially did exactly what we wanted them to and was a satellite of the United States. So we would be experimenting with a different system. Yet the Europeans will spend more. It is worth pointing out it’s there was a reason we wanted to denationalize the foreign and defense policies of countries like Germany and Germany in particular, trapped in the center of Europe, has always had a difficult time having a kind of sensible, moderate foreign policy. So there were great virtues to saying to the Germans what, guys, don’t worry so much about your security. We’ll take care of it for the last 100 years when you’ve worried about it, things haven’t turned out so well. And I think Germany is a completely different country now, but it is taking us into a different world. By the way, there will be no defense savings out of all this. The idea that the United States will be able to spend less because the Europeans are spending more misunderstands what our defense budget is about. We are the only global superpower. We are trying to be engaged in every part of the world. I mean, this is a president who says we should be in Gaza. We have to deter the Japanese. We need Greenland because we want to be able to be sure that we control the Arctic. And by the way, we need to be controlling the Panama Canal. That’s the way even Trump conceives of America’s role. So there’s going to be no defense saving. So at the end of the day yeah, it’s possible that we get a more independent Europe that spends more on defense. I think that I would prefer a kind of tough love approach where there was actually some love among the places where I am surprised by what policy is looking like and what the rhetoric coming out of the administration is like. Is China where what were we told he was going to do and going to think that he was going to come in and put a 65 percent tariff on all goods from China. Nothing like that is happening. He’s been much more aggressive in some ways with threats of tariffs towards Europe and Canada and Mexico. He’s now begun talking about some kind of big deal with China, where they would just buy more of our stuff, which is like a deal he struck in the first term, even though they didn’t end up buying the stuff. But I would have told you that he actively wants a hostile relationship with China. And now he doesn’t seem to actively want a hostile relationship with China. It was him who initially came up with, or at least people in his administration with, forcing the sell off of TikTok. Now he’s the Savior of TikTok. How do you describe where the Trump administration seems to be or seems to be moving on China again. You with Trump, so much of it is personal. So the reason he seems to have moved on TikTok is because he realized that there was a large group of people supporting him on TikTok. TikTok was good for him. It was a good platform for him to get his message out. And it’s possible. Sometimes with Trump that it’s as simple as he realized TikTok is good for me, so I’m for it. But I think that with China, you have always had this conflicting pressure and you saw it in Trump in one 0.0. He was hostile toward China in the campaign. He talked about massive tariffs against China. And he comes in and he invites Xi Jinping to mar-a-lago. And he’s dazzled by that. And his grandchildren sing Chinese songs to Xi Jinping. And he talks about this beautiful chocolate cake. He serves him. And he likes the idea that he is sitting with the second most powerful person in the world. And they have a relationship and they get on. I mean, the whole Trump 1.0 on China was kind of a nothing because they put tariffs on. And somebody did a calculation that something like 95 percent of the value of the revenues collected for the tariffs went to subsidies to American farmers to compensate them for the loss. So we didn’t even make any money off of it, which Trump often talks about with tariffs. This time around, I think he seems to be much less even rhetorically hostile toward China. My inclination is to go where you’re going. He wants to deal with China. He wants to have some kind of a better working relationship with China. I think to a large extent that could be a good thing. And I think that if one of the things I worry about in The New world we’re going into China is embarking on a massive military buildup. China is probably going to quadruple the number of nuclear weapons. It has in the next 10 years, that’s all. And to a certain extent, I understand China’s point of view, which is they are the second richest country in the world. Why should they not have an arsenal that’s as big as Russia is, but it can be very destabilizing that period. When the Soviets expanded their nuclear arsenal in the late 50s and 60s and the United States and the Soviets were going mano a mano is a very unstable period. Think of the Berlin crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis. So to have a better working relationship with China during that in this period, I think is a very, very good thing. And if for whatever reason Trump gets there, I’d be the first to applaud it. How have you taken Trump’s attitude towards Israel and Gaza, his proposals, his appointments. How would you describe it. I think what Trump represented for the Israelis was the most unqualified support that any American president was ever going to give to an Israeli Prime Minister. And the relationship is obviously very personal between Trump and Bibi as a result of that. By the way, he was able to get a ceasefire fire because in effect what. It seems that his envoy told Beebe, you’re not going to get a better deal from Trump. So you better take this one. This is in the waning days of the Biden administration. But I think that it’s also a kind of ideological affinity to Bibi ISM, if you will. If you notice in that UN resolution in which the United States absolutely, bizarrely sided with Russia, against Ukraine, against almost every Democratic country in the world, in basically not condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. There were two unusual countries that went along with the US, Russia, North Korea, Belarus. It was Hungary and Israel. And I think what that tells you is that there is this ideological affinity that Trump feels with Bibi, both wrongly persecuted by the liberal elites of their country, both representing the kind of silent majority in their minds, both believing in huge amounts of disruption, both tough guys. So I think, a kind of personal and ideological connection that Trump has with Bibi’s Israel. And you can see it when you watch them, watch them together. The fear that the people I know who work on Middle East policy had about Donald Trump was that if he was elected, you would have an American president functionally supportive of Israeli annexation of the West Bank and possibly of Gaza. What they didn’t expect was any desire on that same American president’s behalf to personally annex Gaza. Nobody saw. Well, actually, no, Israel shouldn’t take Gaza. America should take Gaza. What do you think that proposal is. Do you understand where it came from. Do you have a sense of how much he would actually risk to make it happen. Like, how have you read it. We have tried to understand it. And most people I was with a lot of what Trump says, it does appear to have come out, almost spontaneously. And so my guess is what happened is Bibi Netanyahu essentially expressed what has long been a kind of right wing fantasy in Israel, which is if only we could clear these Palestinians out of Gaza, this would be a great place for us to it was a big mistake for us to leave. And it’s an amazing piece of land. We could think of the wonders we could do with Gaza. So it may be came out of that. What it has done is it has in some ways given comfort to both the extremists on both sides. So right wing Israelis now say, and I mean people to the right of Bibi Netanyahu say, you see, this was not a fantasy. This was something real. The president of the United States is now advocating getting the Palestinians out of Gaza. So all those people have dug in and believe that this is really viable. And by the way, it’s spreading to their views on the West Bank as well, because the right wing fantasy in Israel has always been make life so difficult for the Palestinians that effectively, they will slowly but surely start moving away. They’ll go to Jordan, they’ll go to Egypt. The Egyptians and Jordanians will be forced to take them. But on the other hand, it does seem to have also reinforced among the hard line Palestinians. The idea that, look, the Americans only mean bad things for us. Don’t be very wary of any of This American involvement, because what the Americans really want to do is ethnically cleanse all of us out of Gaza. So they’re digging in. They’re trying to figure out how do we maintain our presence, how do we make sure that if there is some kind of an American or Israeli suzerainty here, we would launch an insurgency? So I don’t see it as having produced anything particularly good. And it has really reinforced this very, this very strong element within the Israeli right that believes there is a solution to the Palestinian problem, and it is largely ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the West Bank. In Joe Biden, you had the apex of the liberal international order believers. Joe Biden’s whole career in the Senate it was devoted to this quite significantly. He was known for his commitment to these alliances, known for his belief in a muscular liberal internationalism. It was always notable the way, when he was deciding whether or not to stay in the race, the thing that seemed to animate him in that period was NATO. And if not for me, who’s going to protect NATO and the alliances. And they had this vision of American strength through the alliance system, and it led to a world or it coexisted with a world that by the end of his term felt to many people like it had fallen into disorder. You had Russia invading Ukraine. You had the war in Gaza. And you had a sense of American weakness. I mean, some of that was Joe Biden’s inability to personally project strength, whatever you thought of the actual policies. Now, you’ve had Trump come in for a month and the whole world is reshuffling in response to what he says. You have negotiations happening with Moscow. You have mineral deals being signed with Ukraine. You have in Gaza, all of a sudden, for the insanity, in my view of Trump’s actual proposal, I am hearing more serious proposals from the Arab countries than I was before. Yet Yair Lapid, one of the opposition leaders in Israel, had a reasonable I thought, proposal of wiping out Egyptian foreign debt in return for Egypt taking over rebuilding and governance of Gaza for a period of time. The sense that the world is responding to American strength. Did Democrats fumble this in their belief that a restrained America was a strong America, that more did not need to be projected? Did they leave the opening for someone like Trump, who said, there’s all this surplus power and the American public is going to respond to seeing someone come pick it up, that the sense of the world should respond to America, that we should be feared by our friends and our enemies alike, had been dismissed. I’ve heard this from people involved in the Middle East conflict. Nobody feared Joe Biden. Look, I think that there’s no question the United States had enormous power. Again, I say it contradicts the central premise of the Trump Vance domestic argument, which is that America has been hollowed out and ravaged over the last 30 years by the forces of globalization and liberalism. In fact, the real story of the last 30 years is the United States has emerged dominant among the rich countries in the world. And they seem to envy the political systems of countries that are in terrible shape. right. Hungry Russia, China, which is seeing its growth rates fall. They have a lot of envy of systems that you would not want to emulate. China doesn’t have a trade deficit. And look at China. Like that’s not a country you would want to emulate the economy of. So there is a kind of weird contradiction. But I agree with you. The United States has enormous power, and I don’t think that it is a sign of strength to go around bullying smaller countries and forcing them to say, things that are often kind of rhetorical concessions get everyone to call it the Gulf of America get the Panamanians are a good example. The guy who was running Panama now is a very pro-American conservative, and he’s now been humiliated and made to mouth some kind of nonsense that allows Trump to claim he got a victory. Same thing happened with Canada and Mexico. I’m going to do it because I want to push you to the strong examples here, the strong counterexamples, which is to say that I Jake Sullivan, on this show and we were talking about Ukraine and we were talking about Israel, and I would say the view that emerged from him is that it would be immoral to use American leverage to push our allies into negotiations in Ukraine, to force Israel to have done really anything differently in Gaza, and that as soon as Trump came on the scene, it turned out people would listen. Like the hostage deal got signed and Yahoo dropped some objections they move forward on to some kind of ceasefire. You had negotiations. Not in the way I would like to see them had preconceiving. Functionally, everything to Moscow is, in my view, fundamentally immoral. But the level at which the Biden administration would not push its own allies and did not act like it had leverage over someone like Zelenskyy, was strange. By the end, you could tactically say there are some cases where they didn’t handle it well. I for many, many months was criticizing the Biden administration. On the russia-ukraine front. I thought that it was important to get more realistic on Israel. It’s a particular dynamic that you well, which is that for a Democratic president, it is very hard to push the Israelis to do anything, because they know they can outflank a Democrat by going directly to Congress, by going directly to essentially to Republicans. Bibi Netanyahu did that to Barack Obama, who was a much more skilled politician and negotiator than Joe Biden was. And when Obama tried to push him on the Iran nuclear thing, Bibi just did an end run around Obama, went to Washington, got the Republicans to invite him to give a joint speech to the joint session of Congress and completely kind of tied Obama in knots on that one. So that is a particular problem. But I agree with you that tactically, there are some places where you could push harder, if you ask me, which philosophy is the right one for the United States to have. I think it’s the one that has built these alliance structures in this system for 80 years by not viewing this as a series of transactions, but as a relationship. Trump is a transaction guy. Think about every real estate deal he’s ever done. At the end of the day, the person. He does the deal with never wants to deal with him again. I mean, that is basically one of the leitmotifs of Trump’s business career. He screws you in the deal and then moves on and the next time around screws somebody else. But that’s not what American foreign policy has been built on. It’s been built on these alliances and these relationships that have endured now for almost a century. And by the way, very few countries have managed that. So Trump, by strong arming of a few people, a few of these countries will get, in the short term, a better deal. Again, we’re very powerful. We’re very rich. But is that going to build real trust for the next 40, 50 years. I don’t think so. It’s going to give Trump a few good headlines. And by the way, on the Gaza thing, I think it’s important to remember, because I’ve spent time in a lot of time in the Middle East over the last nine months or so. I’ve been to Saudi Arabia 3 times 4 times. They were always willing to pay for the reconstruction. The idea that the Trump’s bizarre Gaza proposal has gotten the Saudis and the Egyptians to be ready to be involved is not true. The issue has always been who will govern Gaza. And that was the Israelis say it can’t be any Hamas involvement. The Arabs say, look, if it’s going to be no Hamas involvement, then you have to allow the Palestinian Authority to do it. And the Israelis say no. And the Israeli response is, why can’t the Arabs do it. Well, the Arabs don’t want to be in the position of ruling over the Palestinians. They don’t want to be in a position where Hamas launches an insurgency against them. That has been the sticking point, not the money. They’ve always been willing to pay the money. And by the way, that will continue to be the sticking point. That is the hard part of the Gaza business, not getting the Saudis and the UAE to pony up the cash. The thing that I think I’m pushing towards here is not, is Trumpism the right long term strategy for the US, but assuming the system survives the next couple of years, which in the range of possibilities. I don’t think is 100 percent I don’t think it’s 100 percent domestically, and I don’t think it’s 100 percent internationally. I think there’s a question of there being thesis, antithesis, synthesis, dynamics to where things probably need to go. I think that with Doge, where Democrats were accepting, I mean, I have a whole book on this coming out, but Democrats are accepting of huge levels of government proceduralism obstruction, the inability of government to deliver or be responsive. They became defenders of government. Now you have a group heedlessly taking chainsaws, trying to actually wreck the thing in a way I consider immoral and genuinely dangerous. But I think for to find some stable equilibrium, Democrats are going to have to take some lessons from this. Not just say we were right before you guys should have listened to us. And the way I think we now understand that center left parties, kind of in Europe and in America, had adopted positions on immigration that were politically unstable. And they don’t need to go all the way to where the far right is, but they can’t be where they were if they’re going to win power. Is there some ways in which lessons need to be learned here, for there to be an effective center left answer, or even a left answer or liberal answer to what this set of challenges represents. Is there some dissatisfaction with how the system is working, either from the American perspective or the International perspective that needs to be integrated. Even if you find, as many of us do where Trump is going. Immoral Yeah. Look, the left is collapsed everywhere. I mean, if you look at Europe, the real story of the European elections over the last, 10 years is the collapse of the left. The French left has collapsed. The German left has collapsed. If you look, Holland, wherever you look, Sweden was run by the Swedish social Democrats for 75 years, and they were in trouble. And I think it’s principally over the issue of immigration. As I’ve been hard line on immigration. I think the whole system is. The asylum system needs to be scrapped. And the fact that the left was not willing to frontally acknowledge that you had millions of people coming in who were obviously gaming the system, claiming to be asylum seekers when they were really economic migrants. I think the left is paying a huge price for that everywhere, and they will continue to pay a price for that because even now it will feel like catch up. When they do it on the international side, I don’t think there was any such deep dissatisfaction with the international system as it exists. I think to a large extent, Trump’s grievances around it that have exploited it. But he taps into a certain kind of American jacksonianism that says, why are we entangled with these people. Why the United States has always had two fundamental attitudes. One, we are too good to participate in the world, or we are so good that we should completely transform the world. But to actually engage in the world as it exists has always been difficult for the United States because it’s an ideological nation. It believes it is exceptional and all that. And I think you see some of that in the Trump attitude. I think the point you made about Europe is the principal place where I would say there was a lesson to learn, that we had gotten too complacent about the Western Alliance, and we had gotten too complacent about Europe’s foreign policy dysfunctions. And I think in some ways, Trump’s willingness to say the I think the unthinkable and say the unsayable like he’s said, for example, maybe we should make a deal with Iran. He went in his first term and tried to make a deal with Kim Jong Un. I those things I actually do find refreshing because why not try to see if there’s a way you could make a deal with Kim Jong Un. Why not see if there’s a way. I think all these things are low probabilities of success, but there is something to be said for of thinking out of the box or in some way or the other. I feel like with Trump, the danger is not the thinking out of the box part. The danger is he doesn’t value that the box we created is a pretty special box, and it’s been very hard in human history to find an era of peace and prosperity and great power, stability of the kind we have been able to create. So before we have this kind of Maoist nihilism and say, let’s burn the whole thing down and see where it goes. Let’s appreciate the box. How does the destruction of USAID fit into this in one way or another. I think it’s been because that got filed under Doge, I think has been treated as less of a foreign policy move than it actually is. They seem to have successfully continued to keep the money pretty cut off in a lot of cases, even in places where say, Marco Rubio seemed to want PEPFAR funding, which is funding for HIV/AIDS medication, particularly in Africa, turned on. And it seems to have not really turned back on. Is this foreign policy. Is this just a kind of internal jihadism against what they see as the liberal nonprofit industrial complex. What do you. What is the import of what they’ve done to USAID and what is to the best you believe they have it or the rationale for it. So I’ve thought about this a lot, because why would you choose usaid? It’s 1 percent of the federal budget. If you were able to change some of the uploading mechanisms in Medicare Advantage, you’d probably save more money than in reforming USAID. Medicare is $1 trillion, Social Security is a trillion and a half dollars. USAID is about $40 billion. And they don’t seem to be reforming it. They’re annihilating it. So I think what happened is if there’s thought behind it, there must have been Musk. And companies said, what is the least popular form of spending that the US does. And Marco Rubio alluded to this. It’s obviously foreign aid. You’re sending money to foreigners. People feel like, why shouldn’t we be spending it at home. It’s easy. So I think that was the idea. Let’s go for an easy win. Let’s go for something where particularly our base, the megabase. And most Americans in general think this is a waste of government spending. And they went at it with a brutality. I think to send a signal to other government agencies don’t block us. This is how this is what will happen to you if you try to in some way or the other, do an end run around what we’re doing. The look, the effect to my mind is tragic because there’s this geopolitical argument that this is the soft power of the United States. We go into these countries and people think, well of America. Now the Chinese are going to go in and the Russians are going to go in. I believe all that. But I think it’s I wouldn’t it’s put it in those competitive terms to sell it and I get it. But, it’s been one of the wonderful things that the United States has done in the world. Foreign aid barely existed before 1945. It’s again one of these revolutions of foreign policy that America in large part initiated. And I think it is largely the impulse comes from the idea we’re the richest country in the history of the world. It would it’s also be a great thing for us to be the most generous country in the history of the world 4 out of every 10 humanitarian dollars spent in the world are spent by the United States, and most of USAID’s budget is food and medicine. You’re literally feeding the hungry. You’re clothing sick people. I’ve seen this on the ground. The people who do work at USAID, these are people who move to Mozambique or Ghana to learn how to get water filtration systems in there. They’re getting paid 60, $70,000 a year. They’re not doing it for the money. They’re not doing it for the glory. They’re doing it because they believe that the United States can have a kind of positive impact on the world. And to see the agency gutted, the funding pulled. And these people demeaned and demonized, called a criminal enterprise. It’s so sad. I grew up in India, and I saw so much of the USAID funding, which was exactly the kind of stuff that Doge demonizes, which was to say, I mean, there was a program where they would show old American movies at the US. Consulate, and a whole bunch of us would go there. And I remember, I mean, I went to I saw it’s a wonderful life and movies like that. And you know what it did have it made me fall in love with America. It made I think that’s always been America’s great strength, which is that it’s the Chinese who do these deals with an African country and with the dictator and say, we’ll build you a dam. And in return for that, here’s what we want. And by the way, you can take 10 percent what American soft power has been. We let the world know who we are. We let the world know that we’re a big, open, generous country. And some of that is funding plays and movies, and some of it is, and most of it is food and medicine. And I was always a matter of great pride to me that the United States did that. And it’s very sad that, for now at least, gone away. I think it also gets to what is America first. And one of the things that I actually think it is a total devaluing of non-American lives. We were talking you were saying a minute ago how USAID is being Musk calls it. What was it, a ball of worms. It’s like no worms in the Apple, just a ball of worms. So that’s a horrible thing to say about I know people who work in aid like you do. Musk is a billionaire who Jets around the world fathering children with Lord knows how many women and tweeting sending missives on X 300 times a day. And these people who went to amazing schools go work on, marginally improving economic growth by making the textile sector more efficient in Ghana. So it just it appalls me. But at least the Americans who are working for USAID exist in the calculus the administration hates them and wants to demonize them and wants them to go to the private sector where they’ll be more productive. But the kids who the children who needed PEPFAR funding the antiretrovirals from PEPFAR. They don’t exist in the conversation here at all. And it’s always, I think, a difficult thing from the perspective of a nation, right, which does have a preference for its own citizens. Like, how should you think about an economic migrant who’s any individual economic migrants. Life would be much better off if they could come to the US. And for reasons of stability and the economy, you can’t let everybody who would like to come to the US and how do you value that. It’s a really hard question. And we don’t have I think, very good answers. And we tack forward and backward. How do you value like people we say, from dying of malnutrition. The answers have been complex, not always really debated, but somewhat. We value those lives somewhat. It’s not how we think about Americans, but it’s not nothing. And I kind think one of the messages here is it’s nothing like the value of foreign lives is nothing. The value of people in the West Bank whose land is going to be annexed is nothing our care about. The Ukrainians is nothing, right. And I think that’s some of the message of it, too, particularly domestically, that USAID was about spending American money to not really serve our interests. First and foremost, I think you’re right to say that when we say it’s really about our soft power, not truly telling the truth anymore. It’s about expressing our values, which is that other Lives Matter. And practically, if those cost effective ways we can help them, we should. And the message here is they don’t and we shouldn’t. I think that one of the ironies here is that I do believe, as you do, that it was American aid was never entirely about geopolitics and ","summary":"The journalist Fareed Zakaria discusses the worldview emerging from Trump’s foreign policy decisions regarding Ukraine, Gaza, China and beyond.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-fareed-zakaria.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/opinion/01eks-zakaria-image/25eks-gurri-video-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 12:02:30","author":"Ezra Klein","authors":["Ezra Klein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":295648690,"title":"The Dark Heart of Trump’s Foreign Policy","text":"What is the Donald Trump doctrine. What is Donald Trump’s foreign policy. I think the place to begin to try to untangle what we’ve actually seen here is to listen to the way Donald Trump and Vice President Vance speak about our allies. The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia. It’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America. I mean, look, let’s be honest, the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it. And they’ve done a good job of it. But now I’m president. I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine. They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough. Something is new here. This is not even what Donald Trump’s first term was like. There were hints of it, but something is new here. I wanted to have a bigger picture conversation about what this Trump doctrine is, and the way it’s going to reshape the world. So I’m joined today by Fareed Zakaria, the host of GPS on CNN, a Washington Post columnist and the author of the best selling book, age of revolutions. As always, my email at nytimes.com. Fareed Zakaria, welcome back to the show. Always a pleasure, Ezra. So to the extent you feel you can define it, what’s the Trump doctrine. The part of the problem with Trump is he’s so mercurial, he’s so idiosyncratic that just when you think you’ve figured out the Trump doctrine, he goes and says something that kind of sounds like the opposite of the Trump doctrine. But I do think that there’s one coherent worldview that Trump seems to espouse and has espoused for a long time. The first ad he took out when he was a real estate developer, I think it was in 1985, was an ad about how Japan was ripping us off economically, and Europe was ripping us off by freeriding on security. And what that represents, I think, fundamentally, is a kind of rejection of the open international system that the United States and Europe has built over the last eight decades. If you think about it for a minute. It really is a remarkable achievement. You go back to international relations before 1945, and it’s just constant war, mercantilism, protectionism. The two Yale scholars who tabulated in the hundreds years before World War II, there’s about 150 territorial conquests aggression, taking of territory, legitimization of that since 1945, there have been practically none. You have an open international economy. You have free trade. You have rules, you have trade and travel and patents. I mean, there’s a huge area of international cooperation that people don’t think about but that happens all the time, every day. When you fly, when from one place to another. And what Trump, I think has taken from that whole world is the US has been the sucker. The Uc has been the country that’s had to underwrite it. The Uc is the country that’s opened itself up to the world and everyone takes advantage of the US. So I don’t know that he wants to tear it down, but he wants to seriously renegotiate or perhaps even redo that system. Let me try to reflect what his people tell me. Picking up on something you said. There is this, as people call it, rules based international order. And the thing that Joe Biden says and Jake Sullivan says. And Fareed Zakaria says, is that America benefits from that order and benefits from being part of that order. And there’s long been a critique from the left that America, in fact, dominates that order and doesn’t play by its rules. We break international law, we do the things we want to do, and then use those rules on others when we don’t like what they’re doing. But the critique from Trump is that that’s not true, that of every country, America, as the strongest, is harmed the most by these restraints, by these rules, by these laws. Because we have so much leverage we could be using, we could slap tariffs on anybody for any reason and get them to do what we want. We have the strongest military. Of all of the militaries. Everybody wants to be on our side and everybody fears being on our bad side. And that what Trump is doing is systematically automatically searching out the strength America has, the ways we can wield our weight and leverage, and untying our hands from behind our back. Yeah, there is a certain truth to that the United States does have enormous power, by the way. They’re even right about the fact that the United States is more open to for example, the world’s goods and services than they are to ours. The United States has long practiced a kind of asymmetrical free trade. So after World War II, we decided we would open up our markets to Europe and East Asia, to Japan and South Korea. And the reason we did that was we were trying to build an international system where everyone benefited, where there really wasn’t that feeling of beggar thy neighbor. Zero sum game where everyone went into a competitive spiral, which then ends up in nationalism and war. We were trying to build something different and we thought, we can be a little generous here. Let’s let everyone grow and we’ll do fine in the process. And of course, Europe, and Japan and South Korea and places like that grew. But the United States absolutely dominated the world, because it’s a classic positive sum game. We created a much larger global economy, much larger trading system, huge capital flows, and we were at the center of it. The dollar was the reserve currency of the world, which alone gives us incredible advantages. We’re the only country that doesn’t have to worry that much about debt and deficits, because we know that at the end of the day, the dollar is the reserve currency. And my feeling is if you take that system and say, O.K, we’re going to look at each bilateral relationship and see if we can squeeze this country for a slightly better deal, you probably will get a better deal, but two things will happen. The first thing is you will end up fracturing your alliances because the people with whom you have the most leverage are your allies. We have more leverage with Canada than we have with Russia because Canada depends on us for security. Canada trades with us a lot. Its economy is intricately tied to the US economy. So you can bully Canada. You can’t really bully Russia that much because we don’t do much trade with them. You can’t bully China, even China. It’s another vast continental economy that can survive just fine. So the result of Trump inaction, the Trump doctrine inaction has been a war on America’s allies. But the second and more important part is yeah, you’ll gain a little bit here and there by getting slightly better tariff deals. And just so people understand, tariffs in the industrialized world are around 3 percent They’re very, very low. So the idea we’re not getting penalized in any large ways. You can pick a few. You can cherry pick a few examples to the contrary, but mostly among the liberal Democratic states of the world. It’s a free trade world. But what you will do by squeezing each of these individual countries, humiliating them, making them, forcing them to accept renegotiation of terms, you lose the kind of relationships that you had built over 8 decades that created this extraordinary anchor of stability in the world, which was the Western Alliance. And the gains are not that great. Let’s talk about the tariffs for a minute. This is one of the places where the policy and practices just seemed incoherent to me. And I think I need to do a whole episode on this. But you there were different goals that have been articulated for tariffs. One is you impose significant steady tariffs for a long period of time because you’re trying to make manufacturers make different decisions about where to locate factories. You’re trying to onshore supply chains. To do that have to have them, these corporations expecting tariffs for quite a while. And then you hope that they will respond to those tariffs by insourcing into America. Another is that we’re going to use the tariffs to raise a lot of revenue. That too requires the imposition over a long period of time of significant tariffs. Another is we’re just going to bully small nations and just bully kind of anybody. We might feel like bullying right. The tariffs are an all purpose tool to get other countries to do anything we want them to do. We’ve been using them that way, but not for very significant concessions. We’re on the cusp of maybe they’re about to reintroduce them to Canada and Mexico. So we’ll see where we are in a couple of weeks. But what are they doing, man. So there are two things, I think, are going on. One is, as I’ve said, Trump, if he has a worldview, he’s a protectionist. He’s always felt that want to protect American industries. These foreigners come in and they take advantage of us. Et cetera. Et cetera. The second, I think, is that and this I think he discovered as president, the president has incredible power in the area of tariffs. Technically, it’s meant to be Congress that imposes tariffs. But a long ago Congress delegated that power to the president. And I think Trump loves that. It is an extraordinary unilateral exercise of huge American power, the power of the American market to say, I will just block you from being able to participate in the American market. And you saw him do that in the case of the Colombian president. So I think he’s not sure. At one hand, he loves wielding this weapon. On the other hand, he is something of a protectionist. But as you say, he notices that markets don’t seem to it. So where will it all end up. My gut is that what happens is, so tariffs in the industrialized world, as I said, have roughly been about 3 percent If you assume all of Trump’s tariffs are actually put in place. I think it goes up to about 6 percent And if that stays, which is a big if other countries will all retaliate. This is an area where I think, we do live in it’s not even a bipolar world. It’s a tripolar world. The Europeans and the Chinese are very powerful. And the Europeans on this issue speak with one voice. So they will put on reciprocal tariffs. The Chinese will put on reciprocal tariffs. We end up in a world with more tariffs, more protection. Look, I’m an old fashioned free trader. I think the whole thing is a disaster. I think that it is a complete misreading of the last 30 or 40 years of economics. JD Vance, when he was in Germany, in Europe, one of the few backhanded compliments he played to Germany was, he said, at least the Germans didn’t go along with this Washington Consensus nonsense, and they protected their manufacturing, which is partly true. They didn’t protect it through tariffs, by the way. They protected it by just having very strong apprenticeship programs and what we would call community college type stuff. But look at where Germany is. Germany, the third or fourth largest economy in the world, is stuck in the second Industrial Revolution. What do they make. Cars, chemicals, machine tools. They don’t have any industry in the digital economy, the entire digital economy is totally dominated by the US. Why is that. Because we allowed ourselves to transition to where the frontiers of the economy were. This whole idea of trying to hold on to the 19th century or the 1920s, it doesn’t work. It’s incredibly expensive. Nobody has been able to do it. Manufacturing employment today after Donald Trump’s four years, and Joe Biden’s four years is the same as it was roughly 10, 15 years ago. I think that this whole obsession is fundamentally misconceived. What we should do is much more redistribution, so that the people who lose out in these periods of technological change are taken care of. But the idea that we can go back to 1950 is just nuts. This gets to me, one of the real obfuscations of the Trump presidency of MAGA as a movement. There are a lot of conversations right now that have a term in them that is ill-defined. Let’s call it efficiency. What is the Department of Government efficiency about. What is efficiency. Efficiency of what Towards what. Efficiency requires some other defined ends to be a coherent goal. But here too, what is America first. What would it mean for that to be successful. What are we looking like. The trade deficit is going to be the main output of our foreign policy, which, by the way, he’s not consistent on in any way. He was talking the other day about building a renewed Keystone XL pipeline to Canada, which if we start importing a bunch of Canadian oil, that’s going to increase the trade deficit with Canada. Is it manufacturing employment. Is that what we’re supposed to be targeting here is if America first was working, it would be manufacturing and playing. Is it GDP growth. I have never heard them, and I have listened fairly closely. Describe what this new era, this new golden age of American strength is. Is it median wages for men. They don’t, I think they certainly have not articulated a coherent view of American power or success. Like, is America stronger if AFD takes over Germany. Why like, what does AFD get us. I’m curious how you think about this. If maybe I’m being unfair. Maybe you think there’s a better definition of it. But there is a question, all this of what they’re trying to achieve. Do you feel like, I would guess that America First for Trump and for many of his followers and I wouldn’t put some of the ideologists of MAGA in the same category. But I think for Trump. It’s the idea that the United States has been constrained for too long by globalism, by worrying about the international environment, by worrying about all these alliances constrained by these international organizations that, again, we’ve been the sucker, that what America first means is we’re going to break through all that bullshit and we’re just going to do what’s good for America. But what is left undefined, as you’re saying, is, well, what is good for America. Why would it be good for America to break, to break apart the international trading system. Why would it be good for America to break apart this world that’s created. So that part I think is undefined. But you can see the impulse and what the attraction is to a lot of people. A lot of people who have always felt that the United States, by the way, run by this elite cabal of urban liberals, overeducated urban liberals in places like New York and Washington has been selling America out. This was basically, if you think of the 1950s, this was the McCarthy attack in many ways. So I think in some ways, it’s a harkening back to that idea. There’s another piece of that being restrained by norms. I think a pretty significant difference between Trump’s first term and his second is the intensity of his fascination now with territorial expansion, making Canada the 51st state, making Gaza province. Somehow of America. Taking over Greenland. But I think Trump believes in the people around him. Believe that the norms of the world turned against territorial expansion in a way that was bad for America. America in the 19th century expanded. Other countries did, too. And we are powerful. And there are things we should want that Canada should be the 51st state, or at least it should act like a vassal state of America that if we want Greenland, we should have it. I think Trump really wants, fundamentally wants the landmass of America to be larger when he leaves office than when he came in. How have you taken Trump’s renewed interest in gaining territory. Yeah, I think you have it exactly right. And in a way, he has a kind of fascination, not just with America. I think in the 19th century, in the way exactly the way you described, but also in geopolitics of the 19th century to the extent that I think he understands it, which is the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. To quote Thucydides, and that idea that we are powerful, we should be unconstrained is very familiar in a sense. That’s what the Chinese foreign minister said at a meeting of ASEAN nations where he was telling, I think it was the Philippines or the Singaporeans. You’ve got to understand we are big and powerful. You are not. We are going to tell you what to do. Obviously, it is the way Putin views the world. That’s why I think he has a much more benign view of Putin’s desire to have a sphere of influence, a kind of a group of satellite states around him, including Ukraine. He has a much more benign view, I think, of Chinese expansionism. He very rarely criticizes it. I can’t remember him ever doing it. And so then he looks at it and says, well, the United States should similarly have that kind of sense of the Monroe Doctrine, the Western hemisphere. Again to me, it Mrs. the central point about the transformation of the international system after World War II, which is that you realized you don’t need territory to become rich and powerful and incredibly effective in the world. Look at South Korea. South Korea is, I forget, now 15 times the per capita GDP of North Korea. Look at tiny Israel, which is now essentially an advanced industrial country on a tiny spit of land. Think about all the richest and most powerful countries in the world. Land acquisition has almost nothing to do with, who has a lot of land. Russia it feels to me like a kind of bizarre, anachronistic way to look at the world. But I agree with you. That is the way he’s thinking about it. You could get whatever minerals you wanted to get out of Greenland by just signing a couple of deals with them. You don’t actually need to own it. You could redo the Panama Canal treaty and be much easier, by the way, to let the Panamanians run it. And you’ve just kind of renegotiated it in terms you like. But I think for Trump, part of it is this kind of old fashioned view. And part of it is I do think at the end of the day, there’s a strong element of narcissism that infuses everything that Trump does. And I think he loves the idea that he would be able to put his stamp on history by saying, Trump added Greenland or something like that to the United States. The physical expansion of America would be a great Trump legacy. You mentioned Ukraine and Russia. We’re talking in the week when all that is being negotiated. How would you describe what Trump’s policy towards Ukraine now is. It’s almost impossible to have a kind of again, a clear through line because it’s moved so much. He had a tweet in which he said the Russians better. Putin better realize this war has ruined his country. He better settle. And if he doesn’t, we’re going to put additional sanctions and his favorite weapon tariffs on Russia now. But it seemed to suggest that he understood that the principal obstacle to a peace deal was not Zelenskyy but Putin. But then he shifted entirely and enormously in the last few weeks, where he’s called Zelenskyy a dictator. He said he started the war, all that stuff. I mean, the UN resolution where the United States sided with Russia and North Korea and Belarus. So you could argue that, again, in Trump’s case, so much of it is personal. He doesn’t like Zelenskyy. But if you step back from that, I think that Trump in his heart believes that Russia has legitimate claims over Ukraine and so has a much softer line on Russia. I think he thinks that the Russians should keep the territory they’ve acquired. He thinks Ukraine should not be a part of NATO. He thinks that maybe Ukraine should have a kind of neutrality in foreign policy. These are all essentially the Russian demands. There’s no way to read his mind. But my sense from listening to him and watching him is he thinks all those Russian claims are kind of broadly legitimate. Let me push on this. All this much better than I do. I don’t think he thinks anything about Ukraine and Russia whose claims are legitimate. I think he thinks Ukraine is worthless to the Uc, and somebody at some point persuaded him their mineral rights there. And he thinks Russia is not that there is value for the US, for Trump personally, for the US economy and access to Russia, good relations with Russia, and that there is some part of him that genuinely doesn’t. Understand why we give a shit about Ukraine, as opposed to cutting a deal with Putin. And getting something out of that transaction. Yeah if you think about the countries and the leaders he likes, it’s either the country is very strong or the leader is very strong. It’s Putin Xi. Modi, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Orban Erdogan. Those are the people he speaks, talks about with respect. The more muddled, compromised, weaker leaders of coalition governments in Europe, he finds feckless, he finds uninteresting. I think he likes these more old fashioned countries. I’ve thought about this once, and I don’t know if it’s a reasonable point to make, but the countries he seems fascinated by and respects are countries which you could imagine having lots of Trump towers. The countries he doesn’t like Europe. You couldn’t imagine a Trump. But in that way, is he picking up on something real. And I think you see this a bit with JD Vance. JD Vance is going out of his way to alienate the European governments of the moment. America is weighing in on behalf of the AFD in Germany. Their view is that there are regimes that they have affinity with, and that the proper nature of American Alliance is in some unchanging alliance between America and Europe, because we’re all quote unquote, liberal democracies. Trump doesn’t want us to be a liberal democracy. The proper nature is between regimes of affinity. And in that way, Putin sees a world more like Trump does than Keir Starmer in the UK. Erdogan sees a world more like Trump does, and Justin Trudeau does that the nature of the alliances they’re seeking is a nature of regimes that are like them, regimes that could actually support, have a genuine ideological affinity for who Trump is and what he wants and the world that he wants to see. Yeah I think you’re raising something very important. I think that part of what’s going on here, this new dynamic in international relations we’re watching, is that it’s not all about power. It’s about ideology. So if you think about what is it that Putin is reacting to in the rise and hegemony of the West after the collapse of communism, some of it is Western power, the expansion of NATO, for sure. But a lot of what Putin has been obsessed by has been the expansion of Western liberal ideas and ideology. So if you notice, the things that he talks so much about are the rise of multiculturalism in the West. The rise of a kind of libertine gender ideology. The idea of gender fluidity even weighed in on the JK Rowling controversy. These issues are central to the way that Putin thinks about Russian power. The power of his regime. And so he’s viewed the rising tide and the spreading of Western liberal ideas as much a threat as the expansion of NATO. So notice that when he really reacted with force against Georgia in 2008 and then against Ukraine in 2014, in both cases, the issue was not actually that these countries were about to join NATO. They were not. It’s that they were going to join the European Union, or at least wanted to have better relations with the European Union. What is the European Union represent It represents some kind of idea of a Western style capitalist liberal democracy. And so the way he looks at it is he doesn’t want to be surrounded by those kind of countries. He wants to be surrounded by countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan, quasi authoritarian, somewhat kleptocratic regimes that he can control and manipulate. And I think she also, if you listen to Xi Jinping, a lot of the things he’s talked about is the dangers of too much westernization, too much liberalism. The Chinese have not just cracked down on the private sector, they’ve cracked down on what they called the effeminacy of men. He’s talked about the virtues of motherhood and women going back to raising families. So again, he views this rising tide of Western liberalism as much a threat, I think as Western hard power. And here the irony is Trump and Vance agree with them. And so for the first time now, you have in America a party or an ideology that says, Yes, that’s right. And in a strange sense, as Steve Bannon would explicitly say this. Our real allies should be Russia, and that becomes the new alliance system. Now that takes it further than we are right now. But it’s those inclinations. But that’s I think, where this is really going. And I think the way you see it is in Vance and Musk in Trump’s first term. Trump is surrounded, particularly on the National security and foreign policy side, by members of the traditional Republican establishment. Your HR McMaster’s, your Rex tillerson’s Mike Pence as his vice president. And none of them want this move, right. This is not why John Kelly got into politics. And so it doesn’t really happen. What there is instead are these weird moments in interviews and elsewhere where Trump seems to talk about Putin with real affection in a way that he never talks about anybody in Europe that way. Fast forward. You have Trump’s second term, in which he is surrounded by people who have been spending the intervening years building the ideology for what Trump intuitively was moving towards. And it’s not a complete purge in the Republican Party. But what’s left is too weak, even if the Senate Republicans don’t love it in every instance. And so now you see this the war between autocracy as an ideological phenomenon and liberal democracy as an ideological phenomenon isn’t now between America and Europe. And these other countries. It’s inside America, too. And now you really see it, right. These people who are more framework oriented, going there and actively weighing in, as Elon Musk did on behalf of the AFD in Germany. JD Vance going to the Munich Conference and really telling the Europeans that the great security threat is the way they run their governments, not Russia, not climate change. It is the temperament and the policy of European liberalism. Yeah, many years ago, I wrote an article called The Rise of illiberal democracy in Foreign Affairs, and I was trying to describe this phenomenon of countries where with majorities, with pluralities, we had elected leaders who then systematically degraded the rule of law and individual rights and individual liberties. And of course, I meant it as a term of condemnation. Viktor Orbán gave a speech a few years after he came to power. He didn’t he didn’t quote me, but he cited the phrase illiberal democracy. And he said, people have talked about illiberal democracy. That is what we want to achieve. That is our goal. We want to be an illiberal democracy because we don’t believe in the tenets of Western liberalism. And I think that is where some impulses of the Trump administration go. Now, I do want to say there are two possibilities. And you have outlined them yourself because when you first started the conversation, you said, the Trump people tell me, look, we just want to use unused American power and get a better deal within this framework that we’ve built up. Like, we’re O.K with the liberal international system. We just think we got screwed. So that’s one theory of where Trump is going. And I actually had a conversation with a very senior Republican this week who was hoping, and I would say was arguing that that’s where Trump is going. Yeah, there’s a lot of noise. It’s very messy. He does things. He negotiates out in the open in ways that you never would by demeaning Zelenskyy. But what he’s trying to do is to get a better deal. But then there’s the second view, which is the one we’ve just been talking about, which is no, no, no, he’s not trying to get a better deal. He is trying to systematically remake the international system, and it it reminds me there was a period in the 1870s and 80s when the three great conservative monarchs of Europe, the Russians, the austro-hungarians and the Germans got together and created a 3 emperors league. It was called the dry Kaiser Bund. And they got together because they feared the rise of liberalism in Europe after the revolutions of 1848. And it was meant to be these three conservative monarchs holding back the tide of liberalism. And to a certain extent wonder whether for some of The people involved here, that is the way they are thinking about it. And Putin and maybe even Viktor Orban and people like Erdogan and Xi. We need to hold back all this kind of godless, reckless, libertine liberalism that is engulfing the world. I do think there’s a why not both to this, as you were saying at the top of the show, it is very hard to say anything definitive about Donald Trump, because he actually is flexible and he starts in one place and it ends in another, and he says, we’re going to annex Gaza and use it to build hotels. And I do want to talk about this in more detail. But he also seems perfectly happy with the situation where the Arab League steps up. He says he wants to slap huge tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but he also seems kind of happy if they just give him some concessions. And I think two things are happening at once. He takes deals. He doesn’t want a lot of friction. He doesn’t want markets to freak out. He doesn’t want to be committing US troops in places where they’re not wanted. He Trump has a real sense that the tolerance of the American people for pain and bad headlines is low. And on the other hand, there is an erosion to what he is doing. He is pushing and pushing and pushing and the rock slowly give way. And so even as he’s taking these deals, he’s also alienating the Europeans. Even as he’s taking these deals, he’s changing the way people think about America, even as he’s taking these deals. Maybe he cuts the deal on minerals with Ukraine. He’s also signaled to Moscow that he’s open for a transaction. And so even if he doesn’t go all the way in the first deal, I mean, we’re a month into his second term. He’s sending signals to every other player on the field to reimagine their strategies. And for some that’s going to mean reimagining their strategy to create countermeasures to the US. I think you’re seeing that among the Europeans. For some that is going to mean reimagining their strategies, their offerings, their positioning to come closer to the US, to give Trump a deal that he can sell here. I think that’s for Putin, right. I think that’s for potentially China, somewhat to my surprise, given Trump’s historic feeling that China is going to destroy the American economy. And this game will be repeated again and again and again, and by the end of it, by the end of turn after turn after turn of this, the entire system is in a very different place, not a place you could have gotten it into in one month, but a place you could definitely get into in four years. Yeah, and I think NATO has essentially been eroded already because what is NATO. NATO is not the buildings. The treaty. NATO is something very simple. It is the question, will the United States of America come to the defense of a small European country if attacked by Russia. And I think the events of the last few weeks have left. I can tell you, having talked to many Europeans, have left the Europeans in no doubt that if Lithuania were attacked tomorrow by Russia, there is almost no chance that Donald Trump would do everything it took to defend Lithuania. So that means they start asking themselves, what. What is this new world we’re living in. So you’re seeing I mean, this is really historic that the guy who’s going to become the chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Mertz, has said the most urgent task for Europe now is to begin a step by step independence from the United States, because the United States, or at least Donald Trump, have shown themselves to be indifferent to the fate of Europe, that is seismic for what was really America’s most important ally in Europe. To say that our principal strategic task now is to find a strategy of independence away from the United States, and you’re going to see other countries do variations of that. And in some cases, those countries will be probably doing private kind of hedging in a way that they can’t publicly admit to. The one part I don’t agree with you is I think there are countries that are going to do deals with America. Everyone is going to be wary of a long term relationship because they realize that certainly in this new world, those don’t mean that much. I was in Australia last December. And I met with a senior official there who said to me, we’re very happy to be in this closer relationship with the United States. We’re delighted that you’re sharing your nuclear technology with us. Those nuclear subs deal that we made with them. But the big question we wonder about is we have now put ourselves in a structurally confrontational role vis a vis our principal trading partner, China. We didn’t have to do that. China is a long way away. We were happily trading with them. We hope to continue to do that, but it has completely changed the relationship we have with China. That’s O.K if you have our back, but if in a few years you decide to cut a deal with China, we will have made a generational strategic error, and I think that is what’s going to be in every country’s mind, about getting close to the United States in a long term. That’s why I say these alliances took eight decades to build. Let me take the other side of this. What are the chances that Trump is exactly what Europe needs right now. That Europe is a mess, that it has not invested nearly enough in its defense for decades. That it has been watching its productivity numbers functionally collapse, that in something JD Vance was saying, it is overregulated. And that is one reason it has almost no strong technology companies right now. That Europe was not getting stronger under Joe Biden’s protective umbrella that we’ve been watching, actually, Europe weaken. We have been encouraging a kind of dependence from it. And that here, I guess I’m sounding like the senior Republican you were talking to. But I’ve heard this, and I don’t think it’s crazy that you may not ideologically like why Donald Trump is doing this. But if the end result of it is a more independent Europe that spends more on defense and takes its own economic revitalization more seriously, that would be good for all parties, and that it is frankly unlikely that Putin, when he’s trying to build better relations with America, is going to invade a bunch of other countries and embarrass Donald Trump. So the Moscow problem is not that big of a problem in the near term. And a stronger Europe would be good for deterring that in the long run. And was not going to happen under Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. I broadly agree with what you’re saying, that Europe needed a kind of a kick in the pants. And interestingly, the threat from Russia has turned out not to be big enough to get Europe kind of energized because of us. Well, it couldn’t it could only not be big enough because of us. And the threat of the abandonment of the United States is actually more significant than the threat of Russian aggression. And so they will probably spend more. They will coordinate more on defense. Maybe they’ll even do more. I think that the fundamental issue with productivity in Europe is much larger than the US or Russia seeing where the total factor productivity rises in Europe over the next five years may be unrelated, but I do think they will coordinate more in defense. They’ll coordinate more in foreign policy. They’ll get they’ll get more. They’ll spend more. What you will lose is they will be less deferential to the United States. I think it might be bad for us. I was about to say we had a system where we kind of ran the world. We ran the world because the European Union essentially did exactly what we wanted them to and was a satellite of the United States. So we would be experimenting with a different system. Yet the Europeans will spend more. It is worth pointing out it’s there was a reason we wanted to denationalize the foreign and defense policies of countries like Germany and Germany in particular, trapped in the center of Europe, has always had a difficult time having a kind of sensible, moderate foreign policy. So there were great virtues to saying to the Germans what, guys, don’t worry so much about your security. We’ll take care of it for the last 100 years when you’ve worried about it, things haven’t turned out so well. And I think Germany is a completely different country now, but it is taking us into a different world. By the way, there will be no defense savings out of all this. The idea that the United States will be able to spend less because the Europeans are spending more misunderstands what our defense budget is about. We are the only global superpower. We are trying to be engaged in every part of the world. I mean, this is a president who says we should be in Gaza. We have to deter the Japanese. We need Greenland because we want to be able to be sure that we control the Arctic. And by the way, we need to be controlling the Panama Canal. That’s the way even Trump conceives of America’s role. So there’s going to be no defense saving. So at the end of the day yeah, it’s possible that we get a more independent Europe that spends more on defense. I think that I would prefer a kind of tough love approach where there was actually some love among the places where I am surprised by what policy is looking like and what the rhetoric coming out of the administration is like. Is China where what were we told he was going to do and going to think that he was going to come in and put a 65 percent tariff on all goods from China. Nothing like that is happening. He’s been much more aggressive in some ways with threats of tariffs towards Europe and Canada and Mexico. He’s now begun talking about some kind of big deal with China, where they would just buy more of our stuff, which is like a deal he struck in the first term, even though they didn’t end up buying the stuff. But I would have told you that he actively wants a hostile relationship with China. And now he doesn’t seem to actively want a hostile relationship with China. It was him who initially came up with, or at least people in his administration with, forcing the sell off of TikTok. Now he’s the Savior of TikTok. How do you describe where the Trump administration seems to be or seems to be moving on China again. You with Trump, so much of it is personal. So the reason he seems to have moved on TikTok is because he realized that there was a large group of people supporting him on TikTok. TikTok was good for him. It was a good platform for him to get his message out. And it’s possible. Sometimes with Trump that it’s as simple as he realized TikTok is good for me, so I’m for it. But I think that with China, you have always had this conflicting pressure and you saw it in Trump in one 0.0. He was hostile toward China in the campaign. He talked about massive tariffs against China. And he comes in and he invites Xi Jinping to mar-a-lago. And he’s dazzled by that. And his grandchildren sing Chinese songs to Xi Jinping. And he talks about this beautiful chocolate cake. He serves him. And he likes the idea that he is sitting with the second most powerful person in the world. And they have a relationship and they get on. I mean, the whole Trump 1.0 on China was kind of a nothing because they put tariffs on. And somebody did a calculation that something like 95 percent of the value of the revenues collected for the tariffs went to subsidies to American farmers to compensate them for the loss. So we didn’t even make any money off of it, which Trump often talks about with tariffs. This time around, I think he seems to be much less even rhetorically hostile toward China. My inclination is to go where you’re going. He wants to deal with China. He wants to have some kind of a better working relationship with China. I think to a large extent that could be a good thing. And I think that if one of the things I worry about in The New world we’re going into China is embarking on a massive military buildup. China is probably going to quadruple the number of nuclear weapons. It has in the next 10 years, that’s all. And to a certain extent, I understand China’s point of view, which is they are the second richest country in the world. Why should they not have an arsenal that’s as big as Russia is, but it can be very destabilizing that period. When the Soviets expanded their nuclear arsenal in the late 50s and 60s and the United States and the Soviets were going mano a mano is a very unstable period. Think of the Berlin crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis. So to have a better working relationship with China during that in this period, I think is a very, very good thing. And if for whatever reason Trump gets there, I’d be the first to applaud it. How have you taken Trump’s attitude towards Israel and Gaza, his proposals, his appointments. How would you describe it. I think what Trump represented for the Israelis was the most unqualified support that any American president was ever going to give to an Israeli Prime Minister. And the relationship is obviously very personal between Trump and Bibi as a result of that. By the way, he was able to get a ceasefire fire because in effect what. It seems that his envoy told Beebe, you’re not going to get a better deal from Trump. So you better take this one. This is in the waning days of the Biden administration. But I think that it’s also a kind of ideological affinity to Bibi ISM, if you will. If you notice in that UN resolution in which the United States absolutely, bizarrely sided with Russia, against Ukraine, against almost every Democratic country in the world, in basically not condemning the Russian aggression in Ukraine. There were two unusual countries that went along with the US, Russia, North Korea, Belarus. It was Hungary and Israel. And I think what that tells you is that there is this ideological affinity that Trump feels with Bibi, both wrongly persecuted by the liberal elites of their country, both representing the kind of silent majority in their minds, both believing in huge amounts of disruption, both tough guys. So I think, a kind of personal and ideological connection that Trump has with Bibi’s Israel. And you can see it when you watch them, watch them together. The fear that the people I know who work on Middle East policy had about Donald Trump was that if he was elected, you would have an American president functionally supportive of Israeli annexation of the West Bank and possibly of Gaza. What they didn’t expect was any desire on that same American president’s behalf to personally annex Gaza. Nobody saw. Well, actually, no, Israel shouldn’t take Gaza. America should take Gaza. What do you think that proposal is. Do you understand where it came from. Do you have a sense of how much he would actually risk to make it happen. Like, how have you read it. We have tried to understand it. And most people I was with a lot of what Trump says, it does appear to have come out, almost spontaneously. And so my guess is what happened is Bibi Netanyahu essentially expressed what has long been a kind of right wing fantasy in Israel, which is if only we could clear these Palestinians out of Gaza, this would be a great place for us to it was a big mistake for us to leave. And it’s an amazing piece of land. We could think of the wonders we could do with Gaza. So it may be came out of that. What it has done is it has in some ways given comfort to both the extremists on both sides. So right wing Israelis now say, and I mean people to the right of Bibi Netanyahu say, you see, this was not a fantasy. This was something real. The president of the United States is now advocating getting the Palestinians out of Gaza. So all those people have dug in and believe that this is really viable. And by the way, it’s spreading to their views on the West Bank as well, because the right wing fantasy in Israel has always been make life so difficult for the Palestinians that effectively, they will slowly but surely start moving away. They’ll go to Jordan, they’ll go to Egypt. The Egyptians and Jordanians will be forced to take them. But on the other hand, it does seem to have also reinforced among the hard line Palestinians. The idea that, look, the Americans only mean bad things for us. Don’t be very wary of any of This American involvement, because what the Americans really want to do is ethnically cleanse all of us out of Gaza. So they’re digging in. They’re trying to figure out how do we maintain our presence, how do we make sure that if there is some kind of an American or Israeli suzerainty here, we would launch an insurgency? So I don’t see it as having produced anything particularly good. And it has really reinforced this very, this very strong element within the Israeli right that believes there is a solution to the Palestinian problem, and it is largely ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the West Bank. In Joe Biden, you had the apex of the liberal international order believers. Joe Biden’s whole career in the Senate it was devoted to this quite significantly. He was known for his commitment to these alliances, known for his belief in a muscular liberal internationalism. It was always notable the way, when he was deciding whether or not to stay in the race, the thing that seemed to animate him in that period was NATO. And if not for me, who’s going to protect NATO and the alliances. And they had this vision of American strength through the alliance system, and it led to a world or it coexisted with a world that by the end of his term felt to many people like it had fallen into disorder. You had Russia invading Ukraine. You had the war in Gaza. And you had a sense of American weakness. I mean, some of that was Joe Biden’s inability to personally project strength, whatever you thought of the actual policies. Now, you’ve had Trump come in for a month and the whole world is reshuffling in response to what he says. You have negotiations happening with Moscow. You have mineral deals being signed with Ukraine. You have in Gaza, all of a sudden, for the insanity, in my view of Trump’s actual proposal, I am hearing more serious proposals from the Arab countries than I was before. Yet Yair Lapid, one of the opposition leaders in Israel, had a reasonable I thought, proposal of wiping out Egyptian foreign debt in return for Egypt taking over rebuilding and governance of Gaza for a period of time. The sense that the world is responding to American strength. Did Democrats fumble this in their belief that a restrained America was a strong America, that more did not need to be projected? Did they leave the opening for someone like Trump, who said, there’s all this surplus power and the American public is going to respond to seeing someone come pick it up, that the sense of the world should respond to America, that we should be feared by our friends and our enemies alike, had been dismissed. I’ve heard this from people involved in the Middle East conflict. Nobody feared Joe Biden. Look, I think that there’s no question the United States had enormous power. Again, I say it contradicts the central premise of the Trump Vance domestic argument, which is that America has been hollowed out and ravaged over the last 30 years by the forces of globalization and liberalism. In fact, the real story of the last 30 years is the United States has emerged dominant among the rich countries in the world. And they seem to envy the political systems of countries that are in terrible shape. right. Hungry Russia, China, which is seeing its growth rates fall. They have a lot of envy of systems that you would not want to emulate. China doesn’t have a trade deficit. And look at China. Like that’s not a country you would want to emulate the economy of. So there is a kind of weird contradiction. But I agree with you. The United States has enormous power, and I don’t think that it is a sign of strength to go around bullying smaller countries and forcing them to say, things that are often kind of rhetorical concessions get everyone to call it the Gulf of America get the Panamanians are a good example. The guy who was running Panama now is a very pro-American conservative, and he’s now been humiliated and made to mouth some kind of nonsense that allows Trump to claim he got a victory. Same thing happened with Canada and Mexico. I’m going to do it because I want to push you to the strong examples here, the strong counterexamples, which is to say that I Jake Sullivan, on this show and we were talking about Ukraine and we were talking about Israel, and I would say the view that emerged from him is that it would be immoral to use American leverage to push our allies into negotiations in Ukraine, to force Israel to have done really anything differently in Gaza, and that as soon as Trump came on the scene, it turned out people would listen. Like the hostage deal got signed and Yahoo dropped some objections they move forward on to some kind of ceasefire. You had negotiations. Not in the way I would like to see them had preconceiving. Functionally, everything to Moscow is, in my view, fundamentally immoral. But the level at which the Biden administration would not push its own allies and did not act like it had leverage over someone like Zelenskyy, was strange. By the end, you could tactically say there are some cases where they didn’t handle it well. I for many, many months was criticizing the Biden administration. On the russia-ukraine front. I thought that it was important to get more realistic on Israel. It’s a particular dynamic that you well, which is that for a Democratic president, it is very hard to push the Israelis to do anything, because they know they can outflank a Democrat by going directly to Congress, by going directly to essentially to Republicans. Bibi Netanyahu did that to Barack Obama, who was a much more skilled politician and negotiator than Joe Biden was. And when Obama tried to push him on the Iran nuclear thing, Bibi just did an end run around Obama, went to Washington, got the Republicans to invite him to give a joint speech to the joint session of Congress and completely kind of tied Obama in knots on that one. So that is a particular problem. But I agree with you that tactically, there are some places where you could push harder, if you ask me, which philosophy is the right one for the United States to have. I think it’s the one that has built these alliance structures in this system for 80 years by not viewing this as a series of transactions, but as a relationship. Trump is a transaction guy. Think about every real estate deal he’s ever done. At the end of the day, the person. He does the deal with never wants to deal with him again. I mean, that is basically one of the leitmotifs of Trump’s business career. He screws you in the deal and then moves on and the next time around screws somebody else. But that’s not what American foreign policy has been built on. It’s been built on these alliances and these relationships that have endured now for almost a century. And by the way, very few countries have managed that. So Trump, by strong arming of a few people, a few of these countries will get, in the short term, a better deal. Again, we’re very powerful. We’re very rich. But is that going to build real trust for the next 40, 50 years. I don’t think so. It’s going to give Trump a few good headlines. And by the way, on the Gaza thing, I think it’s important to remember, because I’ve spent time in a lot of time in the Middle East over the last nine months or so. I’ve been to Saudi Arabia 3 times 4 times. They were always willing to pay for the reconstruction. The idea that the Trump’s bizarre Gaza proposal has gotten the Saudis and the Egyptians to be ready to be involved is not true. The issue has always been who will govern Gaza. And that was the Israelis say it can’t be any Hamas involvement. The Arabs say, look, if it’s going to be no Hamas involvement, then you have to allow the Palestinian Authority to do it. And the Israelis say no. And the Israeli response is, why can’t the Arabs do it. Well, the Arabs don’t want to be in the position of ruling over the Palestinians. They don’t want to be in a position where Hamas launches an insurgency against them. That has been the sticking point, not the money. They’ve always been willing to pay the money. And by the way, that will continue to be the sticking point. That is the hard part of the Gaza business, not getting the Saudis and the UAE to pony up the cash. The thing that I think I’m pushing towards here is not, is Trumpism the right long term strategy for the US, but assuming the system survives the next couple of years, which in the range of possibilities. I don’t think is 100 percent I don’t think it’s 100 percent domestically, and I don’t think it’s 100 percent internationally. I think there’s a question of there being thesis, antithesis, synthesis, dynamics to where things probably need to go. I think that with Doge, where Democrats were accepting, I mean, I have a whole book on this coming out, but Democrats are accepting of huge levels of government proceduralism obstruction, the inability of government to deliver or be responsive. They became defenders of government. Now you have a group heedlessly taking chainsaws, trying to actually wreck the thing in a way I consider immoral and genuinely dangerous. But I think for to find some stable equilibrium, Democrats are going to have to take some lessons from this. Not just say we were right before you guys should have listened to us. And the way I think we now understand that center left parties, kind of in Europe and in America, had adopted positions on immigration that were politically unstable. And they don’t need to go all the way to where the far right is, but they can’t be where they were if they’re going to win power. Is there some ways in which lessons need to be learned here, for there to be an effective center left answer, or even a left answer or liberal answer to what this set of challenges represents. Is there some dissatisfaction with how the system is working, either from the American perspective or the International perspective that needs to be integrated. Even if you find, as many of us do where Trump is going. Immoral Yeah. Look, the left is collapsed everywhere. I mean, if you look at Europe, the real story of the European elections over the last, 10 years is the collapse of the left. The French left has collapsed. The German left has collapsed. If you look, Holland, wherever you look, Sweden was run by the Swedish social Democrats for 75 years, and they were in trouble. And I think it’s principally over the issue of immigration. As I’ve been hard line on immigration. I think the whole system is. The asylum system needs to be scrapped. And the fact that the left was not willing to frontally acknowledge that you had millions of people coming in who were obviously gaming the system, claiming to be asylum seekers when they were really economic migrants. I think the left is paying a huge price for that everywhere, and they will continue to pay a price for that because even now it will feel like catch up. When they do it on the international side, I don’t think there was any such deep dissatisfaction with the international system as it exists. I think to a large extent, Trump’s grievances around it that have exploited it. But he taps into a certain kind of American jacksonianism that says, why are we entangled with these people. Why the United States has always had two fundamental attitudes. One, we are too good to participate in the world, or we are so good that we should completely transform the world. But to actually engage in the world as it exists has always been difficult for the United States because it’s an ideological nation. It believes it is exceptional and all that. And I think you see some of that in the Trump attitude. I think the point you made about Europe is the principal place where I would say there was a lesson to learn, that we had gotten too complacent about the Western Alliance, and we had gotten too complacent about Europe’s foreign policy dysfunctions. And I think in some ways, Trump’s willingness to say the I think the unthinkable and say the unsayable like he’s said, for example, maybe we should make a deal with Iran. He went in his first term and tried to make a deal with Kim Jong Un. I those things I actually do find refreshing because why not try to see if there’s a way you could make a deal with Kim Jong Un. Why not see if there’s a way. I think all these things are low probabilities of success, but there is something to be said for of thinking out of the box or in some way or the other. I feel like with Trump, the danger is not the thinking out of the box part. The danger is he doesn’t value that the box we created is a pretty special box, and it’s been very hard in human history to find an era of peace and prosperity and great power, stability of the kind we have been able to create. So before we have this kind of Maoist nihilism and say, let’s burn the whole thing down and see where it goes. Let’s appreciate the box. How does the destruction of USAID fit into this in one way or another. I think it’s been because that got filed under Doge, I think has been treated as less of a foreign policy move than it actually is. They seem to have successfully continued to keep the money pretty cut off in a lot of cases, even in places where say, Marco Rubio seemed to want PEPFAR funding, which is funding for HIV/AIDS medication, particularly in Africa, turned on. And it seems to have not really turned back on. Is this foreign policy. Is this just a kind of internal jihadism against what they see as the liberal nonprofit industrial complex. What do you. What is the import of what they’ve done to USAID and what is to the best you believe they have it or the rationale for it. So I’ve thought about this a lot, because why would you choose usaid? It’s 1 percent of the federal budget. If you were able to change some of the uploading mechanisms in Medicare Advantage, you’d probably save more money than in reforming USAID. Medicare is $1 trillion, Social Security is a trillion and a half dollars. USAID is about $40 billion. And they don’t seem to be reforming it. They’re annihilating it. So I think what happened is if there’s thought behind it, there must have been Musk. And companies said, what is the least popular form of spending that the US does. And Marco Rubio alluded to this. It’s obviously foreign aid. You’re sending money to foreigners. People feel like, why shouldn’t we be spending it at home. It’s easy. So I think that was the idea. Let’s go for an easy win. Let’s go for something where particularly our base, the megabase. And most Americans in general think this is a waste of government spending. And they went at it with a brutality. I think to send a signal to other government agencies don’t block us. This is how this is what will happen to you if you try to in some way or the other, do an end run around what we’re doing. The look, the effect to my mind is tragic because there’s this geopolitical argument that this is the soft power of the United States. We go into these countries and people think, well of America. Now the Chinese are going to go in and the Russians are going to go in. I believe all that. But I think it’s I wouldn’t it’s put it in those competitive terms to sell it and I get it. But, it’s been one of the wonderful things that the United States has done in the world. Foreign aid barely existed before 1945. It’s again one of these revolutions of foreign policy that America in large part initiated. And I think it is largely the impulse comes from the idea we’re the richest country in the history of the world. It would it’s also be a great thing for us to be the most generous country in the history of the world 4 out of every 10 humanitarian dollars spent in the world are spent by the United States, and most of USAID’s budget is food and medicine. You’re literally feeding the hungry. You’re clothing sick people. I’ve seen this on the ground. The people who do work at USAID, these are people who move to Mozambique or Ghana to learn how to get water filtration systems in there. They’re getting paid 60, $70,000 a year. They’re not doing it for the money. They’re not doing it for the glory. They’re doing it because they believe that the United States can have a kind of positive impact on the world. And to see the agency gutted, the funding pulled. And these people demeaned and demonized, called a criminal enterprise. It’s so sad. I grew up in India, and I saw so much of the USAID funding, which was exactly the kind of stuff that Doge demonizes, which was to say, I mean, there was a program where they would show old American movies at the US. Consulate, and a whole bunch of us would go there. And I remember, I mean, I went to I saw it’s a wonderful life and movies like that. And you know what it did have it made me fall in love with America. It made I think that’s always been America’s great strength, which is that it’s the Chinese who do these deals with an African country and with the dictator and say, we’ll build you a dam. And in return for that, here’s what we want. And by the way, you can take 10 percent what American soft power has been. We let the world know who we are. We let the world know that we’re a big, open, generous country. And some of that is funding plays and movies, and some of it is, and most of it is food and medicine. And I was always a matter of great pride to me that the United States did that. And it’s very sad that, for now at least, gone away. I think it also gets to what is America first. And one of the things that I actually think it is a total devaluing of non-American lives. We were talking you were saying a minute ago how USAID is being Musk calls it. What was it, a ball of worms. It’s like no worms in the Apple, just a ball of worms. So that’s a horrible thing to say about I know people who work in aid like you do. Musk is a billionaire who Jets around the world fathering children with Lord knows how many women and tweeting sending missives on X 300 times a day. And these people who went to amazing schools go work on, marginally improving economic growth by making the textile sector more efficient in Ghana. So it just it appalls me. But at least the Americans who are working for USAID exist in the calculus the administration hates them and wants to demonize them and wants them to go to the private sector where they’ll be more productive. But the kids who the children who needed PEPFAR funding the antiretrovirals from PEPFAR. They don’t exist in the conversation here at all. And it’s always, I think, a difficult thing from the perspective of a nation, right, which does have a preference for its own citizens. Like, how should you think about an economic migrant who’s any individual economic migrants. Life would be much better off if they could come to the US. And for reasons of stability and the economy, you can’t let everybody who would like to come to the US and how do you value that. It’s a really hard question. And we don’t have I think, very good answers. And we tack forward and backward. How do you value like people we say, from dying of malnutrition. The answers have been complex, not always really debated, but somewhat. We value those lives somewhat. It’s not how we think about Americans, but it’s not nothing. And I kind think one of the messages here is it’s nothing like the value of foreign lives is nothing. The value of people in the West Bank whose land is going to be annexed is nothing our care about. The Ukrainians is nothing, right. And I think that’s some of the message of it, too, particularly domestically, that USAID was about spending American money to not really serve our interests. First and foremost, I think you’re right to say that when we say it’s really about our soft power, not truly telling the truth anymore. It’s about expressing our values, which is that other Lives Matter. And practically, if those cost effective ways we can help them, we should. And the message here is they don’t and we shouldn’t. I think that one of the ironies here is that I do believe, as you do, that it was American aid was never entirely about geopolitics and ","summary":"The journalist Fareed Zakaria discusses the worldview emerging from Trump’s foreign policy decisions regarding Ukraine, Gaza, China and beyond.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010014531/the-dark-heart-of-trumps-foreign-policy.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/25/opinion/01eks-zakaria-image/25eks-gurri-video-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 12:00:12","author":"Fareed Zakaria","authors":["Fareed Zakaria"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":295625216,"title":"Whether Europe Or Oval Office, JD Vance Takes Up Attacking Role For Trump","text":"The meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was becoming contentious on Friday when Vice President JD Vance, sitting on a couch across from Trump in the Oval Office, weighed in with a zinger.\"With respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance told Zelenskiy, who had just challenged Trump's No. 2 to explain what he meant by advocating for diplomacy with Russia.\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance snapped.Though the extraordinary White House meeting put tensions between Zelenskiy and Trump on public display, it also showcased Vance's increasing role as an attacker of sorts for his boss.Democrats accused the White House of setting up Zelenskiy with the Oval Office onslaught, but a source familiar with the meeting said Vance's encounter with the Ukrainian leader was \"not planned.\"Vance, 40, a potential heir to Trump's Make America Great Again political movement, has served as a loyal lieutenant to the president since they came into office a little over a month ago.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");The former senator from Ohio has also carved out a spot as a sharp-tongued defender of the commander-in-chief, elevating him among other Trump lieutenants, including billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading the president's charge to cut what they see as government waste.\"This was the flexing of JD Vance.

As during his first term, Trump – a wealthy businessman and celebrity – has surrounded himself with a mix of conventional Republican politicians, Wall Street financiers and economic nationalists.\nThis time, these groups have been joined by members of the techno-right, represented most glaringly by Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest person.\nWhat unites these groups, at least for the time being, is not Trump’s character or his leadership – both of which leave much to be desired. Rather, it is the belief that their specific agendas will be better served under Trump than under the most likely alternative.\nConservative Republicans want low taxes and less regulation, while economic nationalists want to close the trade deficit and restore US manufacturing. Free-speech absolutists want to end what they see as “woke censorship”, while the techno-right wants a free hand to enact its vision of the future.\nThese groups all regarded Kamala Harris (and Joe Biden) as a hindrance and Trump as a promising ally. Most do not oppose democracy per se but they do seem willing to overlook, and hence facilitate, Trump’s authoritarianism so long as their agenda is served.\nPress them on Trump’s anti-democratic impulses and contempt for the rule of law, and they will equivocate or minimise the risks.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, I shared my concerns about him with one of his leading economic advisers (an economic nationalist). But my interlocutor pooh-poohed my worries and countered that Democrats and the administrative state were the more serious threats. Ultimately, he was interested in his boss’s commitment to tariffs, not any of the possible consequences for democracy.\nSimilarly, on a recent episode of New York Times journalist Ezra Klein’s podcast, free-speech absolutist Martin Gurri explained that his support for Trump was driven mainly by the Biden administration’s clampdown on free expression. Biden had “basically told the [social media] platforms: You have to adhere to European standards of good behaviour online”, Gurri claimed.\nYet the restrictions Trump has placed on speech by civil servants and government-funded private entities are far more egregious. Even as he concedes Trump might end up “being even worse”, Gurri seems unfazed. When push comes to shove, it is apparently more important to decimate woke culture than to uphold the First Amendment.\nWith Trump’s elite supporters prioritising their narrow agendas over democratic principles, the risk of a slide towards authoritarianism should be obvious. Fortunately, the even more likely outcome is these competing agendas will soon clash, causing the Trump coalition to implode.\nThe sharpest lines of conflict are between the economic nationalists and techno-right. Both see themselves as anti-system and want to disrupt a regime they feel has been imposed by Democratic Party elites. But they embody very different visions of America and where it should be going.\n\nThe economic nationalists want to return to a mythical past marked by American industrial glory, whereas the tech camp envisions an AI-administered utopian future.\nOne is populist, the other elitist. One has faith in the wisdom and common sense of ordinary people, the other only in technology. One wants to stop immigration across the board, the other welcomes skilled newcomers. One is parochial, the other essentially globalist. One wants to break up Silicon Valley, the other to empower it. One believes in soaking the rich and the other in spoon-feeding them.\nThe nationalist-populists claim to speak for the people Musk’s envisioned technological revolution would leave behind. So it is not surprising they hold Silicon Valley’s “technofeudalists” in deep contempt. Steve Bannon, a leading voice among the economic nationalists (and a graduate of Harvard Business School, of course), has gone so far as to call Musk a “parasitic illegal immigrant”.\nMusk and what he represents must “be stopped”, Bannon warns. “If we don’t stop it … now, it’s going to destroy not just this country, it’s going to destroy the world.”\n\nWhile Bannon does not serve in the Trump administration, he is a major figure in the Maga (“Make America Great Again”) movement, and he maintains close ties with many top administration staffers. Yet it is clear Musk has Trump’s ear. The White House has given free rein to Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), and Trump has encouraged Musk to be more aggressive.\nIt is typical of personalistic leaders, like Trump, to pit allies (courtiers, really) against each other so none amasses too much power. Trump undoubtedly thinks he can stay on top and leverage the conflicts for his advantage. But such tactics work best when the competition among different groups is over government resources and rents, rather than reflecting different ideologies and belief systems.\nGiven the vastly different world views and policy preferences of the forces animating the Trump administration, a showdown is all but inevitable. But what would come after? Will there be paralysis or will one of the groups assert its dominance? Will the Democrats be able to capitalise on the rift? Will Trumpism be disgraced? Will the prospects for American democracy be revived or diminished even further?\nRegardless of the outcome, the tragedy is that the less-educated working-class voters who flocked to Trump’s anti-elitist message will remain the losers. None of the contending wings of Trump’s coalition offers a compelling vision for them. This applies even to the economic nationalists (their rhetoric notwithstanding), whose aspirations hinge on an unrealistic revival in manufacturing jobs.\nAs different elites fight for their versions of America, the urgent policy agenda needed to create a middle-class economy in a post-industrial society will remain as distant as ever.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate","summary":"The competing agendas of Trump’s elite supporters are clashing, with the sharpest conflict between the economic nationalists and techno-right.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3300675/musk-bannon-trumps-rabble-backers-are-heading-brawl","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/01/445297e7-c325-4052-8c3a-25ad8447f818_b3a8c14c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 11:00:09","author":"Dani Rodrik","authors":["Dani Rodrik"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":295605318,"title":"Democrats are lawyering themselves into political oblivion: Time to change that","text":"I'm a lawyer. When I look at Democrats today, I see myself. That's not a good thing.\n\nLet's consider the 2024 presidential campaign. Democrats appeared to adopt the classic lawyer tactic of saying, \"My client didn’t do anything.\" There’s good reason this has become a cliché: You win in court by showing that your client followed the law and the other guy didn’t. Which is why as a lawyer, you do everything in your power to make it seem like your client was off flying kites with his kids or staring out the window at pretty clouds while the other guy was doing the most.\n\nIn other words, you try to make your client seem like Kamala Harris and the other guy seem like Donald Trump.\n\nAs a lawyer, you also always put the focus on the opposition. If you talk too much about your own client, that might encourage people to look too closely and begin to notice their flaws. So you make your client’s story all about the person across the aisle: It’s hardly ever about \"my client did good\" and almost always about \"my opponent did bad.\" That’s exactly what the Democrats did last year, seeking to undermine the opposition’s case (\"Here are all the reasons Trump is bad\") instead of building their own case (\"Here are all the reasons Harris is good\"). \n\nThere was a moment in the campaign — right after Joe Biden backed out of the race — when that dynamic shifted and Democrats actually kept the focus on themselves. For one brief, brilliant month in the summer of 2024, as Harris commanded the media’s attention and united the delegates and the party insiders at once, we watched as her apparent political awkwardness suddenly revealed itself to be far-thinking craftiness, and her “kooky” demeanor transformed from a liability into a surprisingly effective tool to paint a vision of America that was thrillingly non-apocalyptic. For one exhilarating moment, the campaign felt upbeat and exciting — \"Make America Fun Again!” — and the story was all about her.\n\nBut like any good lawyer — and Harris is unquestionably a good one — she then put the focus back on her opponent. And the Democrats’ vision of the future once again became negative — in other words, all about what it wasn’t, rather than what it was or what it might be. And to be fair, that’s not a bad courtroom strategy against an opponent who is almost pathologically predisposed to putting his foot in his mouth. \n\nHere’s the funny thing about voting, though: It doesn’t happen in court.\n\nThe similarities didn’t stop there. Democrats seemed intent on avoiding policy specifics, while also pronouncing a series of vaguely progressive policy goals. That was another classic lawyer move: Keep your positions just specific enough to point out the other side’s flaws, and just vague enough that it’s hard to attack them in court. \n\nWhen you’re a lawyer, you also never want to make it sound like you’re saying something dramatically different from what people have said before, because you win with a judge by showing that what you’re asking for is consistent with existing law. In a campaign, that line of argument almost makes itself when your candidate for president is also the current vice president. \n\nAnd no matter what, as a lawyer, you stick close to the facts. You don’t say anything unless you have the evidence to back it up. Because if you can’t point to that evidence when the judge asks you for it, you lose. Democrats did this at a highly professional level, building their messaging almost entirely around facts that not even Republicans would dispute (e.g., Trump says wild things, many of which aren’t true). It didn’t make a lick of difference.\n\nHere’s the bottom line: In 2024, the Democrats ran a campaign out of a lawyer’s wet dream, and Kamala Harris seemed like the perfect client, painting a picture of a future that didn’t offend anyone. And it changed absolutely nobody’s mind. Trump was a client who would give any good lawyer nightmares (and surely has done so). His vision of the future was chaotic and offensive. And he won. \n\nThe thing about lawyers is that we’re great at being lawyers and terrible at virtually everything else. This is partially by design: Lawyering is a specialized profession that requires a real depth of knowledge. But some of it is also by circumstance, since lawyers often work in environments that consist roughly 99% of other lawyers. While there are certainly benefits to this kind of specialization, there are drawbacks too: an inherently narrow viewpoint; an unwillingness to take the opinions of non-lawyers seriously; and a reluctance to acknowledge that the letter of the law is not the only thing that matters.\n\nThese drawbacks are particularly glaring when it comes to running, and winning, a presidential campaign.\n\nAs a lawyer, I buy what Democrats are selling. But as a voter, I don’t. Because as a voter, I want to feel like my vote has power. And you don’t demonstrate power with dry, technical arguments; you demonstrate power by making people feel. Even now, I don’t really know what it would feel like to live in the Democrats’ world, except that it’s not Trump’s. And even though that “not Trump” vision certainly has its appeal, on an emotional level, it’s hard to get excited about not going somewhere. \n\nBy contrast, what Trump did better in this election was painting an affirmative vision of what the world could be like, and making people feel like it was real. That’s why I can understand why people voted for him (even if it’s a separate question entirely whether they’re getting what they hoped for). Because if you want to feel like your vote has the power to change the world, you vote for the person who makes you feel like they can do that And it’s hard to dispute that Trump makes you feel like he’s changing the world. \n\nMoreover, unlike Biden — who, despite significant policy accomplishments, was rather lackluster at making me feel the scope of those accomplishments — Trump will never let us forget what it feels like to have him in charge. The first month of his administration has made that obvious: It is difficult to do literally anything without being reminded of him. That feeling will be a big part of American life for the next four years — and that is exactly the point. \n\nDemocrats, who now understandably appear to be overwhelmed, seem to be taking refuge in the facts. In other words, they’re falling back on the real legal weakness behind much of what’s been happening in Washington since Jan. 20. They are accurately pointing out that many of Trump’s executive orders constitute a dramatic overreach of the executive branch’s constitutional authority; that the judiciary is already issuing injunctions against some of his more egregious initiatives; that in spite of the inarguable erosion of political norms over the last decade, there are still checks and balances left in American government that can and should be leveraged to stop him. \n\nThey’re not wrong about any of that. But they’re also missing the point. \n\nFacts are great when you’re a lawyer in court or when you’re a wonk writing policy briefs and refining legislative language. But when you’re trying to convince people to buy into a possible future, facts don’t really matter. What matters is offering people an affirmative story — not a reactive one, not a story whose climax is “at least we’re not him” — and being able to sell it. Facts and policy can certainly serve as proof-points for that story, but they can’t be the story itself. And while Trump’s initiatives are unquestionably flawed from a legal standpoint, from a storytelling standpoint, they are flawless. This isn’t about the next four years anymore — it’s about the years after that, in this country and elsewhere. That’s what Trump seems to understand instinctively.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nGood governing takes good lawyers. But good politics — and especially good presidential campaigns — takes bad ones. Governing and campaigning are fundamentally unrelated skills. Like too many lawyers, Democrats seem to believe that only the governing part matters, and that the kinds of lawyerly arguments that work well in courts are also going to work well with the public. \n\nIn normal litigation, the existence of the courtroom itself is not at stake. The courtroom’s presence is physical and immutable, and no matter what happens on any given day in the course of a lawsuit, lawyers from both sides will have to walk into that same courtroom the following day and play by the same rules. But in a presidential election like the one we just had, and likely the next one as well, the existence of the system itself is exactly what’s at stake. It’s not about which side leaves the courtroom with a win; it’s about what the courtroom will look like the next time around, or whether that courtroom will still be there at all. That’s why being a good, risk-averse lawyer — where, by definition, you take the law as a given — is an incredibly risky strategy in a presidential campaign, particularly one where both sides have ratcheted up the stakes to existential levels. Because if you’re telling people that the future of the courtroom itself is in doubt, you also need to tell them what the new one should look like, or they’re going to vote for the person who does.\n\nTrying to create a new future takes boldness. It takes risk. It takes imagining a world that does not yet exist and making it feel like it does. In other words, it takes a whole host of qualities entirely alien to the lawyerly mind. If Democrats want people to start buying into the future they’re selling, they’ll have to become worse lawyers and better storytellers. If they can’t do that, the party of lawyers might have no future at all.","summary":"As a lawyer, I understand the Democratic Party all too well.

Aside from all being famous, they were at this year's Upfront Summit, the glitzy annual invite-only conference hosted by Upfront Ventures that aspires to be nothing like most of the stodgy events dotting the conference circuit.The summit is held at a unique location yearly, such as the Rose Bowl, Malibu Farm, or the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. This year's event was at the Intuit Dome, the new arena in Inglewood, CA, that is home to the NBA Clippers. There was pickup basketball at lunch, two illuminated hoops on the stage, and booming speaker introductions by the Clippers' public address announcer.Though the theme was ostensibly basketball, the more overriding one onstage and in conversations at couches and tables on the outskirts of the area was the uneasy duality of the current tech market. On the one hand, venture investors are enamored of generative AI, which many see as a once-in-a-generation moneymaking bonanza bigger than the mobile phone. Megafunds like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst keep raising billions more to pile into the biggest AI startups.\"This is a unique moment,\" said Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark who backed startups like Uber and Zillow, in an interview on stage. \"AI is the exact event every founder and [general partner] dreams of.\"On the other hand, most VCs have been unable to return much capital to their limited partners because the IPO market has been slow to recover, and the M&A market has been quiet. Many startups have been going out of business as capital runs dry. There is also widespread concern those megafunds could be bad for the industry.\"I am a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist,\" said Pat Grady, partner at Sequoia Capital, in an on-stage interview. \"I think we're going to have a culling of the herd because people got away from the original spirit of venture capital, which is helping founders build legendary companies, and they got into the asset management business.\"General partners in a less enviable position than Grady pony up thousands of dollars to attend Upfront, and they are not paying for the food (which is always excellent) or the speakers (mostly top-caliber). Their return on investment is meeting the endowment heads and chief investment officers from places like the University of Michigan and Mizuho, who can write checks into their next fund.Getting those LPs to make commitments proved frustratingly slow again this year, especially for less-established players, according to multiple VCs and LPs I spoke to at the conference. Two LPs said they were impressed by the many funds they met with, but when I asked which funds they would invest in, they said they were not deploying any capital right now.As the gravity of tech has been moving rightward with Donald Trump's return to the White House, the Upfront Summit retained its bluer, California vibe. There were appearances from Chelsea Clinton and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who received a frosty reception from some in the audience still upset about his handling of last month's catastrophic wildfires in LA.

Paris Hilton closed out the summit with Tim Cadogan, CEO of GoFundMe, and a somber panel on rebuilding.Afterward, investors, founders, and limited partners mingled over tacos, BBQ chicken, and funnel cake at a glitzy closing party on the Clippers' hardwood court.

British singer Charli XCX could never have dreamt that her latest album would generate such global hype, but as music journalist Michael Cragg tells us, \"She's now one of the UK's biggest exports, and the Brat craze captured people's imaginations in a way we hardly ever see nowadays.\"\n\nBrat was said to be a rejection of the \"clean girl\" aesthetic, with Charli herself explaining, \"It can be like, so trashy. Just like a pack of cigs and a Bic lighter. And like, a strappy white top with no bra.\" It went even further than that, and as music business writer Rhian Jones says, \"The marketing around Brat was so smart that people interpreted it however they wanted to.\"\n\nIt was symbolised by a shade of slime green, which during summer 2024 was all the rage in everything from fashion to hair and makeup, and even home decor. \"The colour was a way of rejecting the status quo and turning everything upside down,\" adds Rhian. \"Charli has always done her own thing and doesn't care if some people see her as a bit weird. She just pushes ahead with self-confidence and determination.\"\n\nThough the Brat effect seemed to transform Charli, 32, into a household name almost overnight, she had in fact been in the music industry for 15 years. She was born Charlotte Emma Aitchison in Cambridge to a Scottish father and Indian mother, who she persuaded to loan her money aged 14 so she could begin recording songs.\n\n\"I always felt like a loser,\" she later said. \"I had friends, but my school was full of blonde white girls and I was this half-Indian girl with frizzy hair and different interests. That always made me feel a little bit rejected. I thought if I made music, people would think I was interesting.\"\n\nAfter posting her music to MySpace, she was spotted by a club promoter and began DJing at illegal raves in London – which her parents would drive her to. \"My dad was really into it,\" she recalled. \"We arrived at, like, 9pm and they just stood at the back of the sweatbox with all the hipsters.\"\n\nCharli, who signed her first record deal with Asylum Records when she was 16, released a string of singles and mixtapes, and in 2012 collaborated with Icona Pop on I Love It, her first UK No1. Her debut album True Romance arrived in April 2013, but peaked at a lowly number 85. Her second album Sucker was recorded in Sweden and more successful upon release in late 2014, with the single Boom Clap reaching No6 in the UK and featuring on The Fault In Our Stars soundtrack.\n\nDescribing the album as more \"pop-oriented\", she said she \"wanted to write an album that I would've been obsessed with when I was 14\". As her profile grew, she jumped at the chance to support Taylor Swift on her Reputation Stadium Tour in May 2018, alongside Camila Cabello. \"It was fun to perform Shake It Off with her and Camila every night, and learn how to move across the stage like an actual pop star,\" she enthused.\n\nThree further albums followed, beginning in September 2019 with Charli, which featured collaborations with Lizzo, Christine and the Queens, and Haim. Then came How I'm Feeling Now in May 2020, which Charli wrote in six weeks during the pandemic. In March 2022 she released Crash, which aimed to challenge what she called the \"vanilla palatable flatness\" of pop music. The tactic worked, as it was her first album to reach No1 in the UK.\n\n\"The pop world was quite homogenised before, and it was all sounding quite similar,\" says Michael. \"Everyone seemed afraid to say much, but Charli came along and made things more fun – and a bit chaotic.\" However, prior to the release of Crash, she revealed on social media that she was struggling behind the scenes. \"I've been grappling quite a lot with my mental health the past few months and obviously it makes negativity and criticism harder to handle when I come across it,\" she posted.\n\nShe added that she would step away from the platform for a while, as \"I can't really handle it here right now\". A few months later, she not only co-headlined Coachella in the US, but also contributed to the Barbie soundtrack with Speed Drive, which became her sixth UK top 10 single. And when Brat finally arrived in June 2024, it debuted at No2 in the UK album chart and produced a raft of hits like Von Dutch, 360 and Apple, which prompted its own viral dance.\n\nAs the #bratsummer trend exploded, millions of videos were posted on TikTok and it was even used by Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign. Reflecting on the movement, Charli told Zane Lowe on Apple Music that \"a kind of a monoculture moment happened, which we don't see a lot of in this day and age\". Though she described the album as her \"most aggressive and confrontational\", she also called it her most vulnerable, and its personal topics included motherhood, relationships and self-identity.\n\n\"While a party album, it's also incredibly reflective and messy, and shows how relationships with friends or partners can be complex and difficult,\" Michael says. Bratmania shot off the scale when deluxe and remix editions of the album landed, bringing collaborations with big-name artists including Robyn, Troye Sivan, Kesha and Bon Iver, as well as Billie Eilish, who featured on the No1 hit Guess.\n\nAriana Grande guested on Sympathy Is A Knife, while singer Lorde also made an appearance on the Girl, So Confusing reboot, which was widely seen as confirmation that the pair had resolved a rumoured rift. While promoting Brat last June, Charli played an epic Glastonbury set, but it's fair to say her popularity had far outgrown the 7,000-capacity Silver Hayes field.\n\n\"She will almost certainly be a headliner next time she's invited back,\" says Michael. \"It's great that she has taken off in this way, six albums into a career that wasn't always mainstream.\" One of Charli's secret weapons in the making of Brat appears to have been her fiancé George Daniel, drummer with The 1975. After they collaborated on the song Spinning in 2021, he was heavily involved as a producer on her latest record.\n\n\"It's funny, I have never been in a relationship with someone that I've worked with, so it's like a whole new dynamic. But it's cool,\" she has said. They confirmed news of their engagement in November 2023, and speaking about their wedding plans on The Howard Stern Show in October, Charli told how they were \"planning it slowly\". She added, \"We just want to be together forever and have a party with our friends, is our vibe.\"","summary":"The huge Brit export famously coined the term Brat Summer, but as hitmaker Charli XCX admits, she could never have dreamt that she'd go from illegal raves to global superstar","url":"https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/inside-charli-xcxs-shocking-past-34678027","image":"https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article34678167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Charli-SOCIAL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 09:57:57","author":"Anna Pointer,Shelley Spadoni","authors":["Anna Pointer","Shelley Spadoni"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":295588888,"title":"Did Biden Blame Obama, Nancy Pelosi For Election Loss?

Matthew Huttle entered the Capitol for about 15 minutes – recording it on video – and agreed to a plea deal that resulted in about six months of prison for him.\n\nDale Huttle, meanwhile, received 30 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to using a long flagpole to jab a police officer protecting the Capitol.\n\nThe Huttles were among more than 1,500 Capitol attackers who were pardoned by Trump on 20 January, his first day back in the Oval Office after retaking it by defeating Kamala Harris in November’s election.\n\nSix days after Trump’s mass clemency, a deputy stopped Matthew Huttle as he drove at 70mph (113km/h) in a 55mph zone near the line between the north-west Indiana counties of Jasper and Pulaski. The deputy told Huttle he would be arrested for being a habitual traffic offender, which prompted the motorist – who had been ordered out of his car – to say: “No, I can’t go to jail for this.”\n\nHuttle later sprinted for his car as the deputy shouted: “No, don’t you do it buddy! No, no, no, no, no!”\n\nThe deputy and Huttle struggled in the latter man’s car. Video captured Huttle shouting: “I’m shooting myself”, and investigators said he “reached in a manner consistent with retrieving a weapon”.\n\nProsecutors said the deputy fired multiple shots at Huttle – mortally wounding him – after seeing him raise a gun. Investigators subsequently found a loaded 9mm pistol as well as additional ammunition inside Huttle’s car, prosecutors also said.\n\n“Based on the evidence … the deputy’s actions were legally justified under Indiana law,” said the statement signed by prosecutor Chris Vawter, which called Huttle’s killing a case of self-defense. “This investigation is now closed, and no charges will be filed.”\n\nAttempts to contact an attorney for Huttle were not immediately successful. In court filings pertaining to the case against him in the January 6 attack, Huttle’s attorney, Andrew Hemmer, claimed that his client was “not a believer in any political cause” and only went to the Capitol that day “because he thought it would be a historic moment”.\n\n“He had nothing better to do after getting out of jail” in connection with a driving violation, Hemmer wrote of Huttle.\n\nThose who criticized the clemency that Trump granted the Capitol attackers included the US’s largest police union, which had endorsed him over Harris, a former prosecutor.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police said in a joint statement with the International Association of Chiefs of Police: “Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety – they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law.”\n\nHuttle was one of multiple pardoned Capitol attackers who have since landed in news headlines over other legal issues.\n\nThat group included a man left facing unresolved charges in Texas of having solicited a minor.\n\nAnother pardoned January 6 participant was rearrested on federal gun charges. And yet another was handed a 10-year prison sentence for killing a woman in a 2022 drunk-driving crash, according to authorities.","summary":"Killing of Matthew Huttle, 42, during traffic stop ‘legally justified’ and will not lead to criminal charges, lawyers say\n\nThe pardoned US Capitol attacker who was shot to death by an Indiana sheriff’s deputy during a traffic stop in January had first told the officer: “I’m shooting myself,” before attempting to retrieve a gun from his car, according to officials as well as newly released video of the encounter.\n\nMatthew Huttle’s killing by the deputy – whose body-worn and dashboard cameras captured video of the traffic stop – was “legally justified” and would not lead to any criminal charges, prosecutors said in a statement published on Thursday.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/pardoned-capitol-rioter-matthew-huttle","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e6b633ef6007f4cfa2c83d5edef0e7def90d06/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 09:00:36","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.584},{"id":295579460,"title":"Trump, Zelenskiy fail to reach deal after White House clash","text":"The US and Ukraine failed to sign a critical minerals agreement after a Friday meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy devolved into a fiery exchange, fracturing relations between the two countries.\n\nTrump took umbrage with Zelenskiy’s doubts that the US president’s efforts to broker a deal with Russia would lead to lasting peace. The Ukrainian leader departed the White House following the public spat, and a planned signing ceremony and press conference were canceled.\n\nUS officials said the minerals deal - which Trump had cast as a necessary step to repay American support as he sought to negotiate an end to the war directly with Russia’s Vladimir Putin - was not signed before Zelenskiy’s departure.\n\n“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump said in a social media post shortly before Zelenskiy left the White House.\n\nThe clash, played in front of the television cameras, is a major setback for Zelenskiy, who was hoping the in-person meeting with Trump would help smooth out his relations with the American president and commit him to stronger backing for his country following his tilt toward Moscow.\n\nInstead, the vicious tone of the exchange is likely to sow further doubt about Ukraine’s ability to stand up to Russia’s three-year invasion as it struggles with manpower on the battlefield and still relies heavily on US military aid. It’s also likely to alarm European allies, who have already been scrambling to fill the void being left by Washington.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader angered Trump and US Vice President JD Vance when he said he did not believe the planned deal would do enough to deter further Russian aggression.\n\n“Putin will never stop and will go further and further,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the Russian leader “hates Ukrainians” and wanted to destroy the country. “We can do it, but it’s not enough,” he added of the deal.\n\nAs Zelenskiy sought to make his point, Trump and Vance lit into the beleaguered leader, suggesting his approach - delivered in the Oval Office - was disrespectful and inhibiting an end to the bloody three-year war.\n\n“It’s going to be very hard to do business like this,” Trump said, telling Zelenskiy he was not sure the Ukrainian leader could make a deal. “You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us you don’t have any cards.”\n\n“You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump continued. “And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country - this country - that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should,” he said. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it is going to be pretty.”\n\nThe meeting had been intended as a moment of unity between the leaders, who were set to sign the natural resources agreement, which was designed to satisfy Trump’s concerns that US aid would not be repaid. Trump had touted the agreement as a major commitment from the US to Ukraine as he initially welcomed Zelenskiy to the White House for a high-stakes meeting with stark implications for the fight to repel Russia’s invasion.\n\n“It’s a pathway to peace. It’s a pathway to getting something solved,” Trump said.\n\nThe deal, however, did not offer the explicit security guarantees Zelenskiy had wanted, instead focusing on the economic partnership between the US and Ukraine. Zelenskiy told Trump that Putin had repeatedly violated previous agreements and that Ukraine would never accept a simple ceasefire to conclude the war. He insisted to Trump that the mineral deal was not enough to ensure Ukraine’s security.\n\nPublic clash\n\nThe underlying tension between the leaders was obvious. Trump had his eyes closed and was tapping his fingers as Zelenskiy stressed his concerns about Putin reneging on an agreement. When Trump downplayed the threat of a future attack, the Ukrainian leader shook his head.\n\n“I’m in the middle. I want to solve this thing. I’m for both,” Trump insisted. “It’s wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.”\n\nThen the meeting exploded when Vance, sitting nearby, criticised Zelenskiy’s approach.\n\n“Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that’s trying to prevent the destruction of your country?” Vance asked.\n\nTrump said Zelenskiy had “tremendous hatred” for Putin and suggested that the anger could be inhibiting a deal, while also defending his warm relations with the Russian leader as more likely to yield results.\n\n“I could be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen. I’d be so tough, but you’re never going to get it done that way,” Trump said.\n\nThe leaders also sparred after Zelenskiy suggested Trump did not understand the issue because the US was protected by an ocean, and didn’t face the looming threat from Russia.\n\n“You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong. You’re right now not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,” Trump said.\n\n“Have you said thank you once?” Vance added. The vice president went on to suggest Zelenskiy had campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris with his trip last fall to an ammunition plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country,” Vance admonished.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Zelenskiy in a post to social media thanked Trump, Congress and “the American people.”\n\n“Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he wrote.\n\nMinerals deal\n\nThe fate of the natural resources deal remained in doubt as the meeting broke.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that he did not know what Zelenskiy could do to get the agreement back on track, saying he had committed “one of the great diplomatic own goals in history.”\n\nBessent said it would be up to Trump to decide whether he wants to continue negotiating with Zelenskiy.\n\n“President Trump’s idea was to show that way with the economic deals, to show that we’re more intertwined. And that would be a symbol to the Ukrainian people, to Russian leadership and to the American people and President Zelenskiy blew that up today,” Bessent added. “I’m not sure what he was thinking.”\n\nSpeaking from the White House after the meeting, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president’s, also sought to lay the blame for the Oval Office blow up on Zelenskiy, saying Trump had been “shocked” by their exchange and questioning whether the US could work with the Ukrainian leader again.\n\n“I don’t know that we can ever do business with Zelenskiy again,” Graham said. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”\n\nThe US president on Friday originally called the minerals deal an “exciting moment” and said funds from the deal could also be used for artificial intelligence and military weapons. He reiterated that he would continue military sales to Ukraine.\n\n“We don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it’s going to be a lot of money,” he said.\n\nStill, Trump has downplayed calls for more explicit security guarantees, suggesting the economic ties between Ukraine and the US would suffice to deter Putin from further aggression.\n\n“I think once we make the agreement, that’s going to be 95% of it, it’s not going to go back to fighting,” Trump said. “I’ve spoken with President Putin, and I think, I mean, I feel very strong. I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they’re very serious about it.”\n\n“I’m not worried about security, I’m worried about getting the deal done,” the president added.\n\nZelenskiy’s visit capped a dramatic week that saw both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visit Washington to push Trump to offer US support for a European “backstop” to protect Ukraine from further attacks.\n\nFrance and the UK have discussed deploying a peacekeeping force but any such initiative will require US assistance, but Trump has declined to provide any assurances of US support and cast it as an issue for Europe to deal with.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","summary":"Public spat between Ukrainian and US leaders played out in front of TV cameras","url":"https://www.luxtimes.lu/world/trump-zelenskiy-fail-to-reach-deal-after-white-house-clash/46441639.html","image":"https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/1dckfp-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-visits-the-white-house-34194005.jpeg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-visits-the-white-house-34194005.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 08:37:32","author":"Us President","authors":["Us President"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":295576048,"title":"Ben Lowry: More wildly erratic behaviour from the US president, Donald Trump","text":"This was crystal clear again last evening, as it was emerging that the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky of “gambling with World War Three” as the pair met in the Oval Office. ​Anybody who follows politics closely should be able to pinpoint the moment at which Mr Trump’s extraordinary conduct became obvious for them, and for me it was the 2015 debate among Republican Party contenders for the White House. This was more than a year before the US presidential election which Mr Trump won. Not having followed US version of The Apprentice, in which Mr Trump was an American Alan Sugar, judging the business skills of young would-be entrepreneurs, I was stunned by his unprecedented casual verbal abuse of his rival contestants. Those traits to his character have been exhibited daily since then. It was only relatively recently, on my American trip during last year’s presidential election, that I heard an explanation as to why Mr Trump has been able to get away with such personal nastiness, which no other major presidential contender, let alone actual president, has exhibited in public. The reason is that his dedicated supporters, who make up about a quarter of American voters, liken his political approach to a wrestling match. He says outrageous things but his fans just consider it all part of the sport of his combative approach to politics – he doesn’t really mean it. I know that Trump supporters will read this and dismiss my squeamishness, but these traits are shocking in US president, who not just leads but represents the United States, one of the greatest civilisations in history. I was in America for the 2016 election and thought that Mr Trump would be damaged by adverts that showed kids watching some of Mr Trump’s most abominable statements, and had the slogan: ‘Our children are watching’. In fact Mr Trump has been badly damaged by his conduct, which is why he has massive levels of public disapproval. Also, a large minority of people who vote for him don’t like him. He lost the popular (overall) vote decisively in 2016 to Hillary Clinton (by three million votes), he lost it by a huge margin in 2020 (seven million votes) and he only scraped it this time (the web version of this article will link to an essay I wrote in November about how his victory margin was the third narrowest in terms of vote margin out of the 14 presidential elections of my lifetime). The reason I write all this at such length is that some readers of this column, and indeed some friends of mine, who often agree with me politically, feel dismay at my criticisms of Donald Trump. I, in return, feel dismay that they cannot see how he can’t be relied on in almost any respect as a friend of the west, of the English speaking world (the countries of which should be natural allies, with the exception of Ireland if it prefers to chum around with mainland Europe), of the west, of the UK and certainly of unionism (I not aware of Mr Trump having given unionism any thought in his now quite long life). Recently I was writing about how unpardonable it was for Mr Trump to remove bodyguards from two former close colleagues, Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, of bodyguards, who supported President Trump’s assassination of the General Qasem Soleimani of Iran in 2020, but who later fell out with Mr Trump. That was before the terrifying nonsense he has been speaking about Russia, which got even worse yesterday. Mr Zelensky had warned the US would “feel it in the future” if it did not continue to support Ukraine. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem,” Mr Trump hit back. The exchange began with Vice President JD Vance telling Mr Zelensky: “Mr President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.” Mr Zelensky tried to object, prompting Mr Trump to raise his voice and say: “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people.” “You’re gambling with World War Three, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.” It is true to say that Mr Trump alone has caused Europe to think about spending far more on defence. Vice President Vance has been right to cite the vast amount Europe spends on welfare (I have been writing for years about NI’s massive expenditure on that) while neglecting its defence (Ireland, which has the nerve to sue the UK on its handling of Troubles legacy, is arguably the worst offender, freeloading off that same UK). And I hope that the defeat of the Kamala Harris wing of the Democratic Party last year will usher in a retreat from the insanity of woke extremism on matters such as trans and a belated western regaining of control of our borders from disastrous levels of immigration. But this erratic nonsense about Russia from the US president, who suddenly now seems to support the Chagos surrender, which was set in motion by the sort of meddling international courts that Mr Trump is right to despise, is unsettling, to say the least. • Ben Lowry (@Benlowry2) is News Letter editor","summary":"It is almost superfluous to point out how wildly erratic and unpredictable is Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/columnists/ben-lowry-more-wildly-erratic-behaviour-from-the-us-president-donald-trump-5012920","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjUxMWQ1ODZkLTJmMGYtNDc4Ni04OTdmLTkzMTQxNmEzMDhjYzphYjgyZGI3Mi1iYTFhLTRmYzctODNkZi1lNjQxYjI3OTM2YTk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 08:01:08","author":"Ben Lowry","authors":["Ben Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.041},{"id":295559752,"title":"Trump adorns Oval Office dining room with front pages of The Post ","text":"President Trump has lined the West Wing with the front pages of The Post that chronicle his stunning political comeback. \n\nThe snapshots of history, in the form of commemorative plaques featuring The Post’s distinctive covers, are prominently displayed in Trump’s Oval Office dining room.\n\nPhotographs of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s Feb. 21 swearing-in ceremony released by the White House earlier this week show several of The Post front pages sitting on the mantle above the fireplace in the Oval Office dining room, which is one of a suite of rooms accessed via a private internal corridor from the Oval Office. \n\nMore front-page plaques were also visible on a sideboard in the room, which is often used for working lunches the president has with administration officials and foreign leaders. \n\nThe Post’s coverage of Trump’s “MAGA Square Garden” rally last October and his raucous September 2024 Long Island event, where he pledged to “save New York” are among the front pages the president chose to highlight. \n\nTrump also put up the “‘I shouldn’t be here” cover – his first interview after the Butler, Pa., assassination attempt with The Post’s Michael Goodwin – and the Sept. 16, 2024 front page after the attempt on his life, in Palm Beach, Fla. \n\nThe Post’s Aug. 24, 2024 front page – “A Kennedy Endorses a Republican” – after Trump received the pivotal endorsement of one-time-opponent-turned-Cabinet-secretary Robert F.

British singer Charli XCX could never have dreamt that her latest album would generate such global hype, but as music journalist Michael Cragg tells us, “She’s now one of the UK’s biggest exports, and the Brat craze captured people’s imaginations in a way we hardly ever see nowadays.”\n\nBrat was said to be a rejection of the “clean girl” aesthetic, with Charli herself explaining, “It can be like, so trashy. Just like a pack of cigs and a Bic lighter. And like, a strappy white top with no bra.” It went even further than that, and as music business writer Rhian Jones says, “The marketing around Brat was so smart that people interpreted it however they wanted to.”\n\n It was symbolised by a shade of slime green, which during summer 2024 was all the rage in everything from fashion to hair and makeup, and even home decor. “The colour was a way of rejecting the status quo and turning everything upside down,” adds Rhian. “Charli has always done her own thing and doesn’t care if some people see her as a bit weird. She just pushes ahead with self-confidence and determination.” \n\nThough the Brat effect seemed to transform Charli, 32, into a household name almost overnight, she had in fact been in the music industry for 15 years. She was born Charlotte Emma Aitchison in Cambridge to a Scottish father and Indian mother, who she persuaded to loan her money aged 14 so she could begin recording songs.\n\n“I always felt like a loser,” she later said. “I had friends, but my school was full of blonde white girls and I was this half-Indian girl with frizzy hair and different interests. That always made me feel a little bit rejected. I thought if I made music, people would think I was interesting.”\n\nAfter posting her music to MySpace, she was spotted by a club promoter and began DJing at illegal raves in London – which her parents would drive her to. “My dad was really into it,” she recalled. “We arrived at, like, 9pm and they just stood at the back of the sweatbox with all the hipsters.”\n\nCharli, who signed her first record deal with Asylum Records when she was 16, released a string of singles and mixtapes, and in 2012 collaborated with Icona Pop on I Love It, her first UK No1. Her debut album True Romance arrived in April 2013, but peaked at a lowly number 85. Her second album Sucker was recorded in Sweden and more successful upon release in late 2014, with the single Boom Clap reaching No6 in the UK and featuring on The Fault In Our Stars soundtrack.\n\n Describing the album as more “pop-oriented”, she said she “wanted to write an album that I would’ve been obsessed with when I was 14”. As her profile grew, she jumped at the chance to support Taylor Swift on her Reputation Stadium Tour in May 2018, alongside Camila Cabello. “It was fun to perform Shake It Off with her and Camila every night, and learn how to move across the stage like an actual pop star,” she enthused.\n\nThree further albums followed, beginning in September 2019 with Charli, which featured collaborations with Lizzo, Christine and the Queens, and Haim. Then came How I’m Feeling Now in May 2020, which Charli wrote in six weeks during the pandemic. In March 2022 she released Crash, which aimed to challenge what she called the “vanilla palatable flatness” of pop music. The tactic worked, as it was her first album to reach No1 in the UK.\n\n “The pop world was quite homogenised before, and it was all sounding quite similar,” says Michael. “Everyone seemed afraid to say much, but Charli came along and made things more fun – and a bit chaotic.” However, prior to the release of Crash, she revealed on social media that she was struggling behind the scenes. “I’ve been grappling quite a lot with my mental health the past few months and obviously it makes negativity and criticism harder to handle when I come across it,” she posted. \n\nShe added that she would step away from the platform for a while, as “I can’t really handle it here right now”. A few months later, she not only co-headlined Coachella in the US, but also contributed to the Barbie soundtrack with Speed Drive, which became her sixth UK top 10 single. And when Brat finally arrived in June 2024, it debuted at No2 in the UK album chart and produced a raft of hits like Von Dutch, 360 and Apple, which prompted its own viral dance.\n\nAs the #bratsummer trend exploded, millions of videos were posted on TikTok and it was even used by Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign. Reflecting on the movement, Charli told Zane Lowe on Apple Music that “a kind of a monoculture moment happened, which we don’t see a lot of in this day and age”. Though she described the album as her “most aggressive and confrontational”, she also called it her most vulnerable, and its personal topics included motherhood, relationships and self-identity.\n\n“While a party album, it’s also incredibly reflective and messy, and shows how relationships with friends or partners can be complex and difficult,” Michael says. Bratmania shot off the scale when deluxe and remix editions of the album landed, bringing collaborations with big-name artists including Robyn, Troye Sivan, Kesha and Bon Iver, as well as Billie Eilish, who featured on the No1 hit Guess.\n\nAriana Grande guested on Sympathy Is A Knife, while singer Lorde also made an appearance on the Girl, So Confusing reboot, which was widely seen as confirmation that the pair had resolved a rumoured rift. While promoting Brat last June, Charli played an epic Glastonbury set, but it’s fair to say her popularity had far outgrown the 7,000-capacity Silver Hayes field. \n\n“She will almost certainly be a headliner next time she’s invited back,” says Michael. “It’s great that she has taken off in this way, six albums into a career that wasn’t always mainstream.” One of Charli’s secret weapons in the making of Brat appears to have been her fiancé George Daniel, drummer with The 1975. After they collaborated on the song Spinning in 2021, he was heavily involved as a producer on her latest record.\n\n“It’s funny, I have never been in a relationship with someone that I’ve worked with, so it’s like a whole new dynamic. But it’s cool,” she has said. They confirmed news of their engagement in November 2023, and speaking about their wedding plans on The Howard Stern Show in October, Charli told how they were “planning it slowly”. She added, “We just want to be together forever and have a party with our friends, is our vibe.”\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads","summary":"The huge Brit export famously coined the term Brat Summer, but as hitmaker Charli XCX admits, she could never have dreamt that she'd go from illegal raves to global superstar","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-charli-xcxs-shocking-past-34664634","image":"https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article34677981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MIRROR-Charli.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 07:00:00","author":"Anna Pointer,Shelley Spadoni","authors":["Anna Pointer","Shelley Spadoni"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":295542360,"title":"Vance strongly supports Trump’s foreign policy, leading to a remarkable altercation in the Oval Office.","text":"President Donald Trump, ready to wrap up his Oval Office meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asked for one last question from the reporters gathered in the room.\n\nThat’s when Vice President JD Vance jumped in instead, responding to a previous question about Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin by praising Trump’s diplomatic approach to the war in Ukraine.\n\nHis comments yielded a sharp rejoinder from Zelenskyy, steering an already tense discussion into an unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.\n\nFor the next seven minutes, Vance and Trump exchanged increasingly heated words with their visitor. Vance accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful in the White House, of not being thankful enough for U.S. assistance and of embarking on a “propaganda tour.”\n\nZelenskyy pointedly questioned Vance’s authority on Ukraine, asking if he’d ever been to the country, prompting Vance to reply that he’d “watched and seen the stories.” Then Trump tagged in, coming to his vice president’s defense by demanding that Zelenskyy be more thankful and asserting that the Ukrainian leader was “gambling with World War III.”\n\nIt was, in the words of Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and State Department appointee during Trump’s first term, “a horrible day for the peacemakers.”\n\nIt was also a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer — albeit in a much lighter tone.\n\n“Look, I said what I said,” Vance responded Thursday when a reporter asked him about his comments in Munich that were critical of alleged free speech violations in the United Kingdom.\n\nStarmer replied politely: “In relation to free speech in the U.K., I’m very proud of our history there.”\n\nThe confrontation Friday with Zelenskyy was far frostier — spurred not by a reporter’s question but, according to those close to the vice president, by Vance’s desire to push back on what he believed was Zelenskyy’s inappropriate behavior in a diplomatic environment.\n\n“The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” Vance said after pre-empting Trump’s attempt to field one last inquiry from the media. “We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States’ words mattered more than the president of the United States’ actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That’s what President Trump is doing.”\n\nZelenskyy then asked for and received permission to address Vance directly, noting that Ukraine had previously made diplomatic agreements with Russia that were then violated.\n\n“He killed our people, and he didn’t exchange prisoners,” a visibly agitated Zelenskyy said, referring to Putin, who has been at war with Ukraine for three years. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?”\n\nVance shot back that it was “disrespectful” for Zelenskyy to “come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.” Things only got more tense from there.\n\nAn earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was “very bipartisan and very supportive,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: “That’s what you get for letting Vance in the room.”\n\nA source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor.\n\n“No one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,” said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting.\n\nAnother source familiar with Vance’s thinking going into the meeting said: “I don’t think anyone expected [Zelenskyy] to walk in there and act like such a petulant child.”\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has supported sending aid to Ukraine, called Zelenskyy’s meeting a “complete, utter disaster,” saying that “the way he confronted the president was just over the top.”\n\nGraham also said he was “very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country.”\n\nVance’s long-standing views on Ukraine aid are well-established, and Zelenskyy in the past has made no effort to hide his disapproval of the vice president, having called him “too radical” in an interview last year with The New Yorker, when Vance was running on Trump’s ticket.\n\nOn Friday, Vance called back to a visit Zelenskyy made ahead of last fall’s election to Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania — a trip that Republicans have characterized as a sign of support for the Democratic ticket. Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton and met with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, at the White House.\n\n“You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,” Vance told Zelenskyy. “Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”\n\nThe adversarial tone reminded some observers of Vance’s Munich speech.\n\n“I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that’s important,” Vance said there, addressing European leaders. “But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me … is what exactly you’re defending yourselves for?”\n\nBartlett, who resigned from the first Trump administration on Jan. 6, 2021, over Trump’s response to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, acknowledged that Zelenskyy “may have come in, possibly, with the wrong posture.”\n\n“It just shows how personality is critical to policy, and how one bad meeting, you know, can be so potentially damning in history,” Bartlett said.\n\n“There are plenty that will see Vance as being wildly inappropriate, even stepping over the president,” Bartlett added. “And there are plenty that feel as if Vance said what needs to be said for the past three years.\n\n“And it seems, regardless of where anyone comes down, the vice president was very eager to make this point,” Bartlett continued. “It was an echo of his speech at Munich, it echoes his online persona, and you saw the personification of it now in a critical, tense foreign policy situation.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump, ready to wrap up his Oval Office meeting Friday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vance strongly supports Trump&#8217;s foreign policy, leading to a remarkable altercation in the Oval Office. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/vance-strongly-supports-trumps-foreign-policy-leading-to-a-remarkable-altercation-in-the-oval-office/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Vance-leans-hard-into-Trumps-foreign-policy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 05:44:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":295535892,"title":"Governors And Legislators Take On Local Impediments To New Housing","text":"Montana Governor Greg Gianforte (Photo by Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nAlong with further cutting tax rates, expanding school choice, and reducing the burden of state regulations, lawmakers and governors in many states this year are prioritizing reforms that bring down high housing costs, namely by protecting property rights in a way that facilitates new construction. Lawmakers’ focus on reining in the cost of housing is well-founded.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors estimated in 2021 that nationwide 5.5 million new housing units are needed to meet current demand. Freddie Mac, meanwhile, estimated the housing shortage at 3.8 million units in 2020, while the National Association of Homebuilders estimated the shortage at 1.5 million units in 2021. The Brookings Institute, using an adaptation of Freddie Mac’s methodology, projected that the U.S. housing shortage as Q4 2023 varied “between 3.4 million and 6.4 million units, depending upon the choice of model and vacancy rate.”\n\nThough bills to reduce income tax rates and expand school choice are being filed predominately in red states, reforms aimed at making housing more affordable are gaining traction in both red and blue states. Indicating the potential for bipartisan cooperation on the matter, President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both lamented on the 2024 campaign trail how regulations inflate the cost to build new housing. Though escalating housing costs are getting attention from national politicians, however, most of the policy remedies for addressing the matter must be implemented not by Congress or the White House, but by state legislatures, city halls, and county commissions.\n\nGovernors and legislators recognize that when it comes to making their state as attractive as possible to prospective and existing residents, keeping housing costs down is as important as keeping tax burdens in check. “What matters to movers the most is housing affordability in the destination state,” says the National Association of Realtors.\n\n“States with higher median property value had fewer people moving into them in 2022. In fact, states with the highest property values—Hawaii ($846,470), California ($740,140), and the District of Columbia ($722,318)—all experienced net migration losses, with California losing the most people that year,” the NAR added. “These are crucial results, as they indicate that people would be willing to compromise on employment opportunities to move to a place where they can afford to buy housing.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPhysical Attacks Against Bitcoin Holders Surge As BTC Price Rises\n\nWhat’s Next For P.J. Tucker After Raptors Waive Former NBA Champion?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers Prove That The East Runs Through Them\n\nIn recent months and years, governors and state legislators have successfully implemented reforms that aim to mitigate housing costs by making it less costly and time consuming to construct new housing. In particular, recent state-level reforms that remove or ease local regulations that restrict the supply of housing, such as the set of reforms Montana Governor Greg Gianforte (R) enacted in 2023, are being considered in more states in 2025.\n\nGovernor Gianforte signed into law a series of bills in 2023 that preempt local zoning restrictions blocking the construction of new housing in Montana. One of the bills Governor Gianforte signed, Senate Bill 323, overrides local single-family zoning restrictions in cities and towns with more than 5,000 residents to permit the construction of duplexes. Another bill Gianforte enacted, SB 528, preempts all local prohibitions or restrictions on the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as a carriage houses, guest cottages, and pool houses. Similar reforms have been enacted in California, Virginia, Colorado, and Utah.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, however, the implementation of SB 323 and SB 528 was held up when a judge in Bozeman, where the median home price now exceeds $800,000, issued a preliminary injunction. Governor Gianforte, state legislators, and those who want to increase the supply of housing subsequently celebrated the September decision by the Montana Supreme Court to lift that injunction, which allowed the 2023 housing reforms to move forward.\n\n“I appreciate the Montana Supreme Court for rejecting this injunction, which held back two key reforms identified by our bipartisan Housing Task Force and passed into law by the Legislature,” Governor Gianforte said in September. “We will continue to find innovative ideas to increase housing supply so that affordable, attainable housing is within reach for every Montanan.”\n\nLegislation to preempt local zoning restrictions that prevent new construction or increase the cost of construction have been introduced but not yet enacted in other fast-growing states, such as Texas and North Carolina. The Texas Senate already passed a local zoning preemption bill in 2023 like the one enacted in Montana the prior year, but it did not get out of the Texas House.\n\nReducing Regulatory Barriers To New Construction Is Top 2025 Priority for Lone Star State Leaders\n\nHigh housing costs remain a top challenge facing state legislators in Texas, who kicked off their biennial legislative session in January. Based on a change in the composition of the Texas House, a series of conservative reforms that have passed out of the Texas Senate numerous times only to die in the House, such as the aforementioned zoning reforms approved in 2023, are now set to at last reach Governor Greg Abbott’s (R) desk in 2025.\n\nAside from the expansion of school choice and further property tax relief, another top 2025 priority announced in January by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R), who presides over the Texas Senate, is “Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing.” Before adjourning the regular session this spring, Lt. Governor Patrick and his colleagues are expected to approve zoning reforms that protect property rights, streamline the permitting process, and preempt local rules that impede construction of new housing.\n\n“According to Comptroller Hegar, Texas is more than 300,000 housing units short of addressing the last decade’s massive population growth,” Texas Public Policy Foundation’s John Bonura and Elle Cole wrote in a February 4 op-ed. “This shortage has been exacerbated by policies that restrict the supply of housing, prompting high prices that have reached a point where 74% of Texans cannot afford a median-priced newly constructed home.”\n\nBonura and Cole highlighted recent comments by Lt. Governor Patrick, in which he said “we have to get cities to allow us to build more affordable housing by looking at lot sizes, what we can do with multiple housing in an area…right now in some of our bigger cities, our school teachers and policemen and firemen who work in those cities can’t even afford to live there.”\n\nTennessee Reform Expedites The Permitting Process\n\nA reform enacted by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee (R) in 2024 provides an example of another way in which state legislators can reduce construction costs, one that doesn’t involve preemption. Governor Bill Lee (R) and Tennessee legislators enacted a bill last year that allows developers to hire their own inspectors. That reform also allows builders to hire a wetlands consultant to conduct permit reviews if the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation is unable to do so within 30 days of application.\n\n“Just take it from someone who spent 35 years in the construction industry,” Governor Lee said about the need for that 2024 reform. “A bureaucratic permitting process is bad for everybody but the government.”\n\nRepresentative Kevin Vaughan (R) noted that this reform allows builders to say “hey we’re going to use our own folks on this because we know the timelines are so backed up.” While such a reform can speed up the permitting process and prevent delays from impeding development in other states, some have pointed out that such a reform would be particularly useful in Los Angeles, where thousands of residents are working to rebuild homes, stores, and offices in the aftermath of the recent fires.\n\n“I don’t see how there is any alternative to allowing applicants to hire third party permit reviewers and inspectors,” Nolan Gray, senior director of California YIMBY and professional city planner, noted in a January 9 post on X. “LADBS is already massively backed up, and we already have a housing shortage.”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on January 27 suspending permitting requirements that would delay rebuilding in areas affected by the wildfires. Newsom also ordered the California Coastal Commission to refrain from issuing guidance or taking actions that conflict with that executive order.\n\n“As the state helps the Los Angeles area rebuild and recover, we will continue to remove barriers and red tape that stand in the way,\" Newsom said. “We will not let over-regulation stop us from helping the LA community rebuild and recover.”\n\nNewsom’s statements and actions in the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires are the first instance of a sitting Democratic governor of California acknowledging that California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) mandates and Coastal Commission regulations inflate the cost of housing and make it harder to bring new units online.\n\nSuch an admission from Newsom will make it harder for Golden State lawmakers to justify keeping CEQA mandates, as they current exist, in place for everyone moving forward. Should CEQA persist as is even after this gubernatorial admission of its inflationary effects, that would indicate environmental pressure groups have not seen their influence in Sacramento diminished that much.\n\n“Newsom’s executive actions are admissions that the two laws they target--CEQA and the California Coastal Act--need to be completely overhauled,” Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institute fellow and former candidate for California State Controller, wrote in a post on X. “If they can be so easily waived in times of emergency, why should Californians have to deal with the regulatory headaches they cause otherwise?”\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., two dozen members of Congress formed the YIMBY caucus after last November’s election. Congressman Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), a member of that caucus, said its formation demonstrates that the need to increase the supply of housing is an issue “where Democrats and Republicans agree” and that federal lawmakers of all ideological stripes “understand that building housing is critically important.” Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), meanwhile, has introduced the Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) Act, which makes federal funding for states and localities contingent up the enactment of reforms that allow property owners to build more housing.\n\nRecent actions and statements by both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill underscore how high housing costs have become one of the top challenges facing many U.S. households. While most of the reform work that is needed to remedy this problem must occur at the state level, based on legislation that has been both filed and already enacted in a number of states states, it’s clear that beyond bipartisan recognition of the problem there is also some cross-ideological agreement about the optimal policy solutions.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Lawmakers and governors in many states this year are aiming to bring down housing costs, namely by protecting property rights in a way that facilitates new construction.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2025/02/28/governors-and-legislators-take-on-local-impediments-to-new-housing/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c1e22e9c355c42cd8447df/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 04:58:32","author":"Contributor,Michael Ciaglo,Patrick Gleason","authors":["Contributor","Michael Ciaglo","Patrick Gleason"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":295520084,"title":"A look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship","text":"The first time Donald Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he tried to pressure Ukraine's new leader to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nIt was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.\n\nOn Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started with cordialities turned heated, with US Vice-President JD Vance telling Mr Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Mr Trump, before the US president himself began shouting.\n\n\"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\nWith that, Mr Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the US to access Ukraine's rare earth minerals.\n\nThis was a deal the president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion.\n\nBut the blow-up has cast new doubt on the future of the US's support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.\n\nHere's a look at the evolution of Mr Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years.\n\nA 'perfect' phone call\n\nIn July 2019, Mr Zelenskyy was anxious to have a meeting with Mr Trump at the White House.

Minutes later Trump posted to social media saying that Zelenskiy could return to the White House when he was ready to make peace.\n\n“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE,” Trump said in the post. “He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”\n\nTrump’s comments indicated plans to sign a deal that would have allowed the US to gain from developing Ukraine’s critical minerals as a step toward brokering a ceasefire agreement with Russia are in doubt. Zelenskiy was set to depart the White House without attending a press conference where the two leaders were slated to sign the minerals deal.\n\nThe cancellation capped a remarkable exchange in the Oval Office that saw the two leaders openly bicker over their approach to resolving the war.\n\n“It’s going to be very hard to do business like this,” Trump said, telling Zelenskiy he was not sure the Ukrainian leader could make a deal. “You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us you don’t have any cards.”\n\n“You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump continued. “And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country — this country — that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should,” he said. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it is going to be pretty.”\n\nThe meeting had been intended as a moment of unity between the leaders, who were set to sign the natural resources agreement, which was designed to satisfy Trump’s concerns that US aid would not be repaid. Trump had touted the agreement as a major commitment from the US to Ukraine as he initially welcomed Zelenskiy to the White House for a high-stakes meeting with stark implications for the fight to repel Russia’s invasion.\n\n“It’s a pathway to peace. It’s a pathway to getting something solved,” Trump said.\n\nThe deal, however, fails to offer the explicit security guarantees Zelenskiy had wanted, instead focusing on the economic partnership between the US and Ukraine. Zelenskiy told Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly violated previous ceasefire agreements and that Ukraine would never accept a simple ceasefire to conclude the war. He insisted to Trump that the mineral deal was not enough to ensure Ukraine’s security.\n\n“Putin will never stop and will go further and further,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the Russian leader “hates Ukrainians” and wanted to destroy the country. “We can do it, but it’s not enough,” he added of the deal.\n\nPublic Clash\n\nThe underlying tension between the leaders was obvious. Trump had his eyes closed and was tapping his fingers as Zelenskiy stressed his concerns about Putin reneging on an agreement. When Trump downplayed the threat of a future attack, the Ukrainian leader shook his head.\n\n“I’m in the middle. I want to solve this thing. I’m for both,” Trump insisted. “It’s wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.”\n\nThen the meeting exploded when Vance, sitting nearby, criticized Zelenskiy’s approach.\n\n“Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that’s trying to prevent the destruction of your country?” Vance asked.\n\nTrump said Zelenskiy had “tremendous hatred” for Putin and suggested that the anger could be inhibiting a deal, while also defending his warm relations with the Russian leader as more likely to yield results.\n\n“I could be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen. I’d be so tough, but you’re never going to get it done that way,” Trump said.\n\nAnd the leaders sparred after Zelenskiy suggested Trump did not understand the issue because the US was protected by an ocean, and didn’t face the looming threat from Russia. \n\n“You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong. You’re right now not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,” Trump said.\n\n Also read: Trump-Zelenskyy Oval Office confrontation LIVE coverage: Key takeaways and reactions\n\n“Have you said thank you once?” Vance added. The vice president went on to suggest Zelenskiy had campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris with his trip last fall to an ammunition plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country,” Vance admonished.\n\nMinerals Deal\n\nThe fate of the natural resources deal remained in doubt as the meeting broke. The US president originally called the deal an “exciting moment” and said funds from the deal could also be used for artificial intelligence and military weapons. He reiterated that he would continue military sales to Ukraine.\n\n“We don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it’s going to be a lot of money,” he said.\n\nStill, Trump has downplayed calls for more explicit security guarantees, suggesting the economic ties between Ukraine and the US would suffice to deter Putin from further aggression.\n\n“I think once we make the agreement, that’s going to be 95% of it, it’s not going to go back to fighting,” Trump said. “I’ve spoken with President Putin, and I think, I mean, I feel very strong. I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they’re very serious about it.”\n\n“I’m not worried about security, I’m worried about getting the deal done,” the president added.\n\nZelenskiy’s visit caps a dramatic week that saw both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visit Washington to push Trump to offer US support for a European for a “backstop” to protect Ukraine from further attacks. \n\nFrance and the UK have discussed deploying a peacekeeping force but any such initiative will require US assistance, but Trump has declined to provide any assurances of US support and cast it as an issue for Europe to deal with. The US president has also pressured allies to contribute more to collective security.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com","summary":"The cancellation capped a remarkable exchange in the Oval Office that saw the two leaders openly bicker over their approach to resolving the war","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/trump-zelenskiy-press-conference-cancelled-after-public-argument/article69277848.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hgbmnz/article69277874.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-02-28T215456Z_1215238299_RC2T3DAWCTTO_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-EUROPE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 04:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.538},{"id":295551050,"title":"Washington Post Loses 75,000 Subscribers After Jeff Bezos’ Opinion Takeover","text":"Jeff Bezos knocked a yet another hole in the Washington Post’s finances this week, as the paper has lost 75,000 digital subscriptions in the 2 days since the billionaire commanded its opinion section to exclusively promote his right wing views.\n\nNPR first reported those losses, which haven’t been made public by the Post but were leaked by employees who, according to NPR, fear internal reprisals if their names become public.\n\nIt’s a sizable hit to the Post’s readership in such a short time, but still only a fraction of the gaping fiscal wound the paper has suffered since Bezos began imposing his political preferences on its coverage. That started in late October when, just days before the 2024 election, Bezos killed a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nIn the 24 hours after that announcement, the Washington Post lost a staggering 250,000 paid subscribers, at the time a 10% drop. By election day that drop had grown to more than 300,000 and the exodus continued into the new year. In fact, though the paper claims it has brought in 400,000 new subscribers in the months since the election thanks to an aggressive marketing push, according to NPR WaPo has still suffered a net loss of more than 200,000 subscriptions.\n\nThat may be because Bezos, apparently determined to destroy the reputation of the paper he bought for $250 million in 2013, has increasingly overruled editorial judgment and fostered a culture of apparent censorship of views contrary to his own since the election. \n\nFor instance, In January, Washington Post editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after editors killed a satirical cartoon that mocked Bezos and other media and tech giants for their fealty to Donald Trump. And in early February, WaPo canceled a planned “Fire Elon” advertisement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bezos announced the Opinion section change to staff, asserting that “we are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.” Opposing views, Bezos said, will not be welcome at the Post. Of course, the terms were not defined, but the billionaire has indicated a clear, conservative interpretation of phrases like “personal liberties.” Make of that what you will.\n\nOpinion editor David Shipley quit in protest after this announcement, and multiple WaPo staffers and alums condemned the move. Meanwhile, it’s only the latest curious example of billionaire businessmen who don’t seem interested in whether or not a business is actually successful if said business is a newspaper that dare publish liberal points of view. Even, and perhaps especially, if it drives away the paper’s actual customers.","summary":"The paper's latest right turn also prompted more cirticism and protest resignations\n\n\nThe post Washington Post Loses 75,000 Subscribers After Jeff Bezos&#8217; Opinion Takeover appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/washington-post-loses-75k-subsribers-after-bezos-opinion-takeover/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Washington-Post-e1661878728808.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 03:38:34","author":"Ross A.

It was a 2019 phone call that eventually sparked an impeachment.On Friday, a meeting in the Oval Office that started out with cordialities turned heated at the end, with Vice President JD Vance telling Zelenskyy to show more gratitude toward Trump, before the president himself began shouting.“You're gambling with the lives of millions of people,\" Trump berated Zelenskyy. \"You're gambling with World War III.” With that, Trump scrapped plans to sign an agreement that would have allowed the US to access Ukraine's rare earth minerals, a deal the US president had said would have helped move the war toward a conclusion. The blowup cast new doubt on the future of US support for Kyiv in fending off Russia's invasion.Also Read: Make A Deal or US Is Out: Trump-Zelenskyy-Vance In Full Blown Public Spat, White House Shares Full VideoA look at the evolution of Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship over the years: 'Perfect' phone call In July 2019, Zelenskyy was anxious for a meeting with Trump at the White House, one of the Ukrainian leader's top foreign policy priorities at the time.During a 30-minute call, Trump dangled the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. But he also suggested that future US military support for Ukraine might be contingent on its leader helping investigate business dealings there by Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son.The elder Biden was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Trump seemed to want to weaken him 15 months out from Election Day.Trump denied wrongdoing and began referring to his exchange with Zelenskyy as a “perfect\" phone call. Even Zelenskyy later insisted that he faced “no blackmail”.But Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House in December 2019 on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges, only the third American commander in chief to be in that situation. He was acquitted by the Senate.Russia's war in Ukraine Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24, 2022, triggering the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.Since then, the US has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. The Biden administration made steadfast military and political support for Zelenskyy's country a centrepiece of his foreign policy.As the war raged, the Biden White House staunchly defended continuing to provide support to Ukraine, even as some Republicans began grumbling about so much funding for a war that had no end in sight.In a speech to Congress in December 2022, Zelenskyy thanked \"every American\" for supporting his country.“Your money is not charity,” he said then. \"It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” Trump, then campaigning for his second term, said repeatedly that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president and that he'd have no trouble solving the conflict.Upon taking office, he upended years of US policy by dispatching negotiators to Saudi Arabia to meet with officials from Russian President Vladimir Putin's government, and also began hammering out the minerals deal that he and Zelenskyy had planned to sign Friday.Trump meets with Zelenskyy ahead of Election Day 2024 Last September, Zelenskyy accompanied Biden to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers producing some of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight with Russian ground forces.A few days later, he travelled to Trump Tower in Manhattan and discussed ending the war. In comments to Fox News Channel afterward, Trump said of the fighting, “It should stop and the president wants it to stop,\" meaning Zelenskyy.“And I'm sure President Putin wants it to stop and that's a good combination,” Trump added. Zelenskyy invited Trump to visit Ukraine, to which Trump responded, \"I will.\" That trip came up again Friday, when Vance told Zelenskyy, “You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition.\" Zelenskyy's September trip was not billed as political, though, and Trump's election opponent was Vice President Kamala Harris, not Biden. Still, Pennsylvania is a battleground state and some congressional Republicans at the time accused Democrats of using Zelenskyy's visit to bolster Harris politically.Trump calls Zelenskyy a dictator, then suggests he didn't Last December, Trump met with Zelenskyy again during a visit to Paris to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral. It was a hastily arranged three-way meeting set up by French President Emmanuel Macron, who was trying to push the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion.As president, Trump has publicly prodded Zelenskyy that he had better move quickly to negotiate an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, or risk no longer having a country to lead. On his social media site, Trump decried Zelenskyy for not organising an election to decide if he should remain in power — an idea backed by Russia — calling him a “dictator without elections”.He also suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, but later conceded that Russia was the aggressor.Before this week, Zelenskyy had been to the White House four times — all during the Biden administration. When the Ukrainian leader announced he was coming to Washington and was ready to sign a minerals deal, Trump's tone got more conciliatory.He called America's support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion “a very worthy thing to do.” And, when pressed about having called Zelenskyy a dictator, Trump responded: “Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\" It all served to make Friday's blowup all the more spectacular.

Less than two hours later, Zelenskiy was rushing out of the West Wing into an idling SUV, his relationship with Ukraine’s most critical ally in tatters. Prospects for a signing ceremony — much less a landmark accord with Russia resolving three years of conflict — had vaporized. And as Trump posted social media missives blasting Zelenskiy as an ingrate who had insulted the United States, stunned officials in Washington and across the world wondered if repairing the rift was even possible.This is the account of a remarkable and heated Oval Office exchange that illustrated the dramatic upheaval Trump has brought to decades of US foreign policy and seemed certain to color the course of world history for decades to come.While the argument erupted quickly, the kindling had been laid out over the course of years. Trump has long complained about Ukraine and its leader. The president has long seen the country, situated as a bulwark between the Europe and Russia, as endemic of unnecessary US involvement abroad, demanding resources and security guarantees when it instead should have followed his lead in cultivating a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.That skepticism has only deepened with what Trump sees as a political alignment with Democrats — from declining in his attempts to fan grievances about Hunter Biden to an election-year visit by Zelenskiy to Pennsylvania that many Republicans saw as a bid to bolster Kamala Harris. The chummy relationship between former President Joe Biden and Zelenskiy only fanned that divide, fostering resentment of the Ukrainian leader among Trump diehards, including Vice President JD Vance.In a way, the Oval Office session — driven in part by Trump and Vance ratcheting up the temperature — was the bloodletting Trump had long pined for, and it offered a reason, or at least a fig leaf, for Trump to balk at backing an effort he’s been wary of. The exchange could prove seismic. The mineral deal Trump demanded — itself a pressure tactic on Kyiv — went unsigned, immediately delivering a destabilizing signal to allies including the UK and Germany that had sought to broker some path to avoid abandoning Ukraine. And the scene was certain to reverberate through domestic US politics, where critics have long argued that Trump is too cozy with Russia.The tone was set even before Zelenskiy stepped into the White House.“You’re all dressed up,” Trump told Zelenskiy as he arrived in snug black clothing, consistent with the wartime attire he’s donned since Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy and his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, have refused to wear suits since the invasion, though Yermak broke that streak by wearing one Friday. The offhand remark might have been nothing, but it teed up a similar question in the Oval Office from Brian Glenn, a reporter with the staunchly pro-Trump outlet Real America’s Voice.“Why don’t you wear a suit?” Glenn asked Zelenskiy, prompting laughter. “A lot of Americans have a problem with you not respecting the dignity of this office.”Zelenskiy bristled but brushed it off. Maybe, he allowed, he would don a suit when the war is over, though, perhaps, he quipped, it would be something a little “cheaper.” ‘Compromises With a Killer’Both leaders were on common ground describing the importance of ending the conflict in Ukraine, with Trump insisting it was time to see an end to the killing that has ravaged the eastern European nation. But Zelenskiy swiftly warned that couldn’t come at any cost, asserting there was no room for “compromises with a killer.” Persistent questions about whether the US would provide security guarantees and military aid raised the temperature. It wasn’t the time to talk about security guarantees, Trump said, adding that right now, the focus should be on getting a deal. Trump grew visibly frustrated as Zelenskiy repeatedly emphasized how Putin had broken the terms of previous ceasefire agreements. The US president closed his eyes and tapped his fingers together repeatedly as Zelenskiy spoke just inches to his right. “That wasn’t with me,” Trump replied. “That was with a guy named Biden, who was not a smart person.” But the conversation took a sharp turn when Vance jumped in, chiding Zelenskiy: The US previously “had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded,” Vance said. Zelenskiy gently asked Vance if he could ask a question, then brought up the history of Russian occupation of Ukraine, dating back to 2014. Given all that, he said, “what kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about?”‘Not Playing Cards’Vance, leaned forward, raising his voice as he admonished Zelenskiy: “It’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” the vice president said. “Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”Tensions only escalated when Zelenskiy emphasized the relatively comfortable US position — an ocean away from Russia and the conflict in Europe. You don’t feel it now, Zelenskiy said, “but you will feel it in the future.” Trump jumped in: “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he said. “You’re in no position to dictate that.” Instead, Trump cast Zelenskiy as powerless. “You don’t have the cards right now,” Trump said, but “with us, you start having cards.”“I’m not playing cards,” Zelenskiy shot back. “I’m very serious.”No, Trump said: “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.” With a cadre of White House correspondents and a phalanx of video cameras watching the exchange, Vance stepped in once again. “Have you said ‘thank you’ once this entire meeting?” Vance asked Zelenskiy, scolding: “Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”Zelenskiy has regularly thanked the US for its response, including in a joint address to Congress in 2022. “I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family, which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people,” he said at the time. But in the heat of the moment Friday, it was clear no modest exchange of gratitude would calm tensions. Trump, a real estate developer whose rise in politics was paved by years hosting “The Apprentice” reality television show, acknowledged the drama. “This is going to be great television,” he said as White House aides started escorting journalists from the gilded room. After the Oval Office blow-up, the president huddled with top advisers, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Vance, while the Ukrainians waited in another room, according to a White House official who shared details on the events on condition of anonymity.Trump decided that he would not move forward with the talks and instructed Waltz and Rubio to break the news to Zelenskiy, the official said. While the Ukrainians wanted to continue the discussions, Waltz and Rubio made clear that would not happen and that it was time for them to leave.‘Not Ready for Peace’Trump took to Truth Social to declare a deal was premature. “It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Trump declared. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE.”A White House aide swiftly ripped down a sign with details about an upcoming Trump-Zelenskiy news conference from an office door, as a black SUV drove to the West Wing. Zelenskiy slipped inside, as White House aides gathered at windows to watch him pull away.At the White House, staffers — at least those who weren’t enjoying the abandoned lunches that had been prepared for US and Ukrainian officials — looked to amplify conservative commentators and lawmakers casting Zelenskiy’s behavior as disrespectful.Democrats, eager for a chance to reverse the political momentum that has carried Trump in recent weeks, immediately pounced. “Trump and Vance are doing Putin’s dirty work,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a social media post.Among the uncertainties now is the fate of the Ukrainian leader himself. Trump, as he left the White House later Friday to head to his Mar-a-Lago estate, accused Zelenskiy of wanting to continue fighting and sidestepped a question about possibly cutting off aid. He added that Zelenskiy had signaled to the US he was prepared to return immediately to the White House to reengage.“He’s got to say I want to make peace,” Trump said of the Ukrainian leader. Bessent said the situation was “going to take a lot of repair” and it wasn’t clear if the relationship could ever be fixed.“He chose to let things go into a downward spiral on worldwide television,” Bessent told Bloomberg Television.A Trump ally, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, emerged from a meeting with the president at the White House to suggest Zelenskiy should abandon his presidency. He said he’d warned the Ukrainian leader before the meeting to defer discussion of security guarantees to another day.Zelenskiy didn’t publicly address the notion, and canceled a planned speech at the nearby Hudson Institute. But he offered the gratitude Vance demanded.“Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you, @POTUS, Congress, and the American people,” Zelenskiy posted on X. “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”","summary":"A severe rift emerged between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy during a heated Oval Office exchange, resulting in the collapse of a critical minerals deal.

The moment was captured in a number of viral photos and videos as Trump questioned Zelenskyy about not wanting a ceasefire with Russia at a live White House press event. As shaky microphones hovered above the spatting leaders, Markarova lowered her head to her right hand and closed her eyes. ZELENSKYY BREAKS SILENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER FIERY OVAL OFFICE EXCHANGE WITH TRUMP: 'THANK YOU AMERICA' President Trump addressed Zelenskyy, saying, \"You're saying you don't want a ceasefire. I want a ceasefire because you get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.\" The Ukrainian president chimed in, \"I said to you … with guarantees. Ask our people about [a] ceasefire, [about] what they think.\" Trump starkly halted the conversation, saying \"that wasn't with me.\" ZELENSKYY LEAVES WHITE HOUSE AFTER BEING ‘KICKED OUT’ FOLLOWING HEATED MEETING The leaders were expected to sign a deal sharing Ukraine's rare earth minerals and discuss a peace deal with Russia when the conversation turned contentious. After questions were posed by Zelenskyy about diplomacy, Vice President JD Vance reprimanded him for \"try[ing] to litigate\" in front of the American media, calling his actions \"disrespectful.\" \"Do you think that it's respectful to come into the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country,\" Vance asked Zelenskyy. Sources close to Zelenskyy noted tensions were high prior to the meeting, Fox News Digital previously reported. Zelenskyy reportedly rejected the mineral security agreement before Friday's meeting due to the absence of security guarantees protecting Ukraine from another Russian invasion. Even though the Ukrainian president warned he would need those assurances to sign the deal, sources said the dismissal angered Trump and Vance. Just minutes after reporters asked their first questions, the heated disagreement unfolded. Reporters watched in shock as the meeting came to an abrupt halt, and Zelenskyy was rushed out of the White House. Minutes later, Trump posted to Truth Social, saying, \"President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE.\" Zelenskyy subsequently posted to X, thanking America and Trump for their support and allowing the visit. \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,\" he wrote in the post. Markarova was ambassador for roughly a year when Russia invaded Ukraine, thrusting her into the spotlight. In September, Fox News Digital exclusively reported that House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote a letter to Zelenskyy seeking Markarova's firing after she allegedly organized a U.S. taxpayer-funded tour of an American manufacturing site for Zelenskyy in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Johnson, R-La., said the tour \"purposely excluded\" Republicans, calling it \"election interference.\" \"The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,\" Johnson wrote in the letter. He said the \"shortsighted and intentionally political move\" prompted Republicans to \"lose trust\" in Markarova’s ability to fairly and effectively serve as a diplomat. \"She should be removed from her post immediately,\" Johnson wrote.

We’re turning a new leaf with President Trump and this bill will put American mines and American jobs first.”\n\nFellow Montana Republican U.S. Sen Tim Sheehy also co-sponsored the bill.\n\nThe bill was introduced on the same day that President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.

Despite hyping the release of the supposedly secret FBI documents as a bombshell, the binders Bondi delivered to Trump supporters turned out to contain very little new information about Epstein’s criminal cases.\n\nInstead, the roughly 200 pages of documents mainly consisted of flight logs on Epstein’s planes and some contact information of his hundreds of associates, including Donald Trump, as well as an inventory of some of the items found in the homes that the FBI raided. \n\nWhat wasn’t included, though, was any fresh allegations about Epstein or any other associates, prompting the MAGA faithful to rage about the lack of new evidence while alleging a ”Deep State” conspiracy.\n\nSensing the anger from the right, who have long used the Epstein case to fuel other conspiracy theories, Bondi instructed New York’s FBI field office to turn over “all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained” by Friday morning. \n\nMidway through their three-hour-long chat, Rogan cited the criminal cases against Trump as part of a Democratic-led “lawfare” campaign to prevent him from running for office again. Musk, meanwhile, noted that Hoffman helped back columnist E. Jean Carroll’s lawsuit against Trump, which found the president liable for sexual abuse and defamation.\n\n“That lawsuit was funded by Reid Hoffman, who is a major Dem donor and also an Epstein client,” the DOGE chief alleged.\n\n“The plot thickens!” Rogan responded. “Jesus Christ, it’s just so blatant. It’s like so obvious. The SpaceX lawsuit, the Trump stuff, it’s just so obvious.” \n\nWith the conspiracy-peddling podcaster setting the stage, Musk then accused Hoffman of trying to keep Trump from returning to the White House in order to prevent FBI evidence against Epstein and possibly others from being made public.\n\n“Known Epstein clients who are obviously extremely powerful – powerful politically and very wealthy – are Bill Gates, Bill Clinton and Reid Hoffman,” Musk alleged. “And some others, too. But those three.”\n\nWhile a stunned-looking Rogan let out an exasperated sigh, Musk added: “Why was Reid Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump?”\n\nAfter Rogan asked if “they were worried about the list coming out,” the X (formerly Twitter) owner flatly replied: “Yeah.” \n\nThe two would go on to express their frustration about “sitting in the situation where the list isn’t coming out,” with Rogan complaining that Thursday’s document dump had “nothing in it that’s new.” \n\nMusk, on the other hand, reiterated that Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel are now the “captain of a ship with a hostile crew,” suggesting that they are the victims of a coverup by career officials working for them.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has pushed baseless claims about Hoffman as it relates to his relationship with Epstein. \n\nDuring an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in October, the SpaceX CEO said Hoffman was one of the “billionaires behind Kamala” Harris who were “terrified” over the prospect of Epstein’s client list becoming public. Additionally, Musk approvingly retweeted a post that claimed the billionaire was “TERRIFIED about Trump releasing the Epstein client list after all his visits to Epstein Island.”\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times in December, Hoffman said Musk had made a “conviction with no evidence” that he had a close relationship with Epstein and partied with the disgraced financier – who committed suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial over sex crimes. \n\nHoffman added that he also had received threats of violence and had to hire security due to Musk’s conspiracy theories about him.\n\nHoffman said in 2019 that he regretted helping to “repair” Epstein’s reputation by introducing him to tech moguls in prior years while he sought donations to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He claimed that Epstein had passed MIT’s “vetting process” at the time, adding: “My lesson is I should go do my own research.”\n\nAt the same time, Hoffman claimed that he “went to no Epstein parties” and wasn’t really familiar with the financier’s sullied reputation at the time. \n\nAdding that he didn’t associate with Epstein after 2015, he speculated that Musk’s sordid claims about him were “seeded when he invited his old friend to an MIT fundraising dinner that was also attended by Epstein in 2015.”\n\n“Elon’s defamation makes me angry and sad,” he told the Times. “Angry because it is an ugly assault. Sad because it comes from someone whose entrepreneurial achievements I continue to admire.”","summary":"‘Why was Reid Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump?’ Elon Musk asked Joe Rogan before agreeing with Rogan’s claims that it was to prevent the ‘list from coming out.’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-epstein-list-released-trump-b2706992.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/28/22/54/Screenshot-Capture-2025-02-28-16-38-26.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 02:00:29","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":295494374,"title":"Maine’s Governor Picks Fight She Won’t Win With Trump Over Trans Athletes Invading Women’s Sports","text":"“We’ll see you in court,” Maine Gov. Janet Mills told President Donald Trump at a Feb. 21 gathering of the National Governors Association at the White House.\n\nBut Mills, a Democrat, should be careful what she wishes for, because Trump wasn’t bluffing when he said Mills and Maine would be the big losers if she refused to comply with his Feb. 5 executive order conditioning receipt of federal education dollars on prohibiting transgender faux females from invading girls and women’s interscholastic athletics.\n\nTrump disputed Mills’ assertion that she is “complying with state and federal law” and reminded her that his office represented that federal law.\n\n“Good. I’ll see you in court,” Trump retorted. “I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.”\n\nIt was not an idle threat. Within hours of the White House event, Trump ordered his Department of Education to determine whether Mills and Maine were in violation of Title IX, the landmark 1972 federal civil rights law prohibiting sex-based discrimination at any school or any other education program, including in athletics, that receives federal funding.\n\nThe Trump-Mills confrontation and the ensuing Education Department probe came just days after an interscholastic athletic competition in Maine that showed this fight is not over hypotheticals—or what could happen, but over what is in fact happening—and not just in Maine, but across the country, albeit mostly in blue states.\n\nJust four days earlier, on Feb. 17, a boy from Cumberland, Maine, who “identifies” as a “girl” won the girls’ high school Class B state championship pole-vaulting competition. His jump of 10-feet-6-inches was eight inches higher than the female runner-up. (Last year, competing against other boys, he finished fifth.)\n\nThat was just two days after Feb. 5, when Trump was joined by a phalanx of female athletes as he signed his campaign-promised “No Men in Women’s Sports” executive order at the White House.\n\nUnmoved by parental and Republican state lawmakers’ protestations of the inherent unfairness of the pole-vaulting competition, or by the risk of losing $250 million in federal funding, a defiant Mills released a statement on Feb. 21 vowing not to follow Trump’s order, asserting, “The state of Maine will not be intimidated by the president’s threats.”\n\nBut the Trump vs. Mills bout is shaping up to be akin to a fight pitting Mike Tyson against Dylan Mulvaney.\n\n“If the president attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine schoolchildren of the benefit of federal funding, my administration and the attorney general will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides,” Mills fumed.\n\nThat’s just it, however. It wouldn’t be unilateral.\n\nMills will have brought it upon herself and her state by putting the interests of an estimated .003 of 1% of the population that “identifies” as transgender ahead of 51% of the population; namely, real girls and women (of whom Mills reportedly is one).\n\nMills, 77, had no children, but perhaps if the granddaughter of a close friend or relative lost an athletic medal, trophy, or scholarship to one of these faux females, she might be a bit more empathetic to those who have.\n\nThere are in fact many girls and women athletes who indeed have lost out to these transgender interlopers. The website SheWon.org meticulously tracks such things, and according to its current tally, 791 female athletes have been deprived of 1,121 awards in 545 competitions across 43 different sports.\n\nAs such, it can’t be blithely dismissed as a rare, isolated phenomenon.\n\nDoes Mills really want to spend her political capital—to say nothing of Maine taxpayers’ dollars and state Attorney General Aaron Frey’s time—fighting on an issue on which she is going against the sentiment of nearly 80% of the population?\n\nA New York Times/Ipsos survey released in January found the vast majority of Americans—including fully two-thirds of Democrats, even—don’t think these make-believe females should be allowed to compete in girls and women’s sports.\n\n“Thinking about transgender female athletes—meaning athletes who were male at birth, but who currently identify as female—do you think they should or should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports?” the NYT-Ipsos survey asked.\n\nOf the 2,128 respondents, 79% said biological males who identify as girls or women should not be allowed to take part in female athletics.\n\nOf the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete against XX-chromosomed girls and women.\n\nIn Maine, where I lived for 30 years, there is no lieutenant governor, and the attorney general is not elected, but instead is selected by a majority vote of the Legislature. As such, Frey, a former Democratic state lawmaker himself, would ordinarily be the heir apparent to the term-limited Mills, a former state attorney general whose second term as governor ends in January 2027.\n\nBut if Frey aspires to succeed Mills and run for governor next year, he should think twice—or three times—before taking on this quixotic and viscerally unpopular losing battle.\n\nIs this really the political hill that Mills, Frey, and other Democrats want to die on?\n\nHave Democrats learned nothing from Kamala Harris’ presidential loss in November, which was due in no small part to Trump’s barrage of attack ads exposing her support for federal taxpayer funding of sex-change operations, even for federal prisoners—a stance she was unwilling or unable to disavow?\n\nApart from being a blatant violation of Title IX, how is allowing delusional boys and men to compete against real females not a real “war on women”—unlike the phony one Democrats have for decades falsely accused Republicans of waging?\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Times","summary":"“We’ll see you in court,” Maine Gov.
