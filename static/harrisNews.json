Booker’s objection came after he said the Office of Justice Programs, which administers grants through the Justice Department, was withholding funds for programs in so-called “sanctuary cities”, like Booker’s hometown of Newark.\n\nBooker clashed with Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Amy Klobuchar over an amendment that would have prevented the DOJ from blocking those funds. It also would have likely endangered the unanimous consent process, which senators were relying upon to pass the bill, given that it would likely trigger GOP opposition.\n\nThen, in comments to reporters, he slammed his fellow Democrats as “complicit” in the Trump administration’s attempts to bully blue states and districts into line.\n\n“Literally, they were about to be complicit in the very things they say out of the other side of their mouth that they object to. Democrats need to learn to fight and fight him and stop him from hurting people,” he said.\n\nHe added to The Independent: “Today, I saw people being complicit with something that is truly undermining the Constitution, the separation of powers and the kind of things that we should be standing up [against].”\n\nBooker didn’t explain why he didn’t object to the bills’ final passage when his amendment failed.\n\nCortez Masto, meanwhile, maintained her anti-Trump bona fides in a separate conversation with The Independent after the vote, pointing to her work at the DSCC to flip the Senate into Democratic hands in 2020, when her party secured a narrow 50-50 majority, with ties broken by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Nevada Democrat said that she was “proven” in “the fight against Donald Trump.”\n\nAnd she added: “ I chaired the DSCC. We flipped the Senate [to] control of the Democrats and pushed back on Donald Trump.\n\n“I am not opposed to taking on the challenges of Donald Trump and bad policies. I do it all the time. The question is, why aren't most Democrats supporting law enforcement?” the senator asked.\n\nKlobuchar, in her floor speech, took aim at her New Jersey colleague for not bringing up his concerns in committee. But Booker contended to reporters later that the threats were only leveled after the legislation advanced, making Klobuchar’s criticism a moot point.\n\nBooker gained notoriety on the left with a marathon floor speech earlier this year denouncing the Trump administration’s second-term agenda, a speech that broke Senate records. At the same time, he, like other Democrats in the chamber, has faced derision from some in their party for the persisting air of bipartisanship that still permeates part of the chamber, particularly involving the nominations of former senator Marco Rubio to be Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nHis notion that the party is sick and tired of leadership and the strategy of appeasement some Senate Democrats like Chuck Schumer have exhibited when dealing with the new Republican majority is accurate, however.\n\nA national NBC News poll in March found that just 7 percent of Democrats have a very favorable view of their party, with just a quarter having positive views overall. A second poll in May from The Center Square, conducted by Noble Predictive Insights, found that three-quarters of Democrats want the party to push back against the president “more often”.","summary":"Corey Booker lectured Democrats over backing legislation that White House and DOJ say will be another cudgel against ‘sanctuary cities’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/booker-cortez-masto-senate-democrats-trump-b2798479.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/29/23/02/GettyImages-2215125774.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xKCQjCDS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:59:43","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":346421248,"title":"Russia Knew About Hillary Clinton's 'Psycho-Emotional' Issues During 2016 Campaign","text":"Russian president Vladimir Putin was aware of Hillary Clinton's \"psycho-emotional\" issues during her 2016 presidential run and planned to use the information against her if she defeated Donald Trump. \n\nDirector of National Security Tulsi Gabbard made the stunning announcement when releasing a newly declassified 17-page report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2020, RadarOnline.com can reveal.Heavy TranquilizersPutin, 72, held the \"most damaging material he had in his possession about Hillary Clinton until her potential and likely victory\" in the 2016 presidential election, Gabbard told reporters on July 23. Trump ultimately defeated her. \n\nGabbard explained how high-level DNC emails detailed how Clinton was allegedly suffering from \"intensified psycho-emotional problems, including uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression and cheerfulness,” which Russia was aware of. \n\nThe then-Secretary of State was allegedly \"on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers,\" Gabbard said about the report. The files claimed Clinton was placed on the drugs out of her deep fear of losing the election to Trump, as she was \"obsessed with a thirst for power.\"\n\nThe documents also alleged that there was evidence that Clinton suffered from dangerous health issues, including type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and deep vein thrombosis.\n\nThe report stated that \"then-President Barack Obama and other Democratic party leaders found the state of Clinton's health \"extraordinarily alarming\" and felt it could have a \"serious negative impact\" on the likelihood of her winning the election.'Possible Criminal Acts'Russian intelligence was aware of more than just Clinton's health problems. “The report goes into great detail about the information that Russia and Putin had on Hillary Clinton, which included possible criminal acts,\" Gabbard revealed. \n\nThose included \"secret meetings with multiple named U.S. religious organizations in which State Department officials offered, in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton's campaign for the presidency, significant increases in financing from the State Department.\"\n\nClinton served as then-President Obama's Secretary of State in his first term, from 2009 to 2013.Infamous CollapseWhile the Russians were aware of Hillary Clinton's secret health ailments during her presidential run, Americans also were alerted to how she suffered a medical crisis after attending a 9/11 memorial service in New York in September 2016.\n\nA video of Clinton appearing unable to stand and on the verge of fainting as she waited for a van while departing the event went viral. Several aides grabbed her by her arms to keep her from falling over before quickly loading her into the vehicle. \n\nAt the time, the candidate's team initially blamed her near-collapse on heat and dehydration. They later claimed Clinton had been given a pneumonia diagnosis before attending the event and was \"recovering well with antibiotics and rest.\" \n\nThe former first lady later told Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on The Tonight Show: \"There's nothing like a little rest when your doctor tells you to and you don't do it.\"\n\n\"I'm used to just kind of getting up and powering through it, and that's what I thought I could do,\" Clinton continued. \"Turned out I couldn't, so I took a few days off, and actually I think it was good.\"Issues With BidenWhile Clinton's health was an issue during her presidential campaign, she was one of the first to raise the alarm about Joe Biden's viability before the 2024 presidential election, as the octogenarian was initially hoping to seek a second term.\n\nThe revelation came amid the House Oversight Committee's investigation into whether or not Biden administration officials covered up signs of cognitive decline.\n\nSources said Clinton and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan approached Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain, \"stating they believed Joe Biden was not politically viable,\" before the president dropped out of the race in July 2024 following his disastrous debate with Trump. \n\nSullivan allegedly told Klain the ex-president \"was less effective in 2024 compared to 2022.\"\n\nBiden eventually dropped out of the race and handed his candidacy over to Vice President Kamala Harris.

Having chained their party to support for Israel under the Biden administration, the party suffered a devastating defeat in 2024 and are now being forced to watch a resurgence on the progressive pro-Palestinian left.\n\nDespite breathless insistences to the contrary by center-left commentators, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the base of the Democratic Party is shifting away from the pro-Israel consensus long upheld by the DC foreign policy establishment. \n\nIt’s not just the left, either; new polling shows a generational divide across all party lines on the issue of sympathy for support of Palestinian statehood and an end to the slaughter in Gaza.\n\nFew will say it openly, but no one is denying it on the left: there has been an earthquake within the party. \n\nThe upstart victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor came amid a barrage of coverage from the mainstream media — including his hometown papers, the New York Times and New York Post — which often insinuated that Mamdani harbored anti-Semitic beliefs or falsely accused him of expressing them. It also rebuked the endorsements of aging Democratic would-be kingmakers Bill Clinton and James Clyburn, who issued late-game endorsements of New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo.\n\nIn a poll out Tuesday from the IMEU Policy Project conducted by Data for Progress, a clear portrait of the race emerges. Nearly eight in 10 New York mayoral primary voters said they believed Israel was committing a genocide in Gaza.\n\nPutting aside the mayoral race entirely for a moment — how does a candidate in the ideological vein of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris fare among an electorate like that?\n\nIn the same poll, 63 percent of Democratic primary voters in the city supported what could easily be described as Mamdani’s most hardline position on the matter of Israel-Palestine: his support for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were he ever to visit the city. A lower figure than the number that are willing to assign the term “genocide” to the conflict, but far from insignificant. \n\nA news article in the Jewish magazine Forward put the question plainly on Monday: “After Mamdani and Gaza, are Democrats turning against Israel?”\n\nDemocrats in New York and across the country are quickly waking up to the rapidly shifting ground beneath them. \n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and vocal critic of his colleagues in the so-called “Squad,” bluntly assessed that he could not win a Democratic primary for governor in the state after Mamdani’s victory. \n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House Minority Leader, reportedly told allies that he doubts his ability to win the speakership with Mamdani in play. \n\nKirsten Gillibrand, New York’s junior US senator, issued a humbling apology to Mamdani after accusing him (falsely) of supporting “jihad.”\n\nThe efforts to dodge what could be a historic wave of primary challenges fueled by progressive rage over the next three years are hastily getting underway.\n\nJoe Biden’s departure from the White House and Netanyahu’s close alliance with Trump make criticizing Israel a much easier prospect for Democrats. The mass starvation and shocking killings of Palestinians at aid reception areas by Israeli troops have accelerated the criticism of Israel from Washington Democrats in the past week.\n\nIn the Senate, a large coalition of Democrats led by Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to publicly break with the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and return to reliance on neutral international groups to provide aid. Van Hollen, who was a lonely voice for Palestinian suffering under the Biden administration, now has the backing of nearly half of his caucus. \n\nOne unsurprising holdout was John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania senator and vocal supporter of Israel, including some of its most controversial war-fighting methods that have been denounced as war crimes by the International Criminal Court and others.\n\nFetterman, up for reelection in 2028, has vultures circling him. Conor Lamb, his former primary opponent, is punching him relentlessly on social media and in a series of public appearances he’s made at town hall-style events across the state. \n\nLamb, who tweeted in support of destroying Hamas and supporting Israel after the October 7 attacks, lost out on endorsements from the progressive left that now despises Fetterman when they ran against each other in 2022. Another Pennsylvania congressman, a Democrat, tweeted (publicly!) that he hopes Fetterman doesn’t run for president.\n\nThis past week, Lamb tweeted that he hopes Pope Leo, the first American pontiff, “continues to speak against starvation and barbarity in Gaza.”\n\nMembers of the House are speaking out as well. \n\nRep. Andre Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, came out in support of an arms embargo against Israel on Monday while accusing Netanyahu’s government of “starving” the population of Gaza.\n\nOthers, including Madeleine Dean, demanded another ceasefire be hammered out. Torres attacked a Republican colleague for making repeated Islamophobic remarks about Rep. Ilhan Omar, and in an interview with Chuck Todd blasted Netanyahu for doing “irreparable” harm to the relationship between Israel and the Democratic Party. \n\nLeadership is lagging behind but clearly feels the wind shifting: Minority Whip Katherine Clark and Jeffries released statements on Friday on the starvation, each condemning the crisis, neither one using the word “Israel” at any point.\n\nEven Barack Obama, hesitant as he typically is to speak out on the issue of the day in his post-presidency, put out a statement seemingly critical of Israel, writing in part: “There is no justification for keeping food and water away from civilian families.”\n\nThe only Democrats who are being truly silent on the issue are tied directly to the former administration. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris are widely seen as two of the most likely to contend for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Neither has issued a word about Gaza for months. Harris, also thought to be considering a run for governor of California, hasn’t sat for a long-form interview this year.\n\nIn the end it could be difficult to determine exactly how much of the stink attached to former Biden-world figures relates to Gaza, as opposed to the year(s?)-long coverup of the president’s declining faculties. \n\nOne thing is for certain: something shifted in the past week, something beyond just the fallout from election of a charismatic Muslim candidate in a prominent but isolated primary race.","summary":"A wave of key party condemnations makes it clear: a tide is finally shifting among DC Democrats as Israel starves Gaza, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-israel-gaza-famine-netanyahu-biden-b2798391.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/17/19/2025-NYC-Pride-March-yj0ylj0m.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 22:14:33","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":346416530,"title":"Dem Gov.

It’s just difficult to be the vice president, to come into that.

We stopped making the case. We came up with this philosophy where, listen, it all comes down to three states.”\n\nHarrison agreed and added, “We cede ground.”\n\n“And it’s like, do you know who hears this thing is only going to come down to three states?

The lone exception came in 2002, when Republicans, riding on post-9/11 goodwill for then-President George W. Bush, actually gained seats in the House and in the Senate, strengthening a governing trifecta they would not lose until the 2006 midterm elections.\n\nBut an uncomfortable truth for the Democratic Party and a welcome one for Republicans is that the 2026 cycle is already shaping up to be quite different from previous midterm elections. Of course, this hardly means that Republicans will maintain control of the House and their governing trifecta. But, less than a year and a half before the midterm elections, the party in power appears to have as good a shot as any to defy history and keep its Democratic rivals shut out of power for the duration of President Donald Trump’s term in office.\n\nThere are three primary reasons that the GOP can pull off this upset: the district map, fundraising, and public support for the two major parties. While all three come with an accompanying asterisk that the elections are still more than a year away, these trends seem to be more locked in than not.\n\nThe map of House districts\n\nWhen Republicans flipped the House of Representatives in 2022 by a meager five seats, there was a sense that the party left a lot on the table. A promised red wave failed to materialize outside of Florida and New York, as the GOP scraped together a thin majority in the House. This seemed like a minimal rebuke of the Biden administration, especially after previous midterm elections yielded much larger swings in favor of the party out of power.\n\nBut much of this disappointment can be attributed to the fact that the number of competitive House districts is at an all-time low. In 2016, Republicans won the national popular vote for the House by 1 percentage point but won 241 seats, a much stronger majority than the GOP secured in 2022, when the party won the national popular vote by more than 2 points. In 2024, Republicans again won the national popular vote for the House, this time by a point and a half, but only secured a three-seat majority.\n\nThe simple reality is that opportunities to pad a majority are few and far between for either party. Both Republicans and Democrats have gerrymandered numerous states in a bid to limit the other party’s ability to compete. The Cook Political Report rates a meager 18 seats in the 2026 midterm elections as true toss-ups, of which 10 are held by Democrats and eight by Republicans. It’s a map that is not much changed from 2024, when 22 seats were rated as toss-ups, 12 held by Republicans, and 10 by Democrats. By contrast, the final ratings in 2018 featured 30 toss-ups, of which only one was held by a Democrat.\n\nBut even against that backdrop, Republicans head into 2026 with more obvious pick-up opportunities than the Democratic Party, which is defending 13 members who won their seats even as Trump received the most votes in the concurrent presidential election. Republicans, on the other hand, are only defending three seats in districts that were won by the Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nEffectively, this means that even if Democrats improve their national standing with voters in 2026, there is no guarantee that that will translate into more seats. Indeed, a number of Democratic incumbents could still lose reelection simply due to the partisan trends of their districts. And in the case that Republicans do lose the House, the Democratic majority will likely be as small as the GOP’s current majority.\n\nFurther bolstering Republican prospects is Trump’s effort to push Republican state legislatures to redraw House districts in several states, most notably Texas, which would yield the party additional seats even in an environment favorable to Democrats. While Democrats in California, New York, and elsewhere are looking for ways to redraw their own maps, legal and logistical hurdles will inhibit their ability to do so.\n\nFundraising\n\nWhile having district electorates that are more favorable to Republican candidates will no doubt be a boost to the party’s prospects, campaigns that do not have enough money in the bank are destined to struggle, no matter the political trends among voters. But there, again, Republicans are showing remarkable resilience, while Democrats are struggling to keep up.\n\nAt least 10 Republican incumbents that Democrats plan to target next year have already raised more than $1 million, while only one Democratic incumbent targeted by Republicans has done the same. According to a recent Politico report, the median House Republican has raised $860,000, while the median House Democrat has raised $689,000, a remarkable difference given that the party out of power typically enjoys a fundraising boost from its angry supporters.\n\nBut that discrepancy is only one part of the GOP’s burgeoning cash advantage. According to Fox News, Trump’s political operation and the Republican National Committee are expected to secure a campaign war chest of nearly $1.5 billion over the next year. As it stands now, the RNC has $81 million in cash on hand, while the Democratic National Committee has only $15 million.\n\nPublic image\n\nTrump and the GOP’s massive fundraising advantage has no doubt been aided in no small part by their political rivals suffering from a major public image crisis. Poll after poll has shown that the Democratic Party is woefully underwater with voters, while Republicans have largely held steady.\n\nA recent poll from the Wall Street Journal conducted by Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio and Democratic pollster John Anzalone found that the Democratic Party’s approval rating is 30 points underwater with the public, a 35-year low, while Republicans were only down 11 points.\n\nDEMOCRATS BELIEVE ROY COOPER IS A ‘GAME-CHANGER’ IN NORTH CAROLINA SENATE RACE\n\nThat reality is a far cry from eight years ago. In 2017, Democrats had a negative approval rating of 9 points, while Republicans were below water by 15 points, a public image issue that presaged the coming blue wave in 2018. In the meantime, Trump’s approval ratings have consistently been higher than they were throughout his first term.\n\nOf course, a year from now, things could look quite different. The president’s approval ratings could drop, Democrats could see their public approval rebound and fundraising strengthen, and gerrymandering efforts in Texas and elsewhere could falter. These factors would push the 2026 midterm elections back toward the historical trendline. But as of now, the Republican Party is as well-positioned as ever to defy history and keep its trifecta for another two years.","summary":"By every conventional historical measure, the Republican Party’s governing trifecta, control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, will come to an end in January 2027.

To which Trump responded: “I don’t want to say but everyone knows the people that were taken. The concept of taking people that work for me is bad.…and the answer is yes, they were.”\n“I have a great spa, one of the best spas in the world at Mar-a-Lago,” he continued, “and people were taken out of the spa, hired by him, in other words, gone.” Asked by another reporter if “one of those stolen persons” included Virginia Giuffre—one of Epstein’s most prominent victims—Trump answered: “I don’t know. I think she worked at the spa, I think so, that was one of the people, he stole her. And by the way she had no complaints about us, none whatsoever.”\nThe president’s explosive remarks follow him talking Monday about the prospect of pardoning Maxwell, “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody’s approached me with it. Nobody’s asked me about it. It’s in the news about that, that aspect of it, but right now, it would be inappropriate to talk about it.” That was the second time in matter of days that Trump emphasized that he has the power to pardon the longtime Epstein associate, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.\nFor her part, Maxwell has asked the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction; she also wants immunity in exchange for testifying before Congress, having been subpoenaed to appear next month.\nAlso on Monday, Trump denied ever visiting Epstein’s Caribbean island with a characteristically bizarre turn of phrase, saying “I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down, but a lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down. I didn’t want to go to his island.” He then explained why he apparently ended his friendship with Epstein. “I wouldn’t talk to Jeffrey Epstein because he did something that was inappropriate,” the president said. “He stole people that worked for me. I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He did it again, and I threw him out of the place,” he said, referring to Mar-a-Lago.\nAnd, of course, it wouldn’t have been a Trump presser without claims of a hoax and a shot at his Democratic foes. Responding to a question about whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had told him his name was mentioned in the Epstein files, the president said he hasn’t “been overly interested in it” because “it’s a hoax that’s been built up way beyond proportion.” Then he suggested Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, James Comey, and Merrick Garland—all recurring MAGA targets—planted evidence about him in the documents. “I can say this,” he said. “Those files were run by the worst scum on Earth. They were run by Comey, they were run by Garland, they were run by Biden and all of the people that actually ran the government, including the autopen. Those files were run for four years by those people. If they had anything (on Trump), I assume they would have released it.”","summary":"And suggests one woman Epstein “stole” was Virginia Giuffre.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-accuses-epstein-of-taking-people-from-his-mar-a-lago-spa","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6889341781bd8de7ef271829/16:9/w_4256,h_2394,c_limit/2183887423","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 21:02:59","author":"Bess Levin","authors":["Bess Levin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":346398942,"title":"Will ‘not anti-gun at all’ Newsom ban handguns in California?","text":"For context on just how popular the gun California would be banning is, there are over an estimated million Glock handguns in circulation in the state.

It also highlights the liberal impulse of punishing law-abiding citizens for the crimes of criminals, especially since California Democrats have weakened sentencing enhancements for criminals convicted of gun crimes.

More (Photo by John McDonnell/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nSkydance Media’s $8.4 billion merger with Paramount Global — a deal that’s finally set to close next week, after a protracted regulatory review and behind-the-scenes wrangling — will go down as one of the blockbuster business stories of the year. But to frame it exclusively as such, as merely a big-dollar business transaction, is to also miss the larger forces at play once the deal is done that will indirectly touch millions of Americans. Specifically, millions of news and media consumers.\n\nIn remarks to CNBC, for example, the Trump-appointed FCC chairman made clear that the Paramount-Skydance deal is about so much more than two companies consolidating assets. \"President Trump is fundamentally reshaping the media landscape,\" the FCC’s Brendan Carr told the channel on Friday, by way of contextualizing how the Trump administration actually views this merger. “The media industry across this country needs a course correction.”\n\nParamount–Skydance merger: Trump’s influence and FCC approval\n\nIn other words, the transaction is at least partly about using corporate power to realign how one of the nation’s most influential newsrooms operates — and by extension, how millions of Americans get their news – while President Trump, from the wings, calls at least some of the shots. “The new owners of CBS came in and said, 'It's time for a change,” Carr added. “‘We're going to reorient it towards getting rid of bias.’ At the end of the day, that's what made the difference for us.”\n\nThe merger officially closes August 7. By then, CBS News journalists (CBS being one of the most important assets under the Paramount name) will be working under a new regime led by Skydance CEO David Ellison, a chief who’s pledged that CBS editorial decisions will “reflect the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.” And many both inside and outside the network, no surprise, view those words as a warning, not a promise.\n\n“I fear the end of CBS as I knew it,” former CBS anchor Connie Chung told CNN Friday. “CBS was always a standalone network. It was autonomous. The news division was autonomous, and it was always unencumbered by pressures from politicians, including presidents, and unencumbered by bean counters. But now? I can see very clearly that the days that I remembered are long gone.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAnxiety has only deepened in the wake of recent events — from Paramount’s settlement of a lawsuit brought by President Trump over the editing of 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to the abrupt cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert just two days after the host called the 60 Minutes settlement a “big fat bribe” on air.\n\nCBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. (Photo by Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images)\nCBS via Getty Images\n\nDan Rather minced no words about it all in an interview with Variety. “What really gets me about this is that Paramount didn’t have to settle,” he said. “You settle a lawsuit when you’ve done something wrong. 60 Minutes did nothing wrong. It followed accepted journalistic practices. Lawyers almost unanimously said the case wouldn’t stand up in court.\n\n“Trump is now forcing a whole news organization to pay millions of dollars for doing something protected by the Constitution — which is, of course, free and independent reporting. Now, you take today’s sell-out. And that’s what it was: It was a sell-out to extortion by the President. Who can now say where all this ends?”\n\nJournalism and CBS News under the microscope in Paramount-Skydance deal\n\nCarr’s praise for Skydance’s Trump-friendly promises — like gutting the network’s diversity programs — make clear the degree to which political considerations shaped the FCC’s approval. Trump, for his part, has also claimed the $16 million settlement over his 60 Minutes lawsuit includes an additional $20 million in ads and public service announcements tied to causes he supports. Paramount denies any such deal, but many inside CBS see it as a “Trump tax” — a price paid to secure favor.\n\nThe timing of that payout, followed by Colbert’s cancellation, has only fueled fears that political pressure is driving editorial and related decisions. Ellison, who’s looking to slash $2 billion in expenses, has reportedly met with Bari Weiss, the Free Press founder known for her critiques of “woke” culture – and bringing her on in some sort of advisory capacity, as has been rumored, would definitely tilt CBS News toward a more conservative editorial stance.\n\nThat said, even as CBS wrestles with an ideological tug-of-war, not all voices under the Paramount banner are falling into lockstep. South Park returned to Comedy Central in recent days, with a premiere mocking Trump, the merger, and the controversial settlement — a reminder that, for now, some creators still have license to not just bite but devour the hand that feeds them.\n\nAt its core, the Skydance-Paramount merger is the sort of business deal that regularly plays out in the press; this one, specifically, has teased cost savings along with a more competitive streaming strategy for Paramount. For CBS News, it’s also kicking off a moment of crisis: Can the network maintain its reputation for independent journalism, when its new owners are pledging ideological recalibration to satisfy Trump’s regulators? That answer will unfold in the fullness of time, but one thing is clear for now: This merger reshapes the balance of power in American media at a time when the line between politics and journalism has never been as thin.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The Paramount–Skydance merger closes under Trump’s shadow, igniting fears that CBS News will be remade to fit a new political playbook.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/07/29/fcc-chair-sees-paramount-skydance-merger-reshaping-the-media-landscape/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68888352d14446d9fa8eeff3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 19:34:42","author":"Andy Meek,John McDonnell,Senior Contributor","authors":["Andy Meek","John McDonnell","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.067},{"id":346373282,"title":"Scott Jennings Breaks Down How He Went From Trump Skeptic To Fierce Supporter","text":"Republican strategist Scott Jennings explained on “The PBD Podcast” Tuesday why he became a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump after previously not comprehending his appeal.\n\n“The Daily Show” ran a segment posted to YouTube on Friday featuring Jennings criticizing Trump in the past before embracing the president. “The PBD Podcast” co-host Adam Sosnick mentioned the segment and asked Jennings what changed his opinion on Trump.

Smith, a White House special assistant, also explicitly tied the CCJ report's numbers to Trump's immigration policies.\n\nTolman and Smith write that \"what the report doesn't say out loud is that the timing is no coincidence.\" \n\n\"President Donald Trump is simply enforcing immigration laws already on the books—proof that we don't need more laws; we just need leaders with the backbone to enforce the laws we have,\" Tolman and Smith continued. \"The results are undeniable: communities nationwide are seeing tangible improvements in public safety.\"\n\nFirst, one must begin by congratulating the Trump administration on its sudden, enthusiastic embrace of crime statistics. Trump and his reelection campaign repeatedly claimed in 2024 that crime was spiking even though it had been generally dropping since 2022.\n\n\"Homicides Are Skyrocketing in American Cities Under Kamala Harris,\" the Trump campaign falsely declared last August.\n\nAt an October presidential debate, Trump claimed that \"crime in this country is through the roof.\" When a debate moderator told Trump that preliminary FBI data showed a steep drop in violent crime in 2024, Trump, as is his habit, called the numbers fake. \n\n\"They were defrauding statements,\" Trump shot back. \"They didn't include the cities with the worst crimes. It was a fraud.\"\n\nAs Reason's Jacob Sullum wrote, there were issues with the FBI crime data, which were eventually revised, but the data generally jibed with what other public safety researchers were reporting: that crime in 2024 was continuing to go down.\n\nNow that those numbers are politically useful, the Trump administration and its allies would like to take a very early victory lap. Tolman and Smith write:\n\nWhile violent crime fell, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] arrests surged—more than doubling in places like Sacramento and climbing over 500% in California overall. Nationwide, immigration arrests have already topped 300,000 in 2025 alone. That's not political theater. That's law enforcement doing its job.\nThis data shows the power of real deterrence, the effect of giving law enforcement respect and support to do their job. The fact that these historic drops occurred in the absence of passing new laws gives strong evidence to the power of simply letting law enforcement do their jobs. \n\nBut there is no evidence yet of any deterrent effect, or that crime is falling now because of the administration's mass deportation program, rather than for whatever reason it was falling in the past. Quantifying the effects of laws and law enforcement—and attempting to attribute causation to dips and spikes in crime—is a notoriously tricky problem in criminal justice research, and it usually takes years to collect and analyze the data.\n\nOn its face, the claim that Trump's immigration enforcement is driving down crime runs into the problem that most of the immigrants being arrested aren't criminals. About 60 percent of people arrested by ICE between January and June had no criminal record. In fact, the Trump administration's quotas for arrests and deportations have forced ICE and DHS to stop prioritizing investigations of criminal networks and serious offenders.\n\nThere may well be an incapacitative effect on crime from the scale of the Trump administration's mass deportations, but even then, it would likely be statistically minor. Most studies that have attempted to quantify how much the \"mass incarceration\" era contributed to the national drop in crime that began in the mid-'90s have pegged it somewhere between single digits and 25 percent. And that represented the largest buildup of prisons and prison populations in U.S. history.\n\nCrime also fell during the Obama administration and the second half of the Biden administration, but no one suggested that Joe Biden's executive order banning police chokeholds or Barack Obama's lax marijuana enforcement were responsible for safer cities.\n\nIn fact, quite the opposite. During the first Trump administration, then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that \"soft\" federal drug sentences during the Obama era led to a nationwide rise in violent crime in 2015, even though those changes may have resulted only in shorter sentences for around 500 federal drug offenders each year. \n\nThat 2015 rise in crime, by the way, turned out to be a blip in the overall downward trend, which continued until 2020. \n\nIt would be tempting to note who was president when murders spiked in 2020, but presidents and their policies do not control national crime rates, and if a politician or pundit claims otherwise, it's either wishful thinking or cynical opportunism.","summary":"The Department of Homeland Security is boasting that its mass deportation program is responsible for a major drop in crime.

Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n© 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nHow Is “golf Force One” Fortified?\n\nMultiple experts told The Telegraph the armored golf cart contains several tell-tale signs of being fortified, including a black band around the windshield. “The thing that gives it away is the front windscreen,” Gary Relf, who runs Armoured Car Services, a company that provides fortified vehicles to public figures and wealthy people, told the Telegraph, stating the vehicle appears to be armored. An unnamed British policing expert told The Telegraph the “side panels, doors, and the large panel at the rear above the load tray” also appear to be armored, stating the vehicle appears to be defensively fortified and is not offensive.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump’s debut of his fortified golf cart comes nearly a year after a man was charged with attempted assassination of the then-presidential candidate at his Florida golf course in West Palm Beach. In September 2024, prosecutors say 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted by Secret Service agents aiming a rifle at a member of Trump’s security detail while he golfed at the Trump International Golf Club. A Secret Service agent fired at Routh, who fled in his vehicle and was later caught and arrested. Routh was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and three other weapons charges. The incident happened two months after Trump survived an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.\n\nHow Else Has Trump Stepped Up Security?\n\nAfter the assassination attempts, Trump bolstered his security measures when making public appearances. Following the Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt, Trump began speaking behind bulletproof glass. Trump also reportedly appeared to be surrounded by more security agents following the attempts. In a Truth Social post in September, Trump blamed Iran for “threats on my life,” stating he is “surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before.” In September, Congress passed a bill boosting security for presidential candidates, which entitled Trump and then-Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to the same level of Secret Service protection as then-President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump’s visit to Scotland was expected to cost Scottish taxpayers millions to cover increased security, the Associated Press reported. His four-day stop in the United Kingdom in 2018 reportedly cost about $19 million for policing. Trump’s visit to Scotland sparked protests among locals, some of whom were angered at the cost his visit would impose on taxpayers.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n‘Why isn’t he paying?’ Trump’s golf visit to cost Scottish taxpayers (Associated Press)\n\nGolf Force One: Armour-plated cart follows Trump around course (The Telegraph)\n\nGot a tip?

The other 47. Like, 'we don't even matter, man.' When we hear, ‘We need to make sure we go after the working voter in Pennsylvania,’ and that's the key, do you know who hears that? Everybody you're not talking about. And I just think we ceded a lot of ground,\" Moore said. Moore argued that a lot of key Democratic voters felt taken for granted in 2024. \"And then we get upset, and then we're like, what happened with this group? What happened with that group? And they're saying like, ‘Yo, what happened to the party?’ I think there needs to be a real level setting about who is our base, man. And who are we fighting for? This is not a game for people. This is not game theory. This is not checkers. They're real life. These are real lives,\" Moore continued.

What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.Which young voters have dropped off?Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.Looking back and ahead…Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.Estimating small subgroups in pollsIn order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.","summary":"Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/29/9a1ed6ac-2023-4cf9-a046-563297f3657e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/9eeba1d4dacacbaca5930891d9507e7a/gettyimages-2226748747.jpg","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3915986_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-07-29 16:51:09","author":"Kabir Khanna","authors":["Kabir Khanna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":346358248,"title":"Cotswolds locals issue warning to JD Vance as VP set to arrive for holiday","text":"Amused locals in a Cotswolds town where unpopular US Vice President JD Vance is planning a family holiday have warned he'll have 'nowhere to park' - and believe he'll stay in one of several stunning mansions. The expected arrival of Donald Trump's deputy has caused a stir in Charlbury - with rumours rife among residents speculating on his choice of accommodation. Some believe he might stay in Lee Place, a Grade II* estate in the area built in 1640 with old links to Blenheim Palace, or in a mansion owned by the billionaire Bamford family. Others predict the VP will need the security and space offered by the nearby Cornbury Park, which will host Wilderness Festival this weekend. But all warned Vance his biggest problem will be navigating the narrow streets and finding suitable parking in and around the town during his expected stay in August. Neighbouring Clarkson’s Farm, Charlbury is the ‘checkpoint Charlie’ of the sprawling Cotswolds, the town’s vicar said. The community often sees high-profile visitors - including Kamala Harris, who visited the local Bull pub last week during Steve Jobs’ daughter Eve’s wedding. But news that Trump’s VP is expected to stay for a summer holiday in town has caused a stir among locals. Fergus Butler-Gallie, the town’s vicar who has lived in the area for 19 months, said: “I’m just hoping they bring us Al Gore and Dick Cheney next, we’ve almost completed the set. “We get all sorts of people here – we’ve got Mr Clarkson up the road. It’s noticeably got busier in the time I’ve been here.” It’s nice to be visited, and it’s good the town can maintain two pubs and several shops. There are a lot of places like ours which wouldn’t be able to keep that up. “We can, and of course that’s because of tourism. We do get a lot of tourists who have no idea where they are, really - they’ll come in and ask how to get to somewhere two counties across, because they seem to think the Cotswolds is some sort of theme park rather than a large region. “But I suspect Mr Vance’s people will be pretty thoroughly briefed.” The 33-year-old clergyman heads the town’s community centre programme, where locals donate excess food and outgrown school uniforms for members of the community in need. Mark Jones, a 67-year-old retired programme volunteer, said: “It’s a strong community in an interesting town. You get mostly locals during the week and lots of tourists coming from everywhere at the weekends. And there are lots of festivals every summer. “There’s so much going on in the community. I hope his visit goes well. I haven’t heard anything about protests - and I wouldn’t join them, either. When Kamala Harris visited last week, it seemed to go very quietly. Hopefully the same will happen again. The vice-president’s wife Usha found the country cottage they’re expected to settle in after visiting London in mid-August, the Telegraph reports. A local business owner said: “It’s the talk of the town. They’ve locked our local website forum so people can’t say any more about it. “If they come into my shop, I won’t bat an eyelid. I serve my customers. I’m just worried about the parking, all those secret service cars! Good luck to him - getting round these roads is no joke. They’ll have some fun with these lanes, getting around in a big car.” Currently cars are parked on both sides of the narrow streets, with residents saying Charlbury gets very easily congested - particularly during the summer season, when tourists come through the town to and from festivals and countryside retreats. A one-way system implemented for the last decade has been the only way of moving around the town centre, the locals added. Elizabeth Sparks, a local secondary school cover teacher who has lived in the area for 16 years, said: “I’m not worried about people like that. I don’t really think about it. The only thing I’m worried about are the cars. The other day, the bus driver came into the pub and said, ‘who drives the car with this particular number plate? You need to move it.’ He couldn’t drive past. “The bus gets stuck, it gets very hard to park. The residential parking makes that even harder - good luck to him.” Zena McGreavey, a 57-year-old exhibition officer at a museum in Oxford, has lived in the area for 18 months. She said: “There does seem to be a lot happening around here nowadays. It’s surprising they find us - Charlbury is such a hidden gem. People are talking about it in The Bull pub, it’s caused a stir - but I don’t think people mind him coming. There was a bit of confusion about where he’s going to be staying, people want to know.”","summary":"The expected arrival of Donald Trump's unpopular deputy has caused a stir in Charlbury - with rumours rife among residents speculating on his choice of accommodation","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cotswolds-locals-issue-warning-jd-35638772","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35640042.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_MAIN-JDVANCE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 16:50:21","author":"Adam Aspinall","authors":["Adam Aspinall"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.26},{"id":346365994,"title":"Nolte: CNNLOL Falsely Claims Manhattan Shooting Suspect ‘Possibly White’","text":"CNN, a far-left propaganda outlet that spreads disinformation and promotes violence against Jews, spread an obvious lie with the absurd claim that Monday’s Manhattan mass-shooting suspect was “possibly white.”\n\nYou cannot put a price on just how golden these moments are. Watching CNNLOL repeatedly implode is pure joy-porn. Within their little bubble, CNN apparently believes it can still impact and sway public opinion. Nothing else explains these delicious, ongoing moments of credibility-suicide. But that’s just not the case anymore. That might have been the case 15 years ago. These days, the only thing CNN accomplishes by spewing audacious lies is to suck more air out of the plastic bag already snugged over its doomed head.\n\nFor context, the photo of shooting suspect Shane Tamura was already out there. CNN had already seen the photo. We know that because CNNLOL’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller, references the photo and explains how law enforcement is using it to safely evacuate the building.\n\nNevertheless, here’s how CNN insulted the intelligence of the tens of viewers still dumb enough to watch Erin Burnett Tonight. Make sure you watch the full 58-second clip and note what doesn’t happen:\n\nBurnett: “Was his face visible? I mean, do they have any idea at this point who he is?”\nMiller: “They do not know who he is. They know he is a male, possibly white. He’s wearing sunglasses, he appears to have a mustache, and that picture has been distributed to every police officer in New York City, particularly has been sent to the phones of the search teams inside that building because whenever they encounter a group of people, the first thing they have to figure out is is that individual among these people, hiding among victims or pretending to be an office worker.” [emphasis added]\n\nLater in the segment, Burnett repeated the blatant lie that the suspect was “male, possibly white.”\n\nHere’s what didn’t happen during those 58 seconds. Although Miller directly refers to “that picture,” the split-screen does not show “that picture,” which is rather awkward, don’t you think? I do. It is common practice for producers to use the split-screen to display whatever is being referred to. If you don’t do that, you frustrate the viewer who wonders, What picture? What’s he talking about? Maybe Fox News will show me. *click* There it is.\n\nBut CNN chose not to show the photo, and I think we all know why. To push its fascist and divisive agenda, CNN wants the suspected shooter to be white. If he’s white, CNN can dry-hump the story for weeks. If he’s not white, the story must immediately be memory-holed. CNN would really like to dry-hump it.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same CNN that helped coin the ludicrous term “white Hispanic” to describe the Hispanic George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon Martin dead after precious-Trayvon jumped him and started beating his head against concrete.\n\nThis is also the same CNN that saw whole city blocks burning and declared the scene a “mostly-peaceful protest.”\n\nCNN and the rest of the regime media will never change. And Normal People should not want them to change. The enemy is destroying itself, so enjoy the show.\n\nRegardless, changing would be an admission that they had done wrong. That requires moral courage and a desire to tell the truth. That is not CNN. Nope.

Was that in the Paramount deal? I gotta call my agent. I have a very strict no-cancer clause!”\n\nHe then took aim at President Donald Trump.\n\nColbert honed in on one of President Trump’s entries on his Truth Social account where he blasted ABC and NBC, which he called arms of the Democrat Party, and hinted that their broadcast licenses “could and should be revoked.”\n\nColbert also brought up the president’s threat to prosecute Kamala Harris for using campaign funds to pay A-list entertainers, including Beyoncé, to perform at her presidential campaign stops.\n\nColbert, who has lost the network about $40 million every year practically since he took over the show in 2015, aired a satiric “response” to Trump’s accusation that Colbert said might have come from Beyoncé.\n\nIn his faux musical response, he pushed out a “song” linking Donald Trump to convicted sex predator Jeffrey Epstein. The lyrics of this fake Beyoncé song reads as follows:\n\nYou and Jeff, you and Jeff\nIf all of his files are released\nYou are f’ed\n\nYou needed a distraction quick\nFrom all these damning Epstein pics\nDon’t come for me like that\nI got a big ol’ bat\nDon’t you ever for a second\n\nThink we’ll forget\nYou’re a pedophile’s pal\n\nNo evidence has come forward proving that Donald Trump ever visited Jeffrey Epstein’s island retreat where prosecutors say sexual abuse of women and minors occurred.

One local, who has lived in the area for 16 years, said: “The only thing I’m worried about are the cars. “The other day, the bus driver came into the pub and said, ‘who drives the car with this particular number plate? You need to move it.’ He couldn’t drive past. “The bus gets stuck, it gets very hard to park. The residential parking makes that even harder - good luck to him.” Author Plum Sykes, who has a house in the Cotswolds, recently claimed she knew where the politician was staying. She said: \"The fact that JD Vance has rented this house in Charlbury... I have to say I secretly know the whole story, but I can't tell you. \"It's just so hot and so trendy and so fashionable... it's an incredibly beautiful area because it's being protected, almost like a national park that you can live in. \"Americans cannot get over the charm but since Covid it's been refashioned with all the pleasures of London, Paris and New York.\" Earlier this year, Charlbury was named as one of the best places to live in the country. As well as The Bull, voted Britain's best pub this year, there is also Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop and The Farmer's Dog pub, just a few minutes' drive away, and Soho Farmhouse. The area is also host to swanky events such as Wilderness Festival, which kicks off this Thursday. The four-day event, held at Cornbury Park near Finstock, just a mile from Charlbury, is branded the UK's \"poshest music festival\" and attracts a string of A-list celebrities every year. Cara Delevingne, Jodie Comer, Benedict Cumberbatch, Damian Lewis, Olivia Colman, David Cameron and Lady Amelia Windsor have previously descended on the luxurious gig, nicknamed \"poshstock\".","summary":"Donald Trump's deputy, JD Vance, is rumoured to have booked a country cottage in Cotswolds celebrity hotstop Charlbury for his family holiday next month","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/jd-vance-given-major-cotswolds-35638315","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35613816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_Vance-25197657684332.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 15:02:44","author":"Isobel Dickinson","authors":["Isobel Dickinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.161},{"id":346319658,"title":"Stephen Colbert mocks Paramount, Skydance merger with vulgar monologue","text":"Late-night host Stephen Colbert took aim at his employer again on Monday, mocking the Paramount-SkyDance merger with pee jokes after his show was canceled by the network. \"I’m thrilled for everyone at Paramount that the deal went through and very excited for our newly announced official combined Paramount-Skydance stock ticker name, which will go from 'PARA' to 'PSKY.'

Urkel! ‘Did he do that?’ No, Jon, no, he didn’t. He was nowhere near the towers that day,” an Emmy-nominated star joked about the famous child actor who appeared on the '90s sitcom “Family Matters.”\n\nSteve Urkel, a character played by Jaleel White, became associated with the catchphrase “Did I do that?” which typically followed acts of clumsiness.\n\nWilliams joked that Trump may even start going after other notorious Black celebrities, including Michael Jordan and Michael B. Jordan.\n\n“He better watch his back. I’m scared for him,” she teased about an imaginary “Michael C Jordan” on the topic. \n\nWilliams, an actor and a comedian, formerly appeared as a series regular on the Nickelodeon series “Just for Kicks” in 2006, before becoming The Daily Show's youngest correspondent at 22 years old in 2012.\n\nEarlier in the show, Stewart spoke on the Epstein scandal after the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, met with Ghislaine Maxwell last week. The former socialite is currently serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom, and abuse underage girls.\n\nThe talk show host then suggested that the president is trying to downplay his relationship with Epstein and any mishandling of the documents relating to the disgraced financier’s case. \n\nDuring the show, Stewart showed a Truth Social post, where Trump lashed out at Beyoncé, Oprah, and former Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday, demanding that “they should all be prosecuted!” for “illegally endorsing” the Democrats in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Kamala, and all of those that received endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW,” Trump wrote. \n\nWilliams, who joined in at the end of the segment, called out the president’s “b*****t” before adding that she had “had it with Trump.”\n\n“He’s got to come clean about Epstein,” she insisted.\n\nIt was reported earlier this month that in May, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump that his name appeared in the files.\n\nThe president has since filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal’s parent companies, News Corp and Dow Jones, following the newspaper’s publication of the president’s alleged birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe president has consistently denied any wrongdoing regarding his friendship with Epstein. \n\nOn Sunday, Trump suggested that the Democrats are focused on conspiracy theories.\n\nHe claimed that “all they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense.”\n\nThe president is currently on his final day of his visit to Scotland, where he told a reporter to scrap any ideas of his alleged involvement.\n\n \"Oh, you gotta be kidding with that,\" Trump said. \"No, had nothing to do with it.

The Justice Department alleged that Page did not maintain an accurate voter list in violation of the Help America Vote Act, a 2002 law that made sweeping reforms to the country’s voting process.\n\nBut Page, through the county counsel’s response filed last week, denied those allegations.\n\nThe issue stems from information requested by the Justice Department. The federal government’s lawsuit said the attorney general requested on June 2 documents from January 2020 that showed the number of voter registration records in Orange County that have been canceled because the registrant did not meet citizenship requirements and more information about each cancelation, including copies of the application, voting history and related correspondence sent or received by the county registrar related to the registration.\n\nPage responded to the request but redacted certain personal and sensitive information, including driver’s license or state ID numbers, Social Security numbers, language preferences, race and signature images, both the initial lawsuit and the response from county counsel said.\n\nThe Justice Department said the redacted data “prohibits the attorney general from making an accurate assessment” of the registrar’s compliance with election laws. It also said Page relied on state law for the basis of the redactions, which it said is preempted by federal law.\n\nBut correspondence between representatives for the Justice Department and legal counsel for the registrar’s office — obtained and reviewed by the Southern California News Group — showed there was an effort made by the registrar to provide the “sensitive information,” just in a manner that would include “assurances that such sensitive personal identifiers will remain confidential and be used for government purposes only.”\n\nAnd Page’s attorneys argued “that the unprotected disclosure of such sensitive personal information without a subpoena or court order is prohibited by California and federal law.”\n\nPage also said, through the filing, that he must comply with regulations promulgated by the California secretary of state, “which establishes standards and procedures for processing, transmitting, and maintaining voter registration records in a manner that conforms with the statewide voter registration system requirements” set by federal and state law.\n\n“California law is very clear about what information election officials can release,” said Jim Patrick, a spokesperson for the California secretary of state’s office.\n\n“California election officials cannot release driver’s license numbers, and our understanding is the DOJ was not willing to work with Orange County to find a solution,” Patrick said. “Bob Page is a dedicated public servant who treats all of his constituents fairly, and he always follows the law to a T.”\n\nPage acknowledged in the filing that U.S. citizenship is a qualification for registering and voting in California, noting that no charter city in Orange County allows non-citizens to vote in local elections.\n\nHe stated in the filing that he evaluates voter registrations for eligibility and rejects or cancels those of individuals who do not meet the requirements, including if a registrant cannot certify that they are a U.S. citizen.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nBut in a statement announcing the lawsuit, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said that “states and counties that refuse to disclose all requested voter information are in violation of well-established federal elections laws.”\n\n“Removal of non-citizens from the state’s voter rolls is critical to ensuring that the state’s voter rolls are accurate and that elections in California are conducted without fraudulent voting,” Dhillon said. “The Department of Justice will hold jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal voting laws accountable.”\n\nAllegations of non-citizens and dogs receiving ballots\n\nNotably, the Justice Department’s lawsuit is led by Dhillon, the former vice chair of the California Republican Party; Bill Essayli, a U.S. attorney and former Inland state legislator; and Michael Gates, the Huntington Beach city attorney turned deputy assistant attorney general.\n\nAnd this lawsuit isn’t the first time Gates has questioned Page over the possibility of non-citizens voting.\n\nWhile still the Huntington Beach city attorney, Gates posted a photo on X of a ballot that he said was mailed to someone who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years but is a non-citizen and has never voted before. The name and most of the Huntington Beach address are blurred out in the photo, which appears to be a mail ballot envelope from the Orange County registrar of voters.\n\nGates, in the October post, said he reported the ballot to the registrar. It is unclear whether it is the same ballot referenced in the Justice Department’s lawsuit.\n\nGates also emailed Page twice in October regarding “suspicious” ballots, according to records obtained by the Southern California News Group.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Gates told Page he had spoken with someone who said their father-in-law, who is not a U.S. citizen, had received an official ballot in the mail. Gates sent a photo of the ballot and asked if the registrar had any information about that person’s citizenship status and if they were registered to vote.\n\nPage said he forwarded the information to the California secretary of state to investigate. He also provided an application for voter registration information to address his question about whether a specific person is registered to vote.\n\nWhile the name and address of this ballot were fully redacted, it appears to mirror the one Gates posted on his X account a day after he sent the email to Page. A spokesperson for the secretary of state said they could not comment on the existence of referrals.\n\nTen days later, Gates reached out with another concern, noting “this one is a little harder to believe.” Gates said someone told him her dog had received an official ballot in Costa Mesa, and he again asked if the registrar had any information about the recipient’s citizenship status and if they were registered to vote.\n\nPage said the concern was forwarded to the district attorney, noting that “it is a felony to knowingly and willfully sign and submit a voter registration affidavit for a nonexistent person, including an animal.” Page again said voter registration information is confidential and only disclosable for certain uses if an application for voter registration information is submitted, and he again provided the application.\n\nGates never filled out those applications, Page said.\n\nThe case of the alleged dog’s ballot is still under investigation, said Kimberly Edds, a spokesperson for the district attorney’s office.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a question about whether Gates’ prior questioning of potential non-citizens voting in Orange County could potentially make him a witness in the case.\n\nGates also did not respond to a text message regarding his involvement in the lawsuit.\n\nGates, as Huntington Beach’s city attorney, supported the city’s effort to establish its own voter ID law and sued California over sanctuary policies that restrict the use of state and local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement. In announcing his appointment to the Justice Department, Gates vowed Huntington Beach’s fights will not be “lessened or weakened,” adding that the city’s “adversaries” should know, “Huntington Beach will continue to fight aggressively, and the city will ultimately prevail.”\n\nThe Justice Department, according to the Washington Post, has been ramping up requests for multiple states’ voter rolls. Those requests have left election officials from both parties concerned about what the federal government plans to do with that information, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIt is up to states and local jurisdictions to run the ins and outs of elections. In California, it’s an elected secretary of state who is in charge of overseeing elections, including certifying the lists of who is running for state offices, coordinating tabulation of votes for each county on election night and preparing voter information in various languages, among other things.\n\nOrange County voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump, 49.7% to 47.1%, in the 2024 presidential election. More than 1.4 million people cast a ballot in Orange County in that election.\n\nStaff writer Michael Slaten contributed to this report.","summary":"Before he joined the DOJ, Michael Gates questioned the registrar about multiple 'suspicious' ballots, including one allegedly sent to a dog.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/07/29/orange-county-elections-chief-maintains-he-followed-law-with-justice-departments-request-for-non-citizen-information/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OCR-L-REGISTRARSUIT-0729.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 14:00:31","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":346301636,"title":"How John Swinney and Donald Trump struck up an unlikely bromance during the President's Scotland trip","text":"John Swinney’ s unlikely friendship with Donald Trump was forged over a dinner of langoustine and beef at the President’s golf club in Balmedie. The pair sat next to each other and the SNP leader used the opportunity to charm and flatter the leader of the free world. They exchanged anecdotes about the late Sir Sean Connery and Swinney gently lobbied to exempt the whisky industry from crippling tariffs. Keir Starmer had left the dinner early and Swinney ended up getting two hours face time at the private event - more than the Prime Minister. Swinney was then invited by Trump to a family breakfast the next morning that included the President’s sons Don Jnr and Eric, who is in charge of the Scottish golf businesses. At one point, Swinney showed Trump a picture of his teenage son Matthew playing golf in Tiree, to which the President replied by saying the First Minister’s child had a “beautiful” swing. Later in the day Trump , never a man to pay false compliments, gushed about Swinney ahead of opening his third course in Scotland. He described Swinney as a “really special guy” and - to the surprise of the First Minister’s advisers - even claimed he “loves golf”. Swinney later joked: “I am aware of golf.” Their bromance is remarkable given Trump’s five day trip could have been a disaster for Swinney . He endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris at the 2024 presidential election and earned a rebuke last year from Eric Trump, who said: “I mean, obviously [ Swinney ] read the temperature very wrong. He got it wrong. He got it very wrong because my father won decisively. “And so, you know, endorsing a person three days before an election in a different country, and missing the mark by as much as it was missed by, you know, he read the tea leaves incorrectly. “Again, my father adores Scotland , and you have a First Minister coming out and just being fairly nasty in the days leading up.\" The US President also hates tax, loathes renewable energy and is openly scornful of trans rights. In his time in Government, Swinney has backed income tax rises, supported offshore wind projects and defended law changes to help trans people. He is exactly the sort of politician Trump routinely denounces as “crazy left” in the US. In avoiding a public spanking from Trump , Swinney learned lessons from the humiliation meted out to President Zelensky in the Oval Office in February. Trump is the vainest man on the planet and wants credit when he puts his hand in his pocket to assist on international affairs. Zelensky did not thank Trump in front of the cameras for the aid provided to Ukraine by the US and he let rip. By contrast, Swinney thanked Trump for his family’s investment in Scotland and for providing aid to Gaza. The soft soap approach worked. Older hands also believe Trump’s long memory may be responsible for the positive relationship with Swinney . In 2007, Swinney as SNP Finance Secretary ‘called in’ Trump’s application for the golfing development in Aberdeenshire after opposition by the local council. The project was given the go-ahead and the SNP Government of the day was accused of favouring Trump. As a result of dining with Trump , the First Minister now believes there is an outside chance of the US chiselling down the tariffs on whisky ahead of the second state visit in September. Swinney will take his case to the US ambassador to the UK after concluding that Starmer has not prioritised the whisky industry in discussions on a trade deal. Various world leaders have crashed and burned after receiving public maulings by Trum p. Small acts of resistance by other countries against the US have prompted Trump to threaten even greater sanctions. Swinney will have been worried on Friday that he was in line to receive the same treatment but both sides have left the resort happy. The US may keep a 10% tariff on whisky and Trump will no doubt continue to aim barbs at the “windmills” he believes sully the landscape. But no damage has been done by Trump ’s visit and the links between Scotland and the US have been strengthened.

It also said Page relied on state law for the basis of the redactions, which it said is preempted by federal law.\n\nBut correspondence between representatives for the Justice Department and legal counsel for the registrar’s office — obtained and reviewed by the Southern California News Group — showed there was an effort made by the registrar to provide the “sensitive information,” just in a manner that would include “assurances that such sensitive personal identifiers will remain confidential and be used for government purposes only.”\n\nAnd Page’s attorneys argued “that the unprotected disclosure of such sensitive personal information without a subpoena or court order is prohibited by California and federal law.”\n\nPage also said, through the filing, that he must comply with regulations promulgated by the California secretary of state, “which establishes standards and procedures for processing, transmitting, and maintaining voter registration records in a manner that conforms with the statewide voter registration system requirements” set by federal and state law.\n\n“California law is very clear about what information election officials can release,” said Jim Patrick, a spokesperson for the California secretary of state’s office.\n\n“California election officials cannot release driver’s license numbers, and our understanding is the DOJ was not willing to work with Orange County to find a solution,” Patrick said. “Bob Page is a dedicated public servant who treats all of his constituents fairly, and he always follows the law to a T.”\n\nPage acknowledged in the filing that U.S. citizenship is a qualification for registering and voting in California, noting that no charter city in Orange County allows non-citizens to vote in local elections.\n\nHe stated in the filing that he evaluates voter registrations for eligibility and rejects or cancels those of individuals who do not meet the requirements, including if a registrant cannot certify that they are a U.S. citizen.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nBut in a statement announcing the lawsuit, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said that “states and counties that refuse to disclose all requested voter information are in violation of well-established federal elections laws.”\n\n“Removal of non-citizens from the state’s voter rolls is critical to ensuring that the state’s voter rolls are accurate and that elections in California are conducted without fraudulent voting,” Dhillon said. “The Department of Justice will hold jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal voting laws accountable.”\n\nAllegations of non-citizens and dogs receiving ballots\n\nNotably, the Justice Department’s lawsuit is led by Dhillon, the former vice chair of the California Republican Party; Bill Essayli, a U.S. attorney and former Inland state legislator; and Michael Gates, the Huntington Beach city attorney turned deputy assistant attorney general.\n\nAnd this lawsuit isn’t the first time Gates has questioned Page over the possibility of non-citizens voting.\n\nWhile still the Huntington Beach city attorney, Gates posted a photo on X of a ballot that he said was mailed to someone who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years but is a non-citizen and has never voted before. The name and most of the Huntington Beach address are blurred out in the photo, which appears to be a mail ballot envelope from the Orange County registrar of voters.\n\nGates, in the October post, said he reported the ballot to the registrar. It is unclear whether it is the same ballot referenced in the Justice Department’s lawsuit.\n\nGates also emailed Page twice in October regarding “suspicious” ballots, according to records obtained by the Southern California News Group.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Gates told Page he had spoken with someone who said their father-in-law, who is not a U.S. citizen, had received an official ballot in the mail. Gates sent a photo of the ballot and asked if the registrar had any information about that person’s citizenship status and if they were registered to vote.\n\nPage said he forwarded the information to the California secretary of state to investigate. He also provided an application for voter registration information to address his question about whether a specific person is registered to vote.\n\nWhile the name and address of this ballot were fully redacted, it appears to mirror the one Gates posted on his X account a day after he sent the email to Page. A spokesperson for the secretary of state said they could not comment on the existence of referrals.\n\nTen days later, Gates reached out with another concern, noting “this one is a little harder to believe.” Gates said someone told him her dog had received an official ballot in Costa Mesa, and he again asked if the registrar had any information about the recipient’s citizenship status and if they were registered to vote.\n\nPage said the concern was forwarded to the district attorney, noting that “it is a felony to knowingly and willfully sign and submit a voter registration affidavit for a nonexistent person, including an animal.” Page again said voter registration information is confidential and only disclosable for certain uses if an application for voter registration information is submitted, and he again provided the application.\n\nGates never filled out those applications, Page said.\n\nThe case of the alleged dog’s ballot is still under investigation, said Kimberly Edds, a spokesperson for the district attorney’s office.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a question about whether Gates’ prior questioning of potential non-citizens voting in Orange County could potentially make him a witness in the case.\n\nGates also did not respond to a text message regarding his involvement in the lawsuit.\n\nGates, as Huntington Beach’s city attorney, supported the city’s effort to establish its own voter ID law and sued California over sanctuary policies that restrict the use of state and local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement. In announcing his appointment to the Justice Department, Gates vowed Huntington Beach’s fights will not be “lessened or weakened,” adding that the city’s “adversaries” should know, “Huntington Beach will continue to fight aggressively, and the city will ultimately prevail.”\n\nThe Justice Department, according to the Washington Post, has been ramping up requests for multiple states’ voter rolls. Those requests have left election officials from both parties concerned about what the federal government plans to do with that information, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIt is up to states and local jurisdictions to run the ins and outs of elections. In California, it’s an elected secretary of state who is in charge of overseeing elections, including certifying the lists of who is running for state offices, coordinating tabulation of votes for each county on election night and preparing voter information in various languages, among other things.\n\nOrange County voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump, 49.7% to 47.1%, in the 2024 presidential election. More than 1.4 million people cast a ballot in Orange County in that election.\n\nStaff writer Michael Slaten contributed to this report.","summary":"Before he joined the DOJ, Michael Gates questioned the registrar about multiple 'suspicious' ballots, including one allegedly sent to a dog.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/29/orange-county-elections-chief-maintains-he-followed-law-with-justice-departments-request-for-non-citizen-information/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OCR-L-REGISTRARSUIT-0729.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 12:30:42","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":346267342,"title":"Group calls on Trump to slap ‘tough tariffs’ on China in ‘Screwed’ ad","text":"The PAI ad urges Trump to pursue “tough tariffs” on China in order to “bring manufacturing back home and restore balance to an unfair system that lets China get too close to our food supply.” \n\nThe 30-second ad starts with the narrator contending, “China put a target on our back, taking aim at factories and farms.”\n\n“When they control our jobs and our food supply, they control our future,” the narrator says. “But when China tried to screw us, Trump put the screws to China, and it’s working.”\n\nThe ad concludes by imploring the audience to “stand with President Trump” and “stand with Made in America.”\n\nThe latest PAI ad coincides with the Trump administration’s National Farm Security Action Plan, which is being circulated this month. The plan proposes policies to protect U.S. farmland, food supply chains, and critical research from foreign adversaries. For example, it would prevent Chinese nationals from purchasing farmland and the Department of Agriculture from contracting certain foreign nationals and entities.\n\n“We feed the world. We lead the world. And we’ll never let foreign adversaries control our land, our labs, or our livelihoods,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a statement at the time. “This action plan puts America’s farmers, families, and future first — exactly where they belong.”\n\nThe plan was released one month after two Chinese researchers were charged with plotting to smuggle a toxic fungus capable of poisoning crops and people into a University of Michigan lab, exacerbating national security concerns over agroterrorism.\n\nPAI has commissioned multiple ads encouraging Trump and Republicans to counter threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party, from another six-figure spot in May called “Together,” which also underscored the importance of safeguarding the U.S. food supply to Congress, to another in January called “Stand with Trump,” which targeted GOP state legislators regarding the same. Other spots have criticized China for its inaction concerning fentanyl trafficking and then-Vice President Kamala Harris for “opening the door to China.”\n\nIn addition to ads, PAI conducted polling last month that reported a majority of U.S. voters would prefer retailers to “eat” the costs of Trump’s tariffs. Before that, the coalition pitched a policy blueprint to lawmakers related to the CCP in April and held a roundtable before last year’s election with Trump and Pennsylvania farmers about the risks posed by communist China.\n\nFounder Grenell was one of Trump’s ambassadors to Germany before becoming acting director of national intelligence during the president’s first administration. He has returned to Trump’s second administration as the special presidential envoy for special missions and the president and executive director of the Kennedy Center.

These negotiations are expected to end with a three-month extension of the Aug. 12 deadline for resolving the ongoing trade dispute. Other countries have until Friday before historically high tariffs take effect.\n\nThe U.S. currently imposes tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the country at a rate of 51%, while China imposes a 32.6% duty on U.S. exports. Levies could increase to 145% if the two countries do not reach a deal.\n\n“Sometimes I’ll do something that I shouldn’t do because it’s not very important for our country, but it’s very meaningful for the country on the other side,” Trump said last weekend in Scotland.\n\nOn Monday, the president expressed optimism about a deal with China, telling reporters he would “love to see China open up their country.”\n\n“We have a good relationship with China,” he said. “China is tough… We all are tough.

And why don’t they like each other?\n\nRead on for our timeline of their ongoing rows and swipes and how things are continue to rumble to this day.\n\nThings initially kicked off between the pair as early as 2015 when then London Mayor hopeful Sadiq Khan had something to say about a planned policy Trump had declared while on the campaign trail, during this first stint as US President.\n\nDonald Trump upset an entire religion when he made sweeping statements about Muslims, and said that he would make a presidential campaign pledge to ban Muslims from the US.\n\nSadiq Khan, a Muslim himself, said it was an “outrageous policy” and spoke of his desire to see him lose.\n\nKhan was elected into office and became London’s mayor - which meant that he would be coming into direct contact with Trump, if elected into the White House.\n\nAfter Khan was elected as winner, Trump suggested the London mayor would be exempt from his proposed travel ban on Muslims, saying he would “make an exception”, adding that he believed the appointment of Khan was a “good thing”.\n\nBut this did not go down well in the UK capital, with Khan hitting back accusing Trump of playing into the hands of extremist Muslims with his “ignorant” comments.\n\nKhan told the BBC: “I think Donald Trump has ignorant views about Islam. It is not just about me. I don’t want to be the exception to be allowed to go into America.\n\n“It’s not about me. It’s about my friends, my family and others from all over the world.\n\n“My concern is he is playing into the hands of extremists who say its not compatible to be western and be mainstream Muslim.”\n\nTrump hit back warning Khan he had a long memory, saying: “I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements.”\n\nFollowing terrorist attacks in Borough Market and around London Bridge, Trump hit out at Khan again, and appeared to say he was not taking the atrocities seriously enough as a leader of London.\n\nEight people were killed and many more injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market.\n\nThe terrorists were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes.\n\nTrump hit out at Khan’s management of the situation on Twitter, saying it was ridiculous that he had told the public there was “no reason to be alarmed”, but this quote was incorrect.\n\nKhan had actually said in a statement that the public should not be alarmed by the increased police presence on London’s streets, as the officers were there to provide support and a visible presence.\n\nKhan released another statement saying he “had more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks”.\n\nTrump followed up with another tweet, saying this was a “pathetic excuse” that he had come up with.\n\nIn June, Khan made calls for the UK Government to cancel a planned visit by Trump and said he had no idea what the issue was with him.”\n\nHe said in an interview with the Guardian: “We’re not schoolchildren. He’s the president of the United States, so I’m unclear what his beef is with me.”\n\nThe UK Government did not cancel Trump’s visit.\n\nKhan’s London Mayor office then gave permission for anti-Trump activists to fly a protest blimp of Trump as a crying baby in a nappy.\n\nProtests took place when Trump arrived in the UK, includng the blimp which Khan’s office had okayed, which flew above Westminster during marches and protests.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump said Khan was doing a “terrible job” knocking down on crime statistics for the capital.\n\nTrump was accused of trying to influence the UK General Election, by backing the-then Conservative party leader Boris Johnson.\n\nHe defied diplomatic agreements to stay out of elections in other nations and in The Sun, backed Johnson to succeed former leader Theresa May.\n\nIn the same chat he also hit out at the Duchess of Sussex, calling Meghan Markle “nasty”.\n\nKhan, waded into the debate, calling the American leader a”racist”.\n\nHe said: “This is a man who also tried to exploit Londoners’ fears following a horrific terrorist attack on our city, amplified the tweets of a British far-right racist group, denounced as fake news the robust scientific evidence warning of the dangers of climate change, and is now trying to interfere shamelessly in the Conservative party leadership race by backing Boris Johnson because he believes it would enable him to gain an ally in Number 10 for his divisive agenda.\n\n“President Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat. The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years.”\n\nJeremy Corbyn also spoke on the events, adding: “President Trump’s attempt to decide who will be Britain’s next prime minister is an entirely unacceptable interference in our country’s democracy. The next prime minister should be chosen not by the US president, nor by 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative party members, but by the British people in a general election.”\n\nTrump hit back, describing Khan as “a stone cold loser” and “very dumb”.\n\nKhan’s office accused Trump of “childish insults” .\n\nThe war of words went quiet as Trump left office in January 2021, after serving his first term as US President.\n\nWhen it became clear that Trump was running to serve a second term as US President, Khan was quick to issue warnings publicly.\n\nKhan denounced Trump and urged people to vote for Kamala Harris as he sat down for an interview with POLITICO in New York.\n\nHe warned that the “world was watching” and warned electing Trump would have “far reaching” consequences for the globe.\n\nIn November, when Trump won his second term, Khan again spoke out and said many Londoners would be \"fearful\" about what it would \"mean for democracy\".\n\nHe did however backtrack and said he \"wanted to work closely with the American president\" ahead of his inauguration in January.\n\nThe London mayor said as somebody \"who believes in democracy, and voting and elections, we should recognise the fact that Donald Trump is the elected president of the United States\".\n\nBut he added: \"Let's keep our fingers crossed that this president is different from the last time he was president.\"\n\nIn the last week, Trump has reignited the pair’s row, calling Khan a \"nasty person\" who has done \"a terrible job\".\n\nDuring time spent with Sir Keir Starmer in Scotland, he called Khan a “nasty person”.\n\nAsked if he would visit London during his official state visit in September, Trump said: \"I will, I'm not a fan of your mayor, I think he's done a terrible job.\n\n\"A nasty person, I think.\"\n\nKeir Starter did then jump into the conversation to stop it escalating, claiming \"He's a friend of mine.\"\n\nBut the president added: \"I think he's done a terrible job but I will certainly visit London, I hope so.\"\n\nKhan responded in an official statement, saying: \"Sadiq is delighted that President Trump wants to come to the greatest city in the world.\n\n\"He'd see how our diversity makes us stronger not weaker; richer, not poorer.\n\n\"Perhaps these are the reasons why a record number of Americans have applied for British citizenship under his presidency.\"","summary":"The pair’s ongoing war of words goes back a decade","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-donald-trump-nasty-person-timeline-fued-b1240502.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/11/06/10/2013cfa8c0dc8dd4418d7ebf5b21a7feY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzMwOTc1MTUz-2.30178493.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 11:45:33","author":"Sian Baldwin","authors":["Sian Baldwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":346252296,"title":"Washington Post reeling from buyout exodus as bosses hope to turn the page at embattled paper","text":"The latest round of buyouts at The Washington Post is hollowing out the paper of its most high-profile staffers as current management aims for an editorial overhaul and a financial turnaround. Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray announced its Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in May, hoping that most veteran staffers would be enticed by the exit offer. And it's working. \"It kind of shows the crazy incentives at play,\" one Post staffer told Fox News Digital. \"There is a lot of great talent left, and we've been beating everyone on the federal government story, but it's going to be another talent drain.\" According to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. All of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). LONGTIME WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKER TAKES BUYOUT, SAYS PAPER HAS YET TO FIND REPLACEMENT BEFORE EXIT \"It's been a bloodbath on editorial,\" the Post staffer said. Some of the paper's biggest names in the opinion pages have taken buyouts, including Jonathan Capehart and Catherine Rampell (both notably MSNBC weekend hosts) as well as Perry Bacon Jr. and Philip Bump. The exodus from the editorial pages was also likely fueled by the Post's billionaire owner Jeff Bezos and his initiative to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" while vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. WASHINGTON POST ABANDONS NEWSROOM INTEGRATION FOR ITS SOCIAL MEDIA-FOCUSED ‘WP VENTURES’ DIVISION Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah appeared to swipe the lack of diversity on the paper's editorial team as a result of the buyouts, posting on X \"So.. officially, I'm the last Black staff columnist left in the Washington Post's opinion section.\" The buyouts, however, are having a huge impact throughout the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper. Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post's longtime fact checker, announced his exit Monday and its Supreme Court reporter Ann Marimow has joined The New York Times. Even most of the Post's obituary team have reportedly taken buyouts. The Post scrapped its so-called \"third newsroom,\" dubbed WP Ventures, that aimed to capture social media users. Veteran Post editor Krissah Thompson, who was tapped to lead the now-defunct division after its launch last year, also took a buyout and the paper's viral TikTok personality Dave Jorgenson also left the company. Earlier this month, Washington Post CEO Will Lewis sent a memo to staff issuing an ultimatum for those contemplating whether to adapt to the paper's new direction. \"The moment demands that we continue to rethink all aspects of our organization and business to maximize our impact,\" Lewis wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"If we want to reconnect with our audience and continue to defend democracy, more changes at The Post will be necessary. And to succeed, we need to be united as a team with a strong belief and passion in where we are heading.\" \"I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,\" Lewis continued. \"That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that. The VSP is designed to support you in making this decision, give you the ability to weigh your options thoughtfully and with less concern about financial consequences. And if you think that it’s time to move on to a new chapter, the VSP helps you take that next step with more security.\" WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFF WHO DON'T ‘FEEL ALIGNED’ WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT The Post staffer seemed skeptical the jarring editorial pivot would bear the fruit that the bosses were hoping for. \"So far they don't have much to show for their efforts,\" the staffer said. \"Subscribers fled. Traffic is falling. The third newsroom is dead. Scores of brand-name reporters and editors have left. If there are bright spots, I haven't seen them yet.\" Others who left the Post had some choice parting words. Longtime columnist Joe Davidson claimed he had a piece spiked because was it was \"deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy\" and called out Bezos' \"unseemly and well-document[ed] coziness\" with President Donald Trump. Editorial board member Eduardo Porter said he was a \"bad fit for this ideological turn\" and that Bezos and his team \"are taking the paper down a path I cannot follow,\" risking turning The Post \"into something more akin to a church, with tight constraints on thought.\" There have been multiple waves of exits from the Post over the past year, beginning last October when Bezos blocked the paper's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election. Bezos further enraged staff with his editorial directive in February that resulted in the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley. Both instances also sparked mass cancellations of reader subscriptions. The Post has since hired Adam O'Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to replace Shipley as opinion editor. In his announcement, O'Neal echoed Bezos' mission of being \"stalwart advocates of free markets and personal liberties,\" adding the opinion pages will be \"unapologetically patriotic\" and will not be lecturing its readers. Politico has a running list of over 100 Post employees who have left the paper since last fall, many of them joining rival papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as well as outlets like The Atlantic and CNN.

The First Minister made his pitch during a dinner with the Republican politician on the site of his golf course in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire. Trump is on the last leg of a five day trip to Scotland which included visits to his golf clubs at Turnberry and in the North East. Swinney , who backed the Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential contest, had two separate sets of discussions with the President. He is understood to have spoken to Trump for around two hours at the private dinner on Monday evening . With the UK in line for 10% tariffs on imports to the US, the First Minister lobbied an exemption for whisky. An SNP Government source said a “window of opportunity” exists between now and Trump’s state visit to the UK in September to rethink the tariffs on whisky. The insider said: “It is certainly on the President ’s radar in a way it was not before”. Trump himself said at Turnberry on Monday that he would “look” at concerns over tariffs on the iconic Scottish product. The First Minister previously said the tariffs were currently costing the local whisky industry £4m a week. On Tuesday morning , ahead of the President opening a second course at Balmedie, he and Swinney met for breakfast. They were joined by Trump ’s sons Eric and Don Jnr where the crisis in Gaza was raised by the First Minister. He welcomed the aid provided for Gaza by the US and told Trump he is uniquely placed to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. In a sign of the warm relations between Trump and Swinney during the trip, the President singled him out for praise before he cut the ribbon on the new course. He asked Swinney to stand up in front of assembled guests and referred to him as a “very special guy”.

It's noticeably got busier in the time I've been here.'\n\n'It's nice to be visited, and it's good the town can maintain two pubs and several shops. There are a lot of places like ours which wouldn't be able to keep that up.\n\n'We can, and of course that's because of tourism.'\n\nHe says tourists often arrive having now idea where they are, assuming ' the Cotswolds is some sort of theme park rather than a large region'.\n\n'But I suspect Mr Vance's people will be pretty thoroughly briefed,' he added.\n\nCurrently cars are parked on both sides of the narrow streets, with residents saying the market town becomes very easily congested.\n\nAnd the parking chaos becomes worse during the summer season, when tourists come through the town to and from festivals and countryside retreats.\n\nTo add to traffic woes, the only way of moving around the town centre for the last decade has been one-way system, according to locals.\n\nA local business owner said the high profile American family's visit was the 'talk of the town'.\n\n'They've locked our local website forum so people can't say any more about it,' they said. 'If they come into my shop, I won't bat an eyelid. I serve my customers.\n\n'I'm just worried about the parking, all those secret service cars! Good luck to him - getting round these roads is no joke.\n\n'They'll have some fun with these lanes, getting around in a big car.'\n\nElizabeth Sparks, a local secondary school cover teacher who has lived in the area for 16 years, said she too was mainly worried about the cars that came with the VP.\n\n'The other day, the bus driver came into the pub and said, 'who drives the car with this particular number plate? You need to move it.' He couldn't drive past.\n\n'The bus gets stuck, it gets very hard to park.

Cooper also won his gubernatorial races in 2016 and 2020, even as Trump won at the presidential level.\n\nOutside of one or two other state Democrats, Douglas Wilson, a Democratic strategist based in North Carolina, said Cooper was “the most successful democratic statewide official that has been able to govern and get elected in a purple state that’s center-right, that Trump won three times.”\n\n“And he has also been able to do a lot of bipartisan stuff with Republicans, given his push for many years to get Medicaid expanded here, and it’s happened,” he continued. “So it is a game-changer.” \n\nThe Senate race will likely be one of the most expensive next year as Republicans defend their control. \n\n“This is a race that’s going to be decided by fewer than three percentage points. It’s going to be close,” said Western Carolina University professor Chris Cooper. “And Roy Cooper’s not going to be handed the keys to the Senate seat just because he was a popular governor.” \n\n“The history sort of looks good for the Republicans, and the Democrats haven’t won in a while, but there’s a lot that looks good for the Democrats,” he added. “Roy Cooper’s name recognition, I think the ‘big beautiful bill,’ the Democrats are hoping that is going to do for them what the Affordable Care Act did for Republicans in 2010.” \n\nROY COOPER ENTERS NORTH CAROLINA SENATE RACE, SETTING UP 2026 SHOWDOWN\n\nDemocrats go on the offensive on Medicaid\n\nIn order to flip the Senate next year, Democrats will need a net of four seats. However, with races in states that Trump won in 2024, such as deep red Texas, the North Carolina race may be their best chance for a pickup.\n\nJohn Verdejo, a North Carolina Democratic National Committee member, said Democrats were pleased that Cooper would not face Tillis, but instead, Whatley, a former NC GOP chairman and the current chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\n“Whatley is an easy target,” said Verdejo. “We can easily pin on him all the ills that North Carolina has seen.” \n\nDemocrats pointed to Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” and its effect on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. North Carolina has the second-largest rural population in the nation, and more than half a million people in the state could lose their health insurance, according to estimates from the governor’s office. Estimates also show 1.4 million North Carolinians – including 600,000 children – could lose access to food assistance. \n\n“I think that’s going to be ground zero here in North Carolina, given that Medicaid was just expanded here less than two years ago,” said Wilson. In a joint fundraising pitch with the DNC on Monday, Cooper also bragged about expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe outgoing Tillis thumped the GOP on the Senate floor over Medicaid last month, after announcing his retirement. \n\n“It is inescapable, this bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made,” Tillis said. “I’m telling the president that you have been misinformed. You supporting the Senate mark will hurt people who are eligible and qualified for Medicaid.”\n\nHowever, the Medicaid cuts are set to take effect after the 2026 midterms, somewhat undercutting Democratic attacks against Republicans.\n\n“You can make that argument, but I don’t think people will totally buy it until the material effects of the policy are felt,” said Andrew Taylor, a political science professor at NC State University. “If it is a negative for Republicans going forward, it’ll probably be felt more in 2028 than 2026.” \n\nDemocrats also pointed to Cooper’s rural roots as another benefit in his race for the Senate seat. “He grew up in Nash County, son of a farmer and an attorney,” said Verdejo. “He’s grown tobacco and all that stuff. He’s from the dirt. He’s one of them, so he can talk that talk. He knows the struggles.” \n\nA ‘formidable’ race … avoided? \n\nA battle against Tillis, instead of Whatley, would have been more formidable, Verdejo added, to which Taylor somewhat agreed, pointing to Tillis beating his opponent by a higher share than Trump defeating former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Tillis ran ahead of Trump, although some people might say that Tillis was assisted by his opponent’s scandal,” said Taylor of the 2020 race. “Trump beat Biden in the state by about 1.4 percentage points, and Tillis beat Cal Cunningham by nearly two. Very close, but Tillis did run ahead of Trump in 2020.” \n\nEven Tillis conceded in a recent interview that Cooper’s gubernatorial track record will help him in the Senate race.\n\n“I was actually surprised,” the senator told the Washington Examiner. “It didn’t look like he was going to move into the race, but I think he’ll be a formidable competitor. He’s not invulnerable, but he’s got a pretty good track record as governor.” \n\n“If you’re talking about somebody from a standing start, national fundraising, those things, connection with the Governor’s Association, it’s probably a smart call,” Tillis also said of Cooper joining the race. “We’ve just got to match up and beat them. I don’t want this seat to be taken by a Democrat.” \n\nBut Whatley is not without his strengths. As the chairman of the RNC, he has deep pockets that could come to his aid before the elections.\n\n“Whatley is a quality candidate. He has the kind of background that means that he has networked with the richest and most connected donors, not just in the state of North Carolina, but in the United States of America,” said Cooper, the professor. “So in today’s nationalized political environment, Whatley is going to be a good candidate. Watley is also going to clear most of the field on the Republican side.” \n\nRepublicans brand Cooper a ‘radical’ \n\nDemocrats in the Tarheel State have not won a Senate race since 2008, the same year that the last Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, won the state. Yet, political history has shown that the opposing party of the leader in the White House tends to win seats during the midterm elections. Democrats flipped the House during the 2018 midterm elections under Trump’s first administration.\n\nRepublicans, however, quickly moved on Monday to brand Cooper as a “radical” and “reckless” candidate linked to former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris in fundraising appeals. \n\n“Roy Cooper can run, but he can’t hide from his 40-year radical record,” said NCGOP Chairman Jason Simmons in a statement. “From raising taxes, closing schools, pardoning violent criminals, and failing during hurricane recovery, he has consistently sided with left-wing interests over families and small businesses. He will do everything he can to work against President Trump in the U.S. Senate. We won’t let that happen, and we will keep this seat for Republicans in 2026.”\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee implored supporters in a fundraising plea not to “let Reckless Roy Cooper dupe North Carolina again.” \n\nDemocrats and Trump are suffering from low approval\n\nRecent polling from the Wall Street Journal shows the national Democratic brand at a 35-year low, with 63% of voters holding an unfavorable view of the Party and 33% holding a favorable view. However, Cooper’s odds are higher at the local level in North Carolina.\n\nA July poll from co/efficient showed a pro-Trump Republican tied with Cooper at 48% in a head-to-head matchup. An April poll from the left-leaning think tank Carolina Forward showed a hypothetical matchup, with Cooper at 46% compared to Tillis at 44%.\n\nBlair Reeves, the founder of Carolina Forward, told the Washington Examiner that, despite having Trump’s support, Whatley doesn’t have enough name recognition in North Carolina.\n\n“For people who don’t really obsess about politics, I don’t think they know who Michael Whatley is,” said Reeves. “They’ve probably never seen his picture. Don’t know his name. I don’t even know that any polling about him exists, because no one’s ever bothered to poll him before.” \n\nIf Whatley were to lean on Trump to campaign with him in North Carolina to boost his recognition, Democrats claimed they would welcome it. \n\n“We welcome it,” said Verdejo. “Because with Trump’s popularity in the tank, next to a Whatley, it’ll put a picture to the face and to the message of everything that has gone wrong since Trump has taken office.” \n\nAlthough Trump won’t be on the ballot next year, his polling levels could drag down or lift up Whatley in the race against Cooper. \n\n“If you have the White House and your president’s approval ratings are underwater, that’s at least a flashing yellow sign,” said Taylor, the NC State University professor. \n\nA July Catawba College/YouGov poll showed more North Carolinians disapproved of Trump, at 50%, than approved, at 46%. Nationally, an average composite of polls showed Trump at a 46% approval rating and a 52% disapproval rating, according to RealClearPolitics. \n\nGovernors don’t always succeed \n\nHistory has shown that sometimes a popular governor doesn’t have the juice to win a Senate race.\n\nFormer Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan failed to win the open Senate seat last year, losing to now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).\n\nPopular Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) declined to challenge the vulnerable Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), as did Gov. Chris Sununu (R-NH), who isn’t running for the open seat in New Hampshire after Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced her retirement. \n\n“Jim Hunt, who was arguably the most popular governor in North Carolina history, lost to Jesse Helms to the United States Senate,” said Cooper, the West Carolina professor, of the 1984 matchup. “Look, that has to be a concern for Roy Cooper and anybody who thinks he’s going to waltz into the Senate seat without a serious challenge.”\n\nExperts claimed that, unlike Hogan, who battled in deep-blue Maryland, North Carolina’s purple state status makes it competitive for Cooper to run in. \n\n“If Cooper is running, it’s because he thinks he’s going to win. He has no interest in ending his political career at the loss; the people around him are very good at winning elections,” said Reeves, of Carolina Forward. “And Cooper himself is very good at winning elections.”\n\n“So the big question in this election is going to be: one of these two streaks is going to be broken,” Reeves added. “Either the North Carolina Democrats’ line of losses in federal races or Roy Cooper’s undefeated sweep.” \n\nRamsey Touchberry contributed to this report.","summary":"Democrats called former North Carolina Gov.

Conspiracy theory researchers say that’s because these women are influential, politically left-leaning and break gender stereotypes at a time when the conservative movement favors traditional gender roles.\n\nConspiracy theories target women seen as their political opposition\n\nFor nearly five years, conservative political commentators and social media users have circulated false claims that Michelle Obama was once a man. Despite PolitiFact and others’ repeated reporting about the baseless narrative, the conspiracy theory persists. \n\nJoseph Uscinski, a University of Miami political science professor who has written multiple books about conspiracy theories, said women such as Macron and Obama are targeted because of their status.\n\nIt’s rare for someone to accuse random, lesser-known people of a secret plot. \"Conspiracy theories are generally thrown at power, and these are powerful people,\" Uscinski said.\n\nOther women who’ve been the target of gender-focused conspiracy theories include: \n\nWNBA basketball star Brittney Griner: In 2022, Griner was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges. As Biden administration officials worked to return Griner to the U.S., social media users circulated false posts saying she was really a man. Harris: During her 2024 presidential run, X users shared the false claim that Harris was transgender. Queen Camilla: In late 2024, Facebook users circulated a manipulated video showing Camilla, Britain’s queen consort, saying she was \"born a man.\" \n\nConspiracy theorists often focus on elites they dislike or view as a member of an opposition coalition, experts told PolitiFact. \n\nJoel Penney, a Montclair State University communications professor, said these claims have been largely directed at women perceived to be politically left or center-left.\n\n\"Asserting that they’re literally disguising their true identity and they’re doing these things behind the scenes is a way of mapping fears and anxieties about broader gender issues in politics and society onto them personally,\" Penney said. \n\nGender-focused conspiracy theories linked to anti-transgender rhetoric\n\nGender-focused conspiracy theories have proliferated in recent years alongside increasing anti-transgender rhetoric and support for restrictive policies on trans people, experts said. \n\nThe term \"transvestigating\" describes when conspiracy theorists begin questioning a person’s gender and accusing them of being transgender, Penney said, and it’s become a common attack. GLAAD, a nonprofit advocacy group that works to counter discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the media, describes the practice as an \"example of anti-LGBTQ online hate and disinformation.\"\n\nThroughout 2024, many Republican campaign advertisements focused on transgender people, particularly trans women participating in women’s sports. \n\nThis sort of anti-trans political rhetoric increased newfound suspicion toward women who don’t appear to conform to female gender norms, Penney said. \n\nMichael Mark Cohen, an American studies and African American studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said women such as Macron, Obama, Griner and others were likely targeted because their talents, achievements and ambition break stereotypical gender norms. \n\nEssentially, they undermine someone’s \"‘correct’ or ‘natural’ gender roles,\" so they must secretly be men, he said.\n\nAria Halliday, a University of Kentucky women and gender studies professor, said these attacks are rooted in transphobia and, in the cases of women like Griner and Obama, racism. People pushing these narratives strive to perpetuate the \"falsehood that women like Obama, Macron, and others are not women, therefore limiting the spectrum of what women can look like, do, and how they participate in society.\"\n\nPolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.","summary":"Hit with a defamation lawsuit, conservative commentator Candace Owens is not backing away from her baseless claims that France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, is a man.\n\nOriginally published by PolitiFact.\n\nResponding to the lawsuit July 23, Owens said Brigitte Macron \"is definitely a man,\" and called the Macrons’ lawsuit a public relations strategy. \n\n\"They don’t care if they win,\" Owens said. \"This is about running it through the press.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and the first lady filed the lawsuit more than a year after Owens initially made headlines for promoting the false claim that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux.

But at What Cost?","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAbout 26 minutes into the “debate” video, a guy named Connor leans into the mic and, with a shruggy grin, concedes that he is in fact a fascist. Applause breaks out. Mehdi Hasan, the lone progressive onstage, looks around, bewildered, registering that he is surrounded by fascists. The video is billed as “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,” and off-the-rails moments like this are the point. It’s one pundit alone against 20.\n\nWhat the episode fails to prepare you for is that many of Hasan’s opponents seem to be there only to insult him: A little after Connor cops to his fascism, another “debater” takes center stage to tell Hasan to “get the hell out” of the country, as if the naturalized Muslim American journalist is trespassing. Another insists that as a white person, he is Native American. Hasan rolls his eyes, offers a serious rebuttal when he can, and continues on. He’s literally surrounded. There’s no way out.\n\nThe video is from Surrounded, a show produced by Jubilee Media, a L.A.-based YouTube content company with the stated goal to “provoke understanding” via social experiment–styled discussions and debates. And it has gone more than viral, getting 8.9 million views in one week alone.\n\nSurrounded, one of many shows on the channel, is Jubilee’s version of a political gladiator arena, and the conceit is straightforward: Drop a recognizable pundit in the middle, encircle them with a roulette wheel of antagonists, profit. It’s peak YouTube. And by clipping the most combustible moments, it’s taken over every corner of the internet.Top hits include Charlie Kirk vs. “25 Liberal College Students”; “Can 1 Pro-Lifer Survive 25 Pro-Abortion Activists?”; and Ben Shapiro vs. “25 Kamala Harris voters.”\n\nAnd it’s profitable: The channel sits at over 10 million subscribers and just under 3 billion lifetime views. Not bad for a channel created just 15 years ago. It enjoyed a sharp spike in traffic the week Hasan’s episode dropped; this translates to a substantial boost in revenue, which is estimated to earn Jubilee around $1.8 million a year. Its founder says the goal is the “Disney of empathy,” though it’s also been called “Gen Z’s Jerry Springer Show.”\n\nBut something about the Hasan episode feels different. The thumbnail alone telegraphs it: a brown, famously Muslim journalist against far‑right conservatives, the crowd that cheered the Muslim ban, insists that Islam is incompatible with the West, and is enjoying the massive national deportation campaign.\n\nIf you bring in 20 folks whose position is essentially “You don’t belong,” is that still a “debate”? On an internet that turns identity into a sport that pays out when the “other side” gets cruel, is Jubilee the disease or a symptom? If it’s simply serving what the audience (and the algorithm) rewards and, in the process, surrounds a Muslim immigrant with 20 racists, what does that say about the audience? What does it say about me that I couldn’t resist watching?\n\nWhen the video was first announced, I was hyped. My introduction to Hasan was 12 years ago, seeing a video of him at the Oxford Union arguing that “Islam is a religion of peace” with rapid‑fire charm. I watched him sharpen that blade on MSNBC and now as the editor of Zeteo, an independent news and digital media company he founded in 2024. His book Win Every Argument, with chapters like “Judo Moves” and “The Art of the Zinger,” is as fun to read as it is intriguing. When Jubilee teased this matchup, I thirsted for a bloodbath. Hasan is like an apex predator when it comes to shredding bad‑faith, racist arguments.\n\nAnd Hasan delivers. He forces a panelist to admit she thinks immigrants are not Americans, then recites the 14th Amendment verbatim. When she claims she knew it, he snaps back: “You didn’t seem aware of it.” Brilliant. Chef’s kiss. He grills a guy he later called a “Batman villain” who labeled Palestinian kids killed by the Israel Defense Forces “so‑called innocent civilians,” pressing him on snipers shooting children. “This is bad for you,” Hasan warns. It’s emancipating to watch. Cathartic. No notes.\n\nBut many of his challengers on Surrounded weren’t content just to spar about ideas. When cornered, they openly advocated fascism, floated exclusionary immigration policies to reverse a supposed “white genocide,” or attacked Hasan’s right to remain in the country where he’s raising his family as a citizen. Hasan couldn’t have performed any better. He held up a mirror and showed how toxic their positions are for a pluralistic society. No one seemed convinced. Several basically said they didn’t need to win the argument. This is just what they believe.\n\nHasan sums it up at the end of the video. “Multiple people here said I should be deported,” he said. “One person said, as he walked off, ‘You’ll be the first to go,’ which is ominous and racist. … Free speech doesn’t mean you need to give credibility or oxygen or a platform to people who don’t agree on human equality. The people here were way beyond conservatives. This is open authoritarianism.”\n\nThat’s when the thrill curdled for me. I realized I’d watched what amounted to a right‑wing carnival dunk tank—with Hasan as the prop.\n\nMy colleague Nadira Goffe called it “musical chairs for verbal assault.” On X, someone wrote, “Cruel of Jubilee to make a game show where Mehdi spends 100+ minutes not screaming, ‘WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU?!’ ” Another pitched, “1 Fascist vs 20 WWII veterans—with guns.” Those jokes clock the format correctly: spectacle first, discourse optional.\n\nHere’s the core problem. Using a person to bait actual fascists into being cruel on camera for clicks is clearly not discourse. It’s content. Hasan’s skill makes it watchable, fun even, but the premise is still rotten. Cast one Muslim born in London and surround him with people who hate Muslims and immigrants, and you’re not adjudicating ideas; you’re asking one man to defend not only themself but an entire population’s existence—one I also identify with—to a group of folks who believe in Christian white supremacy. It’s well lit. It’s also quite ugly.\n\nAfterward, I realized I’d been a split‑screen viewer. Half of me exhaled every time Hasan reverse engineered a bad premise into dust. The other half braced, because I know firsthand how the post–9/11 applause lines get recycled as “proof” for bigotry against people like Hasan and me. They’re just better dressed when delivered by lawmakers and presidents.\n\nHis composure is practiced because these ideas aren’t fringe, as Hasan later reflected in a Zeteo town hall. “One of the useful things that comes out of this debate is, you can see for yourself what is out there now. We’re not making this stuff up. In Trump’s America, people are emboldened to say stuff they would never dare say in public five or ten years ago,” he says. “I didn’t expect this much open abuse, racist abuse, to my face.”\n\nPeople seemed shocked he kept his cool. What else was he going to do? Poise is a practice survival tactic. It’s a safety protocol. One stumble, and it isn’t “Mehdi could’ve done better”; it’s “See, they’re all like that.” He was the one encircled, but all of us nonwhite Americans were in that chair with him.\n\nSo is it wrong to format a “debate” this way? For obvious reasons, yes. Elevating fascists as a legitimate side opposite progressivism only launders their racism. Because the show frames the debate as a negotiation in which losing would mean conceding that he and those like him aren’t real Americans, can Hasan even “win”?\n\nI personally couldn’t wait for the episode to drop. I craved the dunks. I’ve watched him do it mercilessly to racists ever since he dropped the hammer at the Oxford Union. It felt healing to see far‑right arguments filleted with agility and composure. But my view is a vote for the premise. I’m training the algorithm to serve me more OWN/DESTROY/TOTALLY DISEMBOWEL!!! content. (I exaggerated that last one, but you get the point.)\n\nThe only potential winners are the microinfluencers cast against Hasan, for whom this was a launchpad. For Connor the fascist, for example, good lighting and a lav mic turned a Telegram troll into a “far‑right voice.” He allegedly lost his job after the episode came out, and he promptly took to the internet to monetize his martyrdom. His crowdfunding, framed as punishment for “heterosexual, Christian, moral beliefs,” has surpassed $40,000. If there’s a winner here, it isn’t Hasan. It’s Connor, still smirking, counting his money.\n\nMonetizing that bargain is obviously wrong, but Jubilee is not “the problem.” The answer is far more complicated than that. The media company is eerily good at mirroring our country’s appetite for watching someone’s identity be stress tested. For Gen Z and beyond, that’s just great entertainment for a Tuesday afternoon. Jubilee didn’t create the hunger. It just happens to run one of the most ruthlessly efficient kitchens in town.\n\nI don’t think the answer is “Never go on Jubilee.” I still rewatch Hasan doing what he does best, and I admire him—because in that chair I’d probably flounder and set our people back a decade. Still, the fact that this is already one of Jubilee’s top videos says plenty. Hasan held up a mirror to the fascists; Jubilee is holding one to us—our appetite for identity cage matches. This isn’t making humanity worse; it’s showing us who we are. It just so happened that after this particular video, we made a fascist rich.","summary":"Jubilee is racking up clicks with “debate” videos.

Republicans aren’t very popular either – but they have a big lead over the donkeys.\n\nI’m not a cheerleader for the Republicans, and I don’t pretend the GOP is the solution to all of our nation’s problems. Republicans have been co-conspirators in the runaway spending and debt crisis in Washington. (RELATED: Pete Buttigieg Says Dems Have Become ‘Too Attached’ To ‘Failing’ Status Quo)\n\nWhat is concerning is that the Democrats have become what I call a donut party: they have no middle. Back at the turn of the century the progressive left started capturing all the important leadership seats in their party. It began with the elevation of Nancy Pelosi and the full-scale takeover of the party happened with the election of Barack Obama. Since then the commanding voices of the party have included AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. They are the voices of the party.\n\nEven as the Trump policies take root and appear to be working, Dems in Washington today are opposed to nearly every Trump policy – even policies like trade protectionism that they once supported. Every Democrat voted against making the Trump tax cuts permanent- apparently, they were fine with the Typical American family paying about $2,000 a year more in taxes. OK fine. But what exactly is the Democratic economic message?\n\nHere are a few of them:\n\n• Raise taxes on the rich.\n\n• Destroy America’s energy capacity due to climate change religiosity.\n\n• Businesses are evil.\n\n• Expand welfare payments.\n\n• Grow the government.\n\n• Defend rotten schools and put teacher union interests above parents and kids.\n\n• Put diversity over merit selection.\n\nI’ve often observed with deepest regrets that the Democrats have sprinted away from the JFK agenda of free trade, lower tax rates, and balanced budgets. Can you imagine ANY Democrat today saying, as Kennedy did in 1963, that “tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the fastest way to balance the budget is to lower the rates now.”\n\nEven more recently, we had the Bill Clinton market-friendly centrists who were ascendant in the Democratic Party. The 1990s was a decade of balanced budgets, abundant jobs, falling government spending, free trade, a technology boom, lower capital gains taxes, and a mighty stock market surge.\n\nThe era of big government really was over – temporarily.\n\nNow it’s back. Biden’s demise was in no small part to the embrace of Modern Monetary Policy – which was a witless theory that the U.S. government could spend and borrow as much as it wanted and good things would happen. Whether they actually believed this non sequitur is an open question. But it shot grocery and gas prices up by nearly 30% and sent voters into Donald Trump’s waiting arms.\n\nThe latest wisdom of the DNC is to simply oppose everything President Trump is doing.\n\nIt’s not an economic philosophy, it’s a pathology.\n\nIt’s not healthy that one of the two political parties has belly flopped off the shallow end. We need a war – or at least a competition – of ideas and solutions. Ceding the debate to the Republicans isn’t healthy for either party.\n\nI’m hard pressed to name even one Democrat in Washington – just one – that has a pro-growth, pro-America agenda. Maybe there is one in the states. I like some of what I’ve heard from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. But even he admits that he’s too centrist and free market oriented for the national party.\n\nIn 1980 Democrats got shellacked by Ronald Reagan. They moved left with Walter Mondale and lost 49 states four years later. And then even when Reagan was gone, they went further left with Massachusetts liberal Michael Dukakis and lost again in 1988. It was only THEN that they went with pragmatism and won with Bill Clinton. I think Dems are going to have to take another beating at the polls in 2028 to see the errors of their ways.\n\nStephen Moore is a co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Donald Trump economic advisor. \n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They “poured money and institutional support into the No Kings protests,” for example — and these “weren’t fringe outbursts. In fact, they revealed the party’s core.” The Oversight Project compiled the Instagram activity of “one key protest organizer, a group called 50501,” and “tracked who its social media managers followed, and what emerged was a clear pattern of associations: communist, neo-Marxist, anti-American, and foreign-aligned groups.” “These protests didn’t bubble up from the grassroots.

All AI has “ideological” formulas — some, including concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism and DEI — “baked” into their code. “The question is not whether an AI system will be built upon a set of values; the question is which set of values the programmers will select.” Yet Trump’s EO stipulates that the government will purchase only software that is “’truth-seeking’ and committed to ‘ideological neutrality.’” The president and his advisers “have shifted the direction of artificial intelligence away from woke — and toward a vibrant American future.”\n\nFrom the right: A Kamala Run Scares the Left\n\n“California Democrats are rubbing their temples” at the thought of Kamala Harris running for governor, quips National Review’s Noah Rothman. She’d be the heavy favorite, but the ex-veep might owe that “less to her political acumen” than to “California voters’ bovine insouciance.” She’d have to defend Joe Biden and “her role in the failed” coverup of his decline. And “in the absence of any measurable charisma and “notable risks” to the party overall, many Dems are attacking her. One state-level official even says she’d ruin the party’s chance to “win the House and hold on to three seats that we just flipped in 2024.” So “Harris could get herself elected,” notes Rothman, “while still serving as a net negative for her party.”\n\nLegal expert: Media’s Russiagate Blinders\n\nNewly declassified material from the Russian collusion investigation reveals “how high-ranking officials in the Obama Administration seeded” the false collusion narrative “with the help of an eager, unquestioning press corps,” thunders Jonathan Turley at Fox News. Ex-CIA director John Brennan “was the key figure insisting on the inclusion of the Steele dossier” in the Russian interference assessment. Ex-FBI director James Comey knew “the Steele dossier was an unreliable political hit job,” yet he “lied to a federal court to maintain” the investigation. “The public is now learning about the real Russian conspiracy and its key players,” but “the same media that pushed the false claims” are “imposing a news blackout as they did with the Hunter Biden laptop.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Democratic leaders hoped to “reverse the party’s hard-left drift and reconnect with working-class voters” after the election, but Democrats instead ran “straight back into the arms of their radical base,” marvels Mike Howell at The Blaze.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/opinion/dems-failed-makeover-in-n-out-of-cali-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/2025-day-president-trumps-military-106533197.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:03:05","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":346086460,"title":"Did Trump prosecute Beyonce?

A recent report by Reuters reveals that, early this month, the top official at the U.S. embassy in South Africa reached out to the White House for clarification on whether or not non-white people in South Africa can apply for Trump’s refugee program, which the president sold to America via claims that white farmers in South Africa have been murdered en masse after having their land taken by the South African government, none of which is true. From Reuters: President Donald Trump’s February executive order establishing the program specified that it was for “Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,” referring to an ethnic group descended mostly from Dutch settlers. In a diplomatic cable sent July 8, embassy Charge d’Affairs David Greene asked whether the embassy could process claims from other minority groups claiming race-based discrimination such as “coloured” South Africans who speak Afrikaans. In South Africa, the term coloured refers to mixed-race people, a classification created by the apartheid regime still in use today. The answer came back days later in an email from Spencer Chretien, the highest-ranking official in the State Department’s refugee and migration bureau, saying the program is intended for white people. Now, Reuters did note that it wasn’t able to verify the exact language used to advise Greene that Trump’s refugee program is a whites-only kind of deal, the State Department’s website specified in May that applicants “must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa.” At best, this means Black people need not apply; at worst, it means the Trump administration only wants white immigrants in the U.S., which would be consistent with literally everything Trump has demonstrated regarding his thoughts on immigration. To be fair, apparently, at least one mixed-race family has made it through the Neo-Apartheid express lane to U.S. asylum. More from Reuters: In the July 8 cable, Greene laid out a summary of the different ethnic and racial groups in the country before seeking guidance on eligibility. In addition to Afrikaners and mixed-race South Africans, Greene mentioned indigenous South Africans known as the Khoisan people. He said that members of the Jewish community had also expressed interest, but that in South Africa they are considered a religious minority and not a racial group. “In the absence of other guidance, [the U.S. embassy] intends to give consideration to well-founded claims of persecution based on race for other racial minorities,” Greene wrote. At least one family identified as coloured has already traveled to the U.S. as refugees, two people familiar with the matter said. Again, at best, the same president who has spearheaded the effort to propagandize DEI into Jim Crow for white people has implemented an international policy that, by default, excludes Black people outright. This is a white supremacist administration, y’all. Not just nationally, but globally.

But federal races in North Carolina have proven elusive for Democrats, who have not won the state at either the Senate or presidential level since 2008.Cooper is viewed as a strong recruit for Democrats as he enjoyed strong approval ratings during his tenure leading the state.What To KnowCooper, who served as North Carolina's governor from 2017 to 2025 and previously held four terms as attorney general, ended months of speculation on Monday, and is now the latest candidate to seek the Democratic nomination for Tillis' seat.\"I have thought on it and prayed about it, and I have decided: I am running to be the next U.S. Senator from North Carolina,\" Cooper said in a video posted to X.Tillis spoke to the outlet NOTUS last week on the potential for Cooper to enter the race against Michael Whatley, the Republican National Committee (RNC) chair, who is endorsed by Trump but has yet to formally enter the race.\"It's going to be a knife fight in a telephone booth,\" Tillis said about the potential match-up.NOTUS reported that Tillis also said he hopes Whatley is up for the challenge of running.Cooper has touted his record of bipartisan governance, Medicaid expansion in 2023, and efforts to raise teacher pay, while asserting that the stakes for the middle class, healthcare, and economic policy are higher than ever.Polling has shown a statistical tie between Cooper and a generic Republican candidate, with each side holding 48 percent support among likely voters, according to a recent survey from co/efficient.What People Are SayingPolitical science professor at Columbia University, Robert Y. Shapiro, told Newsweek via email Monday: \"I can only say the obvious: The Democrats were looking for him to run. He is seen as a more moderate Democrat and he has shown he can win a major election already in the state as governor. He was considered a possible vice-presidential running mate for Kamala Harris. So has the requisite political and governing experience to win another statewide election.\"President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday: \"To the Great People of North Carolina, one of the most capable executives in our Country successfully ran, along with Lara Trump, the Republican National Committee. He happens to live in your incredible State, which I love, and won, including Primaries, six times in a row! My relationship with you has been fantastic, and only enhanced by the job I did after January 20th, when I took over the flood drenched areas that were abandoned by Sleepy Joe Biden and your Governor, and, through the infusion of money and hard work, fixed the problem like nobody else has the ability to do.\"He continued: \"The one that energized that project, and so many more, was the Chairman of the RNC, Michael Whatley. I am sending this Statement out for a very good reason. Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina. He is fantastic at everything he does, and he was certainly great at the RNC where, in the Presidential Election, we won every Swing State, the Popular Vote, and the Electoral College by a landslide! But I have a mission for my friends in North Carolina, and that is to get Michael Whatley to run for the U.S. Senate. He is STRONG on the Border, stopping Crime, supporting our Military/Veterans, cutting Taxes, and saving our always under siege Second Amendment.\"\"I need him in Washington, and I need him representing YOU!

Trump wrote on Saturday. \n\nThe Truth Social post also alleged that Oprah Winfrey was paid $3 million for 'expenses' and MSNBC's Al Sharpton was given $600,000. \n\n'These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records,' Trump claimed. 'You are not allowed to pay for an endorsement. It is totally illegal to do so.' \n\n'Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, broke the law. They should all be prosecuted!' \n\nHowever, an article from CNN's fact checker Daniel Dale asserted that Trump's allegation was baseless. Evidence of the $11 million payment has not been reported. \n\nThe White House did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for evidence of the multi-million dollar payment. \n\nHarris' campaign has denied paying for endorsements and Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles, has called the allegations a 'lie.'\n\n'Beyonce did not receive a penny for speaking at a presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harrris' (sic) Rally in Houston,' Knowles wrote on her Instagram. \n\nAccording to an Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing, Harris' campaign payed the signer's production company, Parkwood Production Media, $165,000 for 'campaign event production.' \n\nAdditionally, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign said last year that the political operation did not pay for celebrity endorsements, but they did concede that they had to cover costs associated with the production, like staff and equipment. \n\nAnother denial came when a spokesperson for Beyoncé told PolitiFact last year that the claim the singer was paid millions was 'beyond ridiculous.' \n\nHarris' campaign paid a non-profit led by Sharpton a total of $500,000, FEC filings show. The Democrat's political operation also paid Harpo Productions, a company owned by Oprah, $1 million for a live stream event.\n\nTrump last spoke about the alleged endorsement payment in February.\n\n'They go out and they pay Beyoncé, as an example. Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million,' the president said at the time. \n\nIn a May post on Truth Social the president again slammed the alleged payment to Beyoncé while also suggesting that Bruce Springsteen accepted money for his performance at a Harris rally. \n\n'I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren't allowed to pay for endorsements, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,' the president wrote.\n\nNeither the White House nor Congress have announced probes into the endorsement, which obviously did not move enough votes into Harris' column come Election Day.","summary":"A CNN fact check poured cold water on President Donald Trump's claim that Kamala Harris ' campaign paid megastar Beyoncé $11 million for an endorsement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14948675/cnn-fact-checks-trump-11million-beyonce-payment-kamala.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/28/21/100712289-0-image-m-76_1753734707238.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/26/5090067307202232891/1024x576_MP4_5090067307202232891.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 22:23:09","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.695},{"id":346086626,"title":"No, Beyonce Was Not Paid $11 Million to Endorse Kamala Harris","text":"According to records from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Harris campaign reported sending $165,000 to Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé’s production company, for “campaign event production.” A senior Harris spokesperson later clarified the nature of the payment as covering the “ancillary costs for that performance.” It is unclear where Trump is getting the $11 million figure, and no law forbids politicians from paying for endorsements, though they do have to disclose those payments.","summary":"Trump called for the singer-songwriter to be ‘prosecuted’ for endorsing the vice president.","url":"https://thedispatch.com/article/trump-beyonce-harris-endorsement-illegal-claim/","image":"https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2181548464.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 21:35:31","author":"Owen Tilman","authors":["Owen Tilman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.731},{"id":346066956,"title":"Guest Opinion: What should scare us about Trump's fake video of Obama, by Anita Chabria","text":"Recently, our thoughtful and reserved president reposted on his Truth Social site a video generated by artificial intelligence that falsely showed former President Barack Obama being arrested and imprisoned.\n\nThere are those among you who think this is high humor; those among you who find it as tiresome as it is offensive; and those among you blissfully unaware of the mental morass that is Truth Social.\n\nWhatever camp you fall into, the video crosses all demographics by being expected — just another crazy Trump stunt in a repetitive cycle of division and diversion so frequent it makes Groundhog Day seem fresh. Epstein who?\n\nBut there are three reasons why this particular video — not made by the president but amplified to thousands — is worth noting, and maybe even worth fearing.\n\nFirst, it is flat-out racist. In it, Obama is ripped out of a chair in the Oval Office and forced onto his knees, almost bowing, to a laughing Trump. That imagery isn't hard to interpret: America's most esteemed Black man — who recently warned we are on the brink of losing democracy — forced into submission before our current leader.\n\nThe video comes as Trump claims that Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, has uncovered a \"treasonous conspiracy in 2016\" in which top Obama officials colluded with Russia to disrupt the election. Democrats say the claim is erroneous at best.\n\nIf you are inclined to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, right before this scene of Obama being forced to kneel, a meme of Pepe the Frog — an iconic image of the far-right and white supremacy — flashes on the screen.\n\nNot subtle. But also, not the first time racism has come straight from the White House. Rev. Amos Brown, pastor of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church and a student of Martin Luther King Jr., reminded me that once upon a time, then-President Woodrow Wilson screened the pro-KKK film \"The Birth of a Nation\" at the executive mansion. It was the first film screening ever held there, and its anti-Black viewpoint sparked controversy and protests.\n\nThat was due in no small part to a truth that Hollywood knows well — fiction has great power to sway minds. Brown sees direct similarities in how Wilson amplified fictional anti-Blackness then, and how Trump is doing so now, both for political gain.\n\n\"Mr. Trump should realize that Obama hasn't done anything to him. But just the idea, the thought of a Black person being human, is a threat to him and his supporters,\" Brown told me.\n\nBrown said he's praying for the president to \"stop this bigotry\" and see the error of his ways. I'll pray the great gods give the reverend good luck on that.\n\nBut, on the earthly plane, Brown said that \"the more things change, the more they remain the same.\"\n\nTrump courted the Black vote and has his supporters among people of all colors and ethnicities, but he's also played on racist tropes for political success, from stoking fear around the Central Park Five, now known as the Exonerated Five, decades ago to stoking fear around Black immigrants eating cats and dogs in Ohio during the recent election. It's an old playbook, because it works.\n\nReposting the image of Obama on his knees is scary because it's a harsh reminder that racism is no longer an undercurrent in our society, if it ever was. It's a motivator and a power to be openly wielded — just the way Wilson did back in 1915.\n\nBut the differences in media from back in the day to now are what should raise our second fear around this video. A fictional film is one thing. An AI-generated video that for many people seems to depict reality is a whole new level of, well, reality.\n\nThe fear of deepfakes in politics is not new. It's a global problem, and in fairness, this isn't the first time (by far) Trump or other politicians have used deepfakes.\n\nTrump last year reposted an image of Taylor Swift endorsing him (which never happened). Also last year, during the election and the height of the Elon Musk-Trump bromance, the billionaire posted a fake photo of political challenger Kamala Harris dressed in what looked like a communist military uniform.\n\nTrump himself has not been immune. In 2023, Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, said he was toying with an AI tool and created images of Trump being arrested, never thinking it would go viral (especially since one image gave Trump three legs).\n\nOf course it did, and millions of people looked at these fake pictures, at least some assuming they were real.\n\nThe list of deepfake political examples is long and ominous. Which brings us to the third reason Trump's latest use of one is unsettling.\n\nHe clearly sees the effectiveness of manipulating race and reality to increase his own power and further his own agenda.\n\nObama on his knees strikes a chord all too close to the image of Latino Sen. Alex Padilla being taken to the floor by federal authorities a few weeks ago during a news conference. It bears a chilling resemblance to the thousands of images flooding us daily of immigrants being taken down and detained by immigration officers in often violent fashion.\n\nVideos like this one of Obama are the normalizing, the mockery, the celebration of the erosion of civil rights we are currently seeing being aimed at Black, brown and vulnerable Americans.\n\nThere is nothing innocent or unplanned about these kinds of videos. They are a political weapon being used for a purpose.\n\nBecause when repetition dulls our shock of them, how long before we are no longer shocked by real images of real arrests?","summary":"Recently, our thoughtful and reserved president reposted on his Truth Social site a video generated by artificial intelligence that falsely showed former President Barack Obama being arrested and imprisoned.","url":"https://www.keenesentinel.com/opinion/op-ed/guest-opinion-what-should-scare-us-about-trumps-fake-video-of-obama-by-anita-chabria/article_c1b78472-1575-4627-a5a0-5c2c8125a0f3.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/keenesentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6260defe-c779-11ef-bd8a-c733c01e3345.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 21:30:00","author":"Anita Chabria","authors":["Anita Chabria"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":346066066,"title":"Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler takes buyout after nearly 3 decades – and paper has no replacement","text":"The man behind The Washington Post’s “Pinocchios” is leaving the paper without anyone to fill his shoes. \n\nGlenn Kessler, the editor of The Fact Checker, announced Monday he has taken a buyout, ending his lengthy career at the Post. \n\n“After more than 27 years at The Washington Post, including almost 15 as The Fact Checker, I will be leaving on July 31, having taken a buyout,” Kessler wrote on his Facebook page. “Much as I would have liked to keep scrutinizing politicians in Washington, especially in this era, the financial considerations were impossible to dismiss.”\n\nKessler said he wrote or edited more than 3,000 fact checks as editor and chief writer of The Fact Checker. \n\n“When I started in 2011, there were only a handful of fact-checking organizations around the world, and I have been thrilled to watch the movement expand across the globe. So many of these brave and diligent fact checkers have become good friends,” Kessler wrote. \n\n“My fact checks were routinely the most-read articles on The Post’s website. I had my detractors, from both the left and right, but many readers appreciated my efforts to sort out the truth in political rhetoric,” he added. \n\nKessler revealed he attempted to stay on a contract basis long enough for his bosses to find a successor for a smooth transition, to no avail. \n\n“I didn’t want The Post to have a gap in fact-checking coverage during this fraught period in U.S. history. But we couldn’t work out an agreement,” he wrote. \n\nWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray appeared onboard with hiring a new fact checker in an exchange with Kessler, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n\nKessler’s next chapter will involve him writing books, and he’s open to freelance and consulting work.\n\n“In 2018, when the Fact Checker team was compiling a database of more than 30,000 Trump claims, I told the New York Times that ‘I have the best job in journalism,'” Kessler wrote. “I still believe that, and I’m sorry to leave without a replacement lined up. But it’s the right time for me. I hope The Post finds someone to carry on this important project.”\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. \n\nMurray implemented a new round of the paper’s Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in May, hoping that most veteran staffers would be enticed by the exit offer. The program is set to end this week. \n\nAccording to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. All of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). \n\nOther high-profile writers who’ve taken the buyouts include columnists Jonathan Capehart, Catherine Rampell, Philip Bump and Joe Davidson.\n\nAlso fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBezos’ directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley. Others resigned in protest and a mass cancellation of subscriptions by liberal leaders rocked the paper. The paper faced similar backlash last fall when Bezos blocked the paper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nEarlier this month, Washington Post CEO Will Lewis sent a memo to staff issuing an ultimatum for those contemplating adapting to the paper’s new direction. \n\nAlso fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBezos’ directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley.
