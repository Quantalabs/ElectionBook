The announcement quickly led to multiple world leaders, including President Donald Trump, to state their support for Biden and his family and to wish for the former president's speedy recovery. But Biden's announcement has also led to confusion and speculation from journalists and the public over the president's disease history, including how long the Biden family has known about his diagnosis. \"President Biden’s announcement Sunday that he has stage 4 prostate cancer, which has spread to his bones, is a sad moment for the country, and we wish him and his family the best for treatment and prognosis,\" The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote Tuesday. \"But Mr. Biden owes the public more information, given that he left office only 120 days ago, after telling voters he was fit to stay through 2029 and age 86.\" BIDEN'S 'LAST KNOWN' PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING WAS OVER A DECADE AGO, AS QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER DIAGNOSIS \"A spokesperson told the press Tuesday that Mr. Biden’s last known PSA blood test, which screens for prostate specific antigen, was in 2014,\" the editorial board continued, referring to a statement widely shared from Biden's press office. The PSA test is a blood test used primarily to screen for prostate cancer. The test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood, according to the Mayo Clinic. The editorial board pointed out that while some men do miss the symptoms of prostate cancer, Biden was campaigning for re-election, meaning that he would have stayed in office for another four years. DAVE PORTNOY GOES OFF ON BIDEN'S LATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS AS ‘ONE OF THE GREATEST SCANDALS’ IN US POLITICS \"Had he remained in the race and won, the country would now be contemplating a President Kamala Harris without having had the election choice,\" The Wall Street Journal wrote. \"There is a long record of Presidents who concealed their ailments, from Grover Cleveland’s secret cancer surgery, to Woodrow Wilson’s incapacity after his stroke, to John F. Kennedy’s Addison’s disease,\" the editorial board wrote. \"Mr. Biden’s White House hid the extent of his age-related decline until his June 27, 2024, debate performance made it obvious to voters. That’s bad enough, and it has raised suspicions. Though he’s no longer in office, the public-spirited thing for Mr. Biden to do is to clarify the details of his disease history and PSA choices.\" Fox News' Louis Casiano contributed to this report.

The comments went viral last week, and Trump responded by slamming Springsteen and calling him \"highly overrated\" Friday. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IGNORES QUESTION ABOUT TRUMP FEUD WHILE SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS: VIDEO \"I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.

The DOJ first sued Live Nation a year ago, claiming the company uses its dominance in concert promotion and in ticketing with Ticketmaster to stifle competition, calling to break up the company.\n\n “It’s not a shock to see this because it’s obviously right in front of us,” says Gary Witt, president and CEO of Milwaukee-based Pabst Theater Group. “Right in front of our very eyes you’re watching a transaction take place where one group is trying to buy their way out of the DOJ and 40 state attorneys pursuing them.” \n\n The DOJ first sued Live Nation a year ago, claiming the company uses its dominance in concert promotion and in ticketing with Ticketmaster to stifle competition, calling to break up the company. Live Nation has consistently denied the DOJ’s claims. Dan Wall, the company’s executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs, wrote last year that the complaint misleads the public into thinking that ticket prices will be lower if something is done about Live Nation and Ticketmaster. DOJ is not helping consumers with their actual problems.”\n\n When asked for comment on the claims on Grenell’s appointment, a Live Nation representative pointed THR to the company’s announcement from Tuesday. “We are pleased to welcome Ric to our Board,” Randall Mays, Live Nation Entertainment’s chairman of the board, said in a statement Tuesday. “His background will bring a valuable perspective as Live Nation continues to contribute to a growing live music industry around the globe.”\n\n A second music executive, who requested anonymity citing fear of retaliation from Live Nation, called Grenell’s appointment “the most thinly-veiled attempt to clash a legal proceeding that I’ve seen.”\n\n “What expertise is he able to provide other than his access to Trump,” the executive says. “What value does he provide? It’s just so obvious. if he wasn’t closely aligned with Trump, would they have ever picked him? If they didn’t have a lawsuit filed by the DOJ would they have appointed him? The answer to both is likely no.”\n\n Grinell’s appointment comes as the live music business has been looking for indications on how aggressively the Trump administration would pursue the Live Nation case it inherited from the Biden administration. Whether Grinell’s appointment would have any impact on the case going forward isn’t clear yet. \n\n “Of course there’s people who are thinking the case is finished now, but I think you can come to the opposite conclusion too,” says a policy expert who’s followed the DOJ case closely, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. “You can just as easily argue Live Nation knows they’re in trouble and is just increasingly desperate that they use this obvious ploy.”\n\n Aside from the civil suit, news broke last week that the DOJ is considering separate criminal charges against Live Nation and rival AEG over collusion allegations regarding their responses to refunds for pandemic-era concert cancellations. Live Nation denied the claims. \n\n “We did not collude with AEG or anyone else,” Wall said last week. “We are proud of our leadership during those trying times, and if any charges result from this investigation, we will defend them vigorously.”\n\n The appointment comes as Trump himself has grown increasingly combative with superstar artists online in recent days. After Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration during a recent concert in the U.K., Trump sent a vaguely threatening message out on Truth Social, writing that Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare’. Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” \n\n Earlier this week, Trump had called for a “major investigation” into the appearances for artists like Springsteen, Beyoncé and Bono at Kamala Harris’s presidential rallies.","summary":"Live Nation appointed Richard Grenell, the interim executive director at the Kennedy Center, to its board on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/live-nation-richard-grenell-doj-lawsuit-1236224658/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2162458235-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 00:12:24","author":"Ethan Millman","authors":["Ethan Millman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":323504028,"title":"Kim Kardashian Graduates From Law School","text":"Kim Kardashian is celebrating graduating from law school after six years of legal training. In an Instagram Story posted by her sister Khloe Kardashian, Kim is seen surrounded by family and friends at a luncheon marking the moment. “All of you guys have been on this journey with me,” she says in the video.\n\n On her own Instagram story, Kim shared a photo of her late father, Robert Kardashian, a prominent attorney who was part of the defense team for O.J. Simpson’s 1995 murder trial. Kim previously shared in a 2023 GQ interview her memories of her father during that time. “My dad pulled Kourtney and me out of school,” Kim told the publication. “He said, ‘I want you girls to witness a piece of history and what a trial is like,'” she recalled. “We walked in and saw my mom sitting on the other side. She said, ‘You’re supposed to be in school. What are you doing here?’ Kourtney and I didn’t even look at her.”\n\n Over the past few years, Kardashian has also become an advocate for criminal justice reform, and previously passed California’s “baby bar” exam, expressing interest in taking the bar exam in hopes of becoming a practicing attorney.\n\n Kardashian has successfully lobbied President Donald Trump during his first term and met with him and several women whose prison sentences he commuted. In April 2024, she returned to the White House for a roundtable discussion with then-Vice President Kamala Harris and recently pardoned former inmates, to discuss criminal justice reform.\n\n The realty TV star is also set to feature as a powerhouse divorce attorney running an all-female law firm alongside Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, and more in Ryan Murphy’s upcoming legal drama, All’s Fair.","summary":"The new grad has also become an advocate for criminal justice reform over the years","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/kim-kardashian-graduates-law-school-1235345525/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kim-kardashian-law-school-graduates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 23:47:12","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.224},{"id":323501798,"title":"Paramount infighting stalls Shari Redstone’s push to settle $20B Trump suit: ‘Decision constipation’","text":"Shari Redstone-controlled Paramount is poised to settle a closely watched legal battle with President Trump over alleged deceptive editing of a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris – but warring factions within the company have delayed the move, On The Money has learned.\n\nThe media giant is said to be willing to spend up to $50 million to end the $20 billion lawsuit brought by Trump, thus lifting a legal black cloud that is that is hampering Redstone’s plans to sell Paramount, and its CBS News subsidiary at the center of the lawsuit, to independent studio Skydance in a deal valued at $8 billion, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nBut the infighting inside Paramount has paralyzed Redstone & Co. from pulling the trigger, leaving management and board members in limbo, the sources said.\n\n“There seems to be a bit of decision constipation on their part,” said a lawyer with knowledge of the matter. “(Redstone) has been poised to settle this for months but is getting conflicting advice.”\n\nAnother lawyer close to the situation said a “decision could be made tonight or tomorrow.”\n\nThe board literally has an emergency meeting every week on when to settle,” the source said.\n\nPress reps for Redstone and Paramount declined comment, but didn’t deny the substance of this report.\n\nRedstone and her board are said to be facing some significant internal pressure from members of her legal team and others not to cave to Trump’s demands.\n\nThey say the Trump litigation is frivolous, and “60 Minutes” has denied any improper editing of the Harris segment. This faction argues that a settlement would also be seen as an affront to press freedom, that Redstone would be acquiescing to alleged extortion to the president and his power over the administrative state.\n\nEarlier in the week, socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on X: “I say to Shari Redstone: Enough is enough. Do not capitulate to Trump’s attack on a free press. Do not settle Trump’s bogus lawsuit against 60 Minutes.”\n\nSanders’ warning came as CBS News president Wendy McMahon was pushed out amid disagreements over the direction of the network.\n\nBut other members of Redstone’s legal and management team are urging a quick settlement of the Trump suit, believing that a payment for as much as $50 million will satisfy the president, and be a money saver.\n\nA federal judge in Texas has already refused to dismiss the case, and even an eventual win on First Amendment grounds would cost more than $50 million in legal and court costs, these people argue.\n\n“Sooner or later, you got to pay the man,” said one media attorney with first-hand knowledge of the matter.\n\nIt’s unclear where George Cheeks, one of three co-CEOs heading Paramount, stands on the issue. He may stay with the newly combined Paramount-Skydance if the deal is completed, people with knowledge of the matter say. A Paramount rep declined to publicly comment on his future.\n\nEnding the Trump litigation is seen as a key move to getting Redstone’s planned sale to Skydance approved. Trump’s regulatory apparatus, namely his Federal Communications Commission, is throttling the merger a conservative group filed a complaint that CBS News violated the “public interest” statutes that govern local TV public airwaves that demand bias-free news programming. The Tiffany Network has been accused for years by conservative groups of tilting its news coverage in favor of Democratic candidates.\n\nThe Trump lawsuit almost mirrors the FCC inquiry prompted by a complaint filed by the Center for American Rights that “60 Minutes” violated agency fairness rules when it allegedly edited Harris’ interview during the heat of the 2024 president campaign to make her sound more coherent when answering a policy question. Harris is famous for her long-winded, word salad answers to such questions.\n\nRedstone, the settlement proponents argue, would hardly be an outlier if she simply paid Trump the money to go away. She would join a host of media companies and law firms that have made payments to Trump to end legal actions by the president, who has vast powers to regulate corporate activities. Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, settled a libel action for $16 million with Trump over erroneous comments made by ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nRedstone needs to sell her stake in the media conglomerate to preserve what’s left of her inheritance from her father, the late media dealmaker Sumner Redstone.\n\nParamount’s stock has cratered amid vast changes in the media business. If the deal is completed, Redstone and her family will walk away with around $2 billion. Paramount was worth close to $40 billion just a few years ago.","summary":"The media giant is said to be willing to spend up to $50 million to end the $20 billion lawsuit brought by Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/business/paramount-infighting-stalls-shari-redstones-push-to-settle-20b-trump-suit/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105049638-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 23:40:47","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":323501192,"title":"Things to know about ‘no tax on tips,’ Trump’s tax pledge that’s included in GOP budget bill","text":"By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS and JONATHAN J.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., are among the “few” Republican women who don’t bow down to the patriarchy, according to Clinton.\n\nClinton made the comment during a discussion at New York City’s 92nd Street Y on May 1, adding that the U.S. electing a female president is “so much harder than it should be.” Video of the event wasn’t posted till two weeks later on May 15, according to The Daily Caller.\n\n“If a woman runs who I think would be a good president, as I thought Kamala Harris would be and as I knew I would be, I will support that woman,” Clinton said, who lost her 2016 bid to become the country’s first female president. \n\nClinton’s comments reveal a bizarre strategy on the political Left—bash anyone who thinks differently than she does, and then act surprised and play the victim when the same people you berated don’t support you. \n\nSpeaking as conservative women who have worked hard to earn countless opportunities from male and female bosses alike who also happen to be conservative, it’s both insulting and laughable to call women who believe in traditional values and protecting the unborn “handmaidens to the patriarchy.” \n\nOn this week’s edition of “Problematic Women,” we discuss our “oppression” as conservative women and take time to celebrate the women who, unlike Clinton, are acting as powerful voices for all women, regardless of political views. \n\nAlso on today’s show, ahead of Memorial Day, the Trump administration has announced an investigation into the disastrous U.S. pullout from Afghanistan in 2021 and a proposed “Golden Dome” to protect the U.S. against missile attacks. \n\nPlus, we breakdown some of the latest pop culture news as singer Lorde equates ditching birth control as “right wing.” And President Donald Trump says Taylor Swift is no longer “hot.” Is he right? \n\nWatch the show above or listen to the podcast below.","summary":"With one broad stroke, Democrat Hillary Clinton called all conservative women “handmaidens” in remarks at an event in New York City earlier this month.  “Well,...

You worry about that instead of the dyin’ kids in Gaza. That’s your problem.”\n\nHe continued: “I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That’s your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING.”\n\nYoung added that Taylor Swift “is right” and “so is Bruce.” (Swift was a recent subject of one of Trump’s Truth Social posts. He wrote: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”)\n\n“You know how I feel. You are more worried about yourself than AMERICA,” Young added. “Wake up Trump!! Remember what the White House is?”\n\n“86/47?? That’s what you think about? You are forgetting your real job. You work for us. Wake up Republicans! This guy is out of control. We need a real president,” Young concluded his post.\n\nThe phrase “86/47” is a reference to a recent social media post made by former FBI director James Comey, who wrote “cool shell formation on my beach walk” under a picture of seashells that appeared to form the shapes for “86 47.”\n\nNumerous Trump administration officials, including Kristi Noem, said Comey was advocating for the assassination of Trump, the 47th president. Merriam-Webster says 86 is slang meaning “to throw out,” “to get rid of” or “to refuse service to,” but colloquially can mean “kill.”\n\nYoung’s post comes after Trump escalated his feud with Springsteen over the long weekend, calling for a “major investigation” into the rock legend after Springsteen branded the Trump administration as “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” during a concert in England last week.\n\nOn May 19, Trump took to Truth Social to post a lengthy, all-caps screed against Springsteen and other Hollywood A-listers who endorsed Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election.\n\n“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote online, in a message published in the middle of the night. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? … AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???”\n\n“I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,” the president continued in his rant. “In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT’S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,’ this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system.”\n\nHe didn’t stop there, however. Nearly eight hours later, he returned to the subject.\n\n“According to news reports, Beyoncé was paid $11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” he wrote.\n\n“Remember, the Democrats and Kamala illegally paid her millions of Dollars for doing nothing other than giving Kamala a full throated ENDORSEMENT.\n\nSwitching back to all-caps, he concluded: “THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! IT IS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION! BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, OPRAH, BONO AND, PERHAPS, MANY OTHERS, HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!!!”\n\nSpringsteen, a longtime opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump’s most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.\n\nHe told a Manchester audience that he believes Trump is “unfit” for the Oval Office.\n\nWhile introducing his and the E Street Band’s song Land of Hopes and Dreams, after which his current tour is named, the 75-year-old Springsteen said, “In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”\n\n“The last check on power after the checks and balances of government have failed are the people, you and me. It’s in the union of people around a common set of values now — that’s all that stands between a democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all we’ve got is each other,” Springsteen continued later in the show.\n\nThe next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,” he wrote on social media.\n\n“This dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,” he said.\n\nThe next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.\n\nAs for Young, this isn’t the first time the Heart of Gold singer has spoken out against Trump.\n\nIn early April, Young voiced concern that he may not be allowed to re-enter the United States after his upcoming European tour due to his criticism of Trump.\n\nYoung spoke out about his fears in a post on his Neil Young Archives website.\n\n“When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” the folk-rock icon wrote.\n\n“If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me,” he added. “That’s right folks, if you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA. If you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We’ll all find that out together.”\n\nAs Young has done many times in the past, he did not hold back about his feelings on Trump in his post, writing, “If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? I love America and its people and its music and its culture. … Remember Freedom of Speech?”\n\n— With files from Global News’ Michelle Butterfield and The Associated Press","summary":"Legendary Canadian musician Neil Young wants U.S. President Donald Trump to stop “worrying” about what Bruce Springsteen and other celebrities think of him.

Holy bazingas!”\n\nHe continued, criticizing the potential agreement for possibly violating bribery laws.\n\n“Now, because handing over a pile of cash to a president over a frivolous lawsuit to get your broadcast license approved sounds so shady, Senators Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Paramount H.Q. raising concerns that this possible settlement risks violating bribery laws.”\n\nColbert joked that although he loves who he works for, he would testify on Paramount’s behalf against Trump’s claims for “the low price of $50 million.”\n\n“Paramount, come on. Let’s talk Turkey. Daddy just wants his beak wet. You cut the check, and zip!” Colbert teased. “I’m joking, obviously. Satire, et cetera. I would never take a bribe from CBS. If Donald Trump outbids them!”\n\nThe late-night host continued to mock the lawsuit, seeming to reference Trump accepting a plane from Qatar as a gift for his presidential library.\n\n“Mr. President, I am willing to testify on your side in this lawsuit for $50 million and $1,” he joked. “And remember, sir, this is not a gift to me.

As of now, the tax break is being incorporated into the “One, Big, Beautiful” budget bill being negotiated by House Republicans, which would be effective from 2026 through 2028.\n\nHow would these changes affect food-industry workers and diners? Here’s what we’ve learned from interviews with tax lawyers, hospitality professors and industry groups:\n\nHow are restaurant employees currently taxed on tips?\n\nThe federal tax code requires that every tip be reported as income. Whether it’s a $20 bill handed to a host, a line filled in on a check or a button pressed on a keypad, employees and employers are required to track and report every cent.

It has not yet been determined whether tips that go directly to a server via a service like Venmo or PayPal would qualify as cash. Service charges, which are legal in some places, are added by the business and do not count as tips.","summary":"Proposed changes making their way through Congress would benefit many employees, but some details are still in flux.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/dining/no-tax-on-tips-bill.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/dining/21FD-tips-explainer/21FD-tips-explainer-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 20:53:51","author":"Julia Moskin","authors":["Julia Moskin"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":323473728,"title":"California Democrat running for governor swipes Harris for Biden ‘cover-up’ as she mulls 2026 campaign","text":"On Tuesday, Villaraigosa focused his gaze on taking down Becerra and Harris, who was a heartbeat away from Biden as his vice president for four years. In response to a new book detailing the extent of Biden’s descent into apparent dementia while in the White House, the former Los Angeles mayor suggested the pair had been complicit in covering up the former president’s decline from voters. “Why didn’t either of them speak out?” he questioned in comments to the Los Angeles Times. \n\n“Voters deserve to know the truth. This cover-up directly led to a second Donald Trump term — and as a result, all Californians are paying the price,” Villaraigosa continued in a post to X on Wednesday. \n\n“Now, we have come to learn this cover-up includes two prominent California politicians who served as California attorney general — one who is running for governor and another who is thinking about running for governor,” he added in a statement to the outlet. “What did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out?”\n\n“At the highest levels of our government, those in power were intentionally complicit or told outright lies in a systematic cover-up to keep Joe Biden’s mental decline from the public,” Villaraigosa warned. “Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra took an oath of office and were entrusted to protect the American people, but instead Kamala Harris repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with Biden, and Becerra turned a blind eye.” \n\nVillaraigosa’s attacks on Harris and Becerra solidify Democrats’ fears that people closely aligned with Biden who defended the former president against concerns about his mental acuity could be dragged down by new revelations detailing the extent of his decline. Those points are outlined most recently in CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson’s book, Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\n\n“Democrats testing the water may not have been forced to answer Biden health questions in the past, but they certainly will now,” a national Democrat involved with major fundraising efforts told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday. \n\nBIDEN’S CANCER DIAGNOSIS FUELS FRESH DOUBTS AND DISTRUST AMONG DEMOCRATS\n\nAs of February, Harris stood ready to sweep aside challengers in a hypothetical Democratic primary, according to a survey from Emerson College Polling. \n\nOf Democrats surveyed, 57% of primary voters would vote for Harris in a hypothetical election. Nearly a fifth, 17%, remained undecided in the poll, which showed former Rep. Katie Porter trailing Harris at 9%. Porter announced her campaign in April, likely giving her a boost. The poll handed Villaraigosa 4% support, with 17% of voters undecided.","summary":"California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa accused former Vice President Kamala Harris, one of his possible competitors in the governor’s race, of being involved in a “systematic cover-up” to conceal former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline from the public eye.  Villaraigosa is running for governor during the 2026 elections after spending decades building political capital [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/state/3418760/california-democrat-governor-candidate-antonio-villaraigosa-kamala-harris-biden-cover-up/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biden-Harris-2025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 20:33:49","author":"Emily Hallas","authors":["Emily Hallas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":323473308,"title":"Democratic leaders must acknowldege the cover-up of Biden’s mental and physical weaknesses (Opinion)","text":"This saddening news of President Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis has added fuel to questions about his health during his presidency.\n\nNo one wants to see the former president and long-time senator facing a serious illness, and I hope that his treatment is effective.\n\nThis announcement was made the same week of the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s explosive book Original Sin. This deeply reported book is based on interviews with over 200 people — many of them Democratic operatives and insiders — and details the astonishing lengths to which President Biden’s team and the broader Democratic establishment went to conceal the president’s cognitive and physical decline from the public.\n\nOriginal Sin exposes one of the most cynical political cover-ups in modern American history, and it explains why Democrats have a trust issue with the American public. This well-earned lack of trust has led to questions about whether Biden may have hidden his prostate cancer too, although there is no evidence to support that he did.\n\nBased upon recent revelations, there can be no question that Republicans and many others, including myself, were justified in sounding the alarm about Biden’s fitness to serve during the re-election campaign.\n\nAt the time, Biden’s team hit back with performative outrage and engaged in kabuki theatre.\n\nHis team dismissed concerns about his age and acuity as dirty politics. But those close to Biden knew they were handling a president who was no longer fit for office. According to accounts of Original Sin, his team choreographed nearly every aspect of Biden’s life — including limiting unscripted interactions, scripting meetings down to the minute, and escorting him to and from Air Force One helicopter to prevent a potential, devastating fall. They even contemplated putting Biden in a wheelchair after the election.\n\nThe cover-up extended to his cognitive decline too. Biden reportedly forgot key names, including major celebrities like George Clooney and even senior members of his own team. Cabinet secretaries were sidelined, and staff members devised elaborate strategies to avoid placing him in situations that might expose his decline.\n\nJust this past week, audio from Special Counsel Robert Hur’s October 2023 interview with President Biden was released. Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland was held in contempt by the U.S. House of Representatives for refusing to release them. In February 2024, Biden and his covert operations team were apoplectic about Hur’s decision that it would be difficult to prosecute Biden in the classified documents matter because Biden was a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and it would be difficult to prove the mental state of willfulness. Biden angrily responded that his memory was fine and his team exalted that this was a “partisan hit job”.\n\nThe audio proves otherwise as the recordings show Biden was confused, rambling, and couldn’t even remember when his son Beau died.\n\nBiden’s team continued to trot out his disingenuous talking points, insisting that he was sharp and physically fit. Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates asserted that “not only does the president perform around the clock, but he maintains a schedule that tires younger aides, including foreign trips into active war zones.” Apparently, however, Biden had difficulty functioning outside of a 6-hour window between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nLike the man behind the curtain in Oz, Biden’s team spun a grand illusion, staging a show of leadership while concealing Biden’s fragility, more devoted to self-preservation and power than being honest.\n\nHere’s where the culpability deepens, Democratic leaders knew. They saw the same signs the public saw and in many instances saw it firsthand and acknowledged it privately. Yet instead of standing up, they continued to vouch for Biden’s fitness.\n\nA month before his disastrous debate with Trump, I wrote a column calling President Biden unfit for office. At that time two-thirds of voters had little or no confidence that Biden was physically fit to be president. Anyone who has watched a family member or close friend decline with senility, dementia or physical ailments had all of the evidence they needed when they watched even his composed public appearances provide clear and unsettling clues with his often incoherent rhetoric and gaffes, confusion and instability.\n\nAnd, following his disastrous debate performance, Biden’s team tried to convince us that it was simply a bad night, blaming the debate preparation team for his poor performance. And, in the days following the debate train wreck, Democratic leaders were conspicuously silent, failing to speak out publicly. My column calling for him to withdraw just a few days after the debate, was one of the very first of its kind in the country and published well before any major Democratic leader called on him to publicly step aside.\n\nAnd, the longer they failed to speak truth to power made it more unlikely the Democrats would win in November. When they finally did, Biden had no choice but to step aside, but behind closed doors, in classic backroom style, Democrats had already crowned his successor, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThis isn’t just a Biden problem that can be conveniently swept under the rug. It’s a Democratic Party problem — a failure of leadership, transparency, ethics and accountability.\n\nThe result? Democrats lost national trust and the party’s favorability rating stands at 29%, a record low. To be fair, that isn’t simply about the cover-up and lack of leadership. It also reflects a party in the wilderness, confused about their values, and unable to muster the leadership to meet Americans where they are on key issues. It is no wonder that only 35% of surveyed Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats would love nothing more than to move on — to refocus on President Donald Trump and reframe the midterm elections as a battle for democracy. But its not that simple. They can’t claim hindsight when they bear collective responsibility for the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nUntil Democrats acknowledge the cover-up, they undermine their own credibility and won’t be able to regain public trust.\n\nIt will surely be impossible for them to authentically critique Trump’s mental acuity and fitness.\n\nDoug Friednash grew up in Denver and is a partner with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber and Schreck.

You not smart enough.“\n\n“But for you to go into a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force—which is a very nice thing, they also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment in addition to the jet,“ he continued, ”you ought to go back to your studio at NBC, because [Comcast CEO] Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, they ought to be investigated.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted multiple media outlets over elements of their coverage since January. \n\nThe Federal Communications Commission, run by Trump acolyte Brendan Carr, has opened investigations into Trump enemies ABC and NBC over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. \n\nHe has also tied CBS’ 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, which Trump has sued the network over for $20 billion, to the FCC’s approval of parent company Paramount Global’s pending merger with Skydance. \n\nTrump continued to bash NBC, ABC, and CBS during the gaggle, and complained that they didn’t cover what he alleged was the “genocide” of white farmers in South Africa.

In the six months since declaring his candidacy, Mamdani has gone from obscure 33-year-old socialist state assemblyman to the biggest story in the battle for City Hall—and a threat to universally known former governor and front-runner Andrew Cuomo. “Zohran is far and away the most talented candidate in the race,” a veteran New York political strategist says.\nComedian Jaboukie Young-White and actor Kal Penn do their best to keep the crowd—which includes Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter of former vice president Kamala Harris—energized during the wait for Mamdani. The mood is festive but wonky: People wearing “Eric Adams Raised My Rent” T-shirts discuss housing development tax policy and read novels to kill time. Finally, after a series of windy politicians and union leaders speak, Mamdani takes the stage, wearing a dark suit and tie set off by a white shirt. Wisely, he keeps his speech to a tight 11 minutes, hopping from signature proposals (“I believe we can freeze the rent for more than 2 million tenants!”) to red meat, like calling President Donald Trump “a wannabe king,” and building to an adrenalized finish. “What we have dreamt in the night, we will build in the dawn,” Mamdani shouts. “The sun is starting to rise, and together, New York, on June 24, we are going to win!”\nThe crowd roars and chants “Zoh-ran! Zoh-ran!” Yet in the background, if you listen hard enough, you can almost hear the calamitous thresher that is tabloid-stoked city politics whirring to life. This morning, after Mamdani exited a breakfast hosted by a Jewish organization in Brooklyn, a fellow state assemblyman, Kalman Yeger, went to the podium and denounced Mamdani as “one of the most vile antisemites” holding elected office in New York. Just less than two weeks later, Politico will run a story highlighting how Mamdani declined to cosponsor two ceremonial legislative resolutions, one celebrating the anniversary of Israel’s founding and another condemning the Holocaust, though Mamdani says he voted for the second edict.\nThis is the flip side of Mamdani’s unexpected success: The political press and his opponents are now taking him seriously and inspecting his record. Cuomo, early in his run, declared antisemitism to be “the most serious and the most important issue” in the campaign—a dubious assessment considering the issues facing New York as a whole, but an astute calculation in a Democratic primary. Jewish voters are one of the city’s most reliable voting demographics. Orthodox Jewish voters are an even more prized bloc, and many in that community were unhappy with Cuomo’s quarantine orders during the pandemic. The ex-governor is finding Mamdani’s history a highly useful foil: Mamdani has long been a vocal advocate for Palestinians; he has called Israel’s military campaign in Gaza a “genocide”; and he has backed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement.\nOne week after the Brooklyn Steel rally, sitting at a table inside Ricky’s Café in polyglot Jackson Heights, Mamdani rejects being labeled antisemitic. “What underpins my politics is a universalism, a belief in human rights that have to be applicable to all people, and that is why I extend these notions of freedom and justice and safety to also apply to Palestinians,” he tells me. “A very real crisis of antisemitism is occurring within our city, and we do it a disservice by allowing politicians like Andrew Cuomo to weaponize it for their own ends.” Mamdani says that, if elected, he would propose creating a department of community safety and increasing funding for hate-violence prevention programs by 800%.\nThe recent attacks, while based in Albany arcana, have nonetheless put Mamdani on the defensive. His campaign’s initial responses to the stories about the Israel and Holocaust resolutions were clumsy, allowing the controversy to fester. “Well, he’s a two-term assemblyman. It’s not like he has some massive operation in place to help handle these things,” a Mamdani ally says. “The infrastructure is, I think, being built as they go.”\nAfter graduating from Bowdoin College in Maine, Mamdani worked as a housing-foreclosure prevention counselor in Queens while also trying to sell mixtapes of himself as the rapper Mr. Cardamom. A career in public policy soon seemed the wiser choice. In 2018, Mamdani became an American citizen; two years later, running as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, he achieved an upset victory in a primary race for a New York State Assembly seat, defeating an incumbent Democrat by riding the local Queens progressive wave that had sent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Congress. Mamdani has scored some modest wins during his two terms in Albany, including the implementation of a pilot program for free city buses. But he has also honed his ability to draw attention, as seen when he went on a 15-day hunger strike to push for better working conditions for city taxi drivers. “I don’t agree with him on everything, but he’s been a straight shooter and has been an effective partner when we work together on issues,” says Mike Gianaris, the State Senate’s deputy Democratic leader and a fellow Queens politician. “What he brings to the table is the ability to galvanize public opinion from people who are not normally involved in politics.”\nThat is essentially the organizing principle of Mamdani’s mayoral campaign. Last fall he looked at the field and saw a lane open to the left. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, was increasingly mired in corruption scandals. The likely challengers were mostly familiar mainstream New York Democrats, including city comptroller Brad Lander and former city comptroller Scott Stringer.\nAnd also, eventually, the 67-year-old Cuomo, who officially joined the field in March, following Adams’s September indictment on bribery and campaign finance charges (to which he pleaded not guilty, with the charges later controversially dismissed after Trump won the presidency). Cuomo, a blunt force in New York politics since the late 1970s, was elected governor three times, only to infamously resign in August 2021 under a black cloud of sexual harassment allegations (he has denied them all) and bitterness over his handling of nursing homes during the COVID pandemic.\nMamdani has been a stark contrast to the somber, gray-haired political lifers, offering a fresh voice packaged in clever Instagram, X, and TikTok posts and touting populist ideas such as low-cost city-owned grocery stores, free buses, and rent freezes for some tenants. He believes he can build a base from younger, Muslim, and South Asian voters and has repeatedly created viral moments—none bigger than when he screamed in the face of Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations, about deportation policy. “Sometimes the only options we’re left with are the ones where you have to shout at the so-called border czar of the United States as he smirks while eating an apple walking across the state capitol,” Mamdani says.\nThe strategy has thus far been successful: Mamdani maxed out on legal campaign donations in March at more than $8 million—collected from more than 19,000 individual donors—and assembled a volunteer force of 20,000-plus that his campaign claims has knocked on more than 500,000 doors. All impressive yet inconclusive. Andrew Yang racked up similarly promising numbers in his bid for mayor four years ago, and was leading in some polls, but finished a distant fourth in the primary.\nThis time around, polling has shown Mamdani as a consistent second to Cuomo, though by a wide margin: A Marist survey released last week had him losing by 24 points. Mamdani’s advisers think they can expand his support to include older, white, conventionally liberal voters in brownstone Brooklyn and on the Upper West Side, particularly as a second or third choice in New York’s ranked-choice voting system, by emphasizing his ideas to lower the cost of living.\nCuomo is, of course, intent on blocking that crossover. He’s portraying himself as the experienced manager who can save the city from the crazy left-wing radicals. The New York Post, meanwhile, is gleefully painting Mamdani as a hypocritical poseur. Mamdani very much wants to be seen as more than just the hipster candidate who attracted R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe to one of his fundraisers, and he welcomes the skirmishing to an extent. “The record that Cuomo touts, we are seeing each and every day that it is built on a very flimsy set of facts,” he says. “He is scared of having to actually answer questions from New Yorkers that are not scripted….because to expose himself to the world that he wants to run is to admit to the fact that he spent the last few decades in suburbia and his connection to New York City is more on cable news than actually out on the street…and I think he’s also scared of our campaign.”\nCuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi ticks off a list of the former governor’s accomplishments, including raising the state’s minimum wage and rebuilding LaGuardia Airport. “He’s got the experience and the record to put this city back on track,” Azzopardi says. “The stakes are too high to entrust this job to a 33-year-old silver spoon socialist whose short political career has been as a legislative backbencher who has no record or management experience whatsoever.”\nWith his raft of major endorsements, tough-guy image, and millions of dollars in ads launched by a supportive super PAC, Cuomo remains the favorite. “Progressives are not connecting with blue-collar voters, whether you measure that along racial and ethnic lines or income and education,” an analyst not affiliated with any of the campaigns says. “For Mamdani to make an upset, he would need to build some bridges beyond just the left, and the overall turnout would have to be under 600,000 voters. In 2021 the turnout was just under 1 million.”\nThe math is indeed very difficult. An estimated 50% of the electorate still doesn’t know who Mamdani is, something he will try to remedy with millions in ad spending down the stretch. Still, putting Mamdani in charge of New York’s $112 billion city budget and its larger-than-many-national-armies police department would require an enormous leap of faith by city voters, driven by something beyond the policy particulars he’s pushing. “I decided to run as a response to the ways in which the Adams administration had made life that much more expensive in a city that was already suffocating,” he says, “and the feeling that when the political class looked at this city after Trump won more votes in November, they were misreading despair as instead being a rightward shift.”\nWhether Mamdani wins or not, his rise is significant—for what it says about the tensions between social and traditional media; as a measure of the role of progressives in the Democratic Party; as a test of whether New York’s tribal fault lines are shifting; and as an expression of the generational hunger for change. “These other people have had their chances,” says Alanna Saunders, a 33-year-old actor in the Brooklyn Steel crowd listening to Mamdani. “The only way the city gets out of its problems is by putting younger blood in charge.”\nThat’s an admirably hopeful view. The immediate political question, though, is whether Mamdani bumps up against the limits of both charisma and left-wing politics, even in New York City. Nimble and confident, as always, Mamdani quickly shrugs off skepticism around buzz translating into enough ballots. “This is a campaign,” he says, “that continues to eclipse every ceiling that’s been imposed upon it.”","summary":"The 33-year-old state assemblyman is winning over young lefties and drawing praise from veteran politicos: “Far and away the most talented candidate,” says one strategist.

Nevada has one of the highest populations of service workers in the United States. According to the Tax Policy Center, 5% of Nevadans are tipped workers. \n\nThe proposed legislation would add to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that certain tipped workers can receive a deduction on future tips and a credit for previously taxed cash tips. \n\nOnly workers in an “occupation traditionally receiving tips” would receive the break. Those jobs were partially defined in a statement by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as “servers, bartenders, [and] delivery drivers.” Another occupation mentioned in the legislation is people in the beauty service industry.\n\nHow much could workers save?\n\nIf passed, each worker would be able to receive a tax deduction on tips in 2026 and a credit for previously taxed tips dating as far back as Dec. 31, 2023, up to $25,000. According to the National Employment Law Project, the U.S.’s monthly median tipped wage is $867, equating to about $10,400 in tips per year. The taxes on those tips since the end of 2023 would be credited.\n\nEmployees who earn over $160,000 per year would not qualify for the tax deduction.\n\nThree percent of families are estimated to benefit from the tax break, which would cost approximately $100 billion, according to a Yale Budget Lab report from September 2024.\n\nWho supports ‘no tax on tips’?\n\nAnother sponsor of the act was Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed similar sentiments during her debate against Trump during the 2024 campaign. \n\nFormer libertarian Texas Rep. Ron Paul floated the idea during his 2012 presidential campaign, but saw significant pushback from economists.\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nThe bill will now move to the House, where representatives will go through the same process of research and discussion. If the tax cut passes in the House, the bill will be sent to the president, who has remained committed to the proposal thus far.\n\nThere is also a version of the act in the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill,” which is making its way through the House Rules Committee. If the act is still included in the reconciliation bill when it passes, it could be cut once the bill goes to markup in the Senate before the final version heads to the president’s desk.","summary":"The No Tax on Tips Act was passed in the Senate on Tuesday after being co-sponsored by Sen.

Because it certainly wasn’t the so-called commander in chief. But perhaps, it wasn’t really a question of who. Maybe we were governed by something much closer to an invisible hand of wokeness. Maybe we were governed by a twisted worldview, not a conspiracy or solitary figure. WHY WE MUST EXPOSE THE CRIMINAL FRAUD OF THOSE BEHIND BIDEN'S DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY It is reasonable, and almost comforting, to believe that Barack Obama or some other Democrat luminary was sitting at the center of the political universe like Vishnu, myriad arms pulling levers and flicking switches. But the reality might be far more troubling. The reality might be that progressive politics have created a self-perpetuating deep state bureaucracy that, left unchecked, couldn’t care less who sits behind the Resolute Desk. There are a handful of behind-the-scenes power brokers, hiding from public view of late, who clearly had a lot of sway in the Biden White House: Chief of Staff Jeff Zeints, longtime ally Mike Donilon, Senior Adviser Anita Dunn, and the ever-present Susan Rice. But in all likelihood, they were not running some textbook conspiracy theory to rule in Biden’s name. In fact, the entire Biden administration looks more like a broken play in football; It really was just trying to stay on its feet. It is telling that the front-facing cabinet members of Biden’s, unlike his hotshot behind-the-scenes team, were feckless, awful and never fired for anything. Watching our current Secretary of State Marco Rubio cross swords with Democrats in his Senate testimony this week couldn’t help but remind us of someone like hapless Biden Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, sitting in those same rooms, like a scolded child unable to mount a defense for his open borders. Or how about Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who seemed to have a special Zippo lighter designed to let him fire up conflagrations from Ukraine to the Middle East? Or Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin -- when he was available, of course -- whose Afghanistan withdrawal made the Keystone Cops look like the A Team? For four years this \"aw shucks\" brigade of midwits was allowed to drive our nation off a cliff precisely because nobody was actually in charge. When the border was a mess and Mayorkas embarrassed himself on the Hill, what would be the process for firing him? The boss is oblivious. Who would actually care enough to go after him? None of the insiders I mentioned above. It wasn’t their legacy, wasn’t their problem. So no accountability. No. We were governed by a set of progressive assumptions, much like the invisible hand of the market that Adam Smith wrote about. In progressive politics the questions simply answer themselves. It is a system. Why would Mayorkas let the southern border become a turnstile for foreign gang members? Because first and foremost, we must think of the innocent migrants, even if the cruel open borders policy is getting many of them trafficked. Why couldn’t the Biden administration back off of the hill of men playing in women’s sports when everyone without pronouns on their business card knows it's absurd? Because progressive ideology dictates that the oppressed must be right. Why was the Biden administration unable to forcefully call out antisemitism on our college campuses? Because Jews are now white-adjacent and privileged. We were governed by a set of left-wing assumptions. Think about what almost happened. Even if Democrats had somehow gotten Methusela Biden over the finish line, with his new cancer diagnosis, we now know we would have wound up with Kamala \"I’m not taking questions at this time\" Harris as president. Could there be a better example of the fact that, to Democrats, it doesn’t matter in the slightest who is actually in charge?

There’s also a three-and-a-half-minute recording of Springsteen once again critiquing the state of American politics later in the show.\n\n “In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on American workers, they’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and moral society,” he says in the clip. “They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.”\n\n The EP comes shortly after Trump responded to Springsteen’s onstage remarks by calling him “highly overrated” and “dumb as a rock” on Truth Social, adding at the time, “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare.'” \n\n Later, the billionaire accused the “Born in the U.S.A.” singer — along with Beyoncé, Oprah and Bono — of taking part in an “illegal election scam” for Kamala Harris, alleging that he accepted an undisclosed payment from the 2024 Democratic nominee to endorse her for president. (Campaign finance records do not support this claim, and Harris’ campaign has denied paying any artist for their support in last year’s election.)\n\n Trump still hadn’t let the matter go as of Wednesday, when he shared an edited video of himself golfing — and appearing to hit and knock over Springsteen with his ball — on Truth Social hours after the Land of Hopes & Dreams EP dropped.\n\n But despite Trump’s counters, Springsteen hasn’t ever backed down on his firm stance against the president’s policies. The E Street bandleader has long been vocal about his beliefs, telling The Atlantic in 2020 that he believed Trump — who in May 2024 was convicted of 34 felony counts in a hush money trial — to be a “threat to our democracy.”\n\n Also in 2024, Springsteen proudly endorsed Harris and played at a number of her campaign events. He also appeared in an advertisement for the former VP’s campaign, telling viewers, “This election is about a group of folks who want to fundamentally undermine our American way of life … Donald Trump does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American.”","summary":"The recorded remarks previously led the politician to call the Boss \"dumb as a rock.\"","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-president-trump-speech-live-ep-1235977938/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bruce-springsteen-press-credit-rob-demartin-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 19:23:59","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.014},{"id":323458900,"title":"Charli xcx Doesn't Expect to Replicate “Brat”’s Success.

Springsteen Feud Escalates: Trump Posts Video Depicting Him Hitting Singer With Golf Ball","text":"President Donald Trump and billionaire musician Bruce Springsteen continued their escalating feud this week, as Trump renewed his social media attacks against the singer Wednesday while Springsteen released a live album containing some of his Trump-critical speeches on streaming platforms.\n\nBruce Springsteen slammed the Trump administration in a May 14 performance in the United Kingdom. ... More (Photo by Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nTrump’s Truth Social video, his latest social media attack on the singer, depicts himself hitting a golf ball in an edited video spliced together with a clip of Springsteen, in which the ball appears to knock him over.\n\nSpringsteen, also on Wednesday, released a live extended play on streaming services featuring songs and spoken interludes from his set in Manchester last week, which includes his speech slamming Trump as “treasonous,” “corrupt” and “authoritarian.”\n\nThe first track on the EP, “Land of Hopes and Dreams (Introduction),” is a one-minute, 39-second track in which Springsteen makes a speech critical of Trump: “The America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” he says.\n\nOn the track, throughout which the crowd roars, Springsteen urges those who “believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.”\n\nOn the EP’s fourth track, his spoken introduction to “My City of Ruins,” Springsteen says: “In America, they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent,” and “the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death.”\n\n“They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation,” Springsteen says on the fourth track, without naming Trump, while criticizing the United States for “abandoning our great allies” and “siding with dictators.”\n\nHow Did The Trump Vs. Springsteen Feud Start?\n\nSpringsteen’s remarks criticizing Trump, which he made on stage last week in Manchester, England, angered the president, who took to Truth Social days after his show to call the musician “Highly Overrated.” “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy,” Trump posted, warning the “dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!)” to “KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country.” Springsteen again made critical remarks about the Trump administration at a show in Manchester on Saturday, repeating many of the lines he had said days earlier. Trump again lashed out at Springsteen in a Truth Social post on Monday, questioning whether his election opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, paid Springsteen for his endorsement, accusing him—with no evidence—of a “major and illegal campaign contribution.” Trump demanded an investigation into Springsteen and other celebrities who endorsed Harris.\n\nWhat Do We Know About Bruce Springsteen’s Political Views?\n\nSpringsteen has stumped for Democratic presidential candidates for decades, appearing at rallies for John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and he narrated one of former President Joe Biden’s campaign advertisements. Springsteen endorsed Harris and appeared at a rally for her in Philadelphia alongside Obama. Springsteen has long been critical of Trump, whom he called a “threat to democracy” during his first term. Springsteen’s music is known for lyrics uplifting the working class, and in the 1980s, he and former President Ronald Reagan had different interpretations of his hit song, “Born in the U.S.A.” Reagan praised the song at a 1984 campaign stop for its “message of hope,” prompting Springsteen to address the then-president on stage days later. “I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must’ve been, you know? I don’t think it was the ‘Nebraska’ album. I don’t think he’s been listening to this one,” Springsteen said, before singing “Johnny 99,” a song about a fictional man who gets laid off, cannot find work and turns to alcohol and crime.\n\nTrump has also recently attacked two other wealthy and powerful musicians: Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, whom he named in recent Truth Social rants. Last week, Trump posted: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” referring to a post he made on Truth Social in September after Swift announced support for Harris. The reason for Trump’s post is unclear, as Swift has not mentioned him recently and has kept a low profile since her Eras Tour wrapped up in December. Trump also questioned Beyoncé’s endorsement of Harris in the same post targeting Springsteen, questioning (without evidence) whether she also was paid for her endorsement.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Revives Taylor Swift Feud And Calls Bruce Springsteen ‘Highly Overrated’ (Forbes)\n\nTrump Wants Investigation Into Springsteen And Beyonce’s Endorsement Of Harris (Forbes)\n\n‘Dried out prune’? ‘Corrupt’ and ‘incompetent’?

You worry about that instead of the dyin’ kids in Gaza. That’s your problem.”\n\nHe continued: “I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That’s your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING.”\n\nYoung added that Taylor Swift “is right” and “so is Bruce.” (Swift was a recent subject of one of Trump’s Truth Social posts. He wrote: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?'”)\n\n“You know how I feel. You are more worried about yourself than AMERICA,” Young added. “Wake up Trump!! Remember what the White House is?”\n\n“86/47?? That’s what you think about? You are forgetting your real job. You work for us. Wake up Republicans! This guy is out of control. We need a real president,” Young concluded his post.\n\nThe phrase “86/47” is a reference to a recent social media post made by former FBI director James Comey, who wrote “cool shell formation on my beach walk” under a picture of seashells that appeared to form the shapes for “86 47.”\n\nNumerous Trump administration officials, including Kristi Noem, said Comey was advocating for the assassination of Trump, the 47th president. Merriam-Webster says 86 is slang meaning “to throw out,” “to get rid of” or “to refuse service to,” but colloquially can mean “kill.”\n\nYoung’s post comes after Trump escalated his feud with Springsteen over the long weekend, calling for a “major investigation” into the rock legend after Springsteen branded the Trump administration as “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” during a concert in England last week.\n\nOn May 19, Trump took to Truth Social to post a lengthy, all-caps screed against Springsteen and other Hollywood A-listers who endorsed Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election.\n\n“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote online, in a message published in the middle of the night. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? … AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???”\n\n“I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,” the president continued in his rant. “In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT’S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,’ this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system.”\n\nHe didn’t stop there, however. Nearly eight hours later, he returned to the subject.\n\n“According to news reports, Beyoncé was paid $11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” he wrote.\n\n“Remember, the Democrats and Kamala illegally paid her millions of Dollars for doing nothing other than giving Kamala a full throated ENDORSEMENT.\n\nSwitching back to all-caps, he concluded: “THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! IT IS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION! BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, OPRAH, BONO AND, PERHAPS, MANY OTHERS, HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!!!”\n\nSpringsteen, a longtime opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump’s most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.\n\nHe told a Manchester audience that he believes Trump is “unfit” for the Oval Office.\n\nWhile introducing his and the E Street Band’s song Land of Hopes and Dreams, after which his current tour is named, the 75-year-old Springsteen said, “In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”\n\n“The last check on power after the checks and balances of government have failed are the people, you and me. It’s in the union of people around a common set of values now — that’s all that stands between a democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all we’ve got is each other,” Springsteen continued later in the show.\n\nThe next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,” he wrote on social media.\n\n“This dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,” he said.\n\nThe next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.\n\nAs for Young, this isn’t the first time the Heart of Gold singer has spoken out against Trump.\n\nIn early April, Young voiced concern that he may not be allowed to re-enter the United States after his upcoming European tour due to his criticism of Trump.\n\nYoung spoke out about his fears in a post on his Neil Young Archives website.\n\n“When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” the folk-rock icon wrote.\n\n“If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me,” he added. “That’s right folks, if you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA. If you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We’ll all find that out together.”\n\nAs Young has done many times in the past, he did not hold back about his feelings on Trump in his post, writing, “If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? I love America and its people and its music and its culture. … Remember Freedom of Speech?”\n\n— With files from Global News’ Michelle Butterfield and The Associated Press","summary":"'You know how I feel.

The Democratic Party’s hopes that President Donald Trump’s job approval rating would zoom down toward zero have been temporarily frustrated, as it has risen slightly in May and is higher than at any point in his first term. \n\nTo illustrate the pickle Democrats are in, it’s helpful to provide a little historical perspective, at least as far back as a dozen years, on the very different political climate following the 2012 election. That saw the third consecutive reelection of an incumbent president, something not seen since 1820.\n\nThe respected Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg argued that Democrats’ increased support from college graduates, plus huge margins from blacks, Hispanics, and young people, would form a “coalition of the ascendant” dominant for years to come. \n\nGreenberg was right about trends up to that point. However, he failed to account for the Newtonian law that says for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. His coalition spurred a coalition of the nonascendant. White non-college-educated people living outside million-dollar-plus metropolitan areas spurned Democrats and elected Trump over Hillary Clinton. A similar coalition in Britain produced the unexpected victory for Brexit five months before. \n\nBy 2024, after one Trump and one Biden term, that movement continued, including among non-college-educated Hispanics, Asians, and blacks. Figures compiled by the Democratic firm Catalist and spotlighted by Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini showed Republicans gaining 36 points among Latinos aged 18-29, 33 points among black men, and 30 points among non-college-educated Asians between 2012 and 2024. \n\nIn the process, the Democratic Party has become increasingly dominated by white college-educated people, who reliably turn out to vote, contribute lots of money, and have poor judgment about what matters will appeal to majorities of the entire electorate. As the financial adviser Dave Ramsey put it, “The hardest people to convince to use common sense are the smart people.” \n\nHigh-education voters, repelled by Trump’s crudeness, provided the enthusiasm behind the Russia collusion hoax and the various lawfare prosecutions and attempts to remove Trump from office somehow. They provided the impetus behind the flawed “science” to extend school closings and other undue COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAfter George Floyd‘s death in May 2020, they gave support or silent acquiescence to radical calls for defunding the police, to reparations for descendants of slaves, and to continued racial quotas and preferences — all positions opposed by large majorities of voters. Biden, having secured the nomination after winning the majority black South Carolina primary, felt obliged to name a black woman for vice president, although the party nominated a black presidential candidate twice in the previous three contests. \n\nIn a process described by Greg Schultz, manager of Biden’s 2020 primary campaign, the voters and officeholders of what he called “the (mostly) safe middle” of the party have embraced or accepted policies advocated by “the (much smaller) far left,” but that actively repel “the majority-makes” whose votes Democratic candidates need to win.\n\nThat didn’t happen when “the (mostly) safe middle” was typified by Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg’s non-college-educated housewife from Dayton married to a machinist. However, it has happened now that the voter looks like the college-educated professional woman married to a lawyer in the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. \n\nYou can see how this works out on controversial transgender matters. College-educated Democrats, noting the public majorities favoring same-sex marriage, have enthusiastically backed stands supported by transgender advocates and expressed scorn for the few elected Democrats opposing them. They have failed to reflect that it took 22 years from Andrew Sullivan’s 1989 New Republic article advocating same-sex marriage to the first Gallup poll showing a national majority in favor.\n\nThose two decades included partisan and civil arguments from Sullivan and Jonathan Rauch that marriage would consensitize gays and need not affect others, just as standard wedding etiquette allows you to decline an invitation without giving a reason or a gift.\n\nIn contrast, transgender activists impinge on others. They insist that inevitably more muscular biological men must compete in female sports, and they pummel the rare Democrat, such as Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), when they question that. As transgender demands have become better known, they have lost support, as Pew Research reported.\n\nMost voters are motivated by concrete concerns — direct economic interests and ethnic or racial concerns. College-educated voters tend to have more theoretical concerns. Sometimes they may alert others to injustice and persuade them to address it, such as supporters of equal rights for blacks. The danger is that their high regard for their own views leads them to take impolitic stands, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s support of government-paid transgender surgeries for prisoners and illegal immigrants. \n\nEvery political party must strike some balance between the demands of its core constituencies and the beliefs of voters. That’s hard for a party dominated by college-educated activists with theoretical rather than practical concerns. The Democratic Party today, with its discredited leadership and its college-educated core, seems badly off kilter.","summary":"How does a political party with overwhelming advantages, including increasing support from the growing bloc of highly educated and affluent voters, almost monopoly support from the press and broadcast media, and with burgeoning financial and high-tech sectors of the economy, manage to lose just about everything across the board?

Trump did not caption the video, but also shared it on X.\n\n Billboard has reached out to Springsteen’s reps for comment.\n\n This latest dig at the 20-time Grammy winner comes after Springsteen spoke out against the twice-impeached president on his ongoing tour. “[America] is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” the rocker, who endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said during his first Land of Hopes and Dreams Tour in Manchester, England, on May 14. “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.”\n\n Trump, who in May 2024 was convicted of 34 felony charges in his hush money trial, responded in a lengthy Truth Social post on May 16 calling the artist “dumb as a rock” and going on to insult his talent. “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare,’” Trump wrote the same day he also insulted Taylor Swift, who also endorsed his opponent in the election. “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!”\n\n Springsteen continued his criticism of the president during his May 17 show in Manchester. “In my home, they’re persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That’s happening now,” the musician told concertgoers. “The majority of our elected representatives have utterly failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.”\n\n Those same comments from his two concerts are included in a new six-track EP also titled Land of Hopes & Dreams, which arrived on Wednesday.\n\n Since the back-and-forth, the president has called for investigations into Springsteen as well as other stars for allegedly joining in on an what he calls an “illegal election scam” he claims was orchestrated by Harris’ campaign. In May 19 Truth Social posts, Trump accused The Boss, Beyoncé, U2’s Bono as well as Oprah Winfrey of illegally accepting undisclosed payments to appear at the former VP’s rallies and endorse her. FactCheck.org previously disproved those allegations when they first surfaced in 2024.\n\n After Trump initially insulted Springsteen and Swift on May 16, the American Federation of Musicians International stepped up to defend the artists. “The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada will not remain silent as two of our members — Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift — are singled out and personally attacked by the President of the United States,” Tino Gagliardi, the organization’s president, said in part in a statement that day. “Musicians have the right to freedom of expression, and we stand in solidarity with all our members.”","summary":"The president previously slammed the musician for speaking out against him during his concerts.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/trump-bruce-springsteen-golf-ball-video-1235977871/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/donald-trump-bruce-springsteen-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 18:55:27","author":"Anna Chan","authors":["Anna Chan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":323445754,"title":"Trump and Co are doing their best to make America white again — as if it ever was","text":"On May 5, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute held its annual fundraising gala. The event showcases the extraordinary imaginations of people who design exorbitant clothes and the gutsiness of those who dare (and can afford) to wear them.\n\nI’m dimly aware of this annual extravaganza because of my interest in knitting, spinning, and weaving—the crafts involved in turning fluff into yarn and yarn into cloth. Mind you, I have no flair for fashion myself. I could never carry off wearing the simplest of ballgowns, and I’m way too short to rock a tuxedo. My own personal style runs to 1970s White Dyke. (Think blue jeans and flannel shirts.) But I remain fascinated by what braver people will get themselves up in.\n\nOne of my favorite movies is Paris Is Burning, a 1990 documentary about the underground Harlem ballroom scene, where drag queens and transgender folks, mostly Black and Latina, recreated a fierce version of the world of haute couture. It was a testament to people’s ability to take the detritus of what systems of racism and economic deprivation had given them and spin it into defiant art.\n\nSo I was excited to learn that the theme of this year’s gala was to be “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” an homage to the tradition of Black dandyism, about which Vogue magazine writes:\n\nThere is something undeniably magnetic about the sharp creases of a tailored suit, the gleam of polished leather shoes, the swish of a silk pocket square. But for Black dandyism, this isn’t just about looking good—it’s a declaration. A defiant reclaiming of space in a world that has long sought to define and confine Black identity. So, what exactly is Black dandyism? At its core, it’s a fashion revolution, a movement steeped in history, resistance, and pride.\n\nThe Met’s gala theme was chosen back in October 2024, when it still seemed possible that, rather than electing a fascist toddler, this country might choose a Black woman as president. In that case, the gala could have served as an extended victory toast. (As it happens, Kamala Harris did in fact attend.)\n\nInstead, this country is today laboring under an increasingly authoritarian regime in Washington, one proudly and explicitly dedicated to reversing decades of victories by various movements for Black liberation.\n\nResuscitating Employment Discrimination\n\nI wrote “laboring under” quite intentionally, because one of one of Trump 2.0’s key attacks on African Americans comes in the realm of work. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 in its ominous preelection document Mandate for Change made this clear in a chapter on the Labor Department. The first “needed reform” there, it insisted, would be to uproot DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) efforts wherever they might be found in the government and military. Its authors wrote that the new administration must:\n\nReverse the DEI Revolution in Labor Policy. Under the Obama and Biden administrations, labor policy was yet another target of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) revolution. Under this managerialist left-wing race and gender ideology, every aspect of labor policy became a vehicle with which to advance race, sex, and other classifications and discriminate against conservative and religious viewpoints on these subjects and others, including pro-life views. The next administration should eliminate every one of these wrongful and burdensome ideological projects.\n\nIn case the reader has any doubt about the evils attributed to DEI, that chapter’s next “needed reform” made it clear that the greatest of those horrors involved any effort whatsoever to prevent racial discrimination against people of color. To that end, Project 2025 wanted the federal government to stop collecting racial demographics in employment. It called on the next administration to eliminate altogether the gathering of such data by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on the grounds that collecting “employment statistics based on race/ethnicity… can then be used to support a charge of discrimination under a disparate impact theory. This could lead to racial quotas to remedy alleged race discrimination.”\n\nIn other words, as I wrote months before Donald Trump returned to power, “If you can’t demonstrate racial discrimination in employment (because you are enjoined from collecting data about race and employment), then there is no racial discrimination to remedy.”\n\nThe 1964 Civil Rights Act first established the EEOC’s mandate to collect such employment data by race in its Title VII, the section on employment rights. Title VII remains a major target of the second Trump administration. That’s especially true when it comes to federal employment, where all federal agencies are required “to maintain an affirmative program of equal employment”—an idea abhorred by the Trump administration.\n\nThe employment-rights section of the Civil Rights Act covers all employers, including the federal government. And in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson went even further, issuing Executive Order 11246, which applied similar principles to the employment practices of federal contractors. That order established the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which uses the EEOC’s data to ensure that federal contractors don’t discriminate against what are considered protected classes of workers.\n\nNot surprisingly, Project 2025 called on the next administration to rescind Executive Order 11246, which is precisely what President Donald Trump did on January 21, 2025, his second day in office, in an order entitled (apparently without irony) “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” (To be clear, by “illegal discrimination,” Trump, of course, meant imagined “discrimination” against white people.) In addition to eliminating that mandate, Trump’s order also rescinded a number of later executive orders meant to ensure racial equity in employment, including:\n\n(i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);(ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);(iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and(iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).\n\nAccording to Project 2025, preventing “discrimination” against whites requires another move as well: eliminating any law or policy that prohibits discriminatory employment outcomes. In other words, intentional racial discrimination, which is often impossible to prove, would remain the only legitimate form of discrimination.\n\nDecimating the Black Middle Class\n\nWhy have I made such a detailed excursion into the weeds of federal law and policymaking? Because the real-world effects on African American communities of such arcane maneuvering will likely be staggering.\n\nFederal employment was a crucial factor in building today’s Black middle class, beginning in the decades after emancipation and accelerating significantly under the provisions of that 1964 Civil Rights Act and the various presidential orders that followed. As Danielle Mahones of the Berkeley Labor Center of the University of California points out, “Federal employment has been a pathway to the middle class for African American workers and their families since Reconstruction, including postal work and other occupations.” We can now expect, she adds, “to see Black workers lose their federal jobs.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s apparently race-neutral attack on supposed waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal workforce is guaranteed to disproportionately remove Black workers from federal employment.\n\nAnd with Donald Trump’s victory in November 2024, that indeed is the plan that has been brought to the White House by Russell Vought, one of the key architects of Project 2025 and now head of the Office of Management and Budget. Implementation began with the series of executive orders already described, which largely govern the hiring of new employees. But actions affecting federal hiring don’t take effect quickly, especially in periods of government cutbacks like we’re seeing today.\n\nFortunately for Vought and his co-conspirators at the Heritage Foundation, Trump had another option in his anti-Black toolbox: the chainsaw wielded by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. While estimates vary, the best estimate is that, thanks to Musk and crew, around 260,000 federal workers have by now “been fired, taken buyouts, or retired early.”\n\nEliminating federal employees in such a way has indeed had a disproportionate effect on Black workers, since they comprise almost 19% of that workforce, while the country’s total workforce is only 13% Black. (At the Post Office, the figure may be closer to 30%.) If 260,000 federal workers have lost their jobs under Trump and Musk, then almost 50,000 of them may be Black. In other words, cutting federal jobs disproportionately affects Black workers.\n\n“Negro Removal”\n\nOf course, Donald Trump’s approach to Blacks is hardly new in this country. “Negro removal” has a long history here. When I first moved to San Francisco in the late 1970s, there was a big blank area in the middle of the city. Acres of empty blocks sat in the section of town known as the “Western Addition” or, to the people who had once lived there, “the Fillmore.” The Fillmore had been a racially mixed neighborhood. Populated by Japanese- and Filipino-Americans, it had also housed a significant Black enclave. As a local NPR podcast described the scene, “If you were walking down San Francisco’s Fillmore Street in the 1950s, chances are you might run into Billie Holiday stepping out of a restaurant. Or Ella Fitzgerald trying on hats. Or Thelonious Monk smoking a cigarette.” The neighborhood was often called the “Harlem of the West.”\n\nBut “urban renewal” projects, initiated under the federal Housing Act of 1949, would tear down over 14,000 housing units and an unknown number of businesses there in the name of “slum clearance and community redevelopment.” By the time I arrived, however, much of the Fillmore had been rebuilt, including the Japantown business area, though many empty lots remained. Today, they’ve all been filled in, but the 10% of the city’s population that had been African American when “urban renewal” began has been halved. And while Blacks still represent 5% of the city’s population, they also account for 37% of the unhoused.\n\nThe writer and activist James Baldwin visited San Francisco in 1963, while the Fillmore’s razing was in full swing. “Urban renewal,” he pointed out, “is Negro removal.” And according to Mindy T. Fullilove, a professor of urban studies and health, San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was duplicated across the country. As she put it back in 2001:\n\n[U]rban renewal affected thousands of communities in hundreds of cities. Urban renewal was to achieve “clearance” of “blight” and “slum” areas so that they could be rebuilt for new uses other than housing the poor… The short-term consequences were dire, including loss of money, loss of social organization, and psychological trauma.\n\nAs Fullilove argued, federal policies like urban renewal, involving “community dispossession—and its accompanying psychological trauma, financial loss, and rippling instability—produced a rupture in the historical trajectory of African American urban communities.” She believes that such federal intervention foreclosed the possibility that Black people would follow the route to full participation in U.S. social, commercial, and political life taken by “earlier waves of immigrants to the city.”\n\nPolicies that appear to be “race neutral” can have racialized effects. The phrase “urban renewal” says nothing about uprooting Black communities, yet that is what it achieved in practice. Just as earlier federal policies led to the removal of Black communities from the hearts of hundreds of U.S. cities, the Trump administration’s apparently race-neutral attack on supposed waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal workforce is guaranteed to disproportionately remove Black workers from federal employment. Together with the planned ejection of millions of immigrants, and following the Project 2025 playbook, Trump, Elon Musk, and their minions like Stephen Miller are doing their best to Make America White Again. (As if it ever was!)\n\nText and Subtext\n\nThe second time around, Trump’s administration sees race everywhere. It’s the subtext of almost everything its officials say and it’s right there in the “text” of its actions and pronouncements.\n\nIronically enough, Mindy Fullilove’s article is—for the moment—still available from the National Institutes of Health library website. Given the “Negro removal” that the Trump administration has been eagerly pursuing on its thousands of websites and libraries, though, who knows how long it will remain there. Certainly, you can expect to see further erasures of African Americans from any arena this administration enters. As Washington Post columnist Theodore T. Johnson writes,\n\nNot only does this White House see race; it is also a preoccupation: One of its first executive orders enacted an anti-diversity agenda that purged women, people of color, and programs from federal websites and libraries. Trump directed the firing of multiple generals and admirals who are Black, female, or responsible for the military following the rule of law.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the purging (and in some cases, embarrassed restoration) of any number of Black historical figures, including Jackie Robinson, Harriet Tubman, and the Tuskegee Airmen, from government websites.\n\nNor are attacks on employment and representation the new administration’s only attempts to constrain the lives of African Americans. On April 28, Trump issued an executive order devoted to “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens.” In addition to “unleashing” local law enforcement, the order prepares the way for military involvement in local policing. It also seeks to roll back consent decrees governing the behavior of police departments judged discriminatory by previous Justice Departments. In 2025, no one should be confused about the respective races of the “criminals” and “innocent citizens” referred to in Trump’s order.\n\nSo yes, along with overlapping groups, including immigrants, transgender and other LGBTQ+ folks, women, and union workers, Black Americans are clear targets for this administration. That’s why even as rarified an event as the Met Gala may be, it still inspires me. As Ty Gaskins wrote in Vogue, Black style is a “defiant reclaiming of space in a world that has long sought to define and confine Black identity.”\n\nIsn’t it now time for all of us to reclaim our space—and nation—from Donald Trump?\n\nNOW READ: Even Trump's lapdog is terrified now","summary":"On May 5, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute held its annual fundraising gala.

He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president,” she said. \n\nExpect that quote to be thrown at her time and again in any upcoming presidential campaign. She was the vice president. The assumption is that she knew everything going on behind doors in the real West Wing. Even if she didn’t.\n\nDitto for Tim Walz. Even though he didn’t seem to know much about what was going on in Harris’s campaign, let alone Biden’s.’\n\nAnd Gina Raimondo, Biden’s Commerce Secretary, was inside the circle. The GOP wolves will be circling.\n\nHotel billionaire Governor J.B. Pritzker can at least claim his Illinois base as a buffer from Biden. The same goes for Gov. Andy Beshear in Kentucky and Gov. Wes Moore in Maryland. And AOC was never going to be popping in for tea at the Oval. But that will not stop the inevitable questions from any future Republican opponents.\n\nA little over half of America voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, knowing that he was almost 78 years old. This is not an age when an uncomfortable prognosis comes as a major surprise.\n\nDonald Trump will be in his eighties by the time his second term nears an end. It is very possible he will face the same kind of dilemma as Josiah Bartlet and Joe Biden.\n\nWill the current president ever admit his health is anything less than “perfect?”\n\nDon’t bet on it.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Eric Faison/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesThe writers of ‘The West Wing’ may see a spike in their residuals in the next few weeks as the repercussions of Joe Biden‘s mental decline and prostate cancer diagnosis become clearer.\n\nFans of the 1999-2006 TV drama about the two-term fictional Democratic Party administration may remember that President Josiah Bartlet’s secret battle with multiple sclerosis was a major plotline.\n\nThe revered TV commander-in-chief‘s integrity was called into question after it emerged that he kept his debilitating illness under wraps during his successful campaign for the White House.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-health-lies-will-play-out-like-tvs-west-wing-for-dem-2028-hopefuls/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/MKWBZDMXUZFXHOB75TXUPQ46RM.png?smart=true&auth=9311f134c966e3d3476d2dd59b3b84c4b30675a680fe856e3a7e431951babe27&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 18:29:56","author":"David Gardner","authors":["David Gardner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":323434812,"title":"Biden’s senility scandal leads top Republican to demand DOJ probe into ‘representations’ to public","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Bombshell developments continue to emerge about former President Joe Biden’s declining health along with allegations of a White House cover-up. In response, a top Republican is urging the Justice Department to investigate whether any laws were broken in how Biden’s condition was presented to the public. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas is expected to write Wednesday afternoon to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding that the DOJ open a probe into \"any potential violations of federal law surrounding the representations made to the American people about the health and wellbeing (sic) of then-President Biden.\" In the letter obtained by Fox News Digital, Cornyn cited the May 18 report from Biden’s camp that he is battling late-stage aggressive prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. \"This announcement follows the publication of news reports calling into question the former president’s capacity and awareness during his time in office,\" Cornyn said as other Biden critics questioned what then-White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor knew while treating the president. TEXAS LAWMAKERS SEEK TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR BIDEN ERA BORDER CONTROL EXPENSES In the letter, Cornyn expressed concern that Biden’s \"associates,\" including O’Connor, misrepresented or made \"material omissions\" to the public about his mental and physical fitness. Conservatives beat the drum of Biden’s alleged senility for years but were often lambasted by the mainstream media for questioning the White House’s line on the matter. \"I fear the American people were deliberately misled about President Biden’s health. Instead of providing full transparency, which is the obligation of the commander-in-chief, important information was kept secret,\" Cornyn wrote. \"I do not have confidence in the former president’s aides and staff, including medical staff, or their ability to be honest and straightforward about President Biden’s cancer diagnosis.\" ARIZONA KAMALA HARRIS RALLY SPEAKERS COURT ‘JOHN MCCAIN REPUBLICANS’ He noted how President Donald Trump assented to calls that he take a cognitive test to demonstrate fitness for office while contrasting that with Biden's refusal, which famously resulted in a tense exchange with a CBS News correspondent when the then-president asked, \"Why the hell should I take a test?\" and asked if the Black news anchor was \"a junkie\" who might want to undergo a test for cocaine in his system. Cornyn contrasted White House claims that Biden was \"fit for duty\" with revelations, including those in a CNN anchor’s new book, that he was only capable of working \"four to six good hours\" per day. \"These positions are in direct conflict,\" Cornyn will tell Bondi, adding that despite having the world’s best medical care at his fingertips, Americans have been asked to \"accept coincidence after coincidence\" involving his health. He also cited the 25th Amendment, which he noted provides Americans an insurance policy that their government can continue to function if the infirmity or death of a president should occur. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These actions potentially impacted the trust the American people have in their government and weakened us on the world stage.\" He cited a report from earlier this week that White House staff had secretly discussed the possibility that Biden would be confined to a wheelchair while still putting on a brave face to the public. Former President Franklin Roosevelt, stricken by polio, conducted the nation’s business from a wheelchair. \"I encourage the Department to conduct a full investigation and ensure that no federal laws were violated during the previous administration,\" Cornyn concluded. Fox News Digital reached out to a Biden representative for comment.","summary":"Allegations of cover-ups regarding Biden&apos;s health prompt Sen.

This could have political ramifications for Harris, who has been floated as a potential California gubernatorial or 2028 presidential candidate.What to KnowConcerns about whether administration officials engaged in a cover-up of Biden's health have already become a question in California's gubernatorial race. Harris has not said whether she plans to run, but Becerra has already announced his campaign.Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles who is also running, is demanding answers from the two Democrats about what they knew about Biden's health while serving in his administration.\"At the highest levels of our government, those in power were intentionally complicit or told outright lies in a systematic cover-up to keep Joe Biden's mental decline from the public,\" he said in a statement reported by The Los Angeles Times.

Voters deserve to know the truth, what did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn't either of them speak out?\"Villaraigosa wrote in a post to X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that the alleged cover-up \"directly led to a second Donald Trump term—and as a result, all Californians are paying the price.\"The book detailed incidents where Biden allegedly failed to recognize longtime friends including George Clooney and required increasingly restrictive scheduling to manage his energy. These allegations, as well as Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, have renewed conversations about his health this year.The allegations raised in the book threaten to create a political headache for Democrats ahead of the 2028 race, as many prominent Democrats stood by Biden and dismissed questions about his health.What People Are SayingBecerra responded to Villaraigosa in a statement to The Los Angeles Times: \"It's clear the President was getting older, but he made the mission clear: run the largest health agency in the world, expand care to millions more Americans than ever before, negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs, and pull us out of a worldwide pandemic.

Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nIf you were to ask an acquaintance if you looked cute, you’d probably get an answer in the realm of yes, no or “What?” But earlier this month, if you asked xAI’s Grok chatbot, it would have told you that the claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly debated, but assure you it’s real.\n\nForbes’ Emily Baker-White writes that someone at xAI must have edited the chatbot’s system prompt—the basic instructions added to queries to help shape the bot’s response. Because for a short while, the answer to every question—ranging from sports statistics to information about Pope Leo XIV—was about white genocide in South Africa. And while xAI didn’t respond to Baker-White’s request for comment, it’s not surprising that this viewpoint on the topic of white South African genocide likely mirrors that of xAI owner Elon Musk, who is himself a white South African. After all, since Musk bought the social network formerly known as Twitter, he remade much of it in his own image, amplifying political posts both from himself and other fringe voices.\n\nOne day later, xAI posted an explanation of Grok’s obsession with white South African genocide—an “unauthorized modification” that violated xAI’s “internal policies and values.” The company said it is strengthening its code review process for prompt changes, putting a 24/7 monitoring team to deal with incidents with answers, and publishing Grok system prompts openly on GitHub. These steps may or may not be fixing the root problem. Rolling Stone reported that days after its white genocide obsession, Grok’s chatbot said it was skeptical about the number of people murdered during the Holocaust.\n\nOr maybe Grok’s willingness to spout controversial fringe theories is a reminder to everyone about what AI is, and what it is not. AI systems only know what data tells them. Even as an AI system “remembers” things about specific users, it’s just recalling the connections between data points. AI doesn’t “know” facts about historical events, like the Holocaust, unless it has the data. It also can be directed to respond to queries in a certain way.\n\nWhile the issues of discrimination against white people in South Africa and Holocaust denial are extremely sensitive, they’re probably two of the best examples to show how chatbots can be biased. They’re both issues that raise instant red flags that a chatbot’s answers are biased—a reminder that artificial intelligence is indeed artificial.\n\nImplementing AI at your company, both to streamline processes and interact with customers, can present real strategy challenges from the beginning. I talked to Ravi Pal, global chief technology officer of Ogilvy One and affiliated martech agency Verticurl, about how to overcome those. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.\n\nAds on streaming services are becoming the new normal. And even though many premium services now offer more expensive plans to bypass them, Antenna’s new “State of Subscriptions” report found that nearly half of all subscriptions to those services—46%—are ad-supported. This adds up to about 100 million ad plan subscriptions, not including Amazon Prime Video. Ad-supported plans are where 71% of streaming services’ growth has been over the last nine quarters, and though ad-supported plans have a slightly higher churn rate—4.96% in March, versus 4.13% for ad-free plans—streaming service ads seem like a worthwhile investment. About three quarters of all streaming customers have tried at least one ad-supported plan in the last four years, and only 14% choose only subscriptions with no ads.\n\nSegmentation and preferences dealing with online ads are largely consistent across key demographics of age, household income, ethnicity and gender. Loyalty is also the same: 43% of subscribers on ad-free plans and 42% of those using ad-supported ones were still subscribers nine months later.\n\nBRANDS + MESSAGING\n\nPhoto Illustration by Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nHBO is back. The streaming service that pulls from content from the storied premium cable network will be changing its name from Max to HBO Max, owner Warner Bros. Discovery announced last week at its Upfront presentation. Forbes contributor Roger Dooley writes this is the fifth name change for the streaming network, which was known as HBO Go in 2008, then HBO Now in 2015, then HBO Max in 2020, and Max in 2023. The last change came because Warner Bros. Discovery didn’t want their streaming offering to automatically be associated with the edgy, adult content HBO has been known for since the 1970s, and instead wanted to be seen as a “something for everyone” service. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes that HBO CEO Casey Bloys said the network did deep research to find out what consumers wanted: HBO programming, scripted dramas, licensed movies and the Warner Bros. TV library—but not children’s programming and animation.\n\nWith the new/old name, HBO Max is returning to the brand that made it so well known—and the name recognition that goes with it. The frequent name changes made the company meme fodder, writes Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido. But at the very least, HBO Max is also joining in. The official Max account on X got into the meme game, and Bloys remarked that he has a drawer full of stationary with the “new” service’s name on it from the last time around.\n\nNOW TRENDING\n\nRendering of the Uno Social Club at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.\n\nExperience has become a key facet of marketing today, and Mattel is leaning into loyal adult customers for its latest launch: Uno Social Clubs, writes Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon. These lounges cater to adult players of the popular card game, elevating a night of cards around a table at home to experiences at hotspots around the country—including bars and well-known venues—with themed adult beverages, tournament-style play and photo-worthy moments. The first Uno Social Club will be in Las Vegas, at the Palms Casino Resort. Tables in this club will be stocked with new versions of the classic game, and attendants will shuffle the thick decks in style.\n\nOn Mattel’s most recent earnings call, CEO Ynon Kreiz said the company’s overarching strategy is to “leverage the strength of our brands to create additional value outside of what we used to do as a company primarily just in the toy business.”\n\nMattel is working on other experiences for the families-with-kids demographic. It’s building two Mattel Adventure Park locations, which will feature rides and experiences based on Hot Wheels, Barbie, Thomas & Friends and He-Man brands, as well as many of the company’s popular games. The parks, in Glendale, Arizona and Bonner Springs, Kansas, are slated to open later this year and in 2026.\n\nWhen Working AI Into Your Brand, Don’t Forget The ‘Why’\n\nOgilvy One Chief Technology Officer Ravi Pal.\nOgilvy One, Getty\n\nSome of the toughest challenges facing anyone bringing AI into their enterprise focus on the basics: Why are you doing it? How can you find insights that are useful to everyone? How can AI be helpful to customers, but not creepy? Ravi Pal, global chief technology officer of Ogilvy’s digital CX and relationship service offerings arm Ogilvy One and affiliated martech agency Verticurl, talked to me about how to find solutions. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nHow can AI be used to build on brand trust and integrity, and where is the line?\n\nPal: Without creating a foundation of trust or transparency about how you’re processing your customers’ data to create some personalized experiences, you’re unlikely to win the trust of your customers.\n\nI see a world where you will have a lot of digital agents creat[ing] autonomous decisions on your behalf. You would want to know how they’re making the decisions. [For example, customer service for a] telco provider for broadband or for my mobile phone. If you go and interact with them, you will see a bot. Let’s say against my complaint, the bot says, ‘Ravi, we’re sorry. Here is a 15% voucher.’\n\nAs a business, you want to know why did the bot give Ravi a 15% voucher? That’s also part of the trust: You want to make sure you can understand how this technology makes a decision for both sides. A customer is happy that they got a thing at a discount, but as a business, you want to make sure that you understand why the discount was given.\n\nOn the other side, the customer would say, ‘You are showing me something highly personalized.’ Let’s say I called your customer service and talked about something yesterday, and today I land on your website. You’re showing me very specific content, which is absolutely tailored to what I want, my favorite color, the tone of the voice, et cetera. It’s creepy. You may want to also look at how customers are going to perceive the use of it. Are you telling them how you are using their data to then personalize this for them?\n\nBoth sides of the trust are important from a brand standpoint. A brand has a unique voice. In a sense, there’s a purpose with which you want to reach out to your customer. So that relationship you create is on a foundation of the brand archetype. When we use AI, or any automated process that starts to create content or change interactions at scale, we want to make sure that it is still speaking the voice of the brand, and it is still being led from that brand archetype. It’s not creating or cultivating its own.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges to getting together an AI strategy to work both internally with the company and externally with the customers?\n\nI think the challenges are not very different. Whenever we’ve had new technology start to reshape our businesses, our customers’ behavior, we’ve had in the past a similar sort of conversation. The nuance this time is that this technology is not replacing one stack, but it’s across all stacks: customer interaction, business processes, data, infrastructure. When we’re thinking about the strategy, we need to think holistically, and you need to think about it as future-proofing your organization. Are your people relevant? Are your processes relevant? Is your governance relevant, your data and infrastructure ready to be used? Do you know what the goal is?\n\nYou don’t want to do is get caught into the pipe that AI is going to solve everything. You don’t want to be sitting on the fence and fear that I don’t know what this is going to do to me. You want to have a specific goal, and then work everything around that goal so that we can measure the ROI. You can figure out if the cost that you’re going to have against implementing something like this is worth all the effort that you’re going to make. You have to have humans in the loop, but you also have to think about what kind of new roles and processes are going to be useful for my teams.\n\nThe other challenge is always going to be data. It’s been the challenge for digital for years. It is going to remain the challenge. You still need to figure out how are you going to take advantage of your data. But with this one additional thing: Now you can bring in everything. You can have image, video, audio, the typical data rows and columns, put it together into one and still take advantage of AI.\n\nThe underlying bit, which will be a challenge for a lot of organizations, is that so far we’ve been able to work with our organizational silos. With AI, you will have to find a way to cross-cut those silos and find the synergies—otherwise, you’re not taking full advantage. You're basically working point solutions, which will give you some benefit, but not a quantum leap in comparison to your competition.\n\nWhat kind of advice would you give to brands, marketers and agencies trying to come up with the right strategy?\n\nIt depends on where they are in their journey. One thing that I can clearly call out: You may want to start with the assessment first. Whether it is aligned to your business goals, whether it should be part of your business strategy, whether all your departments should be behind one common goal. How do you create the synergies between departments or incentives between departments? Don’t spend months, but just look at it from the simple pillars of people, process, data, governance, infrastructure, and then come up with your roadmap, which is aligned to a common business goal.\n\nFocus on ROI. Always look at it as: Why am I using this? If customer experience is where you want to double down, then focus on that. Growth is where you want to double down, focus on that. Make sure that you are doing it for a purpose and not just for getting caught in the hype. It’s like any other technology: customer first, technology second.\n\nCOMINGS + GOINGS\n\nMarketing and communications firm Stagwell appointed Connie Chan as its chief growth officer for Asia Pacific, effective July 2025.

Certainly, he feels that way. You can point to any number of accomplishments he has, he had, having to do with NATO or the infrastructure bill or the CHIPS Act and on and on. And that will be for history to decide. \n\nObviously, the American people thought that the country was on the wrong track and took issue with the border and inflation and his age and acuity. \n\nBut this book is more focused on what happened. You know, we all saw the debate June 27th. We were all shocked. We were all stunned at his inability to communicate his thoughts and the record that you speak of to the American people. And Alex and I set out to figure out what happened. \n\nMIKA: Right. \n\nTAPPER: The bottom line is, the reason that Biden, his wife, his son, Donilon and Ricchetti and others convinced themselves that what they were doing was in the best interest of the country was, one, they thought only Joe Biden could defeat Donald Trump. They were convinced of that. Two, they thought that Donald Trump posed an existential threat to the republic. And if you think that those are the stakes, you can justify almost anything. \n\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: Well, they also thought, three, as you all point out, that Kamala Harris couldn't beat Donald Trump, right? \n\nTAPPER: That's true. How much of that was driving it? \n\nALEX THOMPSON: I mean, how much of it was them looking for a reason, versus what was the reality? \n\nMIKA: One of the contentions you make is that sort of the media didn't do its part or did, like, way too late.\n\nAnd what's not in the book is the day after the debate, Joe, very painfully, immediately says Biden should step out of the race. It was really a big change for the direction of the show. \n\nI personally went on a very long plea for him to stay in the race, and I still stand by it. Nobody agrees with me. \n\nSCARBOROUGH: I've told you about going in and talking to him for two and a half, three hours inside the White House. Uh, far beyond cogent. I mean, really, really, uh, has a better, has a grasp of international, uh, politics. Yeah. In a way that only somebody's been doing it since he was 29 years old. \n\nTAPPER: Sure. \n\nSCARBOROUGH: We get phone calls at home where the guy is, like, pounding me because of op-eds that I wrote, et cetera, et cetera. \n\nSo I said that that this was Biden at his, at his best. \n\nTAPPER: Sure. \n\nSCARBOROUGH: That's what I saw. \n\nTAPPER: I don't doubt it.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: That's what other people saw. I was obviously wrong. \n\nTAPPER: And one of the other things that's really important, and this does continue to get to the tragedy of this all, is top aides told us that the two moments in which he really seemed to lose the most in terms of this non-functioning Biden, his acuity just draining out of his body, was the summer of 2023 when Hunter Biden's plea deal fell apart, and then June before the debate, 2024, when Hunter Biden was convicted of a crime and there was very real chance of him going to prison. \n\nAnd the reason is not just how sad it was for the family, but because at this point, President Biden has lost two children, Beau, and then his daughter in that horrible 1972 accident. And Hunter Biden was saying things along the lines of, they're trying to make me relapse. They, meaning the Republicans, they're trying to make me relapse. They're trying to make me kill myself. They're trying to, you know.\n\nAnd President Biden had a very real and legitimate fear that he was going to lose a third child.

A new, in-depth examination of 2024 voter data — the most detailed autopsy yet of the November election result — eviscerates that notion once and for all.\n\n Every four years since 2016, the progressive data firm Catalist has done the painstaking work of compiling the voting history and census data for every precinct in America to understand who voted for whom, who stayed home, and how those voting patterns have changed over time. \n\n The “What Happened in 2024” report confirms that 30 million voters who showed up to the polls in 2020 failed to materialize in 2024. That is a big number, and it represents the largest number of drop-off voters dating back to 2012, when 27 million voters failed to return to the polls. The difference is that in 2012 — and every election since, up until 2024 — those “dropoff voters,” who overwhelmingly skewed Democratic, were replaced by new voters, who also overwhelmingly skewed Democratic.\n\n In 2016, the 24 million dropoff voters (57 percent of which voted for the Democrat) were replaced by 33 million new voters (55.3 percent of which were Democratic). In 2020, 21 million dropoff voters (54.9 percent Democratic), were replaced by 40 million new voters (a group that was 55.3 percent Democratic).\n\n In 2024, for the first time since Catalist began their post-election analyses, not only were there fewer new voters (26 million) than dropoff voters (30 million) — fatally, also for the first time, those new voters were not mostly Democrats. Just 48.5 percent of new voters in 2024 supported Kamala Harris. Trump, it turns out, did have room to grow. \n\n Catalist’s “What Happened in 2024 report” is a sobering document for Democrats: Not only does it demonstrate Trump’s ability to persuade new voters, it shows that Harris lost ground among almost every single demographic group compared to Joe Biden’s performance in 2020, including groups that have, historically, been very loyal to Democrats.\n\n The Democrats’ largest losses in 2024 were among Latino men (whose support declined 12 points from 2020), Black men (whose support dropped seven points), and young voters. Support for Democrats among voters ages 18 to 29 dropped a whopping six points overall between 2020 and 2024 — even as young voters grew as a share of the electorate.\n\n The report shows that only group among whom Harris overperformed Joe Biden was white, married women — an improvement of a single percentage point. Meanwhile, declining support for Democrats among Latina women (a seven point drop), and AAPI women (a four point drop) meant that the second female nominee for president lost support among women overall (a one point drop) compared to her predecessor. \n\n One of the few bright spots for Democrats in the report is the fact that Harris did better among the most engaged voters — voters who showed up in all of the last four presidential elections — than then either of the last two Democratic candidates. At the same time those voters, called “super voters” in Catalist’s report, made up a larger share of the electorate than they have since 2016. \n\n Unfortunately for Democrats, Trump outperformed Harris with both new and sporadic voters, i.e. those who voted in one, two or three of the last four elections. \n\n The Catalist report appears in the midst of a heated intra-party debate over what exactly happened in 2024. The report with its thousands of different data points will be used to justify different arguments and agendas. At the end of day, progressive campaign strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio says, “The major takeaway is that the source of the loss was both/and: both fewer people turning out on the Democratic side, and vote-switching.”","summary":"The most detailed look yet at Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump yet paints a sobering picture for Democrats","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-kamala-harris-lost-2024-catalist-1235344875/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kamala-harris-dems-lost-deep-dive.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-21 16:39:36","author":"Tessa Stuart,Tessa Suart","authors":["Tessa Stuart","Tessa Suart"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":323428698,"title":"Trump’s big bill is terrible in all the normal Republican ways","text":"Politics, you will notice, has gotten extremely weird.\nTo some degree, of course, this is Donald Trump’s fault. No other president has seen the first part of their term defined by a fight over whether the federal government can send people living in the US to a prison in El Salvador with no due process. No other modern president has decided to ignore decades of settled economic and political wisdom and institute the biggest tariffs since the Hoover administration. No other president has waged war against the entire foundation of American science. \nSome weirdness is also the fault of Covid. The pandemic introduced a slew of policies that proved divisive, from mask mandates to vaccine mandates to funding for “gain of function” research to school closures. None of these were polarizing topics in 2019 because they either had never happened before or were too obscure for most people to care. And though we’re a few years past the worst days of the pandemic, the appointment of anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary shows just how central many of these topics remain.\nIt’s this context that has made Congress’s debate over a multitrillion-dollar reconciliation bill so fascinating. The bill’s contents are still evolving, but the broad outlines are simple: trillions in tax cuts, tilted to the wealthy; hundreds of billions in spending cuts, particularly to programs for the poor like Medicaid and food stamps; over a hundred billion dollars in increased spending for defense.\nI know of no better summary of its effects than the above chart from the Urban Institute, which shows that it would make poor Americans earning less than $10,000 dramatically worse off (reducing their income by 14.9 percent) while affluent households earning over $200,000 would thrive.\nSo, all in all, a terrible bill. But whatever else that proposal is, it’s startlingly normal for Republican politics. It represents ideas that have defined the Republican party and its economic and budgetary priorities since 1980, and which the party has strongly held to even in the face of Trump’s total takeover. The Republican party stands for lower taxes, especially on the rich; lower spending on programs for the poor; and big spending on defense. That’s what Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, and other figures who defined the party have all stood for, for nearly half a century now.\nThe extreme weirdness of national politics has led to a temptation to see a new Republican party just over the horizon, defined by rejecting its tax-cutting and program-slashing tradition. This is stoked by strategic leaks that Trump might be open to a higher tax rate on the richest Americans; by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) condemning Medicaid cuts; by party figures like Vice President JD Vance suggesting a break from the party’s hawkish foreign policy.\nBut the composition of the reconciliation bill suggests that when it comes to bread-and-butter economic issues, this is mostly a mirage. The essential Republican message may become blurred around the edges, the way that George W. Bush messed with it by expanding Medicare or his father did by accepting a small tax hike. But the deviations are swamped by the continuity. It’s not, in the ludicrous phrasing of Steve Bannon, a “workers’ party.”\nCongressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have brought back normal politics, and for them that means one thing: redistributing income upward.\nThe rise and persistence of Normal Republicanism\nThis essential pattern of Republicans standing for across-the-board tax cuts and cuts to safety net programs has not always been the norm. Nothing in politics is truly permanent. As late as Richard Nixon, Republican presidents would propose ideas like a guaranteed minimum income and universal health coverage while actually raising taxes on the rich.\nThe ground shifted in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a small group of policy entrepreneurs in Washington centered around Congress member Jack Kemp (R-NY) began promoting across-the-board cuts to individual income tax rates as a solution to stagflation (the combination of slow growth and high inflation then characterizing the economy). In her history of this moment, Starving the Beast, sociologist Monica Prasad notes that major business lobbies at the time opposed this move. Their priority was corporate rate cuts and a balanced budget, and they saw individual cuts as a threat to both.\nKemp and his allies, including soon-to-be-President Reagan, overcame corporate skepticism for one simple reason: The cuts were popular, and the public mood was becoming strongly anti-tax. At this point in time, the thresholds for tax rates were not indexed for inflation, which meant that more and more middle-class people were being pushed into higher and higher tax brackets every year without actually becoming richer as inflation worsened. These pressures had forced even Democrat Jimmy Carter to sign tax cuts in 1978, and they only built as inflation rose still further.\n\nTimeline of major Republican tax bills\nTax Reform Act of 1969 — signed by Richard Nixon, cracked down on foundations, extended a temporary across-the-board income tax hike to fund the war in Vietnam, and created the Alternative Minimum Tax, meant to target high-earners claiming many deductions and credits. On net, substantially raised taxes on the rich while cutting them for the poor.\nEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 — signed by Ronald Reagan, across-the-board cut in tax rates for individuals, with top rate falling from 70 percent to 50 percent. Tax thresholds now indexed for inflation. Businesses allowed to deduct expenses at an accelerated pace.\nTax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 — also signed by Reagan, undid most of the 1981 cuts to corporate taxes, but crucially kept the cuts on individuals in place.\nTax Reform Act of 1986 — bipartisan legislation signed by Reagan that eliminated many deductions and credits and simplified the individual income tax to only two brackets (15 percent and 28 percent).\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 — signed by George H.W. Bush, added a 31 percent bracket on the rich to raise revenue on top of the 1986 law. Bill Clinton would add 36 percent and 39.6 percent rates in 1993.\nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 — signed by Bill Clinton but championed by Republicans in Congress, created a $500 child tax credit and cut the capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent.\nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 — signed by George W. Bush, slashed individual rates across the board, with the top rate falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and gradually eliminated the estate tax. Initially set to expire in 2010. Extended temporarily by Barack Obama in 2010 as part of an economic stimulus deal, and then in 2012 permanently, but only for couples earning under $450,000.\nJobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 — signed by George W. Bush, cut taxes on dividend and interest income, and limited the Alternative Minimum Tax’s effects. Set to expire in 2010, like the 2001 cuts; largely expired under the 2012 Obama deal.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — signed by Donald Trump, cut individual rates with the top rate falling from 39.6 percent to 37 percent; doubled the standard deduction and consolidated personal and dependent exemptions into a larger child tax credit; dramatically cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. While some cuts, like the corporate rate cut, were permanent, most of the bill is set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nAt the same time, Reagan and his team in the early 1980s were convinced that the US needed a major military buildout to counteract what they claimed had been a Soviet buildout in the 1970s. That led to a big increase in defense spending, from 6.6 percent of GDP in 1981 to 7.6 percent in 1985; at today’s size of the US economy, an equivalent increase would be about $290 billion more per year.\nTo pay for at least some of this, Reagan’s first reconciliation bill included sweeping cuts to safety net programs, notably including Medicaid, food stamps, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). This, too, fit well with Reagan’s image. He had campaigned hard against establishing Medicare in the 1960s, and denunciations of “welfare queens” had been a prominent theme in his ultimately failed 1976 campaign for the presidency. This wasn’t the most popular part of the Reagan brand (he denounced “welfare queens” while trying to win the Republican primary, not the general), but it reflected both his genuine beliefs and the twin pressures of the tax cuts and defense buildout on the budget.\nThis combination of policies was a profound break from the Nixon/Gerald Ford years, when tax cuts were not seriously considered, the priority with the Soviets was detente and arms control, and safety net programs were largely protected. And, sure enough, some Republicans continued to push back against the new regime. Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS) successfully fought to limit food stamps cuts; Congressional Republicans worked with Democrats to expand Medicaid throughout the 1980s over Reagan’s objections; most infamously, George H.W. Bush signed a bill adding a new 31 percent tax bracket for rich Americans in 1990, violating his pledge not to raise taxes.\nBut for the most part, the pattern established by Reagan has persisted ever since, and deviations — like Bush’s tax hike, which contributed to his loss in 1992 — are remembered more as cautionary tales than examples to emulate.\nLook at the Contract With America, the Republicans’ platform during their successful 1994 bid to retake the House for the first time in over 40 years. It included tax cuts (like introducing a child tax credit and lower capital gains rates) and cuts to welfare and other safety net programs. While Bill Clinton was able to tamp down these demands somewhat, all became law in one form or another.\nA few years later, George W. Bush began his first term with sweeping across-the-board tax cuts, and his second with a failed effort to slash Social Security spending in favor of individual accounts. In the Obama years, Congressional Republicans, led by Paul Ryan, coalesced around plans for yet more across-the-board tax cuts and sweeping cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety net programs. Under Trump, Ryan was able to pass the former, though his attempts at the latter through Obamacare repeal failed.\nOccasionally, a Republican politician will gesture at trying to break with this orthodoxy, and is invariably greeted with intrigued attention from the press. With George W. Bush in 2000, it was called “compassionate conservatism.” With Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty in 2005, it was “Sam’s Club Republicanism.” With then-Sen. Marco Rubio and his allies in the press circa 2014, it was “reform conservatism.” \nThese days the preferred term for Sen. Josh Hawley and Vice President JD Vance seems to be “national conservative,” which, like the Sam’s Club and Reformocons before, purports to reject the tax-cutting orthodoxy of past Republicans in favor of a more communitarian vision — very little of which, of course, appears to have made its way into the budget bill. All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.\nA very Normal Republican budget\nBut through each of these much-hyped fads, Normal Republicanism on the budget has survived more or less unchanged. The legacy of compassionate conservatism is a prescription drug benefit in Medicare administered by private insurers; the legacy of reform conservatism is mostly increasing the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 in 2017. These are slight ripples in a pattern that has been remarkably persistent.\nThe 2025 reconciliation package is a perfect illustration of these dynamics. Per a helpful tally by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the centerpiece of the legislation is the extension and expansion of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The cuts here will cost over $4.1 trillion over a decade. Remarkably, some of the cuts aren’t even made permanent, but temporarily extended again, to artificially make the cost look lower than it is; if they’re extended still further, the total cost of the TCJA extensions would be more like $4.8 trillion.\n[Image: Deficits would surge dramatically due to the reconciliation bill. https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Gq7Ur81WMAA91gV.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all]\nThese are tax cuts overwhelmingly tilted at the top. $1.4 trillion goes to repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, which exists to prevent high-earners from taking excessive deductions; $2.2 trillion goes to cutting rates, including the top rate, which disproportionately helps the rich. The pass-through deduction, which arbitrarily lets some business owners exclude 20 percent of their profit from taxation, is extended and also expanded to 23 percent for no apparent reason, for a mere $820 billion. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that extending the TCJA increases incomes for the top 1 percent by an average of 3.7 percent, which swamps the 0.6 percent increase that the poorest fifth of Americans would get.\nOn top of this, the House Ways and Means committee has thrown a potpourri of assorted other tax cuts: through 2028, for instance, tips, overtime income, and car loan interests would be tax-free, and senior citizens would get bigger standard deductions. The spending spree isn’t limited to taxes, either. There’s $144 billion from the Armed Services Committee, focused on shipbuilding ($32 billion) and “air superiority and missile defense” ($30 billion), and $67 billion for border security, including about $50 billion for Trump’s long-promised wall.\nThe gross cost of all these giveaways hits around $5 trillion, before even considering the possibility that giveaways like the tips and overtime tax cuts are made permanent. But the net cost of the package, and impact on the defiict is “only” about $3.3 trillion, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \nWhat makes up the difference? $698 billion comes from cuts to Medicaid; including other cuts to Affordable Care Act subsidies, the bill will deprive about 10 million people of health insurance. $559 billion comes from undoing most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. $350 billion comes from cuts to education, heavily focused on student loan programs and subsidies meant to make them more affordable for borrowers. $267 billion comes from food stamps, slashing the program by about 30 percent overall.\nThere’s a lot to say about this set of priorities. The Medicaid and food stamp cuts target the most vulnerable Americans and, combined with the tax cuts for the wealthy, amount to extreme upward redistribution. The Inflation Reduction Act cuts will likely substantially increase energy prices for most Americans, while substantially increasing emissions. I know of no serious economist who thinks that many of the most expensive provisions in the bill, like deductibility of overtime income or the pass-through business deduction, are effective ways to boost economic growth.\nBut, at a moment where so many assumptions about politics have been overturned, the plan is not surprising. This is not a radically different Republican party newly attuned to the interests of the working class. It’s not a party whose tax-cutting passions have been tempered now that their president is imposing new taxes left and right on foreign imports in the form of tariffs (and which will be borne disproportionately by lower-income Americans). It’s not a party reflecting the fact that Medicaid recipients narrowly voted for Trump over Kamala Harris in 2024.\nIt’s just the normal Reagan-Gingrich-Bush-Ryan Republican party, same as it’s ever been.\nWhy, then, are people so eager to hear that the Republican party has changed? Part of it might be the simple fact that voters have had trouble accepting that a political party could actually be like this. \nWhen Priorities USA, a Democratic super-PAC in the 2012 election, told a focus group that Mitt Romney wanted to slash Medicare while cutting taxes on the rich, “the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing,” per reporter Robert Draper. \nIt does sound vaguely ridiculous: It defies common sense that cutting taxes on the wealthy and funding it with spending cuts on programs for poor and working people would ever be a compelling political message, perhaps outside the extreme inflationary environment of the 1970s that birthed Reagan’s presidency.\nBut ridiculous or not, that’s the world we have. The Republican Party’s budgetary views simply have not changed. They want to blow up the deficit with massive tax cuts tilted toward the rich and pay for a fraction of the cost by slashing programs for the poor. It’s really that simple. It may not be exciting or brand new. But it’s normal Republican policymaking, and it’s back with a vengeance.","summary":"Politics, you will notice, has gotten extremely weird.

The president claims that CBS News engaged in election interference by deceitfully editing the interview to make Harris look better.\n\nWhile the network has called Trump’s allegations “completely without merit,” legal experts have said the lawsuit is baseless and Paramount’s legal team has pushed for the case to be tossed out of court, Paramount's chief shareholder Shari Redstone has urged the company to settle with the president. \n\nWith Paramount in the final stages of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, the deal needs the FCC’s approval to go through due to the CBS broadcast licenses. Brendan Carr, the Trump loyalist who chairs the FCC, has made it clear that the Trump lawsuit will be a deciding factor in “the context of the FCC review” of the merger.\n\nFollowing the resignations of McMahon and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, who both said they would not apologize for the Harris interview as part of any settlement, a group of Democratic senators sent Redstone a letter this week warning her that Paramount may be guilty of bribery if it settles with Trump.\n\n“Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act,” the letter stated. “If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.”\n\nDuring his opening monologue on Tuesday night, Colbert referenced the lawmakers’ probe while trolling the executives at Paramount over the amount they are reportedly looking to pay Trump.\n\n“At first, CBS said they’d fight this frivolous lawsuit,” he noted. “But here’s the rub: Paramount is in the process of being sold, right now, and they need the Trump administration’s FCC to approve transferring the CBS broadcast license to the new owners, which, for vague reasons, they just haven’t done yet.”\n\nHe then brought up CNN anchor Jake Tapper’s recent report that Paramount “could settle with President Trump for as much as $30-50 million,” prompting Colbert to reach off stage and grab a cup of water.\n\n“30 to 50 million dollars,” he exclaimed after dramatically spitting water all over the place. “Holy bazingas!”\n\nThe comic went on to say that because it was “so shady” to just hand over a pile of cash to the president in order to get a broadcast license approved, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent an inquiry to Redstone about the legality of the move. \n\nLaunching fully into faux outrage mode, Colbert mockingly defended his Paramount bosses – before letting them know it would come at a price.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, I am a proud company man. I love who I work for, and I will stand up against these scurrilous accusations that Paramount is engaged in corporate and political malfeasance,” he proclaimed before turning to the camera and adding: “For the low price of $50 million.”\n\nAt the same time, though, he let the president know that his loyalty was for sale if he could top Paramount’s bid.\n\n“I’m joking, obviously. Satire, etc. I would never take a bribe from CBS,” he declared before again turning to the camera to exclaim: “If Donald Trump outbids them! Because, Mr. President, I am willing to testify on your side in this lawsuit for 50 million and one dollars.”","summary":"Late Show host also mockingly said that Paramount and Donald Trump could bid for his loyalty, with the price starting at $50 million","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-colbert-cbs-lawsuit-trump-b2755418.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/21/15/51/Screenshot-Capture-2025-05-21-09-35-33.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gbu00wi8-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-21 16:03:43","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":323412514,"title":"Voters may want more US factories—but they don't want to work in them","text":"President Donald Trump and his dim-witted commerce secretary have said that the goal of the absurd tariffs he's placed on nearly every imported good was to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States so that Americans can toil away on assembly lines for the rest of their days.\n\nBut a new poll conducted by Civiqs for Daily Kos finds that while 46% of registered voters say that bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. is more important than keeping prices low, a large majority of voters (66%) don't want to work in factories themselves. \n\nEven more, just 6% of voters said they would leave their jobs to go work in a factory—a number that shows that even if companies built factories in the United States, they would have an incredibly difficult time finding the labor to staff them. \n\nManufacturing vastly more items in the U.S. would very likely raise the cost of consumer goods. Labor in the U.S. is more costly than in countries like China, which produces a significant portion of the electronics, clothing, shoes, and toys that we purchase.\n\nAs of March, there were almost 500,000 vacant manufacturing jobs in the United States, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And if Americans don’t want to work in factories, and if Trump and Republicans block immigrants from coming to the U.S. to fill those jobs, it would lead to the kind of tight labor market that spikes inflation—i.e., the opposite of what Americans seemingly elected Trump to do.\n\nUltimately, a majority of virtually every demographic polled, save for self-identified Republican voters, says they would not want to work in a factory. That includes 87% of Democrats and 61% of independents. \n\nAnd yet even a plurality of Republican voters (47%) say they would not want to work in a factory, with another 23% saying they are “unsure”—a sign they might not want to admit that they don’t want to work the factory jobs that Trump and his allies insist Americans to want to work.\n\n\"It's time to train people not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future. This is the new model, where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here. We let the auto plants go overseas,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC in April as he sought to defend Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAt the end of the day, 53% of voters disapprove of Trump’s tariffs—and 48% disapprove “strongly.” \n\nAnd the reasoning for that is pretty clear.\n\nA majority of voters (56%) think the tariffs have led to higher prices on items they’ve bought recently. A plurality (49%) say they do not think Trump's tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.—which is the stated goal of the policy. And another plurality of voters (36%) say it would be a bad result if the tariffs brought manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. but also led to higher prices for the items they purchase.\n\nThe new Civiqs/Daily Kos poll finds Trump’s approval rating underwater, with 52% of voters disapproving of the way he's handling his job—49% of whom disapprove strongly. And that's before Trump's tariffs have really had an impact on Americans.\n\nCompanies are only now starting to raise prices, as goods purchased with the higher tariff rate are now hitting shelves. For example, Walmart recently announced it will have to hike prices thanks to the tariff policy.\n\n“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” CEO Doug McMillon said last week.\n\nThat could hit Trump’s voters the hardest as well. States that Trump carried in the 2024 presidential election have far more Walmart stores than those that backed Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nThroughout last year’s campaign, Trump said he wanted to raise tariffs. But voters didn’t listen, or they didn’t know what the effects would be.

The mockery follows Springsteen’s sharp criticism of Trump during the opening night of his European tour in Manchester, England. From the stage, the veteran rocker denounced the current U.S. administration as “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous.” Trump fired back on social media, calling Springsteen a “dried out prune of a rocker,” mocking his appearance, and dismissing him as “highly overrated” and “a pushy, obnoxious JERK.” He went on to say, “This dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country.” The president also dragged Beyoncé into the fray, suggesting that both she and Springsteen should be investigated over whether their appearances supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election constituted illegal campaign donations. Springsteen didn’t back down. The following night, also in Manchester, he repeated his criticisms and urged audiences to “raise your voices against authoritarianism.” This is far from Springsteen’s first political clash with Trump—or Republican leaders in general. When President Ronald Reagan once praised his “message of hope,” Springsteen pushed back, questioning whether Reagan had actually listened to his lyrics. More recently, Springsteen called Trump “a con man from Queens” and accused large portions of the public of being “hypnotized” by him. Springsteen has long used his platform for political expression, from supporting Democratic candidates to releasing protest songs like American Skin (41 Shots) and The Ghost of Tom Joad, which spotlighted social injustice and immigration struggles. His political outspokenness has occasionally clashed with segments of his conservative fanbase. Music journalist Alan Light, author of the upcoming Don’t Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, noted that Springsteen’s defiance is unsurprising. “He’s never shied away from taking a stand. At a time when so many are silent, his voice still carries weight.” Canadian-American rocker Neil Young also came to Springsteen’s defense in a post titled “TRUMP!!!” on his website. He wrote, “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America… You worry about that instead of the dying kids in Gaza.” Young added: “Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce… You are worried more about yourself than AMERICA.” Despite the heated exchange, Springsteen and the E Street Band have not performed in the U.S. since before the 2024 election. His current European tour leans more into themes of aging and mortality than overt political commentary. Still, as Springsteen continues to tour and Trump continues to campaign, the clash between these two prominent figures of American culture shows no sign of cooling off.","summary":"Donald Trump and Bruce Springsteen are engaged in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration as corrupt during a concert in England.

But for days now, the president has been obsessing over Bruce Springsteen. \n\n On Wednesday — as Republicans in Congress slogged through an hours-long markup session on his signature budget legislation — the president woke up and posted a presumably fan-made edit of himself knocking over the “Born in the U.S.A.” singer with a golf ball. \n\n The video spliced together a clip of Trump hitting a drive at a LIV Golf event, with a clip of Springsteen tripping on stage at a 2023 concert in Amsterdam.

They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those who are struggling for their freedom.

The two sides have entered mediation in hopes of reaching a settlement, and Redstone is widely believed to be open to a deal ahead of a planned multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media that could be halted by Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Warren, Sanders and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., cautioned Redstone that a quid pro quo arrangement leading to a settlement could break the law in a letter sent on Monday. \"We write to express serious concern regarding the possibility that media company Paramount Global (Paramount) may be engaging in improper conduct involving the Trump Administration in exchange for approval of its megamerger with Skydance Media (Skydance).

Warren, Sanders and Wyden noted that FCC Chair Brendan Carr stated Trump’s CBS lawsuit was \"’likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of [the Paramount-Skydance] transaction,’\" and \"Paramount is reportedly in talks to settle the lawsuit.\" ‘60 MINUTES' PRODUCER'S ABRUPT EXIT FUELS DRAMA AT CBS NEWS AS NETWORK BATTLES TRUMP LAWSUIT The lawmakers cited veteran CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley, who recently told CBS viewers that \"Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways\" as the company is \"trying to complete a merger.\" The letter also referenced the recent resignations of CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who both criticized corporate overlords on their way out. \"Paramount’s scheme to curry favor with the Trump Administration has compromised journalistic independence and raises serious concerns of corruption and improper conduct,\" Warren, Sanders and Wyden wrote. \"Paramount’s apparent capitulation to President Trump is a sharp contrast from its earlier position that it would ‘vigorously defend against’ the lawsuit.\" Warren, Sanders and Wyden gave Redstone until June 2 to answer nine specific questions, including \"Does Paramount believe the lawsuit filed by then-candidate Trump against CBS has merit?\" CBS ANCHORS SALUTE OUTGOING '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER, SAY EFFORT TO SETTLE TRUMP LAWSUIT TIED TO CORPORATE MERGER They also want to know if Redstone or other board members have discussed a settlement, if the merger was discussed during these conversations, and if \"60 Minutes\" has been asked by Paramount officials to change content to facilitate merger approval.

They said they would \"not remain silent\" as two of their members were \"attacked.\" They wrote that Swift and Springsteen are \"role models\" and \"inspirations\" to millions.Some other musicians have also spoken out against Trump and the current administration. In February, Jack White played the final date of his North American 'No Name' tour in Boston, where he played a version of the song \"Corporation,\" which took aim at Trump and his close ally, Elon Musk.White sang, \"I'm thinking about not being elected. Never holding a public office. Never serving one day of military service, But somehow having the authority to control parts of the US Government; Who's with me?\" and \"I'm thinking about not being properly vetted by the Supreme Court or Congress, Just doing whatever the hell I want because some f****** bloated a****** orange f****** gorilla whose failed at every business he's ever ran wants me to be his golf cart partner.\"The band Green Day has also addressed Trump. During their headline set at Coachella, they changed the lyric in \"American Idiot\" to \"I'm not a part of a MAGA agenda,\" and did the same for their song \"Jesus of Suburbia\" where they sang, \"Am I r******* or am I just J.D.
