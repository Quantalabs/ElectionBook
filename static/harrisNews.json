Pennsylvania favorite Primanti Brothers is scrambling to avoid blowback after turning away vice presidential candidate Senator JD Vance when he tried to make a campaign stop Saturday. The Ohio senator initially stopped at the doors of the shop Saturday afternoon for a campaign event – but staff said they were not given advanced notice. A manager of the store initially turned the campaign away – despite dozens of people waiting inside for a chance to meet the candidate. After being turned away at the door, Vance addressed disappointed and outraged supporters in a video posted by an attendee to ‘X’. “[The manager] just freaked out a little bit because there were a lot of people and she didn’t want to make her restaurant part of a campaign stop,” Vance said in the parking lot outside the 90-year-old business. “We went in there, we paid for everybody’s food, we gave them a nice tip, and of course when I gave them a nice tip I said ‘no taxes on tip’,” Vance added. The junior senator Ohio also made clear that Primanti Brothers is still on his good side and attempted to shield the small business from any ire. “It’s alright, don’t hold it against her, she just got a little nervous. But it’s a great local business, keep on supporting it, and most importantly, on November 5th go vote. Let’s go win this thing.” Later, Primanti Brothers would allow Vance and his supporters to meet inside the restaurant and issued a statement in an attempt to avoid a conservative boycott. “Our doors are open to all patrons who wish to dine with us,” the statement reads. “Without any advance notice, today’s campaign stop caused some momentary confusion for our staff. However, Senator Vance and his team were welcomed into our restaurant shortly after and engaged with our guests inside and on the property.” This statement came after videos of angry Vance supporters made their way around the internet. Videos posted on ‘X’ show dozens of supporters flooding out of the Primanti after they are told Vance and his team would not be allowed to enter the premises. Vance’s welcome was a far cry from the Primanti Brothers reception to Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Gov. Tim Walz when the pair stopped by the business back in August. Their visit caused its own controversy. Patrons of Primanti Brothers claimed that they were forced to leave the premises before Harris and Walz would enter. Diners claimed that they were booted from their barstools so that the Harris-Walz campaign could bring in chosen people for a ‘staged’ photo-op full of supporters. Primanti Brothers did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.","summary":"A Pittsburgh sandwich shop is scrambling to avoid blowback after turning away vice presidential candidate Senator JD Vance.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/28/us-news/vance-briefly-barred-from-primanti-brothers-at-campaign-stop/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/vance-turned-away-primanti-brothers-90625658.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kIAVrCTA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-29 00:57:06","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.615},{"id":257785368,"title":"Something to celebrate?

The disgraced presenter, 60, secretly filmed a special three part series for Channel 5, which required him to give up his home comforts of soul-searching on a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, which he described as his 'story of survival'.It will be the first time Schofield has been on TV since leaving the ITV's This Morning in May 2023 after admitting to a relationship with a much younger male colleague and has since taken aim at those who betrayed him'. The broadcaster, who came out as gay in 2020, joined his wife and friends at the pub and even brought along his pet pooch just 48-hours ahead of the new show's first episode'. A source told MailOnline: 'Phillip was with his wife and a group of friends. He seemed in good spirits and looked like he was enjoying himself. Phillip Schofield, 62, enjoyed a night out with wife Stephanie Lowe and pals in West London on Saturday, as he was seen first time since the announcement of his controversial TV comeback The disgraced presenter secretly filmed a special three part series for Channel 5, which required him to give up his home comforts of soul-searching on a tropical island Phillip cheated on wife of over 20 years Stephanie Lowe with a much younger man (pictured together in 2021) 'It looked like they were attending an engagement party for a friend and he helped himself to some cake too.' Schofield wore a dark blazer of a pale pink shirt and teamed it with dark trousers for the outing where he posed for selfies with fans. The former ITV star later sharing a goodbye hug with a pal before hopping into a waiting taxi. It comes following reports that ITV bosses were furious at the star's claims he would have been treated differently if he had had an affair with a woman rather than a man. In Cast Away, Schofield says he would have got a 'pat on the back' it wasn't a homosexual relationship, before taking aim at the 'three s***s of showbiz' who betrayed him as he ranted about his downfall. In his much-criticised television comeback on Channel 5 programme Cast Away, he refers to himself as the 'shamed, disgraced Philip Schofield, who had an affair'. He aid: 'Strangely, I think another TV presenter or two might have done exactly the same thing. Difference is heterosexual. It's not an unusual thing in the gay world for there to be a difference in age groups.' 'That's not that unusual in the straight world, but if that had been the case with me and it had been a woman. Pat on the back. Well done, mate.' In his much-criticised television comeback on Channel 5 programme Cast Away, he refers to himself as the 'shamed, disgraced Philip Schofield, who had an affair' The broadcaster, who came out as gay in 2020, appeared in high spirits as he joined his wife and friends the pub, where also took along his pet pooch He wore a dark blazer of a pale pink shirt and teamed it with dark trousers for the outing where he posed for selfies with fans The former ITV star later left the pub, but not before sharing a goodbye hug with a pal, before hopping into a waiting taxi Schofield said that he 'has regrets' and acknowledges he 'got something wrong' and 'hurt the people' around him. 'I don't know what price you're supposed to pay and whether the price you're paying is necessarily proportionate,' he adds. Hitting back, a source at the channel said: 'It's a stupid thing for Phil to say, and it is just not true. Phil lied to his colleagues, his bosses and his friends about it, it wouldn't have mattered if it was a woman or a man.' They add that Schofield is unlikely to work with the channel again despite his hints that he had been approached to appear on their reality show, I'm A Celeb. One source said: 'He lied to us, it would be really, really difficult.' In the programme, which airs from Monday, Schofield takes aim at a trio of his former ITV colleagues, saying: 'I think there are only three s**ts.' Read More Phillip Schofield will 'never work for ITV again' despite I'm A Celebrity rumours He pointed out that one was a 'coward who never stepped up in queue gate,' while another 'is a coward because they never stepped up when I was being battered by that one journalist who thought I'd got them fired.' The third, Schofield says 'is just brand orientated. Not what you expect, not what you think you're going to get.' Continuing to take aim at those who he believes wrong him, Phillip added of his formerly long-standing TV career: 'They know how important that was to me. 'They know when you throw someone under a bus, you've got to have a really bloody good reason to do it. Brand, ambition is not good enough', reports The Sun. He went on: 'People can be fake. They can be so fake with you when it's all going well, and suddenly utter, utter betrayal. 'There are a lot of amazing people in morning television.' He also insisted that he has now quit television and doesn't want to make a return despite filming the three-part show for Channel 5 which sees him having to survive alone in Madagascar. While Phillip failed to disclose which ITV figures he was referring to, he did take the opportunity to take a brutal swipe at his ex-colleagues. Despite mentioning ITV Co-stars Ant, 48, and Dec, 49, as well as Joanna Lumley, 78, his former pal Holly Willoughby isn't mentioned at all throughout the 45-minute episode. In one outburst which will leave viewers wondering whether it is aimed at her, Schofield says: 'When you throw someone under a bus, you've got to have a really bloody good reason to do it. It comes following reports that ITV bosses were furious at the star's claims he would have been treated differently if he had had an affair with a woman rather than a man Meanwhile, Phillip also took aim at the 'three s***s of showbiz' who betrayed him as he ranted about his downfall [pictured with former co-star Holly Willoughby] Meanwhile during the programme, Phillip and his family appeared to mock Holly's famous 'are you ok?' clip as he made his return to TV [Holly pictured in June 2023] In a clip obtained by The Sun , he gives out food to his wife Stephanie and their daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, and laughs: 'If you're ok, then we're ok, and I'm ok...are you ok?' 'I got into telly because I love the nuts and bolts of telly, I never wanted to be famous. I'm not fussed about that. 'I miss parts of it. I miss most of it, I'm honest. But there are bits that I really, really, really don't miss. You learn a lot about people. I don't miss that.' ITV's fury comes as Schofield also hints that he was fired from the network when in fact the first its chiefs learned of his departure was in statement to the Mail where he admitted the affair and said he left with immediate effect. Sources at the broadcaster also say that he chose to step back from presenting This Morning a fortnight before following a fall out with his former co-star Holly Willoughby. Read More EXCLUSIVE Phillip Schofield admits he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt on Cast Away Meanwhile during the programme, Phillip and his family appeared to mock Holly's famous 'are you ok?' clip as he made his return to TV. Phillip was ousted from This Morning in May last year, after he admitted to lying about his relationship with a much younger male colleague. Holly distanced herself from her former best friend and during a 'highly strategised' return to the This Morning sofa in June 2023, she told viewers she had been left 'shaken, let down and worried.' When she returned, she began by saying: 'Hello, Firstly, are you okay? I hope so. It feels very strange sat here without Phil.' Appearing to reference the now-famous speech on Cast Away, Phillip is seen having a BBQ with his family before heading off to the island. In a clip obtained by The Sun, he gives out food to his wife Stephanie and their daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, and laughs: 'If you're ok, then we're ok, and I'm ok...are you ok?' No mention of Holly is made in the clip. The Channel 5 show also took a dark turn when Phillip told how he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt, but decided against it when his eldest daughter Molly persuaded him not to. The Channel 5 show also took a dark turn when Phillip told how he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt, but decided against it when his eldest daughter Molly persuaded him not to Phillip recalled how a conversation with his daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, stopped him from going ahead with it (pictured with wife Stephanie Lowe, Molly and Ruby in 2018) He added: ‘That was just enough, just enough to take a step back from the edge. I could have been hospitalised, I just raced to the family home and shut the gates and I was in there' Speaking on the first episode of the three-part series which airs on Monday, the former This Morning host said: 'In the last eighteen months, it got as dark as it is possible to get. 'A year ago I got so, so close. I had everything in place, everything was set up and everything was ready and it was Molly that was looking after me.' He explained: 'Molly and Ruby both looking after me at the time, and Molly said: 'Do you imagine what this would do to us if you actually managed to pull this off? Can you imagine what would happen and can you imagine what it would do to me if you did this on my watch?' 'That was just enough, just enough to take a step back from the edge. I could have been hospitalised, I just raced to the family home and shut the gates and I was in there.' He later pays tribute to his wife Stephanie Lowe, Molly, 31, and his youngest daughter Ruby, 28, saying: 'Without them, I wouldn't be here.' The disgraced presenter revealed this week he was taking part in his own survival show just 16 months on from leaving This Morning after admitting to having an 'unwise but not illegal' fling with a junior male colleague. Phillip Schofield Cast Away, which is a three-part series, can be streamed on Channel 5 at 9pm on September 30, October 7 and October 14. Share or comment on this article: Something to celebrate?

The disgraced presenter, 60, secretly filmed a special three part series for Channel 5, which required him to give up his home comforts of soul-searching on a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, which he described as his 'story of survival'.It will be the first time Schofield has been on TV since leaving the ITV's This Morning in May 2023 after admitting to a relationship with a much younger male colleague and has since taken aim at those who betrayed him'. The broadcaster, who came out as gay in 2020, joined his wife and friends at the pub and even brought along his pet pooch just 48-hours ahead of the new show's first episode'. A source told MailOnline: 'Phillip was with his wife and a group of friends. He seemed in good spirits and looked like he was enjoying himself. Phillip Schofield, 62, enjoyed a night out with wife Stephanie Lowe and pals in West London on Saturday, as he was seen first time since the announcement of his controversial TV comeback The disgraced presenter secretly filmed a special three part series for Channel 5, which required him to give up his home comforts of soul-searching on a tropical island Phillip cheated on wife of over 20 years Stephanie Lowe with a much younger man (pictured together in 2021) 'It looked like they were attending an engagement party for a friend and he helped himself to some cake too.' Schofield wore a dark blazer of a pale pink shirt and teamed it with dark trousers for the outing where he posed for selfies with fans. The former ITV star later sharing a goodbye hug with a pal before hopping into a waiting taxi. It comes following reports that ITV bosses were furious at the star's claims he would have been treated differently if he had had an affair with a woman rather than a man. In Cast Away, Schofield says he would have got a 'pat on the back' it wasn't a homosexual relationship, before taking aim at the 'three s***s of showbiz' who betrayed him as he ranted about his downfall. In his much-criticised television comeback on Channel 5 programme Cast Away, he refers to himself as the 'shamed, disgraced Philip Schofield, who had an affair'. He aid: 'Strangely, I think another TV presenter or two might have done exactly the same thing. Difference is heterosexual. It's not an unusual thing in the gay world for there to be a difference in age groups.' 'That's not that unusual in the straight world, but if that had been the case with me and it had been a woman. Pat on the back. Well done, mate.' In his much-criticised television comeback on Channel 5 programme Cast Away, he refers to himself as the 'shamed, disgraced Philip Schofield, who had an affair' The broadcaster, who came out as gay in 2020, appeared in high spirits as he joined his wife and friends the pub, where also took along his pet pooch He wore a dark blazer of a pale pink shirt and teamed it with dark trousers for the outing where he posed for selfies with fans The former ITV star later left the pub, but not before sharing a goodbye hug with a pal, before hopping into a waiting taxi Schofield said that he 'has regrets' and acknowledges he 'got something wrong' and 'hurt the people' around him. 'I don't know what price you're supposed to pay and whether the price you're paying is necessarily proportionate,' he adds. Hitting back, a source at the channel said: 'It's a stupid thing for Phil to say, and it is just not true. Phil lied to his colleagues, his bosses and his friends about it, it wouldn't have mattered if it was a woman or a man.' They add that Schofield is unlikely to work with the channel again despite his hints that he had been approached to appear on their reality show, I'm A Celeb. One source said: 'He lied to us, it would be really, really difficult.' In the programme, which airs from Monday, Schofield takes aim at a trio of his former ITV colleagues, saying: 'I think there are only three s**ts.' Read More Phillip Schofield will 'never work for ITV again' despite I'm A Celebrity rumours He pointed out that one was a 'coward who never stepped up in queue gate,' while another 'is a coward because they never stepped up when I was being battered by that one journalist who thought I'd got them fired.' The third, Schofield says 'is just brand orientated. Not what you expect, not what you think you're going to get.' Continuing to take aim at those who he believes wrong him, Phillip added of his formerly long-standing TV career: 'They know how important that was to me. 'They know when you throw someone under a bus, you've got to have a really bloody good reason to do it. Brand, ambition is not good enough', reports The Sun. He went on: 'People can be fake. They can be so fake with you when it's all going well, and suddenly utter, utter betrayal. 'There are a lot of amazing people in morning television.' He also insisted that he has now quit television and doesn't want to make a return despite filming the three-part show for Channel 5 which sees him having to survive alone in Madagascar. While Phillip failed to disclose which ITV figures he was referring to, he did take the opportunity to take a brutal swipe at his ex-colleagues. Despite mentioning ITV Co-stars Ant, 48, and Dec, 49, as well as Joanna Lumley, 78, his former pal Holly Willoughby isn't mentioned at all throughout the 45-minute episode. In one outburst which will leave viewers wondering whether it is aimed at her, Schofield says: 'When you throw someone under a bus, you've got to have a really bloody good reason to do it. It comes following reports that ITV bosses were furious at the star's claims he would have been treated differently if he had had an affair with a woman rather than a man Meanwhile, Phillip also took aim at the 'three s***s of showbiz' who betrayed him as he ranted about his downfall [pictured with former co-star Holly Willoughby] Meanwhile during the programme, Phillip and his family appeared to mock Holly's famous 'are you ok?' clip as he made his return to TV [Holly pictured in June 2023] In a clip obtained by The Sun , he gives out food to his wife Stephanie and their daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, and laughs: 'If you're ok, then we're ok, and I'm ok...are you ok?' 'I got into telly because I love the nuts and bolts of telly, I never wanted to be famous. I'm not fussed about that. 'I miss parts of it. I miss most of it, I'm honest. But there are bits that I really, really, really don't miss. You learn a lot about people. I don't miss that.' ITV's fury comes as Schofield also hints that he was fired from the network when in fact the first its chiefs learned of his departure was in statement to the Mail where he admitted the affair and said he left with immediate effect. Sources at the broadcaster also say that he chose to step back from presenting This Morning a fortnight before following a fall out with his former co-star Holly Willoughby. Read More EXCLUSIVE Phillip Schofield admits he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt on Cast Away Meanwhile during the programme, Phillip and his family appeared to mock Holly's famous 'are you ok?' clip as he made his return to TV. Phillip was ousted from This Morning in May last year, after he admitted to lying about his relationship with a much younger male colleague. Holly distanced herself from her former best friend and during a 'highly strategised' return to the This Morning sofa in June 2023, she told viewers she had been left 'shaken, let down and worried.' When she returned, she began by saying: 'Hello, Firstly, are you okay? I hope so. It feels very strange sat here without Phil.' Appearing to reference the now-famous speech on Cast Away, Phillip is seen having a BBQ with his family before heading off to the island. In a clip obtained by The Sun, he gives out food to his wife Stephanie and their daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, and laughs: 'If you're ok, then we're ok, and I'm ok...are you ok?' No mention of Holly is made in the clip. The Channel 5 show also took a dark turn when Phillip told how he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt, but decided against it when his eldest daughter Molly persuaded him not to. The Channel 5 show also took a dark turn when Phillip told how he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt, but decided against it when his eldest daughter Molly persuaded him not to Phillip recalled how a conversation with his daughters Molly, 31, and Ruby, 28, stopped him from going ahead with it (pictured with wife Stephanie Lowe, Molly and Ruby in 2018) He added: ‘That was just enough, just enough to take a step back from the edge. I could have been hospitalised, I just raced to the family home and shut the gates and I was in there' Speaking on the first episode of the three-part series which airs on Monday, the former This Morning host said: 'In the last eighteen months, it got as dark as it is possible to get. 'A year ago I got so, so close. I had everything in place, everything was set up and everything was ready and it was Molly that was looking after me.' He explained: 'Molly and Ruby both looking after me at the time, and Molly said: 'Do you imagine what this would do to us if you actually managed to pull this off? Can you imagine what would happen and can you imagine what it would do to me if you did this on my watch?' 'That was just enough, just enough to take a step back from the edge. I could have been hospitalised, I just raced to the family home and shut the gates and I was in there.' He later pays tribute to his wife Stephanie Lowe, Molly, 31, and his youngest daughter Ruby, 28, saying: 'Without them, I wouldn't be here.' The disgraced presenter revealed this week he was taking part in his own survival show just 16 months on from leaving This Morning after admitting to having an 'unwise but not illegal' fling with a junior male colleague. Phillip Schofield Cast Away, which is a three-part series, can be streamed on Channel 5 at 9pm on September 30, October 7 and October 14. Share or comment on this article: Something to celebrate?

Trump criticized Harris' border visit and Fox News for airing her comments, claiming, \"Everything she says is lies.\"Newsweek reached out to both the Harris and Trump campaigns via email for comment on Saturday's events.Immigration remains a hot-button issue in Wisconsin and other swing states, with the former president hoping to capitalize on voter frustration. Trump reiterated his controversial stance, having previously described illegal border crossers as \"poisoning the blood of the country.\" He also promised to launch the \"largest deportation operation in American history\" if re-elected.The event featured mugshots of individuals in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate. Local Police Chief Kyle Teynor addressed the crowd, confirming that Zarate, arrested on multiple charges including sexual assault, is not a U.S. citizen and possessed fake immigration documents.Recent polls show a tight race in Wisconsin. According to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, Harris leads Trump by a narrow margin of 49 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in the state.The Times/Siena poll, conducted from September 21 to 26, surveyed 680 likely voters and has a margin of error of approximately 4 percentage points. FiveThirtyEight's polling averages for Wisconsin show Harris maintaining a slim lead of 2.1 points over Trump (48.8 percent to 46.7 percent).A recent poll by Redfield and Wilton Strategies reveals that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. This gap has been narrowing in recent weeks, coinciding with a sharp decline in border crossings following President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.Harris' tougher stance on border security reflects Democrats' efforts to close this gap and shifting public attitudes towards immigration. Gallup reports that 55 percent of voters — including nearly 30 percent of Democrats — support new immigration restrictions, the highest recorded figure since 2001.The contrasting approaches to immigration policy between Harris and Trump reflect broader ideological differences between the Democratic and Republican platforms. The GOP ranks immigration as a top priority, promising to secure the border and end what they term an \"invasion.\" In contrast, the Democratic platform emphasizes reforming the asylum system and balancing enforcement with humanitarian considerations.Trump's border policies during his presidency focused on reducing unauthorized immigration, including partial construction of a border wall, expanding enforcement, and introducing stricter asylum rules. His controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in family separations at the southern border, was widely criticized and eventually terminated.Harris supports comprehensive immigration reform, prioritizing humanitarian protections and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including \"Dreamers.\" She advocates for modernizing legal immigration systems and framing immigration as an asset to the American economy and society.Trump and other Republicans have accused Harris of failing to act on these policies as vice president, blaming her for the rise in illegal border crossings and dubbing her Biden's \"border czar.\"During the ABC News presidential debate, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which have been debunked. He has also promised mass deportations of migrants, a plan that has faced skepticism from Democrats and some Republicans due to logistical challenges.","summary":"The former president leads Harris by 11 points on immigration trust and promises mass deportations amid a tight race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-wisconsin-liberate-mass-migrant-invasion-1960854","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2482999/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 00:45:18","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":257785266,"title":"Trump greeted by chants of ‘USA,’ tosses popcorn to fans as he attends Alabama vs. Georgia football game","text":"Former President Donald Trump was welcomed by cheers from a crowd in the concourse at Bryant-Denny Stadium as he arrived for the Alabama v.

JD Vance missed out on a Pittsburgh culinary landmark after he was apparently kicked out from meeting with supporters inside — despite the same restaurant chain allowing the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign to meet its supporters there. A source familiar with the campaign told Fox News Digital that when the vice presidential campaign stopped by Primanti Bros. Restaurant and Bar in North Versailles, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, their planned visit to excited supporters was cut short when they were promptly kicked out by employees. The source noted that Primanti Bros. management was aware that the Trump-Vance campaign was planning on stopping by. An employee told the campaign that this was \"not a campaign stop\" and that \"JD's not allowed in,\" the source said, adding that the manager threatened to call the police if they didn't leave. Trump-Vance supporters shot back, booing the employees as they were ushered to the exit, the source said. PITTSBURGH DINERS FUME OVER ‘STAGED’ HARRIS CAMPAIGN STOP AS POPULAR RESTAURANT CLEARED: ‘MIND-BOGGLING’ The Trump campaign's frosty reception at the restaurant chain contrasts how the Harris-Walz campaign was treated just a month earlier when they visited a Primanti Bros. location in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Harris' campaign made a stop at the Primanti Bros. location on Aug. 18 – much to the chagrin of locals, who were kicked out of the restaurant. \"I wanted to watch some sports and enjoy an afternoon lunch,\" Mark Dodson previously told Fox News Digital. \"Around 3:30, the bartender, she goes, ‘It’s last call’ – what do you mean last call?\" Employees informed the Pennsylvania native that the restaurant was closing early for a private event. FOX NEWS TO SIMULCAST THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE The private event was the arrival of the Harris campaign's entourage, with videos from inside the event showing Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff greeting patrons. Outside, kicked-out patrons and Trump supporters protested the event. Others verbally accused the campaign of employing \"actors\" – as video captured by ABC News of Harris’ visit itself depicted a full dining room with people enjoying their food. \"Holy hell, all these actors in these vans,\" a man was heard shouting among the anti-Harris demonstrators. Despite the Vance campaign being kicked out of the local establishment on Saturday, the campaign met with supporters outside the restaurant. Photos from the impromptu outside event showed Vance greeting excited patrons. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION Before leaving, Vance addressed the crowd of supporters that had gathered outside the establishment. \"We paid for everybody’s food, we gave them a nice tip and, of course, when I gave a nice tip, I said no taxes on tips,\" Vance said, referring to a Trump proposal. \"It’s all right, don’t hold it against [the worker],\" he said. \"She just got a little nervous, but it’s a great local business. Let’s keep on supporting it.\" WATCH: Exclusive video obtained by Fox News Digital showed Vance talking with Primanti Bros employees following the run-in. \"I don't think they paid for their food, so we'll cover it,\" Vance is heard telling an employee. \"I appreciate that, thank you,\" the employee is heard saying. \"And keep the change,\" Vance said. \"I'm sure there's going to be a fair amount in there.

The Lebanese militant group confirmed the death of its longtime leader, whose killing could dramatically reshape conflicts across the Middle East. Attacks on Hezbollah targets by fighter jets continued Saturday after the army said it told residents to evacuate three buildings it was targeting, as Israel braced for Hezbollah's response. Hours before the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. Netanyahu abruptly cut his United States visit short and returned to Israel. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated less than two weeks ago, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled and now stands at more than 211,000. At least 20 primary healthcare centers have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears of further displacement. ___ Here’s the latest: Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani wrote a letter to the heads of the United Nations and the Security Council on Saturday calling for an emergency council meeting over the attack that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. “Using U.S.-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters,” he wrote, Israel killed Nasrallah and Iranian Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, among others. He warned Israel not to attack any of its diplomatic premises or representatives. “Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,” Iravani wrote. Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah, its leader and one of its founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a southern suburb of Beirut. UNITED NATIONS — Russia's foreign minister said Saturday that lots of people think Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was aimed at provoking Iran and the U.S. “to unleash a full-blown war in the entire region.” Sergey Lavrov told a news conference after addressing the annual global gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the killing is \"not simply a political assassination. It’s very cynical as an act.” Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah, its leader and one of its founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a southern suburb of Beirut. “I think — well not even I think but a lot of people say — that Israel wants to create the grounds to drag the U.S. directly into this, and so to create these grounds is trying to provoke Iran,” Lavrov said. “The Iran leadership, I think, are behaving extremely responsibly. And this is necessary. This is something that we should take due note of,” he said. BAGHDAD — Hundreds of protesters tried to cross Saturday into the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy is based. Supporters of Iran-allied Shiite factions gathered near the entrance to the zone at the suspension bridge over the Tigris River. They attempted to breach the Green Zone and storm the embassy in anger over the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Iran-backed Iraqi militias have periodically launched drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in protest over Washington’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iraqi authorities closed one of the fortified gates of the Green Zone to regular traffic, restricting access to holders of Green Zone ID badges. A day earlier, the U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year. U.S. troops will depart some bases that they have occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, twice on Friday about the situation in Lebanon, the Pentagon said Saturday. Austin said Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian-backed groups, according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. “Secretary Austin stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,” Ryder said. The statement said Austin made it clear that the U.S. was prepared to protect American forces in the region and was committed to defending Israel. TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that assassinating Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah became an “essential condition” for Israel to achieve its war goals. In his first public remarks since the killing, Netanyahu said the killings of top Hezbollah commanders was not enough and he decided Nasrallah also needed to be killed. He blamed Nasrallah for being “the architect” of a plan to “annihilate” Israel. WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday called Hassan Nasrallah “a terrorist with American blood on his hands,” while urging a diplomatic solution to stem the escalating tensions in the Middle East. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the militant group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ’s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran. “President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Harris said in a statement reacting to confirmation of Nasrallah’s killing in an Israeli airstrike. She added: “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.” The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech on Friday to the U.N., vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. WASHINGTON — The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut. It also authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of “the volatile and unpredictable security situation” in Lebanon’s capital. The move comes after an Israeli strike on Friday killed the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, intensifying the fighting along another front of war, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. “Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions in the country where they are posted deteriorate. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday called the Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah a “measure of justice” for his four-decade reign of terror. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. “Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military says it killed a Hezbollah intelligence official Saturday in a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed. The Israeli Defense Forces said it “eliminated” Hassan Khalil Yassin in a strike in the Dahieh area of Beirut. The Israeli military said Yassin was involved in planning attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, including some planned to be carried out “in the coming days.” UNITED NATIONS — The head of the United Nations is urging all sides to “step back from the brink” following the dramatic escalation of events in Beirut in the last 24 hours, his spokesman said. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres believes “this cycle of violence must stop now,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Saturday. “The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, as well as the wider region, cannot afford an all-out war.” Guterres urged the combatant parties to recommit to the full implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon “and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities,” Dujarric said. TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel, including at the Tel Aviv international airport, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed from a trip to the U.S. The Israeli military said a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted shortly after the sirens were heard. There were no reports of injuries. Later on Saturday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they targeted the airport during Netanyahu’s arrival with a ballistic missile. Netanyahu cut short his trip to the U.S. to deal with the growing crisis in Israel’s battle against Hezbollah militants. TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered condolences over the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and accused the United States of supporting his killing in Israeli airstrikes. “The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned what he called Israel’s “savage attacks” that have killed hundreds of Lebanese people. In a post on X, Erdogan urged Muslim countries to “exhibit a more determined stance against these attacks.” “With the United Nations Security Council first and foremost, we are calling to action all institutions working toward global peace, stability and security, as well as all human rights organizations,” he wrote. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen mourned Nasrallah’s death and said the killing won’t deter Hezbollah or other Iranian-backed groups fighting against “the Israeli enemy.” The Houthis have launched drone and missile attacks on shipping routes and on Israel as part of their support for Palestinian militant groups. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran says a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The state-run IRNA news agency says Abbas Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in Lebanon. Nilforushan was sanctioned in 2022 by the U.S. government, which identified him as deputy commander for operations in the guard. It said he had been a leader in suppressing protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in the civil war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. In 2020, Iranian state television called him a “comrade” of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the expeditionary Quds Force, who was killed in a 2020 U.S. drone attack in Baghdad. BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health minister says 1,030 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, more than in the previous 11 months. Health Minister Firass Abiad says the toll includes 156 women and 87 children. A total of 1,640 people in Lebanon have died since Hezbollah began firing rockets over the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, the day after Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The health ministry counted 11 people killed and 108 wounded on Friday, but said the true toll may be higher. TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military updated guidelines for residents on Saturday that prohibit large gatherings, demonstrations, and sports events in central Israel due to concerns of a counterattack after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. School remains canceled in northern Israel for some 600,000 students. Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel expects “challenging days ahead” as the country braces for a response. Hagari said at a media briefing that Nasrallah “posed a threat to Israeli citizens for decades, and his elimination makes the world a safer place.” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday’s strike in southern Beirut that killed Nasrallah was one of “the most important targeted strikes since the founding of the state of Israel.” BAABDA, Lebanon — Shots rang out in Hezbollah’s stronghold of southern Beirut and other areas of Lebanon as people fired in the air to mourn the death of the only leader many Lebanese have known for the powerful militant group. Angry supporters shouted, decrying his death. One woman holding her baby in the western city of Baabda, shouted: “Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid,” using an honorific title for Nasrallah. The Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. It said Nasrallah’s death would not stop the two Iran-backed militant groups’ fight against Israel. Hamas said in a statement that “assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.” BEIRUT — Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and vowed to continue its “holy war” against Israel and \"in support of Palestine.” The group said in a statement that Nasrallah “has joined his fellow martyrs.” Nasrallah led the militant group for more than three decades. His death could dramatically reshape conflicts across the Middle East. TEL AVIV, Israel – Israel’s military says it is continuing to strike sites belonging to Hezbollah in Lebanon, some under residential buildings, after the massive attack that targeted the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Israeli army says it hit more than 140 targets since Friday night, including a storage site for anti-ship missiles beneath civilian apartment buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck the weapons stores under six different buildings as, working to “degrade and dismantle” Hezbollah’s infrastructure and capabilities, the military said. It is unclear how many people have been killed in the Israeli strikes on densely populated urban areas. The United Nations says fighting has displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week. TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian state television says a flight from Tehran bound for Lebanon was turned away from Beirut airport on Saturday. It reported that the decision came following a warning by Israel that the airport could be targeted if the passenger plane landed. Israel’s military says it will not allow the civilian airport to be used for military purposes and that pilots are patrolling the skies over the airport for weapons smuggling. Sky News reported that Lebanon’s transport minister intervened to stop the plane from landing. TEHRAN, Iran – Iran’s supreme leader has urged all Muslims to stand by Hezbollah against Israel, but has not indicated how Tehran will respond to the reported killing of the group‘s leader Hassan Nasrallah. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli militant groups in the region. In his first comments since Israel claimed to have killed Nasrallah, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, “it is the duty of all Muslims to stand by the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah” against the “occupier, evil and suppressor” regime of Israel. In a statement read on state TV, he said “all regional resistance forces” support and stand beside Hezbollah. Iran’s influential parliamentary committee on national security met Saturday and demanded a “strong” response to Israel, state TV reported. In April, for the first time, Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel following an Israeli strike that killed Iranian military advisors. JERUSALEM — Israel's military says it expects Hezbollah to retaliate for the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and is on “high readiness.” Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal remains intact despite intense Israeli strikes over the past week, and that Israel will continue to target the group. “This isn’t a threat that has gone away,” he said. Shoshani said it is “safe to assume” that Hezbollah will retaliate. But he said Israel hopes the blow “will change Hezbollah’s actions” and alter the course of the war. Shoshani said the airstrike targeting Nasrallah was based on years of tracking him, along with “real-time information.” He said Israel confirmed the death through various types of intelligence, though he declined to elaborate. COLOGNE, Germany — The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that airlines not operate in Lebanese or Israeli airspace. The Cologne, Germany-based EASA said Saturday that “an overall intensification of air strikes and degradation in the security situation has been noted, impacting the safety of airspace over Israel and Lebanon.” It did not cite any one specific event in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as a trigger for issuing its “conflict zone information bulletins” for the two countries. It said the recommendation is valid until Oct. 31 but could be reviewed earlier and adapted or withdrawn. TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Saturday that it killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, in a strike in Beirut on Friday. The military said that it carried out a precise airstrike while Hezbollah leadership met at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut. Ali Karki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and additional Hezbollah commanders, were also killed in the attack, the Israeli military said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said that 6 people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes on Friday, which leveled six apartment buildings. Nasrallah has led Hezbollah for more than three decades. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. Israel maintained a heavy barrage of airstrikes against Hezbollah on Saturday, as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets toward Israel. TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said it was mobilizing additional reserve soldiers as tensions escalate with Lebanon. The military said Saturday morning it was activating three battalions of reserve soldiers, after earlier sending two brigades to northern Israel earlier in the week to train for a possible ground invasion. CAIRO — An Israeli airstrike killed at least two people and wounded 11 others in the central Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, the Awda hospital said. The strike hit a house late Friday in the camp, according to the hospital which received the casualties in the first hours of Saturday. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the nearly year-long war. TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched more than two dozen projectiles toward Israel Saturday morning, triggering sirens in more than 100 cities and towns across Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said a surface-to-surface missile was fired from Lebanese territory and fell in an open area in central Israel. Israeli media said the missile fell in the sea. No injuries or damages were reported, according to Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services. While Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since Oct. 8 mostly in the area around the border, in the past weeks, the strikes have targeted much deeper into both countries. BEIRUT — Patients in hospitals in Beirut’s southern suburbs will be evacuated to medical centers in the capital and the nearby Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. In a statement carried by state news agency early Saturday, the ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop receiving cases that can be delayed in order to receive patients evacuating from the hard-hit southern suburb Dahiyeh. BEIRUT — Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, with flames lighting up the pre-dawn darkness. Fire raged from at least one location, and smoke and flames were seen from above Beirut early Saturday. Residents reported jets flying overhead. In a short statement, the Israeli military described the sites it hit as belonging to Hezbollah. Authorities there did not immediately acknowledge if there were any casualties. Shelters set up in the city center for people displaced by the onslaught were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches, or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry.","summary":"Hezbollah has confirmed that its leader of more than three decades, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-hamas-war-latest-smoke-rises-beiruts-southern-114310122","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/da7d4a62-2b35-431f-8c9e-6d374baa635a/wirestory_bad4f10c71b1d060a8f98fe13037da20_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 00:14:20","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":257784214,"title":"Trump falsely calls Harris ‘mentally impaired,’ prompting criticism","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’s mental capacity Saturday, falsely claiming she was born “mentally impaired” and comparing her actions to that of a “a mentally disabled person.” The remarks prompted criticism from advocates for people with disabilities.

Trump continued to push the idea that if he doesn’t win the election, “you’re gonna lose your culture.” Railing against migrants and the border has been central to Trump’s campaign, though on Saturday he ramped up the rhetoric to focus primarily on tapping into unsubstantiated fears of a “mass migrant invasion.” He appeared before a backdrop that featured the words “Deport Illegals Now” and “End Migrant Crime” emblazoned in several places across it. Trump claimed that President Joe Biden and vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris were both mentally challenged. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired,” he claimed. “Kamala was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.” He added under the Biden-Harris administration, there have been more terrorists entering the United States. “We have the some of the greatest terrorists in the world, in our country right now,” he said. This claim has been debunked, however. Trump played on fear-mongering to a small-town crowd in Wisconsin, where he claimed criminal migrants are running rampant. “You’re talking about areas of the Midwest where they’re becoming famous because they’re being occupied, and this is hundreds of little cities and little towns — they’re petrified, and their law enforcement is petrified. You have a sheriff and a deputy, or you have a small group, and you’ll have a group of Venezuelan killers, street gangs occupying the town with MK-47s,” he claimed (he probably meant AK-47s). “I know that gun very well,” he continued. “I got to know it very well. I’ve become an expert on guns quickly.” He also once again brought up Springfield, Ohio, where he and his running mate, J.D. Vance, have for weeks pushed baseless lies about the city’s Haitian immigrants, most of whom are in the United States legally. On Saturday, he claimed: “In Ohio, Springfield, they can’t speak English. They’re taking over the schools. There’s nobody that can speak English, and the mayor is looking for interpreters.” “These are vicious monsters in our government that are also stupid people,” Trump said, referring to the current administration. “They are vicious, but they are stupid, which is a very dangerous combination. Today, I stand before you to make this promise. I will liberate Wisconsin from this mass migrant invasion of murderers, rapists, hoodlums, drug dealers, thugs and vicious gang members. We are going to liberate our country. I will liberate our nation. Our nation will be free again if we win this election,” he said. Wisconsin is a pivotal battleground state in the election and a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll finds Trump and Harris running neck and neck, with Trump garnering 47 percent and Harris winning 49 percent of voters if the election were to be held now. Trump will hold his next rally tomorrow, Sept. 29, in Erie, Pennsylvania.","summary":"The former president claimed areas of the Midwest are being “occupied” by migrants with “MK-47s”","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-harris-mentally-disabled-anti-migrant-rally-rant-1235115667/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DonaldTrumpWisconsin-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 23:51:45","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":257783684,"title":"Adam Boulton: JD Vance v Tim Walz – why the vice presidential debate could sway US election","text":"TV debates have mattered more than ever before in this year’s US presidential election. President Joe Biden’s pitiful performance on 27 June effectively knocked the incumbent out of the race for the White House. Then on 10 September Biden’s replacement, vice president Kamala Harris, proved she is a real contender, baiting her opponent Donald Trump into wild statements such as “they’re eating the pets!”. The Democrats have recovered in the polls since Harris took over the nomination, including in so-called swing states, to the point that she is now narrow favourite to beat Trump, according to some respected analysts. Others still reckon the Republican Trump will be re-elected. Either way, all agree the contest is on a knife edge with voting already under way in a handful of less populated states, and opening next week in Illinois. With things so close, the televised debate next Tuesday could even tip the balance. “All the needle needs to be moved is 0.1% in either direction, and that could be the difference in four or five states,” according to Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist. 👉 Click here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts👈 Harris and Trump will not be on stage. This latest debate in CBS studios in New York City on 1 October is between their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz. In most years vice presidential debates are sideshows which have little impact on the voters. Not this year. The rise of Harris to presidential candidate has shown Americans that VPs are important. Just as Trump had to scramble to find a new running mate following stinging condemnation from Mike Pence, the man who served as his vice president for four years. Adding to the excitement, the two men who will be facing off this week are also the best phrase-makers in this campaign. Vance wrote bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy, based on his rough upbringing in the Appalachians. He likes to launch sweeping attacks on his foes, including dismissing Democratic women as “childless cat ladies”. Taylor Swift embraced this jibe for herself in her recent post endorsing Harris. Walz probably owes his place on the ticket to the single word “weird”, which he spent the summer sticking on Trump and Vance to devastating effect in multiple media interviews on behalf of the Democratic campaign. The confrontation between the two men promises to be spicy. There is a generation gap between them. Walz is 60. Vance is 20 years younger. Walz likes to present himself as a folksy centrist dad. In The Manual, a signature campaign commercial, Walz sets about fixing his old car, “a ’79 International Harvester Scout”, while likening it to creating an opportunity economy for all. He is also a veteran democratic politician having served 12 years in Washington in the US House of Representatives before being elected Governor of Minnesota in 2018, the post he still holds. Vance’s career has been meteoric. Four years in US Marine Corps provided his ladder to university. Then he became a corporate lawyer for investment firms. Following the success of his book, his backers included the controversial tech titans Peter Thiel, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen. After a lightning campaign in 2022, he is currently a first-term Republican US Senator for Ohio. Read more:Who is JD Vance?Analysis: Why Harris picked Walz Both men served in the military in non-combat roles. Vance was a journalist in uniform during his four years which included deployment to Iraq. Walz belonged to the Minnesota National Guard for 24 years. The Harris campaign admitted he “misspoke” when he described assault rifles as “weapons of war that I carried in war”. The two “VP picks” share archetypal middle-American backgrounds, Nebraska and Minnesota for Walz and Kentucky and Ohio for Vance, which were major factors in why they were chosen as running mates. Harris is from California, Trump from New York City and Florida, all of which are regarded as coastal fleshpots by citizens in “flyover states”. Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona; the main candidates are all concentrating their campaigning on the battleground states – those most likely to “flip” decisively for one party or another, delivering a majority in the electoral college. This weekend Walz has set up his debate camp in Michigan. In between mock debates in which the Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg is standing in for Vance, Walz will meet and greet the locals in the bayside resort of Harbor Springs. Conveniently there is a “Festival of the Book” taking place which will allow Walz to strut his stuff as a school teacher. Vance has called up US representative Tom Emmer from Walz’s home state for his prep. The House majority whip should know where his old foe’s vulnerabilities lie. This debate will not be relaxed. Unusually for a vice presidential encounter, the protagonists will not be sitting down, they will be standing at lecterns. The last time that happened was 2008 with Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. As with the other debates this year, the Presidential Debates Commission has not been called upon to organise this one. The two sides agreed their own rules with the broadcaster. This time there will be no studio audience, once again, and two moderators: CBS presenters news anchor Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan of Meet The Press. As Harris continues to challenge Trump to another debate without success, Vance has countered in advance demanding a second debate with Walz on 18 October. The Democrat is acting modest, protesting of Vance “he’s a Yale Law guy. I’m public school teacher”. Walz hopes to play the part of a schoolmaster chiding a tearaway pupil. He will do well if he can emulate Lloyd Bentsen’s crushing put down of the younger Dan Quayle in their 1988 vice presidential debate: “I knew Jack Kennedy. You’re no Jack Kennedy.” Walz has fertile territory to exploit. JD Vance has already had to eat many of his wilder statements. He once likened his boss Trump to “Hitler”. For electoral reasons he has U-turned on his book’s thesis that his fellow poor whites were to blame for their own fecklessness. Republican strategists hope that Vance will counter Walz’s rebukes over sexism and abortion by sticking to mainstream issues such as inflation and immigration. Vance can boast a nuanced personal record on some social issues including healthcare. But he is also pugnacious and may be unable to resist going after Walz aggressively for what Republicans regard as his left-wing voting record. Trump’s groundless claims that Harris is “a communist” seem to be impressing Hispanic voters. Walz has more to lose and Vance has more to prove in the debate. Harris has embraced her choice of Walz, notably by appearing with him for her first major TV interview. Trump barely mentions Vance at his rallies. In opinion polls Walz has net approval ratings of 10%, Vance is at around minus 35%. Debates are proving their value in this election year. Americans are paying increasing attention to them. 51.3 million tuned in to Biden/Trump earlier in the summer, 67.1 million watched Harris/Trump earlier this month. An outcome on Tuesday night as vivid as in the two previous debates this year could well be a defining moment for the next presidency. On the other hand, both veteran Democrats and Republicans will also remember that while Lloyd Bentsen smashed the debate, George H W Bush and Dan Quayle won the election.","summary":"TV debates have mattered more than ever before in this year&#8217;s US presidential election.

It comes after the ex-US President bizarrely boasted about his \"very good relationship\" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in front of media and the Ukrainian president. The pair met yesterday at Trump Tower in New York and discussed how the ongoing war as the November election day nears. In a subsequent interview with Fox News, Zelensky revealed what Trump asked him during their meeting. He said: \"He asked me a lot [of questions]. [Trump asked] What do you see now is the situation on the battlefield? How do you see support from the United States? Why do you think Putin started the invasion. Zelensky also said that Trump told him he supported Ukraine and \"he will be on our side, that he will support Ukraine\". But Zelensky did take one shot at Trump and other people saying that peace would be quick or easy. He said: \"I think that we understand better than everybody, including Donald Trump, what is going on in Ukraine and how to stop him [Putin].\" For months Trump has criticised US support for Ukraine and ridiculed Zelensky as a salesman for persuading Washington to provide weapons and funding to his military. The two haven't had a meeting since 2019 as Zelensky continues to pressure US politicians for American aid to fight Russia's invasion. The presidential hopeful said: \"I hope we have a good victory because if the other side wins you're not going to have any victories to be honest.\" Zelensky spoke of how he and Trump \"have a common view\" that the Ukraine war \"has to be stopped and Putin can't win\". Trump said afterwards confidently that he would \"end the war\" and that both sides would \"negotiate a deal that ends the violence.\" Zelensky said he hoped the support of the US would be strong - no matter who wins the election.

The rally, which was supposed to take place outside, but was moved indoors due to a Secret Service staffing shortage, focused on migrant crime. During the speech, Trump referenced the arrest of assault suspect Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, who is an alleged member of Venezuela's violent Tren de Aragua migrant gang. Earlier this month, Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation and suffocation, in addition to false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct, according to WXOW. The suspect, who is accused of sexually assaulting a mother and abusing her daughter \"under particularly brutal circumstances,\" was arrested in Prairie du Chien on Sept. 6. WHITE HOUSE MUM AMID OUTRAGE OVER DATA SHOWING HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINALS ARE IN US \"Just this month, right here in this beautiful town, police arrested an illegal alien member of a savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Agua,\" Trump described. \"These are really bad ones. This vile monster was charged with holding a mother and daughter captive against their will and sexually assaulting them again and again and again.\" The Republican presidential candidate also took aim at his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been criticized for her border policies. \"This animal crossed Kamala's wide open border, along with hundreds of thousands of others that are worse than him, that are worse than him,\" Trump continued. \"He was arrested and released in the sanctuary city of Minneapolis.\" WALZ ROASTED AFTER DECLARING 'WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS' AT RALLY \"And by the way, I'm going to end all sanctuary cities immediately upon taking over,\" he added. Last week, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R–Wis., told Fox News Digital that the community of Prairie du Chien was shaken by the arrest. Van Orden's grandchildren live less than a mile away from the house where the mother and daughter were abused. \"Why should a town of 5,500 people… be afraid of letting their kids play in their front yard?\" the politician said. \"It wasn't like this three years ago.\" Van Orden noted that Wisconsin's farming industries rely on migrant labor, but stressed the need to enact immigration reform for the sake of public safety.

The former president insulted Harris as he ranted about illegal border crossings, describing her as ‘mentally impaired.’ ‘Kamala is mentally impaired. If a Republican did what she did that Republican would be impeached and removed from office and rightfully so for high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Trump began. Trump claimed the Democratic nominee was responsible for migrants who have come into the country illegally and have committed crimes. ‘Think of it – 13,099 convicted murderers. They’re all our country now. And I’ve been saying this for three years. She let in rapists, gang members, drug dealers, child predators and traffickers in women,’ he ranted. ‘Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way,’ Trump repeated. ‘And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.’ Trump’s comments come amid a torrent of racist and sexist attacks from him and his allies against Harris, the first woman and first black and South Asian person to serve as U.S. vice president. Trump has called Harris ‘crazy,’ ‘nuts’ and ‘dumb as a rock,’ and claimed that the Jamaican-Indian vice president previously downplayed her black heritage. Last month he came under fire for sharing a post suggesting his opponent was only successful because of a ‘blowjob.’ The original comment was made by another Truth Social media user, who wrote, below a picture of Harris and Trump’s 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton: “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…” Trump, meanwhile, inherited significant wealth from his father, Fred Trump, a successful New York real estate developer. While Trump expanded his business, he faced financial challenges, with six of his companies filing for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009, mainly in the casino industry. The bankruptcies were used to restructure debt, never affecting his personal finances directly. Trump has often claimed success in real estate and branding despite these setbacks while the true extent of his wealth remains a subject of debate. One thing Trump is not short of is insults and nicknames. Last month he took another thinly veiled jab at Harris as he described himself as ‘better looking’. Trump, 78, began musing on Harris’ recent image on the cover of Time magazine, which he has previously compared to his wife Melania. ‘I am much better looking than her,’ Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. ‘I’m a better looking person than Kamala.’ During Saturday’s rally Trump added that Harris could never be forgiven for ‘erasing our border.’ ‘She must never be allowed to become president of the United States,’ he went on. ‘She’s letting in people who are going to walk into your house, break into your door,’ he said. Trump also professed to not understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, Trump separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended. The former president is hoping frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as ‘poisoning the blood of the country’ and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. ‘I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,’ he said. ‘We’re going to liberate the country.’ Trump has repeatedly portrayed migrants as criminals and blamed Harris for failing to stem an unprecedented surge in illegal immigration, although border crossings fell since President Joe Biden instituted an executive order limiting asylum claims. Democrats, in turn, have blamed Trump for persuading allies in Congress to kill bipartisan legislation that would have funded more border agents and given the Homeland Security secretary authority to prohibit entry for most people over a daily limit. On the Wisconsin rally stage with Trump were three mugshots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have held up the story of Coronel Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. Police Chief Kyle Teynor posted statements on Facebook saying that Coronel Zarate is not a U.S. citizen and that he had two fake immigration documents, including a fake Social Security card. The chief added that Coronel Zarate’s tattoos indicate he’s affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which started in Venezuelan prisons and is posing a growing threat in the U.S.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump hurled his worst slur yet at Vice President Kamala Harris while&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump, 78, makes offensive remark about Kamala Harris as November election nears first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-78-makes-offensive-remark-about-kamala-harris-as-november-election-nears/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/28/23/90224659-0-image-m-9_1727561907936.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 23:16:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":257785050,"title":"Tim Walz Booed Outside of Michigan-Minnnesota Football Game","text":"Minnesota Gov.

It’s the latest of a handful of fake images that Trump has recently shared. The picture claiming to be Diddy, flanked by Harris and another woman, is actually a picture from 2001. And the man in the middle of the real image is talk show host Montel Williams, whom Harris dated at that time. The other woman is Ashley Williams, Montel Williams' daughter. The picture showed up online shortly after Diddy was indicted on a long list of charges, including racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. Trump posted the image Friday on his Truth Social site and wrote: “Kamala, doing the Diddy?” the text read. “Madam Vice President, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?” Trump later deleted the post. Both candidates have crossed paths with Diddy. In 2020 on her X account, Harris thanked him for hosting a town hall about the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities. \"Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night,” the post read. “There's a lot at stake for our communities right now, and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.\" Trump and Diddy have interacted many times over the years, including Trump attending Diddy’s 29th birthday party in 1998. “Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he works very hard,” Diddy told the Washington Post in 2015.

The last presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris was marked by numerous arguments and counter-arguments, but much of the discussion focused on economics and how each candidate plans to address the aspirations, ambitions, and dreams of the American people. There is a perception that, because Trump is being funded by major corporations and is supported by the White Protestants and Catholics, he is likely to succeed in this election. Historically, the US business leaders have consistently supported Republicans. Between 2007 and 2017, 57% of the CEOs of S&P 1500 companies contributed politically to the Republican Party, 19% gave to the Democrats, and the rest split their contributions between the two parties. In fact, big businesses support Trump’s plan to cut corporate taxes although are wary of his proposal to increase tariffs. The business group also appears to oppose Harris’s proposal to address price gouging, which seeks to implement a law that would prevent grocery and pharmaceutical companies from raising prices beyond a certain limit. Harris aims to diminish the influence of big businesses backing the Republicans by reaching out to smaller businesses and consumers. For the small businesses she wants to give tax break of $50,000. For the consumers Harris has proposed increasing tax breaks for families with children, providing more affordable care for the elderly, and offering credits to first-time home buyers, among other initiatives. The average cost of childcare is approximately $11,582 per year. The cost of childcare has risen nearly twice as fast as the inflation rate, largely due to a labour shortage in the sector. The higher cost of childcare has implications for inter-regional mobility. Many working families prefer to stay in the same neighbourhood as their parents due to this cost, even if it means passing up better-paid jobs in other states. In this regard, Harris’s promise of a $6,000 tax cut for families with newborns and the assurance that no one earning under $400,000 will face a tax increase will help support the American middle class. Harris also promises to build 3 million new homes over four years and provide up to $25,000 in assistance to first-time buyers. This move is designed to increase housing availability and help contain inflationary pressures in the real estate market. However, historical evidence suggests it is not easy to build houses in the US. The housing market is tightly regulated. Studies pointed out stringent zoning regulations, such as height limitations and historical site preservation, increased housing costs in New York City by an average of 50 percent. In 2021, in the US, there was a shortage of 7.3 million affordable homes and rental units, an increase of 500,000 from just two years earlier. And the situation is deteriorating largely due to a group of “Not in My Backyard (NIMBY)” supporters who believe that increasing residential development will erode the openness, privacy, and exclusivity of their neighbourhoods. NIMBYs are motivated by concerns that kids will no longer be able to play in the streets, that increased traffic will disrupt suburban life, and that schools will become overcrowded with new students. The legislators seem to be yielding to the anxiety of their suburban constituents and a smaller yet vocal group of NIMBYs who oppose development in New York City. This issue regarding residential housing will be a tough challenge to address, even if Harris wins the election. Immigration affects businesses, society, and employment opportunities. Trump has repeatedly pledged that, if re-elected, he will implement “the largest domestic deportation operation in history”. Trump criticized the Biden-Harris administration for being lenient on immigration, claiming that their policies have allowed “terrorists,” “criminals,” and “drug dealers” to enter the US. Additionally, a more liberal approach to immigration contradicts Trump’s own “America First” policy. It may be common perception that the migrants might take away jobs and lead to unemployment issues. However, this may not always be the case. Whether for high-skilled or low-skilled positions, the US has a historical record of effectively utilizing foreign migrant labour without significantly displacing native workers and increasing the wage. A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that employers could add 160,000 to 200,000 jobs per month this year without significantly leading to a rise in wage or price inflation. The June 2024 unemployment rate of 4.5% is considered low by historical standards. Inflation has dropped below 3%, down from a high of 9.1% in mid-2022. A study at the Yale University found that without immigration, the labour force would have decreased by about 1.2 million people from 2019 to the end of 2023 due to population aging. The nation’s aging population are leading to labour shortages in some industries and may result in a smaller workforce paying taxes to support federal programs like Social Security and Medicare. Take for example, the State of Maine in the East Coast. With a median age of 45.1, Maine has the oldest population of any U.S. state. Maine is known for its abundance of lobsters and its large older population, many of whom are increasingly unable or unwilling to catch, clean, and sell these crustaceans, which constitute a $1 billion industry for the state. As a result, companies are turning to foreign-born workers to fill the gap. As the US as a nation ages overall, Maine provides a glimpse into the potential economic impact and highlights the crucial role that low-skilled immigrants are likely to play in filling the labour market gaps created by the retirement of native-born workers. While the influx may present near-term challenges, it is also enhancing the American economy’s potential. Employers are able to hire more quickly, thanks in part to the influx of labour. The Congressional Budget Office has revised its population and economic growth projections for the next decade upward, reflecting the positive impact of this new wave of newcomers. Immigration could help reduce the federal deficit by stimulating economic growth and expanding the working-age tax base. Data suggests that immigration has contributed to a growth of 1 million in the labour force, annually. Job growth has been strongest in childcare, leisure, hospitality, and construction and most part of the labour requirements are complemented by the migrant workers. Slower growth in Japan and Continental Europe can be attributed to an aging population and historically a restrictive immigration policy. As populations in wealthier nations age, GDP growth tends to slow, support costs rise, and government budgets come under increased pressure. Many empirical studies have found that GDP growth slows roughly one to one with declines in labour force and population growth. Viewed through this lens, the US’s openness to labour immigration has helped maintain the US consumption — a key component of GDP.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump meandered Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic opponent to illegal border crossings. A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for “erasing our border.” “I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,” he said. “We’re going to liberate the country.” Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as “poisoning the blood of the country” and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling immigration. Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris’ father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden’s, and a fly that was buzzing near him. “I wonder where the fly came from,” he said. “Two years ago, I wouldn’t have had a fly up here. You’re changing rapidly. But we can’t take it any longer. We can’t take it any longer.” Trump repeatedly brought up Harris’ Friday event in Douglas, Arizona, where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond Biden’s executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced Trump’s handling of the border while president and his opposing a bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump “prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” “I had to sit there and listen” to Harris last night Trump said, eliciting cheers. “And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be allowed to put it on. It’s all lies. Everything she says is lies.” The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against Harris, insulting her as “mentally impaired” and a “disaster.” Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own party. On either side of the stage with Trump were poster-sized mug shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on Sept. 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment. Police Chief Kyle Teynor posted statements on Facebook saying that Coronel Zarate is not a U.S. citizen and that he had two fake immigration documents, including a fake Social Security card. The chief added that Coronel Zarate’s tattoos indicate he’s affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which started in Venezuelan prisons and is posing a growing threat in the U.S. Speaking to the crowd Saturday, Teynor stressed to the crowd that Coronel Zarate is the only Venezuelan gang member his agency has encountered, but the violence his two alleged victims suffered at his hands earlier this month was very real. Republicans including U.S. Sen. Derrick Van Orden, who is from Prairie du Chien, have criticized authorities in both Minneapolis and Madison for letting Coronel Zarate go, saying they essentially allowed him to attack the woman in Prairie du Chien. They have accused both jurisdictions of being sanctuaries for people in the country illegally. Van Orden told the crowd Trump was the only one who could restore order. “You’re going to see the one man who has enough strength and courage of conviction to stand up to anyone up to and including being shot in the head for us,” he said.","summary":"PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wis.

The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. “Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on American forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ‘s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. “President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden’s description of a “measure of justice.” She added, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.” The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. “It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. “The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of “the volatile and unpredictable security situation” in Lebanon’s capital. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. “Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. Biden on Friday directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust as necessary the U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection and support the full range of U.S. objectives. The president called for the assessment after the Pentagon earlier in the week announced it was sending an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops to the region because of rising tensions.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden and Harris describe Israeli attack on Hezbollah&#8217;s Nasrallah as a &#8216;form of justice&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/biden-and-harris-describe-israeli-attack-on-hezbollahs-nasrallah-as-a-form-of-justice/","image":"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/KSDK/images/bb7bed03-2434-4fe0-a949-be9e70d4d301/20240928T183208/bb7bed03-2434-4fe0-a949-be9e70d4d301_750x422.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:43:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.118},{"id":257781906,"title":"Trump ramps up dark rhetoric against immigrants, Harris","text":"Donald Trump has deployed some of his harshest rhetoric against immigrants who have crossed the border illegally and committed crimes, especially against young women, while he also escalated his personal insults against Kamala Harris.

The former president made the false assertions to a room of supporters in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, seemingly as a way to undermine Harris’s leadership on immigration. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala, was born that way,” Trump said to the audience, who erupted into laughter. “She was born that way.” The former president continued: “And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could’ve allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this.” The “this” Trump was referring to is the influx of migrants who have come into the United States over the last year. A pillar of Trump’s campaign is blaming Harris for migrant crossings by falsely claiming it was her responsibility as vice president to tackle the issue. Multiple Biden administration officials have said that Harris was only tasked with understanding the root cause of mass migration in Central American countries and leading diplomatic efforts to reduce those causes. Maria Town, the president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, said Trump’s language was “ableist.” \"Donald Trump’s ableist comments today say far more about him and his inaccurate, hateful biases against disabled people than it does about Vice President Harris, or any person with a disability,” she said in a statment. “Trump holds the ableist, false belief that if a person has a disability, they are less human and less worthy of dignity. AAPD continues to call for the leadership of both parties in the 2024 election to condemn the use of ableist language like Trump used today. Town reminded people that multiple former presidents lived or are living with a disability. Franklin Delano Roosevelt survived polio and used a wheelchair. John F. Kennedy had Addison’s disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pain. Ronald Reagan had a hearing impairment and President Joe Biden has a stutter. “The presence or absence of disability alone is wholly insufficient to determine a person’s fitness to hold elected office,” Town added. The former president spent much of his hour-long rally on Saturday evening insulting Harris – a common occurrence in his recent speeches. He called her “incompetent” and “a bad person” and claimed her speech from the border on Friday evening was “bulls****.” The Independent has asked the Harris campaign for comment.","summary":"Trump attacked Harris for her immigration policies and invoked ‘abelist’ language to do so","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-wisconsin-rally-speech-harris-mentally-impaired-b2620652.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/28/22/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VL7CHLfe-APg7GJgG.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:41:40","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":257781568,"title":"Photos: Hurricane Helene leaves flooding and destruction across the southeastern U.S.","text":"Hurricane Helene is ravaging communities across the southeastern United States as mass flooding and brutal winds descend on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The 76-year-old singer released The Lighthouse earlier this week as her first solo single since she dropped the political tune Show Them The Way in 2020, dedicating the lyric video to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Now she has returned with another punchy song in the lead-up to the US election in November – this time hitting on women’s rights, and more specifically, the increasing restrictions around abortions in the States. The topic is more heated than ever as women’s rights campaigners continue to fight back after Roe v Wade – protecting abortion rights – was overturned in 2022. Stevie’s song has been two years in the making. ‘I wrote this song a few months after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It seemed like overnight, people were saying “what can we, as a collective force, do about this…” For me, it was to write a song,’ the singer and longtime political activist shared on Instagram. She continued: ‘It took a while because I was on the road. Then early one morning I was watching the news on TV and a certain newscaster said something that felt like she was talking to me~ explaining what the loss of Roe v. Wade would come to mean. https://www.instagram.com/p/DAaAyr0tqcc ‘I wrote the song the next morning and recorded it that night. ‘I have often said to myself, “This may be the most important thing I ever do. To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters ~ and the men that love them”.’ The song does not beat around the bush, featuring powerful lyrics including: ‘Your life’s forever changed / And all the right you had yesterday / Are taken away / And now you’re afraid / You should be afraid / Should be afraid.’ Meanwhile, as the title would suggest, the music video is set in and around a lighthouse on a stormy night, interspersed with images of pro-choice protestors. The blatant social commentary has led to right-wing trolls flooding the acclaimed musician’s comments with their anger. Pro-life and pro-choice advocates clashed in her comments (Picture: Redferns) ‘I’m so crushed. Why do all the millionaire celebs have to do this? Completely out of touch. Goodbye lifelong muse,’ @tangerinedream888 complained on Instagram. ‘Why the hell are these liberals so obsessed with “Abortion”?’ @soldbyamelia said. ‘Sad to see this political bs from Stevie!’ @thejessronaldbinge shared. And @boymon1003 lamented it was ‘so disappointing to see her do this!’ But where there was backlash, there was also an immense amount of love as her fans praised her for the ‘magnificent’ song. ‘Mother, we’ve been waiting for what feels like forever and you did NOT disappoint,’ @sonneiverbena commented. ‘Oh my this needs playing everywhere around the globe, it’s powerful meaning is a true masterpiece that speaks for all the women who aren’t being heard, who are refused their own mental & physical human rights,’ @carolinesw22 shared. ‘The queen has spoken… Women’s rights are violated all over the world, thank you so much for screaming out loud about it, we all need the anthem,’ @wiktoriachlodnika stated. Stevie has previously opened up about an abortion she received in 1979 (Picture: MediaPunch/Shutterstock) ‘This has empowered me to the core! I hope all women out there listens to this and listen to the message she’s trying to tell. ‘This song is not a celebration of abortions and those of you that think this are the problem! This is about our rights! It’s about women’s rights!’ @tmarshall4 said against the haters. And @grievousdrawss echoed: ‘Do none of y’all realise stevie has always been an outspoken feminist? Or were you purposefully blind until now?’ This is far from the first time Stevie has used her platform to amplify socio-political discussions – and made her perspective on the matter clear. In fact, speaking on this issue in The Guardian in 2020, Stevie reflected on the how important access to abortion had been for her in 1979. ‘If I had not had that abortion, I’m pretty sure there would have been no Fleetwood Mac. There’s just no way that I could have had a child then, working as hard as we worked constantly. And there were a lot of drugs, I was doing a lot of drugs … I would have had to walk away,’ she explained at the time. She added: ‘And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people’s hearts and make people so happy. ‘And I thought: “you know what? That’s really important. There’s not another band in the world that has two lead women singers, two lead women writers.” That was my world’s mission.’ And in the lead-up to this election, she praised Taylor Swift after she endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president, telling fans that voting would be ‘the most important thing you ever do’.

Kamala was born that way … only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country,” Trump, 78, said to raucous applause during remarks in Prairie du Chien. She’s a “very dumb person,” Trump added later on. The speech was focused primarily on immigration, long a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign. During his remarks, the former president offered graphic stories of a nation he said had been overrun by illegal migrants. “Just this month, right here in this beautiful town, police arrested an illegal alien, member of a savage Venezuelan prison gang,” Trump said. “This vile monster was charged with holding a mother and daughter captive against their will and sexually assaulting them again and again. This animal crossed Kamala’s wide-open border, along with hundreds of thousands of others that are worse than him.” Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, is accused of sexually and physically assaulting a woman “under particularly brutal circumstances” and holding her and her minor daughter against their will. Harris is “letting in people who are going to walk into your house, break [through] your door, and they’ll do anything they want. They’ll do anything they want. These people are animals,” Trump continued. “They make our criminals look like babies. These are stone-cold killers. They’ll walk into your kitchen. They’ll cut your throat.” Swing state polling shows deep pessimism among the electorate with upwards of four in 10 Wisconsin voters saying the nation is at risk of becoming a failed state. At various points, Trump digressed into other favorite subjects. He told the assembled crowd he had lawyered up for the 2024 presidential election and was prepared to dole out punishment to anyone caught trying to subvert the result, should he be elected. “If we win and when we win, we’re going to prosecute people that cheat on this election,” he said. “And if we can, we’ll go back to the last one, too … You need two things, strong borders and fair elections. And we have neither.” Trump also accused Harris of planning to legalize deadly fentanyl in the United States. “She’s so radical, she even wants to legalize fentanyl right away. Fentanyl will kill you just a little tiny on the top of a pin,” Trump said. “I have so many friends that have lost their children to fentanyl.” The candidate also digressed briefly into the troubles of New York Mayor Eric Adams, who was hit with a slew of federal charges this week, including bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy. Echoing comments he made at Trump Tower, Trump said Adams never would have faced the federal hammer if he had kept his mouth shut about the migrant crisis in the Big Apple. “[Migrants] all over the place. And I’m telling you what I said before, these towns, these little towns and cities, and by the way, the big cities too. New York, look what’s happened in New York. And they went after the mayor of New York because he was saying, we can’t do this. We can’t do that. They just indicted him,” Trump said — calling Adams pursuers “vicious monsters in our government.” Earlier Saturday Trump’s running mate Sen. JD Vance also made remarks on immigration in which he promised a “compassionate” border policy.","summary":"She's a \"very dumb person,\" Trump added later on.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/28/us-news/trump-savages-kamala-harris-in-fiery-wisconsin-speech/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90614732.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:32:43","author":"Jon Levine","authors":["Jon Levine"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":257783030,"title":"Trump Slams Kamala Harris Visit to Border 'After Four Straight Years of Obliterating' It","text":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’s recent visit to the border, noting that it came after “four straight years of obliterating” the United States border.

During a speech from Arizona, Harris cast blame on Trump for doing “nothing to fix” the broken immigration system in the U.S. “Last night, after four straight years of obliterating our border, I watched this show that she put on,” Trump said. “Four years of the most incompetent border anywhere in the world in history, Kamala Harris traveled to the scene. In fact, she stood near where I put up border wall, that was her backdrop.” “And, in one of the most heinous crimes ever committed by any administration in American history, that’s what she did by allowing these millions of people. Millions and millions of people to come through our border and make our civilization very unsafe. It’s a civilization, very, very, unsafe. It’s a heritage,” Trump added. “Border czar Harris went to the border to lie in the most shameless and horrible way possible, at the very site where she released so much suffering, misery and death.” While news outlets such as the New York Times have tried to paint Harris as projecting a tough approach to the border, Harris recently released, according to Breitbart’s Neil Munro, an “economic plan that assumes a loose border inflow of low-wage migrant workers, government-aided migrant consumers, and room-sharing migrant renters.” Included in Harris’s 2024 campaign promises were pledges to provide illegal aliens with amnesty, and to increase the flow of migrants into the U.S. As Breitbart News’s John Binder previously reported, during a recent interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, Harris was asked what her administration would do for communities that had “taken in many” migrants. Harris referenced bipartisan legislation from Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) that would increase immigration levels in the U.S., “codify the administration’s parole pipeline for migrants,” and would “expedite work permits” for illegal migrants coming to the southern border. A report released by the House Homeland Security Committee found that under the Biden-Harris administration, nearly eight million migrants had been welcomed in the U.S. The report also found that over 85 percent of migrants who had arrived at the southern border were being released into the U.S.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris's recent visit to the border, noting that it came after \"four straight years of obliterating\" the United States border.\n\n\nThe post Trump Slams Kamala Harris Visit to Border &#8216;After Four Straight Years of Obliterating&#8217; It appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-slams-kamala-harris-visit-to-border-after-four-straight-years-of-obliterating-it/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Kamala-Harriss-Border-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:30:00","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":257782016,"title":"Rachel Campos-Duffy's critique of VP Harris raises eyebrows on 'Fox & Friends Weekend'","text":"Rachel Campos-Duffy, the American conservative television personality, recently sparked controversy on Fox & Friends Weekend, where she criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for allegedly prioritizing her wardrobe over addressing pressing issues at the southern border. Campos-Duffy stated, “She spent more time planning her outfit to wear at the border and the shots they're going to use in their commercials... This was all just a photo-staged shot.” Her remarks have ignited a firestorm of debate, with viewers split on their reactions. The backlash against Campos-Duffy’s comments has been swift, illustrating the deeply divided nature of American political discourse. Supporters of the Vice President have questioned the validity of her criticisms, asking other commenters, “You believe everything you hear on Fox?” Others have pointed out the irony of the headline, stating, “Why is this a headline when we have a felon running for president?” Such comments reflect a growing frustration among some audiences with media narratives that seem to overlook more significant political issues. Campos-Duffy, who first gained fame in the 1990s as a cast member on MTV's The Real World: San Francisco, has carved out a notable career in conservative media. Now a host on Fox News, she is known for her strong pro-life and Christian values, as well as her role as a mother to nine children. In partnership with her husband, Sean Duffy, a former congressman, the couple has become a notable presence in Republican circles, often referred to as the “Real World GOP couple.” Their daughter, Evita Duffy-Alfonso, has also made waves in conservative circles with her outspoken views on the Biden administration, contributing to outlets like The Federalist and co-founding The Chicago Thinker, a platform for right-leaning reporting by University of Chicago students. As Campos-Duffy continues to amplify her criticisms of Vice President Harris and the Biden administration, her comments reflect the broader challenges and polarization in contemporary American politics. With her platform on Fox News, she is likely to remain a prominent voice in conservative commentary, even as public opinion remains divided on the issues she raises.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2024/09/28/rachel-campos-duffys-critique-of-vp-harris-raises-eyebrows-on-fox-friends-weekend","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-09-28/9ceh3clj/00036HC4YW.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:26:57","author":"TDT","authors":["TDT"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.282},{"id":257782298,"title":"Biden and Harris call the Israeli strike killing Hezbollah’s Nasrallah a ‘measure of justice’","text":"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a “measure of justice” for victims of a four-decade “reign of terror,” President Joe Biden said Saturday. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. “Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on American forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ‘s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. “President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden’s description of a “measure of justice.” She added, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.” The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. “It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. “The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of “the volatile and unpredictable security situation” in Lebanon’s capital. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. “Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. Biden, who was spending the weekend at his vacation home in Delaware, and Harris, who was campaigning in California, held a call with national security aides on Saturday to discuss the situation in the Middle East. In a brief exchange with reporters as he left church on Saturday, Biden did not directly respond to questions about the conflict potentially escalating further. “It’s time for a cease-fire,” he said. The president on Friday directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust as necessary the U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection and support the full range of U.S. objectives. He called for the assessment after the Pentagon earlier in the week announced it was sending an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops to the region because of rising tensions.

The Premiere League player, 35, and TOWIE star, 36, tied the knot in June 2022 in a lavish Hampshire ceremony, shortly after the groom was snapped passed out in bed between TWO blondes during his raucous Dubai stag-do. Andy, who shares three-children with his estranged wife, said in a statement: 'Billi and I have privately separated earlier this year and we are under way with our divorce proceedings'. 'It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children.' Meanwhile a source told The Sun: 'Andy and Billi care about each other a lot and have made some great memories together, but decided it was best for the family if they went their separate ways having grown apart'. Andy Carroll, 35, and Billi Mucklow, 36, are set to divorce after secretly separating earlier this year following two years of turbulent marriage, the footballer has confirmed They tied the knot in June 2022 in a lavish Hampshire ceremony, shortly after the groom was snapped passed out in bed between TWO blondes during his raucous Dubai stag-do (pictured) Andy, who shares three-children with his estranged wife, said in a statement: 'Billi and I have privately separated earlier this year and we are under way with our divorce proceedings' (pictured at their 2022 wedding) 'They're still focusing on the kids and being the best parents they can be and being respectful of each other. Before adding: 'They want the process to be straightforward for everyone involved. Andy has been throwing himself into his football.' MailOnline have contacted Billi and Andy's reps for comment. Ahead of their wedding Andy was left red-faced after a photo was revealed in The Sun to show him laying in bed with bar manager living in Dubai, 29-year-old Taylor Jane Wilkey, from Scarborough. Before more images emerged to reveal he was also asleep on the same bed alongside a second woman - Taylor's friend, 28-year-old Phoebe Robb, a personal trainer from Leeds following a 17-hour drinking session. Photographs showed the footballer passed out as well as Taylor wearing his personalised bathrobe with 'Andy Carroll' embroidered on the chest. Billi reportledy fled from the couple's home following the antics and took refuge at her parents' house, removing her £200,000 engagement ring in the run up to the big day. The publication reported at the time that that the reality star was demanding Andy, 'hand over everything' in relation to the pictures before their wedding. He said: 'It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children' Meanwhile a source said: 'Andy and Billi care about each other a lot and have made some great memories together, but decided it was best for the family if they went their separate ways having grown apart' Saying: 'They're still focusing on the kids and being the best parents they can be and being respectful of each other'. They also added that Billi wanted to see every single image from the night in question to fully understand what happened. A friend told MailOnline with her permission: 'Billi thinks he’s an idiot, her entire friendship group feel the same. 'They cannot believe he got himself into that situation and are convinced it’s a set up. They added: 'She currently has no plans to call off the wedding, it’s still on. Read More Andy Carroll passed out in bed between TWO blonde bombshells during his raucous Dubai stag-do, it is claimed just hours after fiancée Billi Mucklow said their wedding will still go ahead 'But if anything else comes out, that might change. 'Andy’s certainly in the doghouse, that’s for sure.' The couple are parents to sons Arlo, nine, and Wolf, six, and daughter Marvel, four, alongside Andy's children Emilie Rose, 15, and Lucas, 14, from a previous relationship. They tied the knot at Hampshire's five-star Four Seasons Hotel followed by a Coachella-themed party, which they dubbed Carroll Chella. New bride Billi swapped her flowing wedding gown for a white feathered mini dress and silver cowboy boots as she let her hair down and danced with her husband for the second day of their wedding festivities at a festival style bash. It came after the pair chose a traditional all-white theme for their lavish wedding ceremony at the five star hotel - and exchanged vows surrounded by displays of white roses during the ceremony, which took place in a spectacular 16th century walled garden. Rows and rows of bottles of £100 champagne were discreetly lined up on trestle tables behind a tall hedge as cheers rang out from the congregation when the happy couple were declared man and wife. Billi found fame on reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex in 2011, but quit reality TV two years later to run a Bikram yoga studio in Essex. She started dating the Geordie footballer in the summer of 2013 but they kept their relationship under wraps until the following February.

With Billi's stabilising influence playing a significant role, the boozy off-field antics that threatened to overshadow a career already hampered by a catalogue of injuries were curtailed. Indeed, the nightclub brawls, boozy nights out and off field assault allegations soon became consigned to memory as Andy underwent something of a rebrand - a change owed in no small part to partner. He even followed her lead by taking up yoga, and speaking in 2019 the footballer credited Billi for helping him change his lifestyle. 'I've got no doubt that I was daft when I was here, and no doubt that I was daft for a couple of years after as well,' he told nufc.co.uk. 'But I met my missus, and we've got four kids living at home now, we've got animals, we've got responsibilities. There's no more behaviour like it was, you know. I was stupid, I was young, and I was carried away with the lifestyle that I had. 'Now it's completely different. I'm actually a dad, I've grown up, and got responsibilities, so… I've got a purpose.'

The Premiere League player, 35, and TOWIE star, 36, tied the knot in June 2022 in a lavish Hampshire ceremony, shortly after the groom was snapped passed out in bed between TWO blondes during his raucous Dubai stag-do. Andy, who shares three-children with his estranged wife, said in a statement: 'Billi and I have privately separated earlier this year and we are under way with our divorce proceedings'. 'It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children.' Meanwhile a source told The Sun: 'Andy and Billi care about each other a lot and have made some great memories together, but decided it was best for the family if they went their separate ways having grown apart'. Andy Carroll, 35, and Billi Mucklow, 36, are set to divorce after secretly separating earlier this year following two years of turbulent marriage, the footballer has confirmed They tied the knot in June 2022 in a lavish Hampshire ceremony, shortly after the groom was snapped passed out in bed between TWO blondes during his raucous Dubai stag-do (pictured) Andy, who shares three-children with his estranged wife, said in a statement: 'Billi and I have privately separated earlier this year and we are under way with our divorce proceedings' (pictured at their 2022 wedding) 'They're still focusing on the kids and being the best parents they can be and being respectful of each other. Before adding: 'They want the process to be straightforward for everyone involved. Andy has been throwing himself into his football.' MailOnline have contacted Billi and Andy's reps for comment. Ahead of their wedding Andy was left red-faced after a photo was revealed in The Sun to show him laying in bed with bar manager living in Dubai, 29-year-old Taylor Jane Wilkey, from Scarborough. Before more images emerged to reveal he was also asleep on the same bed alongside a second woman - Taylor's friend, 28-year-old Phoebe Robb, a personal trainer from Leeds following a 17-hour drinking session. Photographs showed the footballer passed out as well as Taylor wearing his personalised bathrobe with 'Andy Carroll' embroidered on the chest. Billi reportledy fled from the couple's home following the antics and took refuge at her parents' house, removing her £200,000 engagement ring in the run up to the big day. The publication reported at the time that that the reality star was demanding Andy, 'hand over everything' in relation to the pictures before their wedding. He said: 'It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children' Meanwhile a source said: 'Andy and Billi care about each other a lot and have made some great memories together, but decided it was best for the family if they went their separate ways having grown apart' Saying: 'They're still focusing on the kids and being the best parents they can be and being respectful of each other'. They also added that Billi wanted to see every single image from the night in question to fully understand what happened. A friend told MailOnline with her permission: 'Billi thinks he’s an idiot, her entire friendship group feel the same. 'They cannot believe he got himself into that situation and are convinced it’s a set up. They added: 'She currently has no plans to call off the wedding, it’s still on. Read More Andy Carroll passed out in bed between TWO blonde bombshells during his raucous Dubai stag-do, it is claimed just hours after fiancée Billi Mucklow said their wedding will still go ahead 'But if anything else comes out, that might change. 'Andy’s certainly in the doghouse, that’s for sure.' The couple are parents to sons Arlo, nine, and Wolf, six, and daughter Marvel, four, alongside Andy's children Emilie Rose, 15, and Lucas, 14, from a previous relationship. They tied the knot at Hampshire's five-star Four Seasons Hotel followed by a Coachella-themed party, which they dubbed Carroll Chella. New bride Billi swapped her flowing wedding gown for a white feathered mini dress and silver cowboy boots as she let her hair down and danced with her husband for the second day of their wedding festivities at a festival style bash. It came after the pair chose a traditional all-white theme for their lavish wedding ceremony at the five star hotel - and exchanged vows surrounded by displays of white roses during the ceremony, which took place in a spectacular 16th century walled garden. Rows and rows of bottles of £100 champagne were discreetly lined up on trestle tables behind a tall hedge as cheers rang out from the congregation when the happy couple were declared man and wife. Billi found fame on reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex in 2011, but quit reality TV two years later to run a Bikram yoga studio in Essex. She started dating the Geordie footballer in the summer of 2013 but they kept their relationship under wraps until the following February.

With Billi's stabilising influence playing a significant role, the boozy off-field antics that threatened to overshadow a career already hampered by a catalogue of injuries were curtailed. Indeed, the nightclub brawls, boozy nights out and off field assault allegations soon became consigned to memory as Andy underwent something of a rebrand - a change owed in no small part to partner. He even followed her lead by taking up yoga, and speaking in 2019 the footballer credited Billi for helping him change his lifestyle. 'I've got no doubt that I was daft when I was here, and no doubt that I was daft for a couple of years after as well,' he told nufc.co.uk. 'But I met my missus, and we've got four kids living at home now, we've got animals, we've got responsibilities. There's no more behaviour like it was, you know. I was stupid, I was young, and I was carried away with the lifestyle that I had. 'Now it's completely different. I'm actually a dad, I've grown up, and got responsibilities, so… I've got a purpose.'

During Thursday's broadcast of The Megyn Kelly Show (which aired on September 26), the former Fox News anchor was addressing a fan's criticism; the caller had termed Trump's 'I hate Taylor Swift!' statement on Truth Social as 'childish and petty.' As reported by The Daily Beast, Kelly, while disagreeing, stated, \"You could argue it was actually smart of Trump to attack her. Just telegraph to the MAGA faithful—or adjacent—who hadn’t heard about the endorsement that Taylor sucks. We don’t like Taylor.\" Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris during a presidential debate on September 10 prompted many in the MAGA group, including Kelly, to respond strongly. Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce were characterized by Kelly as the 'epitomes of elite snobs' on the September 11 edition of The Megyn Kelly Show, when Kelly maintained her critical diatribe. Kelly added, \"They both have gazillions of dollars. She doesn’t care what happens to these kids, just like he doesn’t give a s**t what happens to all the young men who take the Pfizer booster he’s been pushing on them.\" Kelly also stressed that Republicans should trust Trump's gut when it comes to branding and marketing. For those who may not know, Swift expressed her support for the vice president in an Instagram post that was published soon after the debate between Harris and former president Trump on September 10. Swift declared her allegiance to Harris in an Instagram post, \" I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades. I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice.\" Nevertheless, a recent survey shows that the megastar's right-leaning fan base has drastically diminished since she endorsed Vice President Harris. According to a study that was issued by NBC News, over 47% of Republicans have an unfavorable opinion of Swift. Compared to last November, when 26% of Republicans had a negative impression of Swift, this is an increase of almost 20%. According to NBC, only 12% of Republicans felt the same way about the 34-year-old Grammy Award winner as last year, when 28% said they had a good impression of Swift. Furthermore, according to the poll, Swift's public support for Harris caused Democrats to have somewhat more positive opinions of the singer. Swift's favorability among Democrats increased to 58% in the September survey from 53% in the previous year.","summary":"Following the pop star&#39;s support of Kamala Harris earlier this month, the former Fox News presenter wasted no time in expressing her own contempt.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/megyn-kelly-applauds-donald-trumps-smart-comment-about-hate-for-taylor-swift","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/717838/uploads/2d8ff960-7d84-11ef-b646-83383586a2f8_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:15:16","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.178},{"id":257780740,"title":"Harris campaign to troll Trump during Georgia-Alabama game with flyover banner: report","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly arranged for a banner trolling former President Trump to fly over Bryant-Denny Stadium, where he is expected to make an appearance during Saturday’s SEC showdown between No. 2 Georgia and fourth-ranked Alabama. The Harris campaign plans to launch a new ad during the game that needles Trump on the prospect of a second presidential debate, The Associated Press reported. But according to other reports, she’s also planning a flyover in Tuscaloosa. A plane with the message “Trump’s Punting on 2nd Debate” is expected to fly over the stadium during the primetime matchup, The Washington Post reported Saturday. The game, a rematch of last season’s Southeastern Conference championship, is one of the must-watch games of the college football season. Former President Trump has said he will not participate in a third debate after claiming victory in this month’s debate with Harris. He previously debated President Biden before Biden ended his re-election campaign. “When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, ‘I WANT A REMATCH,’” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. “Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate.” The Democratic National Committee flew four planes carrying banners with anti-Trump messaging over college football games in four major swing states in the upcoming election earlier this month. Alabama defeated Georgia 27-24 in the SEC title game last season. The Bulldogs will have a chance at revenge when the game kicks off at 7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was in attendance for the Minnesota Golden Gophers’ game against No. 12 Michigan Saturday afternoon.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly arranged for a banner trolling former President Trump to fly over Bryant-Denny Stadium during the game between Georgia and Alabama.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/28/us-news/harris-campaign-to-troll-trump-during-georgia-alabama-game-with-flyover-banner-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-8o1prrq43-1727560876000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727546552&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kIAVrCTA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:15:08","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":257784138,"title":"VIDEO -- 'She Should Be Prosecuted': Trump Blasts Pelosi over Husband's Visa Stock Trades Prior to DOJ Lawsuit","text":"Former President Donald Trump took a firm stance on Thursday against Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) regarding her husband’s Visa stock trades. Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris (D) for the White House in 2024, said he believes the former House speaker should be prosecuted, the New York Post reported on Friday. His comments came during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York: Nancy Pelosi has a little problem because her husband sold their Visa stock. They had a lot of Visa stock, one day before Visa, it was announced that Visa is being sued by the Department of Justice. Think of that. Nancy Pelosi sold vast amounts of Visa stock one day before the big lawsuit that we all read about a few days ago, was brought against Visa. You think it was luck? … Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. The Post cited financial disclosures which show that Pelosi’s husband, Paul, “unloaded 2,000 shares of Visa stock worth between $500,000 and $1 million on July 1,” noting that on Tuesday, “less than three months after the massive transaction, Visa was hit with a DOJ lawsuit alleging that the company illegally monopolized the debit card market.” Schweizer and the late Andrew Breitbart worked to ban members of Congress from using nonpublic information to their own profit via the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act, Breitbart News reported in March 2012. “The STOCK Act will make it illegal for members of Congress and their staffs to use material, nonpublic information to inform their private investments and will impose more rigorous public disclosure requirements on all trades by lawmakers,” the article said. In March 2024 Breitbart News reported that research showing politicians made trades worth over $1 billion in 2023 bolstered a campaign to ban members of Congress from stock trading. “‘Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,’ a spokesperson for Nancy told The Post earlier this week,” the outlet reported.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump took a firm stance on Thursday against Rep.

Clara Jeffery was told to “get a grip” by Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen, after posting a critical comment on X, alleging the salutation was evidence of “creeping Christian nationalism” in the United States. Jeffery then listed off alternative adjectives for the Alaska Air flight attendant “that would have sufficed,” including “great, awesome, fabulous, amazing, fantastic.” “As my rowmate said, ‘this ain’t Montgomery, sweetie,'” the leftie editor added in the late Friday post. “How sad and impoverished is your life that you’re offended by someone blessing you?” asked Thiessen before telling her to “get a grip.” The post was quickly shared, generating more than three million views on X within hours. A campaign fundraiser for Vice President Kamala Harris also chimed in. “Respectfully, I’m a pretty left-leaning guy and I wish folks a blessed day fairly often,” offered Armand Domalewski. “It’s just a nice thing to say.” Jeffrey countered, saying, “It’s a matter of respect for the audience before you. Respecting their space and norms and wishes. Dominant cultures always feel they have a right to enforce their norms and intents. And…way off @AlaskaAir’s brand.” Domalewski told her that, “As a practicing Catholic, I don’t feel like being publicly Christian is really the dominant culture here in SF lol.” The Blaze’s Jessica O’Donnell called Jeffrey out for having “issues greater than a flight attendant’s well wishes.” Jonah Goldberg, The Dispatch’s editor-in-chief and an L.A. Times columnist, commented, “This is a bizarre and pretty indefensible overreaction.” By late Saturday, the post had generated more than 20,000 comments, with just 2,400 “likes.” The Washington Examiner’s Kimberly Ross also took issue with the post. “This is not ‘creeping Christian nationalism,'” wrote Ross. “This is someone showing kindness to others. It’s not offensive. It’s not a demand for religious conversion. The issue here is you processed it as a problem that requires a public complaint while tagging the airline.

There has been reporting from Ecuador to Spain about how migrants will react to the November contest. Trump has been much tougher and outspoke about how he wants to secure the U.S.-Mexico border while Vice President Kamala Harris has just recently proposed support for the wall after previously calling it anti-American. ‘Migrants see risks with Trump’s return’ one Mexican article published September 20 was titled. Another referenced Ecuadorian migrants’ desire to see Vice President Kamala Harris win, who they describe as making them feel more ‘reassured’ they could stay in the U.S. longer. The Mexican outlet El Imparcial wrote: ‘A potential victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the race for the presidency of the United States would toughen immigration procedures, said the specialist in Immigration Law and International Law, Josefina Orozco.’ ‘Immigrants who are in the United States with a status that could lead to their deportation’ may then become ‘vulnerable,’ it continued. Harris has supported positions like ignoring deportation requirements and has been against, what she has called, the ‘un-American’ U.S.-Mexico wall. However, during a trip to the border in Arizona Friday the Democratic presidential candidate vowed to spend millions on the barrier if elected. Still, Harris and Biden have overseen the largest influx of illegal immigration in years with some 10 million migrant encounters being expected later this year according to the House Homeland Security Committee. Spanish outlet Diario Publico reported over the summer in Tijuana, Mexico, that migrants there were concerned that Trump would end the Biden-Harris administration’s migrant screening phone app – CBP One – that can help facilitate flights into the U.S. The app has been helpful in facilitating tens of thousands of migrants into the U.S. At times 30,000 migrants a month have been allowed to fly into the U.S. from select countries using the app. ‘Concern grows among migrants on the US-Mexico border over a possible Trump victory,’ the report said. Ecuadorian agency La Republica, wrote on September 1 individuals ‘stranded at the border with the United States and Mexico’ and those migrants who have made it into the U.S. are worried ‘that their trip will be cut short,’ under Trump’s policies. They reported these migrants inside and heading toward the U.S. ‘feel ‘reassured’ that with Harris they could stay in the country a little longer than under the new Trump administration, which ordered the deportation of a million migrants as soon as he steps into the White House.’ Additionally, a July report from the Associated Press uncovered that migrants in Mexico wanting to illegally cross into the U.S. wanted to get there before the election. The sprint was on for these migrants ‘for fear that the border would be closed in the event of a Trump victory,’ it said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNews dispatches from Latin America indicate that migrants who hope to cross&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Migrant Support for Kamala Harris Over Donald Trump Alleged in Latin American Reports first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/migrant-support-for-kamala-harris-over-donald-trump-alleged-in-latin-american-reports/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Migrants-want-Kamala-Harris-to-beat-Donald.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:02:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019},{"id":257779484,"title":"Alanis Morissette and Halle Bailey Set to Perform at Kamala Harris’ Los Angeles Fundraising Event","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Alanis Morissette and Halle Bailey are scheduled to perform at Kamala Harris‘ fundraiser in Los Angeles on Sunday.

JD Vance (R-OH), told Breitbart News. Internal polling from the Teamsters shows that he is dominating the presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris among the rank-and-file members. Nearly 60 percent of Teamsters sampled in a September 9-15 poll support Trump, while a mere 31 percent back Harris. Moreover, Trump leads Harris with Teamsters members in every single state. “It’s no wonder that rank-and-file Teamsters support President Trump – they simply reject Kamala Harris’s policies of crippling inflation, high gas and electricity prices, millions of illegal immigrants coming into our country, and fewer jobs for American workers,” Martin told Breitbart News in a statement. “Pennsylvania suffered the nation’s highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate at 8.2 percent, and Harris’s EV mandates and pro-China trade policies are undercutting workers across the country,” he added. Martin said that Teamsters will vote for Trump in spades because American workers were better off during the first Trump adminsitration than they are now. “American workers were safer and better off when President Trump was in office – rank-and-file workers know it, and that is why they will ignore their union bosses and will vote for the Trump-Vance ticket on November 5,” he said. The Teamsters have opted not to officially endorse a candidate in the race, marking the first time they have not supported a Democrat candidate for president since 1996. This is a major blow to Harris. That year, the union did not endorse anyone, with former President Bill Clinton missing out due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Clinton had their support in 1992. However, this year’s non-endorsement is more reminiscent of 1988, when they rejected Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. The endorsement instead went to Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush, who would win 41 states in the general election.","summary":"Rank-and-file Teamsters know that \"American workers were safer and better off\" under former President Donald Trump's administration, William Martin, a spokesman for Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen.

Al Sharpton urges Gov. Hochul not to remove Mayor Adams from office ahead of trial","text":"Rev. Al Sharpton urged Gov. Kathy Hochul Saturday to refrain from using her authority to remove Mayor Eric Adams from office — arguing that such a move would have “no precedent,” days after the governor said she is mulling her “options and obligations” in relation to the mayor’s indictment. Sharpton’s remarks are something of a shift in his recent public tenor on Adams, whose political future has grown more tenuous after the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan unsealed a five-count indictment this week, charging the mayor with bribery and fraud charges. Until Saturday morning he had been relatively quiet in his support for the mayor, whom he has vocally backed in the past as an influential ally. As one of the city's most influential Black leaders, Sharpton's words echoed from City Hall to Albany. “The governor should not be pressured into removing Eric Adams from being the mayor,” Sharpton said on Saturday during his regularly scheduled National Action Network rally. The governor has the power — under the city charter and state law — to remove the mayor, and following the charges against Adams, Hochul said she was weighing all of her options. A spokesperson for Hochul did not immediately return a request for comment. “There is no precedent for that,” Sharpton continued. “We just had a U.S. senator, Menendez, indicted. They found gold bars in his house, Mercedes Benz … He was not forced to resign until he was convicted.” The rarely used gubernatorial authority was invoked by former Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt against Mayor Jimmy Walker, who was also being investigated over corruption allegations, but Walker resigned in 1932 before Roosevelt exercised his power to remove him. Adams’ defiant approach in claiming his innocence has not sat well with some, particularly those taking issue with the mayor’s claims that he is a “target” — and his apparent suggestion, without evidence, that his communications with the federal government on the migrant crisis are to blame. Sharpton on Saturday said he did not believe the Biden administration had targeted Adams, and cautioned anyone against using such rhetoric. Sharpton told the New York Times on Thursday, the day charges were unsealed against the mayor, that he would be convening a meeting of Black leaders to discuss the situation in the coming days but acknowledged the delicate nature of the circumstances. “Does that hurt Vice President Kamala Harris? The head of the Southern District is a Black man that we work with,” Sharpton told the Times. “There’s complexities in this.” But Sharpton had taken a more decisive step toward Adams’ defense by Saturday morning. \"We're going to see where the evidence is, but we are not going to stand by silently and let Governor Hochul not know that some of us are saying: ‘Do not change the process and the precedent,’” Sharpton said. “Let due process take its course.” Sharpton was flanked by civil rights legend Rev. Herbert Daughtry who also appeared with Adams the day he was charged. While insisting Adams be allowed due process, he did briefly raise a question about the leadership ability of City Hall officials who have been buffeted by federal and state investigations. Sharpton joked during his Saturday remarks that former President Donald Trump did Adams no favors when the Republican candidate voiced his support for the mayor this week. “I do not want this to get into a contest that helps [former President Donald] Trump,” Sharpton said. “If I was facing a federal trial, the last person I want to speak up for me is somebody convicted of 34 felonies.”","summary":"A file photo of Mayor Eric Adams, Rev.
