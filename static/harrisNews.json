Jon Ossoff and Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, who voted against legislation to bar biological males from women’s sports earlier this year, are backing the Equality Act, a bill that would make “gender identity” a protected class under federal anti-discrimination law. The candidates’ decision to support the far-reaching legislation comes as Republicans accuse the two lawmakers of catering to left-wing gender ideology that is at odds with their own voters. (RELATED: It Appears Democrats Have Finally Picked A Hill To Die On)\n\nNearly 70% of Democrats or participants who “lean Democrat” oppose biological males participating in women’s sports, according to a New York Times survey conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.\n\nOssoff, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking reelection, is currently running unopposed in Georgia’s Democratic primary. Stevens entered a contested Democratic primary field in April to vie for an open Michigan Senate seat following Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters’ decision to not seek reelection.\n\nIn Georgia, 73% of voters told a pollster in January they would support the state government banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation, dubbed the Riley Gaines Act, to protect women’s sports in April.\n\nDespite a majority of voters appearing to reject the Democratic Party’s stance on transgender issues, Ossoff and Stevens appear to be toeing the party line.\n\nOssoff and Stevens are among the 47 Senate Democrats and 214 House Democrats supporting the latest rollout of the Equality Act, which congressional Democrats introduced for the fifth time on April 29. The legislation passed the House in May 2019 and February 2021 under the leadership of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but did not clear the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” The legislation would force schools to open female-only spaces to biological males who identify as transgender girls, including sports teams, according to analysis from the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“As Republicans across the country continue their assault on LGBTQ+ Americans – particularly the trans community – the fight against bigotry and discrimination remains as urgent as ever,” Pelosi said in a April 29 statement marking the Equality Act’s reintroduction.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are seen as top pick-up opportunities for Senate Republicans during the midterms. Early analysis from the Cook Political Report rates both contests as “toss-ups.”\n\nTrump bested former Vice President Kamala Harris in both swing states in November.\n\nStevens called on Congress to take up the Equality Act again in February two months prior to her Senate campaign announcement.\n\n“As a member of the @EqualityCaucus, I’m celebrating 4 years since we last passed the Equality Act — the 119th Congress needs to bring it to a vote, it must become law,” Stevens wrote in a post on X.\n\nStevens also slammed legislation seeking to bar transgender athletes from women’s sports during a speech on the House floor in April 2023, characterizing the bill as “hateful.”\n\nFormer Republican Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who is viewed as the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, criticized Stevens for repeatedly failing to protect women’s sports and female-only spaces.\n\n“Michiganders see Haley Stevens’ In-Equality Act for what it is: the radical left’s latest scheme to force boys into girls’ bathrooms and sports teams,” Rogers campaign spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Meanwhile, Mike Rogers and President Trump are fighting to defend girls’ safety, privacy, and opportunity. Protecting girls’ sports and spaces is not only fair, it’s common sense.”\n\nOssoff, who ran on passing the Equality Act into law during his successful 2020 Senate campaign, has continued to oppose efforts to restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.\n\nThe senator joined Senate Democrats in filibustering Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in March despite pressure from Georgia Republicans to support the bill.\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, the first Republican candidate to jump into Georgia’s 2026 GOP primary following Kemp’s decision to pass on a run, came out swinging against Ossoff’s left-wing positions on transgender issues in his campaign announcement video.\n\n“Last November Georgia spoke, but Jon Ossoff doesn’t care,” the video’s narrator states. “He fought against President Trump securing our border and voted for men in girls sports. Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side.”\n\nSenate Leadership Fund, a Senate Majority Leader John Thune-aligned super PAC, has also targeted Ossoff for his votes against legislation to protect women’s sports. SLF’s issue advocacy arm, One Nation, ran a seven-figure ad buy to highlight Ossoff’s left-wing stance on women’s sports in April. The ad aired during several high-profile sports events, including the Masters tournament and the Final Four college men and women’s basketball games.\n\n“Man-to-man defense isn’t woke enough for Ossoff. He’s for they/them,” the ad’s narrator says while a man purporting to be Ossoff dunks over a female basketball player.\n\nSpokespeople for Ossoff and Stevens did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The administration said it was threatening to garnish wages even as borrowers and advocates expressed concerns about the ripple effect of a new financial obligation weighing down on Americans already grappling with Trump’s tariffs.\n\nThe decision was just one of many in which Team Trump has targeted current and former college attendees, along with the schools themselves.\n\nTrump has authorized law enforcement agencies to abduct and detain college students expressing opinions he disagrees with. He has also cut federal funding for schools like Harvard and Columbia University and affiliated institutions while pressuring them to get rid of diversity programs and admissions, and he has pressured schools to exclude transgender athletes.\n\nRelated | Trump holds federal funding hostage as war on Harvard escalates\n\nColleges are also set to be punished as part of the administration’s plan to destroy the entire Department of Education, which has existed in America since 1980.\n\nAmerica doesn’t like Trump’s posture toward college and universities.\n\nAn Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released on Friday found that 56% of those surveyed disapproved of Trump’s actions on higher education. Majorities of those surveyed said colleges are a positive for medical and scientific research and as a source of new ideas and technological innovation. Additionally, pluralities said colleges are a positive for the U.S. workforce and for defense and military research.\n\nTrump isn’t alone in his disdain for college and making it accessible to everyone. Republicans in Congress fought against efforts by the Biden administration to relieve student debt, and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court significantly scaled back Biden’s relief program.\n\nMajor Republican donor and multimillionaire Peter Thiel even set up a fund to pay students not to attend or to drop out of college.\n\nWhy is conservatism so dead set against colleges and universities despite the public’s position?\n\nThe right-wing movement has long seen college as a source of left-wing indoctrination. Conservatives have forwarded the notion that previously apolitical students are somehow brainwashed when they go off to college, returning to their families as left-wing radicals.\n\nThis is of course, absurd, because if this were truly the case few people who attend college would become conservatives or Republicans—but millions of people who vote for the Republican Party are also college attendees or graduates.\n\nConservatives are so concerned about this purported brainwashing that they have created groups like Turning Point USA, conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s college activism group. The right has also created entire colleges devoted to cranking out right-wing thinkers at institutions like Hillsdale College.\n\nWhat is really going on isn’t indoctrination, but a failure of conservatism to win the war of ideas. And as is so often the case with the right, when they can’t win a fair fight, they try to rig the system from the inside. Republicans fail to enlist those who go through a college education to their side of the aisle, so they undermine student loan programs, try to bully colleges, and even attempt to turn college sports into another casualty of the bigoted “culture war.”\n\nEven when Republicans decisively win an election this is a battle they overwhelmingly lose. In the 2024 election Vice President Kamala Harris lost the popular vote and the electoral college, but among college graduates she crushed Trump 56% to 42%. Among voters of color with a college degree she won by even more, 65% to 32%.\n\nTrump infamously said in 2016 “I love the poorly educated,” because it was the voter demographic most inclined to support him. And despite his policies negatively affecting this group, he has continued to garner their support while blaming colleges for all manner of negative things. It is a useful boogeyman for demagogues like Trump, even though college for most is a positive experience that opens their minds to different perspectives.\n\nRepublicans are using their power to bend colleges to their whims, and unfortunately in some instances these schools have given in to Trump—only to be pushed to give him more control and power. The right wants to break the will of schools, which they believe will eventually lead to more Republican votes.\n\nComplex issues like taxes and tariffs and climate science require an educated populace to make informed decisions not only for themselves but for future generations. The right perceives a college education as another target they must attack and conquer. That’s why Trump is fighting so hard to destroy them and tear down some of the brightest lights in American education.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nThis past week, the Trump administration continued to squeeze middle-class families with its decision to restart the process of collecting on student loans that had been paused during the pandemic.

The ladies of The View — part of ABC News, which is run by Kamala's best friend — lauded Joe as a conquering hero.\n\nYes, this reanimated corpse, who seemed to recognize only two of his five gushing hosts, who needed direction to sit in the lone empty chair waiting for him, and was caked in about five layers of flesh-toned make-up — fielded this tough question, from co-host Sara Haines, right off the bat:\n\n'Mr. President… you had made the selfless and very difficult decision, I'm sure, to step aside.'\n\nHaines — and her producers, and ABC News execs — have clearly memory-holed George Stephanopoulos, of ABC News, interviewing Biden in the wake of that disastrous TV debate, asking the president repeatedly if he really thought he could, and should, continue running?\n\nTo which Biden retorted that only 'the Lord Almighty' could convince him to do the right thing — and guess what?\n\n'The Lord Almighty's not coming down,' Joe said.\n\nOkay. So the mainstream media, the Democratic Party and the Bidens themselves still refuse to take the memo.\n\nThey remain defiant in their beliefs that Joe Biden was an incredible president, that there were zero cover-ups about his declining faculties, and that he and Dr. Jill — the wife-slash-nursemaid who, of course, joined him for this interview — remain party leaders who should be heard and seen as much as possible.\n\nThe delusion is astounding.\n\nBiden was essentially fired by his party and country. Top elected officials and operatives have been telling the media, for months now, that the Bidens need to slink off into oblivion.\n\nJust week ago, former loyalists expressed anger and disgust that the Bidens still want to stump and fundraise.\n\nOne former senior Biden official put it best: 'Their irresponsibility, family ego and selfishness put the Democratic Party in this position… the disconnected reality that they and their ineffective little circle live in is responsible for the Trump sequel and the wilderness the Democratic Party finds itself in today.'\n\nIneffective little circle. Brutal.\n\nYet here was Dr. Jill, bragging that she'd been busy flying to 'LA, New York and DC' as if she's still a vested power broker.\n\nPerhaps her delusion is somewhat understandable — after all, these two are reportedly on the verge of signing a $30 million joint book deal for their White House memoirs.\n\nAny publisher willing to sign such a deal is a moron.\n\nIf this interview is anything to go by — and, really, it's everything to go by — get ready for two tomes of epic self-regard, self-love and self-sacrifice, all bound up like some political fairytale that touts Biden as one of the greatest presidents of all time.\n\nThroughout will doubtless be bitter jousts toward Barack and Michelle, and their joint post-presidential book deal for $65 million — six times what the Bidens are worth.\n\nYou just know that Dr. Jill is looking at Michelle not with pity — which is what she deserves — but envy.\n\nEnvy for the multiple book deals, the Netflix shows, the podcasts, the four lavish estates, and children who aren't reprobates, drug addicts in trouble with the law or $15 million in debt, as Hunter Biden is.\n\nYes, Lady MacBiden — a nickname she says has been hurtful, but hey, if the shoe fits — surely sees dollar signs and brand deals in her near future.\n\nBack to this interview, which is truly outer limits: Biden says Kamala lost because America is 'sexist', even though her campaign was 'successful' and 'consistent'.\n\nThe only thing Kamala consistently did successfully was spew garbage word salad, refuse to offer specifics, and go on The View, where she was asked by co-host Sunny Hostin if she would have done anything differently from President Biden.\n\nKamala: 'There is not a thing that comes to mind'.\n\nThose two idiots, in the span of a few seconds, handed Trump one of his most effective campaign ads. And speaking of Trump, Biden was asked, in this interview, what he thinks of his successor's first 100 days.\n\nBiden, ever on brand, said that like every former living president, the protocol is never to criticize a sitting president — and then proceeded to do just that.\n\n'I think he's done a very poor job,' said Biden — who ordered, against all best military advice, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost 13 US service members their lives.\n\nSaid the president who worked just a few hours each day, who fell asleep in meetings and wandered off stages worldwide, whose cognitive decline and the resulting cover-up has been told in multiple news accounts and now a spate of books.\n\nA president who was so unreachable, so shielded from the press and fellow politicians, that Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said his multiple requests to meet with Biden had been summarily denied.\n\n'If the Speaker of the House can't meet with the president of the United States, that's a problem,' Johnson said in February 2024, four months before that debate.

Lies told by a sympathetic mainstream media that had spent years covering up for Biden's impairments, neglecting to report that a neurologist — a Parkinson's expert — had been called to the White House eight times in eight months.\n\n'I did not create a cocoon around him,' Jill said on The View.\n\nThe gall. Multiple sources maintain the contrary.\n\nDr. Jill also had the temerity to insist that all was well in the Biden White House, that everyone saw Joe working around the clock, day and night, all four years.\n\n'It was non-stop,' she said, her husband nodding off next to her. 'Being president is not, like, a job. It's a lifestyle. It's a life that you live… it's constant. You never leave it'.\n\nWell, Joe and Jill — really, Jill — the job has left you.

However, Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats pushing back on the current administration.The New York Democrat has been traveling around the country with progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as part of his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. The rallies consistently draw thousands of attendees, including in red districts and states.Many political analysts have started touting Ocasio-Cortez as a strong contender for the party's 2028 presidential nomination. Separately, some party activists have urged her to primary Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in 2028 instead.What to KnowLawler appeared as a panelist on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher on Friday. In the show's \"Overtime\" segment, the New York Republican said Ocasio-Cortez would easily defeat Schumer in a primary challenge.\"AOC will absolutely kick his a** in a primary,\" Lawler said, noting that the New York senator has held elected office for 50 years. He went on to describe the congresswoman as the \"leader of the Democratic Party in this moment.\"He predicted that she will \"continue to be the biggest driver of where the party goes from a governmental policy standpoint, and that drives many of my colleagues crazy.\"\"The fact is, she has tapped into the base of support within the Democratic Party, and you see the juxtaposition between her and Chuck Schumer,\" he said.Democrats' Criticism of Chuck SchumerSchumer's support for moving forward with a Republican Trump-backed stopgap funding bill in mid-March drew widespread Democratic criticism, including from his longtime ally, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.The top Senate Democrat's support for the bill moving forward, in which he was joined by nine other members of the chamber's Democratic Caucus, prevented a government shutdown, but was seen by many in his party as a betrayal. Democrats saw the pending shutdown as a point of leverage against Trump and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.Schumer said at the time that his support would prevent worse damage to the federal government from Trump and billionaire Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) adviser Elon Musk. Schumer said a shutdown would allow them to ramp up their efforts to make cuts across federal agencies.Will AOC Run in 2028?Some recent polls have shown Ocasio-Cortez in second place for the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential nomination after former Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's unsuccessful 2024 contender. A survey by Quantus Insights carried out among 1,000 registered voters from April 21 to 23 showed Harris with 30 percent support and Ocasio-Cortez in second place at 14 percent.The New York Democrat was asked about her 2028 plans by Fox News last month. She responded by saying her current focus is not about politics.\"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important,\" she said.What People Are SayingDemocratic operative Charlotte Clymer to Newsweek in March about the party's failure to pushback on Trump: \"This is not a problem of our party; it's a problem of our party leadership. There is so much outstanding potential in the Democratic Party. What we need is fresh leadership.\"Patricia Crouse, political scientist in residence at the University of New Haven, to Newsweek last month: \"I think people see her [AOC] as the face of the Democratic Party right now because she seems to be the only one (along with Sanders) willing to stand up for the party and stand against Trump... But many within the party, both members and voters, view her as too progressive or even extreme left.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Latino USA podcast in February: \"I have a weird relationship with the Democratic Party. I don't believe in a two-party system, but I also understand the Democratic Party is a coalition and if we want the party to change, the balance of the coalition has to change.

It's called the one big beautiful bill,' Trump promised at a rally in April.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are now deliberating over how to make good on that promise, and they must find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the income lost due to the tax cuts. \n\nHowever, negotiations over just how much to cut and where are proving tricky as Medicaid is popular in many GOP-controlled districts, potentially exposing the lawmakers to challenges in the midterms next year. \n\nAttacking the government health program that provides healthcare for close to 80 million Americans, about 25 percent of the U.S. population, including children, the elderly and the sick, has been an unpopular position for any lawmakers. \n\nUnderstanding that slashing a program that provides practically free healthcare is politically perilous for his party heading into the midterms, the president has remained opaque about what may happen. \n\n'We want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, our pregnant women, the poor and disabled,' he told a rally in Michigan last week. He also said in February that the program 'isn't going to be touched.' \n\nDonald Trump has waffled on Medicaid cuts as Congress wrangles with how much of the subsidized healthcare program they want to slash as they search for savings to make good on the president's promise of sweeping tax cuts \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (L) and Trump have been in near constant contact as the House leader works to craft the president's massive, multi-trillion dollar legislative agenda\n\nCare advocates attend 24-hour vigil at U.S. Capitol to share stories and urge lawmakers to protect Medicaid on May 07, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe program costs about $880 billion annually, as each enrollee spends a median $7,000 to $9,000, according to Medicaid data. \n\nRepublicans must find $880 billion in cuts over 10 years to finance the tax cuts this year. That $88 billion in savings annually will come, in part, from Medicaid reform, party leadership has said. \n\nAnd though some in the GOP see the program as a piggy bank to pull from, others are warning the situation is much more treacherous. \n\nLeaving Washington on Thursday after the last votes of the week, GOP lawmakers were perplexed on how to appropriately filet the program to every member's liking. \n\n'There's a lot, there's 20 plus issues, I think, that are still major variables on whether any of this can come together,' Conservative House Freedom Caucus (HFC) member Chip Roy told reporters on Thursday.\n\nHe and other conservatives are pushing to reform the program and whittle down how many individuals can enroll in the subsidized healthcare. \n\nRequiring Medicaid recipients to work to receive benefits and cutting the amount of federal dollars flowing to the program are on the table for the GOP. \n\n'Work Requirements are important,' Roy told reporters. 'You shouldn't be having the people who should work, can work, getting benefits without working.'\n\nGOP members differ on how much Medicaid shut be slashed. Roy, a conservative House Freedom Caucus member is advocating for deep cuts while Bacon, who was elected in a district Kamala Harris won, has expressed doubts over major reform to the program\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., speaks at a Medicaid rally in front of the Capitol. Democrats have been fighting back against GOP reforms\n\nDoctors do an ultrasound on a pregnant woman during a pop-up health clinic in Alabama last year. The pop-up was sponsored by a state program, which receives federal funding\n\n'You shouldn't have the ineligible getting benefits if they're, in fact, ineligible,' the Texas Republican continued, adding the reforms need to be 'transformative' to root out those 'gaming' the system. \n\nThough cuts are also majorly unpopular for some in the party, too. \n\n'I'll hopefully get to talk to leadership about it a little later,' House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told reporters on Wednesday after a private meeting with Democrats on what portions of Medicaid to cut. 'So we'll see.'\n\nCentrist Republican Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said after the meeting that if Republicans vote on a bill that reforms federal financing of state Medicaid programs, they might not succeed. \n\n'I don't think these measures will pass the House, let alone the Senate,' he said about the current proposal. \n\nDemocrats see the GOP's Medicaid cuts as risky too. \n\nTrump poses with Mehmet Oz after being sworn-in as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Oval Office of the White House, April 18, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\n\nDOGE goes after Medicare and Medicaid as Elon Musk calls it source of 'big money fraud'\n\n'You see the fight playing out right there because people understand Medicaid is extremely popular,' progressive caucus leader Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told reporters on Thursday. \n\nShe noted how the program 'covers nursing home care, covers births, including a significant portion of births in Mike Johnson's home state of Louisiana.' \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has said repeatedly that Medicaid reform is a critical component of the 'big, beautiful bill,' though the question of how much is seemingly dividing his narrow majority. \n\nWhenever Johnson and Republicans finalize their work on the trillion dollar legislative package they will only be able to lose a handful of votes to advance the bill to the Senate. \n\nCurrently, the GOP majority is 220 - 213, which means they can only lose three votes and still have Trump's agenda pass. \n\n'As far as Medicaid goes, when you have six out of 10 individuals on Medicaid, able bodied and not working, there's got to be some reforms,' HFAC member Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., told the Daily Mail. \n\n'It's intended for, you know, at risk children, single moms, the at risk population. So get your butt to work and contribute to the process.'\n\nWhen asked about the appetite for major cuts with narrow margins in the House, Ogles admitted he would personally want to make even deeper cuts to Medicaid.\n\n'But obviously we've got a slim majority,' he added. \n\nPoliticsRepublicansDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nThe issue that could tear Trump's base apart... and why the president hasn't made up his mind\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Republicans are viciously fighting over how dramatically they should cut Medicaid in Donald Trump 's 'big, beautiful bill' as they are trying to provide the tax cuts the president promised.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14695783/trump-decision-medicaid-divide-maga-voters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/09/18/98224247-0-image-m-43_1746812984886.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/18/8888645641725627653/1024x576_MP4_8888645641725627653.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-10 19:49:32","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.055},{"id":320003218,"title":"Brazile on Biden Blaming Bigotry for Harris Loss: We Elected Obama Twice, I'm 'Proud' of U.S.","text":"On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” ABC News Contributor and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile responded to former President Joe Biden blaming Kamala Harris’ defeat in the 2024 race on racism and sexism by saying that while “America may have problems with race,” the country did elect Barack Obama twice and she’s “proud” to live in a country that did so.\n\nBrazile said, “Kamala Harris, there were many reasons for her defeat, but I think among the first was the fact that the six or seven million Americans who voted for Biden-Harris in 2020 did not come out because they didn’t feel that the administration was doing enough.

She voted to impeach Trump, along with nine other House Republicans, afterward.The prominent Republican, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, endorsed and campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Trump has frequently slammed Cheney as a result of her opposition, even saying she should be jailed.What to KnowPope Leo XIV was officially elected by the Conclave of Cardinals at the Vatican on Thursday. The new pope, formerly known as Cardinal Robert Prevost, is the first U.S. citizen to be elected to be the head of the Catholic Church.Cheney offered her praise of the new pope on X, while using the post to rebuke Trump as well.\"In an era that looked as if it might be defined by an American man of depraved cruelty, corruption, and shame, what a magnificent thing the Catholic Church has done. The elevation of an American man of goodness, grace, humility, mercy, and faith to the Throne of St. Peter is moving and momentous for us all,\" she wrote.Liz Cheney's Opposition to Donald TrumpWhile Cheney was largely aligned and supportive of Trump throughout his first term, she turned against him in the wake of his 2020 election defeat as he promoted unfounded claims that the results were \"rigged\" due to widespread voter fraud.On January 6, 2021, hundreds of Trump's supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol, believing, as the president claimed, that the election was stolen. While the riot temporarily delayed the 2020 election's formal certification, Joe Biden was inevitably confirmed as the winner in a joint session of Congress.During his first term, Trump was impeached on January 13, 2021, by the House, with Cheney backing the effort. The Senate ultimately acquitted Trump, falling short of the two-thirds majority required for a conviction. However, a majority of senators, including five Republicans, voted to convict, with the final tally 57-43.Cheney went on to be one of two Republicans who served on the House select committee that carried out an investigation of the events of January 6, as well as Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In response, Trump backed a primary challenger, to whom Cheney lost in the 2022 midterms.The president previously said Cheney should be jailed for her stand against him. He has threatened to target her and others involved with the January 6 investigation, but former President Biden issued a preemptive pardon for her and the other involved lawmakers right before leaving office in January.\"We have been pardoned today not for breaking the law but for upholding it,\" Cheney said in a joint statement with other January 6 committee members after she was pardoned.New Pope Appears to Be at Odds With Trump AdminAs a cardinal, Leo XIV maintained an X account that sometimes reshared content critical of Trump administration policies.In April, he reposted a commentary that criticized a Trump meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele about deportation logistics.Prior to that, in February, Leo XIV reposted an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"The article, an opinion piece from the National Catholic Reporter, focused on a comment the vice president made during a Fox News interview on January 29.At the time, Vance said: \"There's this old school—and I think it's a very Christian concept, by the way—that you love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens and your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"Pope Leo XIV's brother, John Prevost, told The New York Times that he is \"not happy with what's going on with immigration.\"Describing his brother, Prevost told the Times: \"The best way I could describe him right now is that he will be following in Francis' footsteps. They were very good friends. They knew each other before he was pope, before my brother even was bishop.\"Pope Francis clashed with Trump and Vance, particularly over immigration.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump's response to new pope's election on Truth Social on Thursday: \"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\"Trump to NBC News' Meet the Press in December on Cheney and the other January 6 committee members: \"Honestly, they should go to jail.\"Vice President JD Vance's response to new pope's election on X: \"Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election! I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!\"What Happens Next?Cheney continues to appear as a speaker at various events, sharing her views on Trump and other political issues.

However, you can only participate if you vote for one of the two candidates nominated by the Alumni Fellow Nominating Committee, a group of university officials and graduates. There’s no way to write in a name or, if you don’t favor either candidate, to cast a blank ballot. You must vote for one of the insiders’ choices or not vote at all.\n\nNow Yale is a private institution, and no one is obliged to have anything to do with it (except perhaps the governor and lieutenant governor of Connecticut, who are ex officio members of the corporation). However, the Yale example has a certain similarity to the way governmental elites restrict the choice of voters in European nations, even while deeming themselves guardians of “democracy.”\n\nOn March 11, Romania’s constitutional court removed presidential candidate Calin Georgescu, who finished first in the first round of voting last year, from the May 4 runoff ballot. It was alleged that he benefited from TikTok accounts paid for by Russia and that he “violated the very obligation to defend democracy.”\n\nOn March 30, a court in Paris convicted National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen of embezzling European Union funds and barred her from running for office for five years. She finished second, with 41% of the vote, in the 2022 presidential election and was leading in the polls for the 2027 contest, which incumbent Emmanuel Macron is constitutionally barred from running in.\n\nOn May 2, Germany’s Verfassungsschutz (Office for the Protection of the Constitution) designated the Alternative for Germany party as a right-wing extremist group, which could lead to it being banned from participating in elections. The AfD finished second in the Feb. 23 election, with 21% of popular votes, behind the Christian Democrats’ 29%.\n\nThe excuse for excluding Georgescu, Le Pen and the AfD from the political process is that they threatened to shut down democracy. Which brings to mind the communist playwright Bertolt Brecht’s comment in 1953 when his fellow East Germans rioted and demanded a new government.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?” he asked.\n\nIt brings to mind Vice President JD Vance’s Feb. 14 speech at the Munich Security Forum, which shocked many European elites.\n\n“I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns, or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy,” he said.\n\nGerman elites would ask you to understand that their nation’s history imposes special burdens. The postwar Bundesrepublik banned publication of Nazi propaganda and Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” for obvious reasons—measures forbidden by our First Amendment.\n\nThe AfD has had some unsavory leaders and spokespeople, and it’s unfortunate that Vance met with its leader in Munich, just as it’s unfortunate that former Chancellor Olaf Scholz endorsed former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nHowever, there’s no serious argument that Georgescu or Le Pen or the AfD wants a second Holocaust. Their support comes from opposition to mass immigration.\n\nVance referenced this in Munich.\n\n“No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,” he said to no applause. “And more and more, all over Europe, they’re voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out-of-control migration.”\n\nHowever, barring immigrants from coming into a country is not another Holocaust. It is not morally equivalent to slaughtering fellow citizens who are Jews, Roma, homosexual or mentally impaired.\n\nIt’s a puzzle why so many highly educated Europeans—and highly educated Americans—feel that limiting the number of immigrants entering their countries is morally akin to mass murder.\n\nThis seems less like generosity—a solicitude for people with unfamiliar cultural attitudes and behavior patterns—and more like snobbery: disdain for ordinary citizens who are uncomfortable with such people.\n\nThe itinerant author and photographer Chris Arnade said it would be easy for European elites “to simply change their policy positions on immigration—not dramatically even.”\n\n“We had to destroy the village in order to save it,” an American was supposed to have said during the Vietnam War.\n\nEuropean elites seem to have convinced themselves that they must destroy democracy in order to save it.\n\nHowever, this may not work. Last Sunday’s winner in Romania was a political ally of Georgescu; Marine Le Pen’s young deputy, Jordan Bardella, is polling nearly as well as she was; and Germany may yet hesitate to ban the AfD.\n\nWe have seen echoes of the European elites among some of their American counterparts, who sought to use kangaroo court verdicts and dubious constitutional arguments to bar President Donald Trump from the ballot and who seem to regard any attempt to enforce immigration laws as morally equivalent to genocide.\n\nNot all of the Trump administration’s immigration actions are, in my view, defensible. However, the cries that the United States is closing its gates to immigrants ignore the fact that it welcomes around 800,000 individuals to become American citizens every year.\n\nThe U.S. has never had a fully open-borders immigration policy. Even during the supposedly “give me your tired, your poor” Ellis Island period, immigrants had to be free of communicable disease and capable of supporting themselves economically. These standards were enforced mainly by the steamship companies, which had to ship back people rejected by immigration station inspectors.\n\nAmericans have also had a habit of assimilation and encouraging non-adversarial attitudes toward American institutions. Is it too much to hope that European elites, though shocked by Vance’s speech, might pay respectful attention to their own citizens rather than continue on the course set out by Brecht?\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within, some for pushing the party too far left, and others for appearing too conciliatory toward Trump.What To Know In a Friday segment of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedian echoed Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin's April call for Democrats to \"retake the flag,\" referencing prepared remarks the Michigan lawmaker was set to deliver, which were obtained by Politico.Maher said this idea of lack of patriotism and American identity \"is a serious problem for Democrats,\" citing polling that shows \"less than 1 in 4 Democrats under 30 say they are proud to be an American, 54 percent say they are embarrassed by it.\"A national poll of 2,098 adults ages 18 to 29, conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics from March 14 to 25, found that 76 percent of young Republicans said they are proud to be American, compared to 24 percent of Democrats. Just 8 percent of Republicans said they are embarrassed to be American, while 54 percent of Democrats expressed the same sentiment. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.21 percentage points.After citing the polling data, Maher acknowledged, \"Is America perfect? No, of course not.\" He went on to say that the United States is \"leagues ahead of the rest of the world on most of the progressive issues that are important to young people,\" citing statistics on women-owned businesses, same-sex marriage rights and more.He stated that the \"dilemma\" for Democrats, is that young members are backingthe \"wrong ones\" citing support for Hamas and the Houthis. He added that they are \"looking for love in all the wrong countries,\" rather than appreciating the U.S. His comments are largelyin reference to various pro-Palestinian protests across the country that have happened since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023.\"If the thoughtleaders in the Democratic Party keep encouraging and not rebuking the idea that America is cringe, and the people who run Gaza are great, the Democrats are doomed,\" Maher concluded.What People Are SayingFormer Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said on the FLAGRANT podcast that aired in April: \"I do think my party needs to do a much better job, especially with the kind of finger-wagging that you're talking about; I think we are like very prone to that.\"Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said in February: \"I think the Democrats' brand is really bad, and I think this was an election based on culture. And the Democrats' failure to connect on a cultural basis with a wide swath of Americans is hugely problematic. I think the majority of the party realizes that the ideological purity of some of the groups is a recipe for disaster and that, candidly, the attack on over-the-top wokeism was a valid attack.\"Former Democratic Ohio Representative Tim Ryan said in an MSNBC interview in late November 2024: \"Our brand is toxic in so many places, and it is like, 'you are a Democrat?' That's the stuff we get in Ohio. We need a complete reboot. We need a complete reboot with the DNC. We need a complete rebranding.\"Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, wrote in a statement in the wake of the 2024 election: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"What Happens Next?The 2026 midterm elections are expected to be a bellwether of the Trump administration and the Democratic Party.It's unclear who the party will eventually support in the 2028 presidential election, with some early polling showing former Vice President Kamala Harris leading the pack of potential presidential candidates, followed by New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Buttigieg.","summary":"The comedian says the lack of patriotism among young Democrats is a \"serious problem\" for the party.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bill-maher-issues-warning-about-serious-problem-democrats-2070543","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642321/bill-maher.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 15:50:48","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":319952264,"title":"It’s fascinating to watch Trump supporters realize they screwed up","text":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes. Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nToday we’ll look at how some of the people who helped elect President Donald Trump are rationalizing the trouble he’s caused them since taking office. \n\nFirst, this Facebook post from Derin, who lives in Missouri:\n\nHello Facebook friends. I want to clarify my position on some things. Yes, I am still a Republican. Yes, I am still against what the Biden-Harris administration was doing. Yes, I still do not support Kamala Harris. However, just because I disagree with the Democratic political position does not mean I have to agree with, what I am seeing from many news sources, what Donald Trump is doing to this country. I deeply regret voting for Donald Trump. I made my decision to vote for him based on my desire to keep Harris from becoming President and based on Trump's performance during his first term. He has changed and is not the same President we had during his first term. With what I am seeing, Americans, and I mean U.S.-natural-born citizens whose families have been in this nation for generations, need to be afraid. Trump is beginning to deport actual American citizens to torturous prisons in Venezuela just because they disagree with him. I have studied a little about the rise of Adolph Hitler in Nazi Germany and I am seeing the same thing with Trump. I personally believe Trump could be the Antichrist. He fits some of the traits of this \"man of sin.\" I am afraid we went from the frying pan into the fire and I don't know if there is anyway back from the flames.\n\nI won’t link to his (or anyone else’s) Facebook page in this article because I don’t want anyone harassing these people. That said, his page has become explicitly anti-Trump. In other posts, Derin wonders where the “2nd Amendment people” are as the administration espouses tyrannical beliefs. He approvingly reposted Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s criticisms of the arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan in Milwaukee. And he even posted a video titled “From a constitutional government to a dictator (a 2.5 minute history lesson).”\n\nBut even though he now thinks Trump is the Antichrist (and Derin appears to be a devout evangelical), he still wouldn’t have voted for Harris. And from what I can gather, that’s all because he hates the LGBTQ+ people and abortion—i.e., he’s the cliche of a God-and-guns conservative. \n\nIt’s a tough slog for Democrats if people would rather vote for the Antichrist than the candidate with the (D) next to their name. \n\nNext up is Stephanie, also on Facebook:\n\nI'll admit it—| voted last election after years of saying my vote wouldn't matter. Between the choices we were given, I chose Trump. And now... I regret it. My husband and I worked our whole lives, paid into the system like we were supposed to. Now we're both disabled, can't work, and we're struggling just to survive. Our home is paid off (thankfully), but we're behind on land taxes because they don't take payments. Our power bill is through the roof. We get SNAP, but now I'm reading Trump wants to ban processed foods and sugar on SNAP. If that happens, we won't even be able to afford food for the month. Let's be real-healthy, non-processed food costs more than what we get in benefits for the entire month. And on top of that, they're trying to force everyone to pay back student loans, while foreigners come here and get free education. Other countries help their citizens. We get punished for getting sick, for needing help, for trying to survive.\nSo did I make the wrong choice voting for Trump?\n\n100% yes. But looking at the other option... was there ever really a right one? #DisabledAndForgotten #PoorAndPunished\n\n#WeDeserveBetter #RegretMyVote\n\n#Struggling ToSurvive\n\nLet’s see: Vote for the party that vows to kill all programs to help the poor, or vote for the party that created, supports, and wants to expand those programs?\n\nIt’s apparently a tough call for Stephanie, even if she depends on those programs to survive. \n\nA teacher engages with two students in Carbondale, Illinois, in March 2015.\n\nOf course, “foreigners” aren’t coming to the U.S. for free education. In fact, they subsidize our university systems since they don’t qualify for in-state tuition. If she’s talking about K-12 schooling, yeah, that’s also not the main reason immigrants come to the U.S. Beyond that, even undocumented immigrants pay taxes while also generally being ineligible for government benefits, like food assistance and regular Medicaid. \n\nThat said, Stephanie does get one thing right: It’s true that “other countries help their citizens”! But why do they, Stephanie? Why? \n\nIt’s because they vote for the parties that want to help their citizens. So what was wrong with “the other option”? \n\nAnd in case you’re wondering, Stephanie does not appear to be evangelical, and she lives in upstate New York. She’s in a rural area, and we know that codes as conservative, but there’s no obvious reason why she should culturally stay that way. \n\nLet’s check on Kaylee in Pennsylvania, who posted on Facebook:\n\nI'm actually appalled that Trump is cutting funding for Early Childhood Education. Bucks IU Head Start was amazing for Tanner to prepare him for kindergarten. Please click the link and send a message to our senators and congressman. I'm genuinely starting to regret my vote if Trumps presidency affects my child's education and it's extremely upsetting that some teachers may lose their jobs without the Head Start Program.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s agenda for a second Trump administration, specifically called for the elimination of Head Start, an early childhood education program that primarily serves low-income families. \n\nBut once again, we see that conservatives are happy to vote for Republicans as long as it’s other people getting harmed. They get the vapors only when they themselves end up in the crosshairs. \n\nLucky for Kaylee—and the rest of America—the Trump administration seems to be backing off its threat to kill Head Start. For now.\n\nThis is a fun one: \n\nIt’s fun how we go from FUCK YEAH DONALD TRUMP SUCK IT LIBS to some amorphous “government” destroying his business and livelihood. \n\nAnyway, I do feel owned, so at least he has that going for him. \n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2.\n\nMeanwhile, over on this Reddit thread, a user is upset at getting slammed by tariffs. It’s fair— tariffs suck. They make things more expensive. As we’ve said over and over again, tariffs are a tax on American consumers—and Trump’s tariffs could be one of the largest tax increases ever. \n\nThis user posted his DHL receipt with the outrageous tariff-related fees itemized, and asked, “Is this correct? Why would I be charged so much?“\n\nWhen told it was because he voted for Trump—and his Reddit history makes clear he did—he angrily shot back, in a now-deleted comment, “I don't want to get political.”\n\nConservatives are happy to parade around with their stupid red hats, telling people “fuck your feelings,” but they sure are full of feels once they get hurt, imploring everyone around them to “not get political.” \n\nWell, bud, everything is political. And you chose wrong. Welcome to the hell that you helped build.\n\nOne more? Here’s Micayla, from Texas, on Facebook: \n\ni voted for trump because, morally, biden & kamala was the wrong choice. but if i'm being honest, the choices backed us into a corner where someone said \"QUICK! Choose one!\"\nI actually hate the government as a whole. I think RFK Jr is the only one worth anything in that entire administration. all that to say.... we have actual real problems in the world, and the Trump Administration is worried about PBS KIDS?!?! are you f--king kidding me? Something that was created to help children in poverty be able to be somewhat educated?? Where TF are all these promises that they made during campaigning season? Nah F Those right????? We gotta defund PBS kids!!\n\nIm so sad to see where our priorities lie. I can't believe my kids won't know PBS kids like I knew them. Mr. Rogers? Arthur? Zoobamafoo? Yall are whack as hell for this.\n\nIf i've said it once, I'll say it again.\n\nF THE GOVERNMENT, F THE POLITICIANS. They don't care about you. They don't care about me. They don't care about anything except that big stack of cash they sit on.\n\nShe clearly didn’t take Mister Rogers’ lessons to heart if she voted for Trump for his morals. And … no one rushed the decision, for Chrissake. She had nine years to learn about Trump’s morality, and even if she wasn’t paying attention to Harris—the vice president, mind you—for the previous four years, three months of direct campaigning for the top job should’ve been enough time to make the right decision. \n\nMeanwhile, Project 2025, which we implored everyone to look at, specifically called for the elimination of public support for NPR and PBS. \n\nAs Trump recently said, he’s doing what he campaigned on. Every one of his voters signed up for this. \n\nCampaign Action","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

The state Democratic leadership and implementation of draconian coronavirus restrictions also hurt their support with voters.\n\nRepublicans have been reaping the benefits of the realignment.\n\nThe Republican Party gained Hispanic, Black, Asian-American voters as suburbanites and working class voters responded to their message of tougher enforcement of crime and immigration, and promising to address the cost of living and inflation.\n\nTrump shocked the state after he only lost by 13 points to Kamala Harris, increasing his voter share in 2024 by 11 points. \n\nTrump gained more than 600,000 votes in New York between the 2016 and 2024 elections. Harris’ margin of victory was the narrowest of Democratic presidential candidates since 1992.\n\nIn 2022, Republicans flipped all four congressional seats away from Democrats, helping give House Republicans the majority in Washington, DC.\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Rep. Lee Zeldin came within 6 points of defeating Hochul as the final tally was 47 percent to 53 percent.\n\nRepublicans are anticipating a rematch with Hochul as her approval ratings are weaker than ever.\n\n‘The rightward shift of New York in particular New York City has been happening since 2006,’ GrayHouse pollster Landon Wall told the Daily Mail.\n\nWall indicated that Trump’s gains in New York City could even help a potential future Republican candidate. \n\nBut the newfound excitement from Republicans in the state is bigger than just Donald Trump.\n\n‘There’s this energy and this desire for something counter to the one party rule in New York that is separate from the Trump effect,’ Wall said.\n\nSixty percent of voters statewide say it’s “time for someone new,” including 75 percent of Independents and even 34 percent of Democrats.\n\nThe poll shows that Rep. Elise Stefanik is within striking distance of Hochul if she decides to run a campaign for governor.\n\nForty-six percent of voters said they would vote for Hohul, while Stefanik would earn 40 percent of the vote. Fourteen percent of voters were undecided.\n\nThat’s a strong start for Stefanik to consider the race, as she has not even announced a campaign. \n\nStefanik has a clear lead with Republicans in the state as 44 percent of primary voters signaled their support for a potential run for governor. Only seven percent chose Rep. Mike Lawler and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Stefanik indicated she was seriously considering a run for governor. \n\n‘If you look at the past few election cycles, New York is moving toward the Republican direction and I believe that's a result of single party failed Democrat rule led by Kathy Hochul,' she said. \n\n Originally selected by Trump to serve as his Ambassador to the U.N., the president withdrew her nomination so that she could remain in the House of Representatives where Republicans are clinging to a slim majority. \n\nBut that did not stop her political momentum. Stefanik is stepping up the number of events in the state and getting strong support for a run.\n\n'I'm gonna fight for New Yorkers like I always do. We are crisscrossing the state ... we are hearing an outpouring of support importantly not just from Republicans but from Independents and Democrats as well. It has been overwhelming. Clearly New Yorkers want to fire Kathy Hochul,' she said. \n\nTrump's performance in the state, his rallies, and events only helped increase the number of Republican supporters, she said. \n\n'The trends are only continuing. You look at President Donald Trump's outcome on Election Day in New York, he did better in some parts of the city than any Republican in decades,' she said.","summary":"A new poll shows that the state of New York could be competitive for Republicans as candidates eye challenging Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14697517/new-york-right-republican-poll-kathy-hochul-elise-stefanik.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/10/15/98249639-0-image-a-30_1746888711209.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 14:52:12","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":319928382,"title":"Trump’s first 100 days were ‘worst ever’ – Biden","text":"Former US President Joe Biden has criticized the first 100 days in office of his successor, Donald Trump, while dismissing widespread speculation about his own cognitive decline, which was widely seen as the key reason behind his decision to drop out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Biden gave his take on Trump’s performance, saying “He’s had the worst 100 days any president’s ever had. And I would not say honesty has been his strong point.” His comments come after the end of the three-month period during which political opponents of sitting US presidents typically limit their public criticism.\n\nBiden also noted that he was “disappointed but not surprised” by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump, claiming that her race and gender played a role. “They went the sexist route,” he said. “I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country – and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nAsked whether he believes he could have beaten Trump in 2024, the former president replied, “I do.” He argued that the 2024 presidential race “wasn’t a slam dunk.” Trump secured narrow victories in several key battlegrounds, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin.\n\nResponding to reports alleging cognitive decline in the final year of his presidency, Biden strongly denied the claims. “They are wrong,” Biden said. “There is nothing to sustain that… I said when I got out of the race, I was still going to be president. I think I did a pretty damn good job the last six months.”\n\nSpeculation about whether Biden was fit for office swirled around him months before the November election, fueled by recurring gaffes. Concerns peaked, however, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024.\n\nDespite his initial defiance, Biden withdrew from the presidential race under reported pressure from the Democratic leadership, allowing Vice President Harris to become the nominee.

And these days, it is entirely bad form in the newsroom to cozy up to a politician, whether that pres is a liberal Barack Obama or a conservative George W. Bush.\n\nThe current president, Donald Trump, is neither a liberal nor a conservative. He’s a one-of-a-kind narcissist who, in a former life, made a business career out of cozying up to various journalists in the pursuit of furthering his Queens dreams of New York real estate domination. He would literally telephone any number of scribes pretending to be someone else with a hot tip about something, anything, that would further his up-and-down fortune.\n\nAnd now, more’s the pity, he is again the president, pretending for the time being to see the journos who formerly made his bacon as the Enemy of the People.\n\nIt’s been 65 years since a president was elected who had cordial relations with the American press. From today’s rather prim perspective, matters were nuttily chummy.\n\nDonald Trump does not drink. Joe Biden does not drink.\n\nBut Jack Kennedy would have any number of drinks, often, with his Georgetown neighbor Ben Bradlee — Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee — who was two years the junior of the blue-blooded politician at Harvard and served as he did with high distinction in World War II naval battles in the South Pacific. Their relationship continued though the 1950s as Bradlee took on senior positions at Newsweek and the Washington Post and Kennedy progressed from senator to president. Couldn’t, wouldn’t, doesn’t happen today.\n\nI just finished “Fierce Ambition,” a fascinating biography of Maggie Higgins, the first American woman journalist to win a Pulitzer Prize for war reporting. She was on the front lines with our troops in Germany, in Korea — where she won the Pulitzer and very nearly died in battle — and in Vietnam. A great beauty, she was also a Kennedy neighbor in Georgetown, and a drinker of many drinks with him. In the end she went native, as we say in the newspaper business, so much so that she married an Army general, and died at 45 from a tropical disease picked up in the Vietnamese jungle. While still a great reporter, she also endlessly lobbied JFK in letters and cables to expand the American fight against Ho Chi Minh.\n\nDonald Trump, formerly almost equally chummy with liberals such as Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, in his ancient age has gone on a ballistic rampage against the media. He bans the Associated Press from covering him because it won’t rename the Gulf of Mexico, after 400 years, the Gulf of America. While he clearly loves Fox News and has, way beyond any Kennedyesque chumminess, nominated 19 current and former Fox folks to work in his administration — oftentimes because he thinks they look the telegenic part — he sued CBS for literally $20 billion for what he considers misleading edits of an interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. He sued the pollster for The Des Moines Register for predicting that Trump would lose the race in Iowa last November, which he very much did not lose. The pollster was wrong. But what kind of president in a non-Stalinist nation thinks that being wrong is a federal offense?\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the dangerously insane situation this presents in the one nation in the world that considers freedom of speech and the freedom of the press fundamental to its existence, in its Constitution. Brendan Carr, Trump’s FCC chair, after opening investigations into NPR and PBS underwriters, last week said in an interview that he is considering pulling CBS’s broadcast license.\n\nMaybe it’s too chummy — I think it is — for a president to have a lot of drinks with people who cover him. But that’s nothing compared to suing them for $20B and trying to put them out of business. Calling them “human scum.” You know what’s scummy? An American president baldly trying to throw the First Amendment to the Constitution in the trash.\n\nWhy, Americans of all political stripes, are you letting him do it?\n\nLarry Wilson is on the Southern California News Group editorial board. lwilson@scng.com.","summary":"All — all! — American presidents have problems with the press.

The world became a little bit bigger, still, and I hadn't considered my world very small. There was something about going through a pledge period with other young women who you really didn't know very well. And you must learn to bond, trust and depend upon one another.

They went in another direction.\n\nThe Pulitzer for “public service,” for instance, went to the leftist propaganda site ProPublica for “exposing the fatal consequences of abortion bans.” ProPublica is perhaps the nation’s leading purveyor of Potemkin journalism, which entails dressing up political propaganda with neutral-sounding journalistic verbiage to create the impression that you’ve done genuine reporting.\n\nIts abortion stories are perhaps the sloppiest and sleaziest of its catalog, even worse than its string of pitiful smears against Supreme Court justices. In a healthy environment, journalism schools would use them as prime examples of hackery and conjecture.\n\nTake their award-winning story on Amber Thurman. In August 2022, the 28-year-old Georgia woman checked herself into a suburban Atlanta hospital emergency room, complaining of severe pain. She was suffering from an infection caused by the remains of twin fetuses she had aborted by pill five days earlier.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when reading ProPublica’s Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters is that they fail to offer a single on-the-record source who maintains that abortion laws slowed or stopped doctors from providing medical help for Thurman.\n\nIndeed, a reader must plow through to the 57th paragraph of the article to find this throwaway line: “It is not clear from the records available why doctors waited to provide (emergency help).”\n\nNot clear? That’s a remarkable concession to make deep into a story. The headline, after all, promises to prove that “Abortion Bans Have Delayed Emergency Medical Care.” Have, not may have.\n\nAnyway, by “not clear,” the reporters mean no testimony exists to support the implication that a dilation and curettage procedure, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped to remove tissue, was delayed because doctors were nervous about Georgia’s abortion law.\n\nWhenever the story hits a juncture at which any real reporter would feel compelled to offer corroboration, ProPublica switches to interviewing nameless “OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion” or pro-abortion activists who offer politically motivated guesswork.\n\nWe call that a “column” in the business.\n\nTo confuse readers, ProPublica regularly conflates miscarriages with elective abortions. And here’s the thing: The fetuses had already been destroyed. There was absolutely no legal basis for any doctor, not even one confused about the supposed ambiguities of abortion laws, to fail to give Thurman all the care she needed. That seems like a vital fact that should have been mentioned somewhere in a 3,400-word investigative piece.\n\nI don’t care where you stand on abortion, that’s not journalism. Yet, this is the type of hackery that wins you a Pulitzer these days.\n\nThe only inarguable truth in the Thurman case is that she died from complications caused by abortion pills. That’s the headline. That’s the buried lede. Knowing this, ProPublica feels compelled to assure readers that there are only “rare complications” from abortion pills—“extremely rare” even.\n\nIndeed, there is now mounting evidence that mifepristone is less safe than the Food and Drug Administration has led women to believe. When two pro-life researchers at the Ethics and Public Policy Center reviewed health insurance claims from over 800,000 chemical abortions, they found that complications occurred in about 1 in 10 cases.\n\nMaybe they should have won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nBut ProPublica, funded by a deep-pocketed progressive group, exists to create fake stories for politicians to use as oppo material. You may remember when many political experts assured us that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and resulting state-level abortion limitations would forever sink the entire GOP?\n\nWell, less than a week after the Thurman story hit, Axios reported that Senate Democrats would launch a “blitz on emergency abortion care this week after ProPublica reporting on death of Georgia woman.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned Thurman on many occasions.\n\nIt should be said that ideological bias doesn’t prevent a journalist from making arguments that rely on facts. It is implausible, however, that any genuine journalist could possibly believe ProPublica’s Thurman story was well reported or that Abu Toha’s essays enlightened anyone.\n\nAnd the fact that Pulitzers reward this kind of transparent hackery only further destroys their already battered credibility.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Do we really need this? | Arwa Mahdawi","text":"It’s (not just) the sexism, stupid\n\nRaise your hand if you’ve been desperate for Joe Biden to pop up and tell us all, yet again, how he would have handily beaten Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nObviously, I’m not the National Security Agency so I have no idea how many hands are up right now but I’d wager it’s not too many. Still, Biden seems to think we all want to relitigate the November election and has returned to the spotlight to explain exactly what went wrong.\n\nIn an interview on ABC’s The View on Thursday, the former president took a tiny bit of accountability for the hellscape we are currently living in, noting: “I was in charge and [Trump] won. So, you know, I take responsibility.”\n\nBiden should have left it there, but he also explained that he thinks he would have beaten Trump if he hadn’t dropped out of the race due to the entire world seeing evidence of his cognitive decline during that disastrous debate. I don’t know what proof he has to support this idea – not poll numbers, anyway – but it’s always good to believe in yourself!\n\nAnother thing Biden believes: that Kamala Harris lost the election because of sexism. “I was disappointed but not surprised,” Biden said of Harris’s defeat. “They [Trump voters] went the sexist route.”\n\nTrump’s campaign was full of sexist and racist attacks against Harris. Bigotry and misogyny clearly played a part in her defeat.\n\nStill, to blame Harris’s defeat on sexism, as Biden does, is a massive cop-out. Harris didn’t lose because she was a mixed-race woman. She lost because Biden’s hubris meant she had very little time to put together a campaign and because, once she was the nominee, she refused to put any distance between herself and Biden’s unpopular policies. To refresh your memory, when Harris went on The View last October, the co-host Sunny Hostin asked her if there was anything the then vice-president would have done differently from Biden, and Harris said “not a thing comes to mind”. A new book by the reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes claims that Biden pressured Harris to ensure there was “no daylight” between the two of them. Biden denied saying this during his appearance on The View – but whoever decided on this strategy, it was disastrous.\n\nIt’s also disastrous, I think, to keep pushing the narrative, as Biden is doing, that Harris lost because of sexism. Saying that the US isn’t ready to elect a female president is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It makes it more likely that white male candidates, seen as a safer bet, are favoured over women.\n\nYes, there’s plenty of misogyny in the US, but the lesson to take from 2024 isn’t that the country isn’t ready for a female president, it’s that the country is desperately ready for change. A recent poll found that 50% of Democrats want the party to “become more progressive”. Another poll found that “a 58% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that the Democratic party needs major changes, or to be completely reformed”. Instead of relitigating the past, Democrats need to aggressively rethink their future.\n\nForget the new US pope – check out Mexico’s ‘weed nuns’\n\nThis is an old article but since religion is in the news this week I am resurfacing it because the pictures are brilliant.\n\nDid Dora the Explorer join the manosphere?\n\nEven your favourite cartoon characters are getting red-pilled. 404 Media reports that a video recently uploaded to the official Dora the Explorer Instagram account featured Dora explaining what “sigma” means.

Unless you are Melania Trump, that is, in which case you are done working. According to the New York Times, Melania has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House during Trump’s second term. That means Trump “has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a first lady.

Just over a month ago, the 25-year-old reproductive rights activist and former Kamala Harris campaign staffer announced her bid for the seat of the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., who died in March. A special election is set for Sept. 23.\n\nHer grassroots campaign faces an uphill battle, in terms of both fundraising and competition from a slate of challengers in the state's July 15 Democratic primary, among them Grijalva's daughter, former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva. In a Democratic stronghold like Arizona's 7th Congressional District, the primary winner is likely headed to Washington.\n\nBut Foxx is unfazed. Through a patently Gen Z mix of social media influencing, retail-politicking charisma and grassroots activist grit, she appeals to prospective voters through trendy TikToks and candid storytelling about the ups and downs of her fledgling campaign. After all, she didn't pick politics, politics picked her, she declares in her campaign announcement video.\n\nHer upbringing in Tuscon — growing up relying on public assistance, experiencing homelessness and working nights to support herself and her mother — and watching politicians threaten the resources she needed pushed her into the activism that would launch her political career. While the nation first learned of her in 2017, when a video of her confronting then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., over his support for defunding Planned Parenthood went viral, she hopes that Arizonans will soon see her as the progressive fighter in Congress she said she aims to be. \n\n\"What we are doing is convincing folks, reminding them of their collective power, that when everybody takes a small action, it has a big difference,\" she told Salon in a video call, arguing that people have lost sight of that power under the chaos of the Trump administration and a political process that privileges the uber wealthy. \"Our campaign is about a long-term strategy for the party and the political system that Gen Z is going to inherit, and part of that is reminding people that their collective power matters.\"\n\nAt times with tears in her eyes as she recalled stories of people who've told her her campaign has galvanized them, Foxx spoke with Salon about why she decided to run for Congress, the challenges of being a young, progressive candidate, and how she's building a campaign strategy model that will work for young working-class people in a political landscape stacked against them. \n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou are by no means a stranger to politics. You've been in reproductive rights and grassroots activism since you were a teenager, and delving into political strategy and influencing. So I wanted to know, why did you decide that now is the time to run for office, and not just any office, but federal office?\n\nTo your point, I have been in this work a decade, despite only being 25. And I got my start at a very local level, fighting my school board for better sex ed because I needed it, because I didn't have parents at home to fill in the gaps of a curriculum that was updated in the 80s, that didn't mention consent, that was medically inaccurate. But as we look ahead, I organized under Trump administration one. I showed up to town halls of Republicans here in Arizona that tried to deny funding to Planned Parenthood Centers, funding that I relied on when I had no parents and no money and no insurance. I showed up on the steps of the Supreme Court to protest the appointment of Supreme Court justices like Amy Coney Barrett, who were pushed through at the time, really, in the middle of a presidential election.\n\nWhen I look to this moment now and the effects of seeing things like Roe v. Wade overturned, feeling like we are further behind on our issues than when even I started, I feel a great sense of responsibility, and it's what brings me to this run for office. I feel a sense of responsibility to young people who deserve a fighter and a champion who's going to make sure that they have the ability to afford rent and groceries, that when they save up their paychecks, they're able to move out of their parents houses, and maybe, I don't know, one day buy a house, even though they didn't start saving in third grade or whatever — you know that meme, where it's like, \"I shouldn't have been in third grade. I should have been saving for a house.\" I feel a great sense of responsibility to those young people who deserve a future they can look forward to, one free from the threat of climate change, one in which, no matter what state they live in, they can make decisions about if and when to start their families, and where they can afford the basics and a shot at getting ahead.\n\nAnd — and this is maybe a bit of a surprise — I feel a deep sense of responsibility to older generations who have fought for the rights that made it possible for me to get access to that birth control, which was not a given, to become the first of my family, to go to college as a first-generation American, someone raised by a single mom. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to those older folks who in this moment, I meet them at their doors and at the protests here on the ground in Arizona. I had a conversation with a woman the other night who was nearly brought to tears talking about the overturn of Roe v. Wade and how scary it is for her that the things she fought for are being overturned, and she may not live to see them reinstated. They are so hungry for a champion, too, someone who is young and has the energy to keep up their fight.\n\nThe last thing I'll add here is that we are in a moment in which a 34-count convicted felon is in the White House; where Elon Musk, a billionaire, is calling families like mine the \"Parasite Class\" on Twitter. We are not in normal times. Like this is the alternative timeline, my friends. Like we need to be taking action right now. ... If you're not seeing these leaders — and it is a stretch to call these men leaders — if you're not seeing these folks and asking yourself \"Why not me?\" then you're asking the wrong questions.\n\nThinking about that — you say you have a responsibility to young people, older folks — what message do you have for other young people, especially other people who are working class, who have a similar experience to you, who feel like running for office may be out of reach for them, even if it's something that they might want to do?\n\nYou don't just feel that way. That's a fact, right? If you feel like running for office is out of reach for you, as a young, working-class person, you're being clear-eyed. You are seeing it as it is. There are so many barriers to running as a young, working-class person. I put out a Substack post about this recently. From the very beginning of this process, I had to doxx myself, which is a barrier enough for most of the young women I know to stay out of this work. And then you move on to something like fundraising, where the traditional wisdom on campaigns, strategies, have been built for a very particular kind of candidate: old, rich, white men. So the idea that you should call all your friends and family and ask them for money to start your campaign works a whole lot better when you are not the friend or family member that people call for money, which is the reality for so many of us. And then, when you think about what it takes, what it costs to just live while running for office, that is a barrier that feels insurmountable for most of us who are just one car breakdown away from not making rent.\n\nBut what I want those young folks to know is that, one, they have a fighter in me. And, two, that I am doing this to win — full stop, period — to be their fighter and to expose those truths; to make it clear to people what the barriers to participation are and to give them new strategies and new road maps to get out there and take up leadership. We're invested in new ways of doing things, whether that's fundraising on platforms like Instagram and TikTok and Substack. We're building strategies that simply don't exist, that are better suited to candidates like us, and they won't replace every piece of traditional campaign knowledge, but they are suited to a different kind of candidate, who's more reflective of our generation and our upbringings.\n\nWhat I'll add here is that even though the barriers are high, I think about how some people have criticized me for not having the right kind of experience, never having run for state or local office, never having held a position at the state [legislature] or school board. But it's worth pointing out that our school boards are unpaid. Our state legislators, they make $24,000 a year ... If we make underpaid and unpaid labor a prerequisite to leadership, we are going to continue to be in a deficit of representation when it comes to age and economics. What we need, now more than anything, is people who get it. Our policy would look different if we had people in power who had made hard decisions in the grocery checkout line — people like us. But, instead, we have people like Donald Trump who have never even done their own grocery shopping, and that is because of the systems built around our elections and the barriers to participate.\n\nRight. And there's a plethora of criticism about the Trump administration, about President Trump, about everyone in his cabinet. But I'm also curious about the other side of things, with the Democratic Party, which you're running under. We saw a consensus that the 2024 election was largely a referendum on its failure to appeal to its base in favor of swinging more conservative, to appeal to moderate voters. Given your work as a political strategist, having worked on the Harris campaign as well, what changes do you think the Democratic Party needs to be making? \n\nI'm almost going to go all the way back to your first question to answer this question, which was when I was deciding if I wanted to get into this race. I had only a week or so because this is a special election, and I had to make calls to my family and friends to make sure that they were going to stay 10 toes down in my corner no matter what; that my support system was locked in with me. And I had to do the hard work of making sure that I could sustain this financially; that I could handle this on a safety level, even both physical and mental well-being.\n\nI have worked the back end of campaigns. I've supported candidates and causes as a strategist throughout the years, and on the other side as a surrogate, as a content creator, someone who spoke at the 2024 [Democratic National Convention]. I have been on both sides and I could not, in good faith, continue my work either behind-the-scenes or in front of the camera on behalf of this party unless I gave people something to get excited about, someone they could put their hopes on. Because in this moment, our party is picking predictability over possibility and failing to meet the moment. So to your question of what do we need to do to get out of this, I had two big learnings coming out of 2024: one, age matters. We saw that with [President Joe] Biden at the top of the ticket. Age was a central conversation, and we need younger leaders — I am brought to this election because, unfortunately, my member of Congress passed away while in the seat. \n\nThe second thing that I learned while on the 2024 run is that primaries matter. There was an absolute sense that people didn't have a choice, that they felt left out of the process, and when I look at an opportunity like this in my district, a district that has been held for the last 22 years by a true progressive icon, I'll note, but basically my entire lifetime, and we have a safe blue seat, which will likely be decided by a primary that is about 100 days long, and depending on who sits in the seat, could be held for another few decades, it is our responsibility to give people in this district a good race. That is a long-term strategy, and it is the long-term strategy that Democrats need to be adopting. Instead of being scared of primaries, we need to be welcoming people like me into the fold, who are sticking our heads up to lead and engaging new people.\n\nI had a man the other day on the street tell me — he stopped me. I didn't know him. He had seen our launch video, seen himself in it, and told me about how he was hoping to get his rights restored in time to vote for us in this election. Just the other day, three additional volunteers showed up to our canvas, our door knock, who found us on Tiktok, who had never knocked doors for a candidate before. When we collected signatures, half of our signature gatherers had never gathered signatures for a candidate or a cause before. We are bringing in people in a special election primary in Arizona, who otherwise have been left out of this process. When I think about what does the party need to be doing? We need to be embracing primaries and our democratic process, letting people feel — not letting them, but rather engaging people in the space between big elections and embracing candidates like me who offer something different for this party. Not every candidate can use digital media, new media, effectively. Our campaign has gained 4 million views since launch, totally organic, good storytelling, not $1 of paid [advertising] behind it because we know how to use these platforms to reach people and how to tell a good story.\n\nOur party, instead of pushing people like me out, calling us an outsider, putting up institutional and establishment barriers, needs to be welcoming people like us in because we are the solution to that 20-something percent approval rating of our party. \n\nBouncing off something you just said a few moments ago, that the Democratic Party is establishing institutional barriers, has labeled you and other candidates an outsider. Can you talk a little bit more about what that has looked like, and what this past month of your campaign has looked like as well?\n\nThere's so much excitement on the ground. I'll be honest with you, as we knock these doors — and we've knocked hundreds — most people don't even know this election is happening. That's the fact. And I think it scares some people that we are attracting viral attention week after week to this election because it makes it harder to predict. Because when more people participate — and people are betting on a low-turnout election in which they can just invest in high-efficacy voters, and get away with that — it scares people and it changes people's strategies and challenges them to do something differently.\n\nI'll also share, on a personal level, that for people like me, who are first-time candidates, who are working-class, we are not supposed to rise to these positions of leadership. I was raised by a single mom and, like, it's just a fact that I don't have some of the same advantages as other people in my race. You know, I think about how just the other day, the former congressman's team gave his daughter his fundraising and email list, which is a major advantage in this race, and it's just one of those ways that we are seeing selection politics at play. And it's not to say that the other folks I'm running against haven't worked hard or are not qualified for this role, but it is to point out that there is a difference in terms of privileges and advantages here that come from legacy last names and legacy politics.\n\nWhat we do here in southern Arizona is going to have effects for the entire country in the 2026 midterms, in which young people are going to stick their head up and lead. What we do here now in the next 70-something days, maybe 60-something by the time this article comes out, is going to have effects on what young people are recruited to run, who is funded, who is endorsed. I want people to feel a sense of urgency around my race — our race — because it has the opportunity to affect all of these other races come 2026, and I promise you that if we win, and we win big, and we prove concept out here in southern Arizona that young progressive disruptors are winners, we will have better options come 2026 and 2028.\n\nThinking about your vision as a candidate, what has been the response on the ground when you're going and knocking on doors, the comments you're getting on your various posts, both in terms of general reactions and receiving those donations? My understanding is that you're also not necessarily tied currently to any large organization to get those large donors.\n\nIt's a balance, for sure, on the fundraising side, but you're right to say we're doing things differently. The response at the doors and online is what keeps me going when the response in D.C. is so mild, to say the least. I feel so energized knocking doors, in part, because that's my bread and butter. ... When people describe how they feel about our political process in this moment — Democrats in particular — the words are, by and large, negative. They feel hopeless. They feel left out. They feel discouraged, disheartened, disappointed, and so it cannot be understated that every door I knock, people leave feeling excited. That is a service to our party and our democracy as a whole. We are doing good work just by the nature of being in this race. And I've found that, like I said, at the doors, most people don't know this election is happening. So anybody who wants to tell you that someone has it in the bag is wrong, and this is the kind of election that could be decided by just a handful of votes. Every conversation counts.\n\nI'll share that people have been quick to discredit what we're doing online — those 4 million organic views on videos that make the political process, frankly, more transparent and feel more human — but we're seeing it have effects on the ground. ... I was at a Sunlink stop, which is one of our kinds of public transportation near the [University of Arizona's] campus in our district, and a girl stopped me and told me that her sister had sent her our videos and that her sister was like, tell all of your friends that they need to vote for this girl, and she asked if we could take a picture to send to her sister. What we are doing online is translating on the ground. And frankly, what we are doing on the ground is translating online. Each and every one of our videos is clips of us knocking the doors. I think about how just the other day, one of our volunteers that came out, Berta, she told me she had never volunteered for a political candidate before, but that she was tired of just critiquing things and wanted someone she could get behind to help build something better. So she found us on Tiktok, and she showed up to knock the doors for the very first time, and her and I walked around for three hours and knocked doors and had incredible conversations.\n\nSo what I'm hearing on the doors and in the streets is, one, most people don't know this election is happening yet. We need to put ourselves in the mind of the voter and remember that for them, July is a long way away. They still got to pay June's rent. Like, let's be clear. The other thing is that, when they hear about us, when they hear our story, which is the American Dream's story, when they know that they have the shot to make history, to elect the first woman of our generation, my generation, they are excited about politics. In this moment, I can't stress enough how difficult it is to move people from hopelessness and disappointment to excitement, and our campaign is doing that.\n\nLast big question for you, so thank you for all of your time. Bouncing off of that — you've been able to appeal, it sounds, to so many people who otherwise might be disaffected voters right now. But we also talked about being up against a number of other Democratic primary candidates, including the late representative Raul Grijalva's daughter, Adelita Grijalva. As you said, who wins this primary is an indicator of how the election itself will go because this is a long-standing Democratic district. Why should Arizona voters who don't know about you, Arizona voters who are on the fence about you, vote for you? What do you have planned for them?\n\nThe way we have been doing things isn't working, and I am the only break from the status quo in this race. They deserve more than a career politician in office. They deserve someone who, when they go to D.C., will fight on their behalf, and I have proved over the last decade that I am a fighter. And the final thing I'll say is that I am comfortable with using the power of this safer and bluer seat to stand up on their behalf, to stand up to the Trump administration. They have my commitment that I will not fold. ... That's my message to voters here in southern Arizona, that if you feel like the way things have been going isn't working, if you're unhappy with the state of this country as it stands, then we're going to need to do things differently, and I'm the candidate to do it.\n\nI want to offer a hopeful message to end, too, which is that there is so much to fight against in this moment, and they have my assurance that I will fight at every at every point. However, we have so much to look forward to. As a young candidate, the future is not theoretical to me. I am fighting to build something better that me and my generation can inherit, and I see a world in which we can build something better. This campaign is about offering that hope.","summary":"Deja Foxx spoke to Salon about why she's running for office and why money in politics is a major barrier to entry","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/05/10/deficit-of-representation-how-money--and-the-lack-of-it--discourages-working-class-democrats/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/05/deja-foxx-1697654459.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 10:00:06","author":"Tatyana Tandanpolie","authors":["Tatyana Tandanpolie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.151},{"id":319847746,"title":"Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyson Hannigan Have a “Buffy” Reunion in N.Y.C., Plus Gwyneth Paltrow, Eva Longoria and More","text":"Friends Forever \n\n Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-stars Alyson Hannigan and Sarah Michelle Gellar reunite at the Sirius XM studios in New York City on May 9.\n\n Amongst the Trees \n\n Gwyneth Paltrow unveils The Forest Within, an immersive recreation of a Korean forest, in New York City on May 9.\n\n Eva Longoria flashes a smile as she arrives at her hotel in Paris on May 9.\n\n On a Callback \n\n Henry Golding grabs a quick bite at the Casting Directors' Luncheon in London on May 9.\n\n Out to Lunch \n\n Lily Allen looks chic at the Casting Directors' luncheon in London on May 9.\n\n Friday Walks \n\n Nina Dobrev and fiancé Shaun White take a stroll through New York City with their dog on May 9.\n\n Daring Dress \n\n Natasha Lyonne looks gorgeous in a see-through dress after appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers on May 9 in New York City.\n\n Back Together \n\n Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre, Nick Lachey and Drew Lachey of 98 Degrees make a stop at the Sirius XM Studios on May 9 in New York City.\n\n They're Gr-r-eat!

Remote Northern California town gets its post office back","text":"For more than two years, a big wooden sign in west Marin County has displayed a set of hand-painted numbers, dutifully changed each morning. \"Days Without a Bolinas Post Office,\" the sign reads. The number Friday: 806. The sign has been a charming, if sad, reminder to the 1,200 or so residents of Bolinas of the loss of their beloved post office, which was booted from its downtown building amid a spat between the U.S. Postal Service and its longtime landlord. Late last month, though, Bolinas resident John Borg nailed a new message to the top of the sign — the wooden equivalent of a P.S. on a letter. It reads: \"We Did It, Bolinas!!! New Post Office Opening by Fall 2025.\" The post office soon will move back into the unadorned wooden building on Brighton Avenue where it had operated for six decades. On April 17, the Postal Service signed a 10-year lease with landlord Gregg Welsh, of Ventura County, his attorney, Patrick Morris, said in an email. For the rural denizens of ZIP Code 94924, the reopening is a major victory — especially given President Trump's musings about privatizing the Postal Service, which lost $9.5 billion in the 2024 fiscal year and is cutting thousands of jobs. \"For this to be approved during the massive federal cutbacks of the Trump administration, it's really somewhat astonishing for a lot of us,\" said Borg, 63, who helped lead a citizens' campaign to reopen the facility. \"I think the past two years gave our town a taste of what potential privatization of the Postal Service could mean for other underserved and rural places throughout the country,\" he said. \"That includes reduced retail operations, delays and inconvenience, increased prices ... [and] more focus on bigger communities that can deliver more profit.\" In Bolinas — a haven for poets, painters, writers and actors — residents got creative in their push to reopen the post office. They picketed with placards reading, \"Real Mail Not Email!\" They marched in local parades dressed as letter carriers, composed songs and wrote more than 2,000 letters in hand-painted envelopes that they sent to Postal Service officials. And they wrote scores of poems to be read at aloud rallies. Like this one, with emphasis by the author: They’ve closed the Bolinas Post Office down Forgetting our isolated, far away little town. The elders need their pensions and checks And wonder what on earth will be next. Most people in Bolinas, a town abutting Point Reyes National Seashore, do not get home mail delivery. Residents long relied upon daily trips to the post office for parcels, pension checks and mail-order prescriptions, not to mention a chance to catch up on the local gossip. Since the post office closed, their mail has been delivered to the smaller town of Olema — a 40-minute round-trip drive through the forest on Highway 1 — where the post office has repeatedly closed because of flooding. And sometimes it has been rerouted to nearby Stinson Beach. The relocations have been more than just an inconvenience for the town’s elderly residents, many of whom cannot drive. There is little public transit, and 47% of the town's residents are 65 and older. Residents have reported problems getting mail-order prescriptions, lab results, healthcare coverage updates, paychecks and other packages. \"It may seem like a little thing, but it really did impact our town greatly,\" said Borg, 63, a type 1 diabetic who had his insulin delivered through the mail before the closure. For the last two years, he has driven two hours round-trip to San Rafael each month to pick up his medication at a pharmacy. Rep. Jared Huffman, a San Rafael Democrat who lobbied former U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on behalf of Bolinas, called it \"great news\" that the post office was reopening. But, he said in an interview Friday, the process took too long. \"They should not have had to experience all of this and to weather all of the bureaucracy and just bulls— that has prevented them from having a post office,\" Huffman said. The Bolinas post office shut down on March 3, 2023. Welsh, whose family trust owns the building, acquired it about 50 years ago. The Postal Service already was a tenant. According to a statement provided last year by Welsh through his attorney, Patrick Morris, the Postal Service for years violated its lease, which required it to maintain and repair the flooring at its own expense. The agency discovered asbestos in the floor tiles in 1998, according to the statement, but essentially kept it hidden from the landlord for more than two decades and did not post warning signs. Welsh and the Postal Service fought over who should pay for asbestos abatement and the repair of worn and broken floor tiles. The Postal Service lease, according to Welsh's statement, ended in January 2022, but USPS continued to occupy the building, sans lease, as a “tenant at sufferance.” In February 2023, Welsh demanded the post office vacate the building within a month. Morris, the attorney, said in an email last week that, although the parties have signed a new lease, the Postal Service has not told Welsh when it expects to move back into the building. Morris said that, although most of the flooring appears to have been replaced and \"an asbestos clearance was provided,\" the Postal Service has not provided his client details about the work. Kristina Uppal, a Bay Area-based spokeswoman for USPS, told The Times in an email that she could not provide details about lease negotiations but that postal services are expected to resume in Bolinas \"early fall 2025 after all necessary construction is completed.\" On March 13, then-Postmaster DeJoy wrote in a letter to several members of Congress that the Postal Service would eliminate 10,000 positions within 30 days through a voluntary early retirement program and that it had eliminated about 30,000 positions since 2021. The letter said he had signed an agreement with the General Services Administration and members of billionaire Elon Musk's White House advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, to identify further cost savings. DeJoy resigned March 24. On Friday, the Postal Service's Board of Governors announced its selection of David Steiner, a board member for FedEx, a direct USPS competitor, to be the next postmaster general. Critics, including the National Assn. of Letter Carriers, the union representing some 295,000 mail carriers, said they feared his selection would hasten privatization of the independent agency. Huffman said that, during the fight over the Bolinas post office, he found the Postal Service — a onetime Cabinet-level department that has operated as an independent agency for half a century — to be unresponsive and, at times, \"deeply unaccountable.\" But privatizing it, he said, \"would make it even worse.\" Bolinas had had a post office since 1863. After the post office closed, there was no viable commercial real estate in town to which it could be relocated. And a 1971 water meter moratorium — put into place because Bolinas has a limited water supply — has effectively prohibited new development for the last 54 years. At one point, residents drafted a detailed proposal for a temporary facility — a mobile office trailer on a parking lot next to the fire station — and offered to raise $50,000 for its installation. They sent the plan to a supportive Huffman, who shipped it to DeJoy, to no avail. Kent Khtikian, a 39-year Bolinas resident, said his friends' and neighbors' hopes for a new post office dimmed after Trump returned to the White House in part because they live in ultra-liberal Marin County, where 81% of voters cast their ballots for Kamala Harris in the November presidential election compared with 17% who chose Trump. \"It is certainly a relief to have the post office back,\" said Khtikian, a retired attorney who helped with the citizens' campaign. \"While there are certainly much bigger problems in the world, it’s an example of what can be done by people not giving up and not being discouraged and believing in their ability to be effective.\" Enzo Resta, a longtime resident and founder of the Bolinas Film Festival, compared the Bolinas post office to an Italian piazza — a place of serendipitous run-ins and \"the poetry of community engagement.\" \"It's quite beautiful to see all walks of life, all demographics, all age groups, all personal interests, all cultural interests be unified in coming together to say: This part of our community matters,\" Resta said. As of Friday, there's a new hand-painted sign in town. Affixed to the exterior wall of the still-closed post office, it reads: \"Coming Fall 2025 Bolinas Post Office 94924. Hooray!\"","summary":"A rural California town lost its post office amid a dispute between USPS and the landlord.

There’s the nuclear family, “which often we talk about as the central tenet of American life”. There’s the chosen family, “the pushback”, the community and friendships built by people who have been rejected by their parents, often because of their sexuality or gender identity. And then there’s the family we talk about much less frequently, but spend most of our waking hours within – our colleagues, or what Vuong describes as “the circumstantial family around labour”.\n\nVuong’s forthcoming second novel, The Emperor of Gladness, encompasses them all. There’s its 19-year‑old hero Hai’s relationship with his mother, a poor Vietnamese immigrant who believes that he has fulfilled her desperate aspirations for him by going to university, when he has actually gone to rehab. (Vuong, who also struggled with drug addiction, didn’t dare tell his mother when he dropped out of a marketing course at Pace University in New York, before getting on to the English literature course at Brooklyn College that set the course for his life as a writer.) The core of the book is Hai’s relationship with Grazina, an elderly widow from Lithuania who has dementia, and who takes him in when she sees him about to throw himself off a bridge in despair. Then there are the eccentric and richly drawn staff members of HomeMarket, the fast food restaurant in which Hai works, with its manager who is an aspiring wrestler, and customers ranging from the snotty and entitled to the homeless and desperate.\n\nTalking in London shortly after Trump’s inauguration, looking every inch the left-field literary lion in a tweed coat, jagged haircut and dangly earring, Vuong says that it’s the special circumstances of our work relationships that make the kind of intimate revelations he depicts in the book possible: “The labour, the anonymity, the long eight-hour shift being this randomised, arbitrary coalescence of people.” He knows what he’s talking about as he used to work in two fast food restaurants in his home town of East Hartford, Connecticut, where he and his mother settled after fleeing Vietnam when Vuong was two, then spending eight months in a refugee camp in the Philippines.\n\nIn the restaurants, “I would hear conversations from my co-workers that would blow my mind as a 19-year‑old,” remembers the author, who is now 36. “These private confessions. I’ll always remember I was cleaning the walk-in freezer with one man, about 50. We had our backs to each other, and he said: ‘I can’t tell my wife this; it would kill her. I have three sons, but I’ve realised that I only love one of them.’ If I heard that now, I would probably weep, right? He was trying to give me something, I realise. But at the time I was just like: ‘What is going on?’”\n\nThe Emperor of Gladness is a slice of American working-class life that depicts the emotions of its protagonists with a sensitivity and lusciousness familiar to readers of Vuong’s first novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous. Published in 2019, that book has sold 500,000 copies in the UK, and 1m copies globally after being printed in 40 languages, making Vuong a literary superstar. As with The Emperor of Gladness, it drew on his own experiences: like its protagonist, Vuong worked illegally in a tobacco farm, while his mother, Lê Kim Hông, had a job in a nail salon. Vuong believes that the chemicals she was exposed to were responsible for her death from breast cancer aged 51.\n\nVuong’s first-hand experience of hardship animates his writing, which is full of vivid insights into the way the poor in America struggle to survive. The Emperor of Gladness acutely depicts the deceptions inherent in this tough existence, from the “home cooking” at the fast food restaurant, which is actually pre-cooked off‑site and reheated, to Hai’s heartbreaking lies to his mother. “Often, perhaps through theology, we see deception as corrupt,” Vuong says. “But in my life, and what I’m trying to explore in this book is: what is benevolent deception? All these people deceive each other, but they’re trying to help each other, and also trying to get something from each other. We often see folks who are impoverished as passive victims, but it takes an incredible amount of creativity and innovation to survive in the brutal economics of America.”\n\nHe is also very attuned to what he calls “chameleonising”, or code-switching, which he says is something that the working poor do all the time. “Growing up in the nail salon answering the phones for my mom, I got to see how people talked, how women would chit-chat with their husbands in the waiting area. And then their husbands would leave, and their voices would change when they spoke to each other. I just thought it was so fascinating.”\n\nVuong’s mother lived long enough to see his early literary success. He has been showered with accolades, including the MacArthur fellowship (AKA the “genius grant”) and TS Eliot prize, and has an army of readers including many young fans. Director Luca Guadignino depicted the queer, gender-questioning teenagers in his 2020 TV series We Are Who We Are reading Vuong’s poetry collection Night Sky With Exit Wounds, and he was interviewed on a podcast by an audibly overawed Sam Smith. Björk loved his work so much that she wrote to his agent asking to meet him, and the pair have since become friends, not least because when they met late in 2019, Vuong’s mother would die within a month, while Björk was grieving for her own mother, who had died six months before. She gives him advice on dealing with fame, which he describes as “one of my biggest challenges”.\n\nWhen he’s not teaching in New York (he is professor in modern poetry and poetics at New York University), Vuong lives in a 1780s farmhouse in rural Massachusetts with his younger brother, who he took in after their mother’s death, and his long-term partner, lawyer Peter Bienkowski. “I have two dogs sitting by a fire; our friends are local country doctors and farmers,” the author says. “And then I have to do publicity or something, and there’s an audience of a thousand people in an auditorium. I don’t think I’m ever comfortable with it because it gets very parasocial. People feel like they know me. But Björk told me I was doing it right, and to keep it small.” Prizes, he says, “can change your life. They’re economic windfalls” – the MacArthur Grant is worth $625,000 – “but they’re given to the past. They’re not an assessment of who you are.”\n\nHis Zen Buddhism also comes into play: Vuong talks about the principle of the eight winds, including prosperity, decline, disgrace, honour, praise, censure, suffering and pleasure. “If you don’t have a strong sense of who you are that roots you, then you’re at the mercy of the winds and you’ll be blown over. But that was a practice I did way before I became an author.”\n\nVuong’s attitude to fame may be low key, but his approach to writing is not: The Emperor of Gladness is more ambitious and larger in scope than anything he has attempted before. It contains moments of almost unbearable poignancy, not to mention a nightmarish chapter set in an abattoir (mistreatment of animals, he believes, is “the staging ground for the violence that we enact on each other”), but it has great warmth, excursions into areas of popular culture not usually explored by literary fiction (hip-hop, civil-war tourism and yes, wrestling) and even some jokes. “I couldn’t have written this book as a debut,” Vuong says. “I didn’t have the chops. I wanted to use humour – and humour is very hard. If On Earth is the artist’s statement, the kind of philosophical treatise of what I wanted to do, then Emperor is me trying to walk the walk. Walking the walk is harder than talking the talk.”\n\nVuong, who could not read or write until he was 11 (he suspects that dyslexia ran in his family), says that DH Lawrence was one inspiration for The Emperor of Gladness, which is “about the same size as Sons and Lovers”, deals with working-class anxiety, and doesn’t offer some rags-to-riches-style escape from the grind of poverty. “Lawrence just said no, there’s going to be no improvement; this whole cycle will stay within this place. We will live, we will talk about life and we’ll talk about death here. I think that was quite radical.”\n\nLike Lawrence’s Nottinghamshire, Vuong’s Connecticut is a far cry from the state’s usual public face. “When I was 20 and living in New York, people would say that Connecticut was the place where posh people with sweaters tied over their necks would live, and I said: ‘I don’t know that part,’” Vuong explains. “What I saw was a post-industrial world of immigrants, working people, and the decline that America is only seeing now through social media. There’s a sub-genre of poverty porn on YouTube where people drive through blighted neighbourhoods, and one of them is Hartford. When I saw it, I thought: ‘Wow, that was my childhood and now it’s entertainment.’ The blight that a lot of America is reckoning with now in the social media age, immigrants have seen for 20, 30 years.”\n\nThough the book is rooted in post-industrial America, set in the fictitious town of East Gladness, Conn (“Gladness itself is no more, so it’s East of nothing,” Vuong says)ecticut, The Emperor of Gladness also takes the reader further afield, back in time and to other nations through the memories and preoccupations of its immigrant protagonists. Hai’s cousin Sony, whose family named him after a TV, is obsessed with the American civil war, while Grazina returns to the insurgency against the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in her episodes of dementia. “It was a convenient way to talk about all civil wars,” Vuong says, noting that while America mythologises its own in films such as Gettysburg, “almost every country has had a civil war – England, Vietnam, Korea. It’s that kind of cultural dominance that I’m trying to work against.”\n\nVuong is also determined to excavate the histories that America is once again attempting to suppress, this time under the guise of a war on “wokeness”. “Oh gosh, look at ‘make America great again’,” he says. “That phrase gestures at memory, but in fact it functions on romantic nostalgia, which is ultimately amnesia. Because if you ask, where’s the ‘again’, no one can point to it.”\n\nWhat most Americans don’t want to contemplate, Vuong says, is the role of genocide and slavery in the foundation of their country. “I often think the mistake of the left is to focus on Trump too much,” he says. “Trumpism has been here since Andrew Jackson and George Washington. Trump gives people permission not to look back, or to look back selectively. And then ultimately it becomes an authorial agency to forget.”\n\nVuong was not interested in considering whether or not the staff of HomeMarket would vote for Trump, setting The Emperor of Gladness in 2009. “It was very deliberate to focus on the Obama years, because it was a lot of hopium,” he says. “That quickly deflated when the president we voted in for the people bailed out the corporations. He’s like: they’re too big to fail. And we’re like: oh.” He calls the 2008 presidential election “my first era of political consciousness” and says that it was the first election he participated in.\n\n“I remember when I was at Pace going to an auditorium to watch the debate between Obama and Mitt Romney. It felt as if we were headed towards something completely new. Like it was electric. And then to see that it was really just an oligarchical state once again and perhaps always had been, that Obama was in many ways just another side of the Bush coin – as a millennial, it really deflated a lot of my peers. I think the greatest deception of my life, politically, was the Obama administration.”\n\nVuong voted for Kamala Harris, but without much enthusiasm. He says that Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential candidate that he and his peers regarded as aligned with their political beliefs. “He would have won [in 2016], I think. But somehow they ousted him from that campaign with the shenanigans of the Iowa caucus. And so when Hillary was announced, we’re like: oh, of course, this is the lesser of two evils that we’re always being told about.”\n\nThe author has since decided to channel his political activism in other directions. He and Penguin are donating 50c for every pre-order of the US edition (up to $10,000) to the Queer Liberation Library, an organisation that aims to make books with LGBTQ+ themes freely available on its website. This was partly prompted by On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous being removed from libraries by a municipal board in the Conroe independent school district in Texas two years ago, which Vuong and PEN America regarded as a book ban.\n\nThe justifications were unclear. “At first they said it’s explicit,” Vuong says. “But then there are a lot of other explicit books – The Catcher in the Rye has a sexual assault in it. There’s a whole group of students who go to challenge these decisions at board meetings. So then they adopted a new thing where they would say there’s a circulation issue, or the books aren’t being checked out. They make it logistical, bureaucratic. I was told that it only takes one person to make that decision, whereas banning for inappropriate material requires a committee. So it’s really dystopian, because people who don’t even read are now controlling the future of children’s literary lives.”\n\nWith America becoming more brutally transphobic by the day, I ask Vuong whether his house is a queer oasis. He says that he has hosted a dozen writers who wanted the space to work on their books, an idea modelled on the house of two trans friends who live nearby and have a child. “At first I was very cis about it; I was: Oh, you have a nuclear family,” he says. “But then I started to observe. Every time I went over, there was a new person there. And it was just trans youth who needed a place to be. So I thought: ‘Oh my goodness. We can rethink the nuclear household or property.’ For a lot of my queer friends, it’s so hard to get into writing residencies and to find a place to do their work. A lot of them are economically vulnerable and losing health care [insurance] in between jobs. And I said: look, there’s space. You don’t have to wait for a grant. You don’t even have to look at me. Just go in there and do the work.”\n\nIt’s another experiment in the idea of family, Vuong says, since being a writer in America is so tough. “No one helps you make it. So I’ve got an open invitation to my friends – they just have to call. I’ll prep the room. Just come.”","summary":"On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous made him a literary superstar. Now the Vietnamese American author is exploring his working-class roots in an ambitious follow‑up\n\nThere are three kinds of family, muses the novelist and poet Ocean Vuong. There’s the nuclear family, “which often we talk about as the central tenet of American life”. There’s the chosen family, “the pushback”, the community and friendships built by people who have been rejected by their parents, often because of their sexuality or gender identity. And then there’s the family we talk about much less frequently, but spend most of our waking hours within – our colleagues, or what Vuong describes as “the circumstantial family around labour”.\n\nVuong’s forthcoming second novel, The Emperor of Gladness, encompasses them all.

After the 2024 election, Republicans gained control of the White House, Senate and Congress.In early polls surveying Americans on potential 2028 candidates, Harris has been a notable contender along with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowBiden sat down for ABC's The View in his first live televised interview since leaving office.

So, you know, I take responsibility,\" Biden said in part.He attended the interview alongside his wife, former first lady Jill Biden.

Every time Joe Biden emerges, we fight an old war.\"Coley led public affairs under Merrick Garland, former attorney general under Biden. He added that \"Every interview he does provides a contrast to Trump that's just not helpful for the Democratic brand, which needs trusted messengers and fighters who can reach independents and moderates and inspire the base. Joe Biden ain't that.\"He continued by wondering how Biden's interviews are actually helping his party. Coley adds that Democratic leaders \"are just ready to turn the page.

Prevost, as he became the first American pope. \n\nThe same week, former President Joe Biden made his first media appearances since leaving the White House.\n\nVice President JD Vance, a longtime critic of U.S. aid for Ukraine, suggested Russia is “asking for too much” in peace talks, while former Vice President Mike Pence was presented with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, said May 9 the Trump administration is “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, or an individual’s right to challenge their detention in court, as a means of enforcing its hardline immigration policy. \n\n— Presidents, other officials celebrate first American pope \n\nPresident Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, as well as former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, were among the U.S. officials to celebrate the first U.S.-born pontiff. \n\nRead more here. \n\n— Biden rejects reports of cognitive decline in post-White House media blitz \n\nIn his first media appearances since leaving the White House, Biden denied reports of cognitive decline in his final months in office. \n\nA disastrous debate performance in June 2024 — during which he seemed confused and spoke with a very faint voice — crystallized longstanding concerns about Biden’s ability to serve another four-year term, polls showed. It ultimately led to his decision to end his own reelection bid — forgoing the possibility to become the first Catholic president to do so — and endorse his running mate, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Harris lost the presidential election Nov. 5, returning Trump to the office he lost four years earlier. Early exit polls indicated economic concerns ranked among the top issues for voters, and that Catholic voters may have undergone a significant shift to the right since 2020.\n\nA book titled “Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,” by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson is scheduled to be published May 20. Biden’s allies are eager to strengthen the former president’s legacy at a time when many in his party want him to withdraw from the political stage, Politico reported.\n\nIn an interview on The View, during which Biden was joined by his wife, former first lady Jill Biden, the couple disputed reports of his cognitive decline and a subsequent cover-up by aides. \n\n“They are wrong. There’s nothing to sustain that,” former President Biden said of the allegations.\n\nIn his final days in office, OSV News examined how Catholicism is an integral albeit complex part of Biden’s legacy, both in his overt public observance of the faith and in areas where his public policy sometimes diverged from church teaching.\n\n— Vance says Russia is ‘asking for too much’ in Ukraine peace negotiations\n\nVance said May 7 that the Trump administration believes Russia is “asking for too much” during peace negotiations as the Trump administration seeks to deliver a campaign promise to bring an end to the conflict.\n\nA skeptic of U.S. aid for Ukraine, Vance played a role in the breakdown of a tense February Oval Office meeting with Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But he said at a Munich Leaders Meeting on international security policy in Washington, “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions, in order to end the conflict.” \n\n“We think they’re asking for too much,” Vance, who is Catholic, said.\n\nAsked about Vance’s comments later the same day, Trump said, “It’s possible that’s right.”\n\n“We are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made,” said Trump, who has previously indicated he may have the U.S. walk away from the negotiations if he is not satisfied by their progress.\n\n“I’m not happy about it,” Trump said. “I’m not happy about it.”\n\nTrump, who as a candidate repeatedly said that he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in 24 hours” upon taking office, recently reached his 100th day in office without having secured a resolution. \n\nCatholic leaders have long called for an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n— Trump aide: White House ‘actively looking at’ suspending habeas corpus\n\nStephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told reporters May 9, “The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion.”\n\n“So, I would say that’s an option we’re actively looking at,” he said.\n\nThe principle, which can be traced to the Magna Carta, the 1215 charter guaranteeing certain civil and political liberties in England, is enshrined in Article I of the U.S. Constitution. Habeas corpus has been suspended in some form a handful of times during wartime since the Constitution was enacted, including during the Civil War and after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. \n\nSome Trump allies have advocated for the suspension of habeas corpus in the U.S. as a means of facilitating mass deportations.\n\nIn a February letter to the U.S. bishops, Catholics and all people of goodwill, about issues of migration in the U.S. the late Pope Francis acknowledged “the right of a nation to defend itself and keep communities safe from those who have committed violent or serious crimes while in the country or prior to arrival.” But he urged the defense of “the legitimacy of norms and public policies in the light of the dignity of the person and his or her fundamental rights.”\n\n“This is not a minor issue: an authentic rule of law is verified precisely in the dignified treatment that all people deserve, especially the poorest and most marginalized,” Pope Francis wrote. “The true common good is promoted when society and government, with creativity and strict respect for the rights of all — as I have affirmed on numerous occasions — welcomes, protects, promotes and integrates the most fragile, unprotected and vulnerable. This does not impede the development of a policy that regulates orderly and legal migration. However, this development cannot come about through the privilege of some and the sacrifice of others.”\n\nHe then warned, “What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly.”\n\n— Pence receives John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award\n\nFormer Vice President Pence was presented with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on May 4 for his refusal to reject the results of the 2020 election despite pressure from Trump to do so, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum announced. \n\nPreviously Trump’s Trump’s running mate in the 2016 and 2020 elections, Pence broke with the president by rejecting Trump’s unfounded claims of a stolen election and certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election despite the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn comments at a Boston ceremony, Pence acknowledged some differences of opinion with the Democrats in the room, but said, “To forge a future together, we have to find common ground.” \n\n“I hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It’s what binds us across time and generations,” Pence said, adding, “It’s what makes us one people.”\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, Pence rejected the Secret Service’s advice that he leave the Capitol building. He insisted on remaining in place for the ceremonial certification of Biden’s election.\n\n“By God’s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America,” Pence said, calling Jan. 6, 2021, “a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom.”\n\nHe said, “History will record that our institutions held.” \n\nThe award, named for the nation’s first Catholic president, is presented annually to public servants “for making a courageous decision of conscience,” the late president’s memorial foundation said.\n\nKate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington.

Hopefully long enough to finally finish my point about Kamala!”\n\n Moments before Kinsey fell to the floor, she was speaking about former President Joe Biden’s recent comments on The View about why he thinks Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election. “This is what they have to do; they have to rewrite history because they had a failed campaign; they had a failed presidency,” she said to Jonathan Hunt. “She never went to the border. This is about incompetency. It’s not about, uh, ideology, or uh, it’s not about…”\n\n On Thursday, Biden shared that he wasn’t surprised by the election outcome, saying, “They went the sexist route — this is a woman, she’s this, she’s that,” he said. “I’ve never seen such as successful and consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country and a woman of mixed race.”","summary":"The contributor fell to the ground during an interview segment Thursday night.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fox-news-camryn-kinsey-faints-on-tv-1236212423/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-09-at-3.47.04 PM-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 21:50:44","author":"Lexi Carson","authors":["Lexi Carson"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"bz","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":319722586,"title":"Do These Libertarians Regret Voting for Donald Trump?","text":"During the 2024 presidential election, a contingent of libertarians cast strategic, often reluctant votes for Donald Trump, arguing he was the lesser of two evils.

Check against the original before quoting.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Do you regret your Trump vote? Just asking questions. We're a little over 100 days into the second Trump administration. Though it kind of feels like more as the president came in hot with an arsenal of executive orders reshaping the immigration system, the federal bureaucracy and the global economy. You might recall that Trump made an explicit appeal to libertarians to vote for him showing up at the Libertarian Party Convention tomake his pitch. Many libertarians feeling queasy about a Kamala Harris presidency and underwhelmed by the state of the Libertarian Party decided to give Trump 2.0 a try. We've got three of them here today, including my co-host Liz Wolf and another of my Reason colleagues J.D. Tuccille. Dave Smith, host of Part of the Problem podcast, also joins us. I think it's fair to describe them all as reluctant Trump voters who had some serious reservations about various aspects of his agenda and maybe his character, but felt that the other options were worse. And so this seems like a good time to just reflect on how things are going so far from a libertarian perspective. Good to see all of you.\n\nLiz Wolfe: I see you too much.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, yeah, you can just keep it to yourself. You each voted for Trump for slightly different reasons. So let's start there. First, Dave, we had you on before the election to talk about this a little bit, which we will link to that episode. And you told us at the time that \"I might be casting the most unenthusiastic vote in the history of voting.\" But your reasoning was that it was purely a vote against Kamala Harris. Let's roll the tape to see exactly why you thought she deserved to lose at the time. \n\nDave Smith:(CLIP) I've never seen anything like the Kamala Harris campaign. There's not even anything else you could compare it to where on every level it doesn't exist. Like there's nothing. She didn't win a primary. She ran for president four years ago and didn't make it to Iowa. She's walked away from every single position that she was running on four years ago without explaining why. \"That was five years ago. Ha ha ha ha\". That's it. But oh, by the way, she's the sitting vice president. Is she running on the current administration? No. And why not? Because I'm not Joe Biden. Hey, like, it's just nothing there. And to watch her, you know, what really did it for me was this rehabilitate the Cheney's that I just was like, what are we what are we doing here? And to me, for you know for everything the Democrats have done over the last really eight years. Um, starting with framing the sitting president for, uh, treason for these claims that he was a Russian spy, which were totally all, they produce nothing. Then they were the, um, the party of lockdowns and, uh mandates, which, okay, the Republicans were bad on too, but no question. They kind of branded themselves that then they were all in on this disastrous war in Ukraine, which has done nothing except get hundreds of thousands of people killed. And then they're gonna essentially coup the president of the United States of America who they had spent four years pretending was not in severe mental decline and and now to run somebody who's just nothing who's going around campaigning with Liz Cheney is just enough for me that you deserve to lose forever. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Okay, so about 100 or so days in, and kind of imagine, I guess, the counterfactual Kamala Harris presidency. How are you feeling about things, Dave? \n\n Dave Smith: I'm, uh, I enjoy talking to you guys much more from home than a hotel room. That's my reflection on that. Man, I hate being in hotels all the time. Uh, yeah, I mean, you know, running the counterfactual Kamala Harris, I think is a little bit difficult, um, because I don't know, you know what, it's hard to say exactly what her presidency would have been. Like my, uh my default assumption is that it would have I don't think it would have just been a continuation of the Biden administration. I think it wouldn't have been a ramp up. And I think we also talked about on that show that one of my major motivations for supporting Trump was that I thought it would really be a death blow to the corporate media and it would be kind of like the coronation. Like this had kind of already happened, but it made it official that the alternative internet world is the mainstream and that the corporate media is dead. And, and I, I got into arguments with this, but like with some people who I think are very smart, who I respect very much. Um, I remember arguing with Robby Soave.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Believe it or not, that's his real name, folks. \n\nDave Smith: Robby was basically saying, which he had a fair argument for, he was like, well, look, like the first time Donald Trump won, it actually drove the ratings up for the corporate media. And my thought was that it's not going to work this time. And I thought so much of that was driven by the Russiagate stuff. And post Russiogate being exposed, and post the entire COVID narrative falling apart, I just think they had no more bullets left in the chamber. Like there was nothing they could say. That's going to actually get people to want to tune in and listen. So for now, if I'm running the counterfactual, if Kamala Harris had won. In many ways, I think that would have signaled that no, actually, the corporate media still does matter more. And that even though Donald Trump, even though Joe Rogan and Theo Von and all these guys had Trump on, that didn't move the needle as much. And so almost completely aside from the politics of it, just like on a cultural level, I think this is a lot of why so much of the woke insanity has totally receded. It's just kind of like, oh, they lost this epic battle therefore we recognize the side that's won. Almost every Democrat, I shouldn't say almost, there's a sliver of them who still want to cling to it, but almost every Democrat now recognizes that's like, oh we can't push this radical cultural agenda anymore, it's gonna cost us elections. And so for that you know, and for the reasons I laid out there, I do, I, I still feel that way. Um, I think that, you know, the Donald Trump first hundred days have been, you know like a clown show in a lot of ways, there's been some really terrible policies, um, and there's been some good ones too. But at this point, I'm not feeling like, Oh, I regret my vote. I'd, I'd still at this point, you would say, Oh thank God we dodged the bullet of Kamala Harris. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Any reactions to that, JD or Liz, this idea that Trump was, it had to be done because there had to be a repudiation of the kind of gatekeepers that ushered us through COVID. And that is a major upside of Trump 2.0. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I mean, there's an element of David's thinking of what I did. I think I described at the time my first ambiguous exploration and reason for voting for Trump, but then I openly wrote for National Post that I was voting for him, but I said I was engaged in damage control and. \n\nZach Weissmueller: I've got your reasoning right here, you said Trump, scumbag though he is, could be less bad than the empty vessel for the control freaks around her that is Kamala Harris. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah and uh… That was my attitude then. Now is the Trump 2.0 presidency perhaps a little shittier than even I anticipated yes it is uh… I can't say I regret it i knew it was a gamble at the time. I thought the choices we face were actually awful uh… I liked Chase Oliver as a candidate for the Libertarian Party was uh… Shambolic is still shambolic and rebuilding so I uh… By cut through the dice and said you know what at least if we disrupt what what is a and by administration Kamala Harris administration that is heavily integrated with the permanent government the civil service with the political class with the elite, if we disrupt that a little bit maybe we can at least get a different variety a less organized variety of all hold us for a little while and and break up what has been a bad experience with the Biden/Harris uh you know presidency uh nothing either of them were in control i don't think i think the aids around works just as much the decision-making power. So, do I regret it? I don't really regret it. I'm also not happy about my vote. It just was what it was in an effort to exercise damage, to engage in damage control in a bad situation. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Can I ask you about one other aspect of your reasoning for voting for him? You said you were kind of standing in solidarity with your wife who felt that the left's anti-Semitism was just getting out of control. How do you feel on that front? Because there's definitely been a pivot towards combating anti-semitism, but from a libertarian perspective, it's kind of manifested in these. Crackdowns on speech on campus and even, you know, pulling visas and green cards from people for engaging in protest activities, what are your reflections on that particular point? \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I mean, I was and am concerned about the antisemitic turn of the Democratic Party. I'm not pleased with how the Trump administration enacts even its good ideas, but the way I look at it is that we were given a choice between a nativist, economically illiterate authoritarian political party, the Republicans, and an antisemitic, economically, you know, illiterate totalitarian political party which is the Democrats. And I'm deeply concerned about antisemitism. They're really, my wife is an observant Jew. I mean, you know, that's a matter of concern for me. And there are two places in the world now that are probably safe for Jews to live. And that's the United States and Israel. You know, Jews are kind of running out of places where they can live and openly, you know, observe their faith and be visibly Jewish. Uh… Even Canada uh… Is going through a major turmoil and an open and accidentally some business tax on jewish schools and synagogues so uh… That is a major concern now is the Trump administration going about this the right way. Well I'm not gonna lose too much sleep about pulling money away from Harvard University, Columbia University depriving any of the uh… Universities of government money uh… Do I think that people ought to be busted just for writing an op-ed? No, I absolutely don't think that's the case, even if it's horrendous out there. Expressing hateful ideas. But a lot of this stuff crosses that line, like what we saw at Columbia University yesterday in the library, when two security guards were driven away in ambulances after there was a quasi-riot in the library on a pro-Hamas protest. So yeah, this is definitely part of my reasoning, is that I'm troubled by the anti-Semitic turn of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Which is I think still dominant now, even though the Democratic Party is going through what Republicans won through say five or eight years ago, which is kind of a re-examination of what it stands for and it's something of a breakup that may result in a coalescing new form. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Liz let me invite you both to react to anything that they said and also read you your own words back to you Remember you asked for this It's I think you \n\nLiz Wolfe: I think doing this panel just to correct the record 100% was not my idea. It was my idea while stoned. I was literally like smoking a joint on my patio and I was like, wait a second. I'm so annoyed by people on Twitter always asking me if I regret my Trump vote. What if we just got a whole bunch of Trump voters together and explored that question. So I messaged it to Zach and naturally Zach was like okay sure whatever. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, this is your chance to clear the air of weed smoke and also all the smoke on Twitter. This is, I mean, so what you said at the time was that the democracy subverting activities of January 6th disturbed me as did tariffs, but I'm more optimistic about the economic conditions that will arise as a result of a Trump administration. And I was pleased with his Supreme Court fix during his first term. Price controls, court packing, and massive amounts of government spending, which I expect to accompany a Harris presidency, will simply not work for me. So what do you, how, what's your reflection, how do you feel about things now? \n\nLiz Wolfe: I mean, I don't really regret my vote because I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about who I voted for. I think libertarians have historically been completely correct in basically saying your vote doesn't matter to the degree that you think. You are probably best served sitting at home. It's just really not going to turn the outcome of an election. And the fact that people spend so much time sort of shaming people over this type of thing is really, it's just such a waste of breath and energy. That said… I always saw Trump, and I think I could have articulated this better at the time, I always saw Trump as a very high upside, very high downside candidate. And I think the thing that's been really frustrating for me is that so far we've seen pretty much all downside. In the early days, I was feeling really optimistic about what DOGE could do. And I recall reading the news about the CFPB being dismantled and like sending that link to a few of my friends and just feeling like, wow, I've been so vindicated. This is awesome. And DOGE seems like the only sort of hope of actually meaningfully reducing the size of government, at least in my lifetime that we've seen, like, this is incredible. And it's just absolutely wild how that really has not come to fruition. I think as it was initially conceived of by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, I think it could have been successful in that form when Vivek was sort of kicked off of the project and it became an Elon Musk initiative entirely. Um, it somehow just became, you know, profoundly unsuccessful. And I think a lot of their sloppiness and accounting has really kind of discredited some of the limited government cause, which makes me concerned from like a 4D chess political perspective, like does this sabotage government slashing efforts for like a decade to come, I hope not, but it's possible and then in a bunch of other areas too, it's just been. Absolutely horrible, you know, trying to make sense of what his tariff policy actually is and why. And what he wants those final amounts to be. I mean, the announcing of reciprocal tariffs has been such a problem. I'm concerned about that as well as the sort of constant 90 day pauses. And then immigration policy, you look at the degree to which he's just really aggressive with deportations. And look, there's some amount of like, deportation was never going to be, soft and cuddly and fuzzy, right? Like it was never gonna be sealing the border again and rolling back some of the Biden era chaos. Was never going to be something that looked good. But the way that the Trump administration has done it has been just shockingly, appallingly bad. And I really do think that there's like such an erosion of due process, which leaves me feeling like, how do we possibly get people to care about this again? The number of fellow Americans who I've seen justifying that type of behavior by the Trump administration is really, really frustrating to me, especially because using that alien enemies act to attempt to deport these people. Keeps getting swatted down by various judges. We saw the Fourth Circuit especially issue a really scathing rebuke. And I'm just a little bit like, you know, like even Trump appointed judges don't agree that the Alien Enemies Act can be used in this way. And I think that's a really big problem. I think the mechanism by which we do this really does matter. \n\n Dave Smith: On that topic, yeah, go ahead, please do. No, there was something, what Liz said up top there, I feel like I just wanted to like stress because there is something that I've, it's very interesting the way a lot of libertarians do react to voting at all. And it's almost as if in some weird way. They buy into the same principle that statists do. And like, I remember there was this one, one time, many years ago, I was on a Fox news show. I was on Kennedy, uh, and Julie Roginsky, who's like a Democratic strategist. She, at one point, like I forget what it was, but it was like, I criticized Hillary Clinton, and then she was like oh, so you must love Donald Trump, you know, the typical thing libertarians are used to getting, and I was like no, I actually don't like him either. And she was, like, wait, so who did you vote for? And I was, I didn't vote. And she goes, this is all on air, and she goes well, if you don't vote, then you can't complain. And I'm like, really? Because I'm about to. So like that's, it's like, that's like an, it is an empirical claim, and I'm about to demonstrate that that's not true. And every libertarian recognizes immediately like how ridiculous that is but then they almost apply the inverse when they find out like you're voting for one of the major party candidates like oh well now you're responsible for all of the bad and it's like all of this is so ridiculous it's like look from libertarian first principles you can deduce that like we're under duress. We are forced into we're forced into a false binary where that shouldn't exist. But one of these two people is gonna be president and it's completely reasonable for libertarians to say I find one of them to be slightly preferable to the other one. So I'm gonna throw a vote their way and see what ends up coming of all of that. So that was kind of just my I just I found it very interesting watching like how people how libertarians implicitly like conceptualize what voting is as if this means it's like a full endorsement of everything that this person has ever done or said or whatever they will do in the future rather than what it really is which is essentially a strategic guess you're kind of going like \n\nLiz Wolfe: This is the thing that's like wrinkled me so much in the aftermath of my scandalous Trump vote, which has been the number of people who respond to me constantly on Twitter or YouTube or whatever and say, you voted for this whenever I'm criticizing a Trump policy. And it's like, yes, I voted for this candidate extremely reluctantly, but I didn't endorse every single thing that you would end up doing. And wouldn't you, in fact, rather have people who will vote for a candidate and still retain their independence and their ability to you know, critically assess each specific policy that this president puts forth and then is able to call balls and strikes and say, this policy is good, this policy's not aligned with my values. Like, it's confusing to me, and especially for a journalist to do that, like it's confusing to me what they want. Do they want me to vote for Trump and then become like a MAGA-tard Trump sycophant and just, you know be super, super excited about every single thing his administration does? Like, would they feel better served by me doing that? I wouldn't feel good. By me doing that. I feel much better about saying, look, I made an educated guess. So far, I don't really like how the guess is working out. It's not really aligned with my values and beliefs. As a libertarian, I consistently feel like there's no good option available to me. And you know what? The only thing I can do as a journalist for the next four years is try to be honest about what is good, what is bad, and what I know and what I don t know about what Trump's doing. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I'm gonna get down on that. Yeah, go ahead. I was just gonna say, I mean, I am just amazed. I've known people for decades who will come at me with, and it's clear that they kind of live at the intersection of tribalism and retardation, because it's a matter of being, they insist that you be all in. You're either entirely on Team Red or entirely on Team Blue, and they can't, and they're angry with me. They're furious because I write some columns that say, yeah, I think DOGE is a good idea. I'm going to scare the Department of Education. And then I write a piece saying, no, Trump's way over the top with executive actions and his trade policy is insane. So yeah, tribalism, the insistence that political identity is all, is a be all and end all. And actually, this is a good way to riff and say this. I've recently seen two studies, one from 2017 from Stanford, another from Political Psychology published recently. Both said that now political identity overshadows race and ethnicity as a matter of personal identification. And a source of interpersonal animus in this country. So yeah, people live in this kind of intersection of, and I'll say it again, of retardation and tribalism. And they insist that you go all in on this identity instead of saying, you know, the vote worked out or the vote didn't work out, and I think I'll just be critical of the policy, the action, the politician rather than the candidate. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah. Let me, uh, triple down on that and say that it's, I think that the less, the more people can avoid letting a vote warp their brain, um, the better off we will all be. Um, I've increasingly come to view it as a harm reduction type of thing where it's like whoever wins, this is not going to be good for America, but is there a choice that is going to be less harmful for America? And if the answer to that is no, then. You can not vote, that was my decision, but this year, last time I made a different decision. We kind of bring this on ourselves at Reason by publishing our votes publicly and just for the record, so people get an understanding. We had 12 Chase Oliver voters, six non-voters, including myself, three Kamala Harris voters, and two write-ins and two Trump voters, to both who are on this show with us. Right now I want to keep going into some of the specific issues one that Liz raised was deportations and I'm really curious to get Dave's thoughts on this because I think Dave, you're the most kind of friendly to immigration restrictions of the libertarians on this podcast. However, there are some rule of law issues. The Supreme Court did order the government to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia from this El Salvadoran prison. So far that seems not to be happening at all. What are your feelings about this? Do you have any sort of rule of law type concerns around this particular issue? \n\n Dave Smith: Um, yes. And I think, yeah. And you know, uh, um, I think it's already sold out, but I think they stream it, but of course Reason magazine, uh or Reason I always call you guys Reason magazine even though the magazine is the least of it these days, but it's just, that's what's in my brain for eternity. \n\nLiz Wolfe: At least you don't call us ReaCNN. \n\n Dave Smith: That's, I've never, I'd never been known for that. I may have called you \"Treason Magazine\" once, but I was particularly mad at you. I think Brian Doherty had written an anti-Ron Paul piece and he got me pissed off or something like that. But, I love you guys. I've always been on record. You two are, this is my favorite show, that Reason does. But, you know, there's like, okay, so I'm doing a debate at the Soho Forum, which is a Reason, you know, event on immigration. I'm sorry about that. In a couple weeks so check that out there is put it out online so yes i am an immigration restrictionist and in fact i even think that i i'd personally believe and i think this is consistent with libertarian principles we've done shows on this before that i think people who uh… I don't think it's a natural right comma uninvited to it uh… Piece of property that you don't own even if it is absurdly claimed by the U.S. government. But regardless of any of that even if you're going to support mass deportations like let's say just like for the sake of argument come at it from the side where you want to see mass deportation and you've kind of won the day in many respects the public opinion of the American people has been pushed far to the right on immigration from the Joe Biden administration. Mass deportations have at least in several polls had super majorities of the American people supporting them. And so what does Donald Trump do at this moment? You know, you've got the American people on your side, you got the president, this is his signature issue. And so again, he does it in a way that would almost you'd think be designed to undermine public support for mass deportations. I mean, it's one thing to say, you came here illegally, you don't have a right to be here, we're gonna ask you to leave. It's another thing to send people to like a torture camp In El Salvador. In a couple instances people who are not from that country it's like this is madness and I would say I think um me and JD may may see things a little bit differently on this but as the I believe the only jewish person on this uh on this show you know I gotta say and somebody who also doesn't like to see like a rise in hatred of Jewish people you know. Wading into the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is one of the most controversial ongoing events in the world, and is a very divisive and polarizing issue. To weigh into that and then deporting legal residents for the crime of having the wrong opinion is just about the worst thing you could do if you don't want to see a rise in Jew hatred. And I would also, obviously in terms of the policy, I support defunding all of the universities. College is essentially one giant government program that should be abolished just like basically every other government program. But again, to defund them based on the accusations of antisemitism is the worst thing in the world you could do if you want to see a decrease in hatred of Jewish people. Particularly after for at least fifteen years all of these universities have been hotbeds for the most vicious anti white bigotry imaginable I mean it's just like it's it's been totally institutionalized and taught into the entire curriculum that it's just okay to be viciously horrible toward straight white men and there's entire entire departments dedicated to it and so then to defund it i mean just plays right into the stereotype of like oh yes see the one group you're not allowed to accuse. It does nothing but give red meat to the Jew haters whose arguments are pretty stupid and like we don't need to give them any more red meat. So I think all of that has been terrible. I think that Donald Trump essentially had about as big of a like you know I don't like the term mandate. I know politicians always like to use it. I think it's kind of an anti libertarian idea that you ever have a mandate but Donald Trump coming back in and this time winning all the swing states and the popular vote and the corporate media being defeated. He had a real shot in the arm to get some amazing things done in the beginning of his presidency. I think he did a few good things, but at this point, a hundred days in, it is kind of like, I think he's blown that already now. And unfortunately, we're just back to kind of where we were. His approval ratings are, he had his highest approval ratings at the beginning and they're already right back down to where they were because just all of this stuff is so It's obviously clown show stuff. I mean, and the deportations and the tariff stuff, I think are right at the top of the list of that. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Stuff there. JD, I'm curious to hear your reaction to this notion that paradoxically Trump may have laid the ground for increasing antisemitism, but also just the general sense that, you know, it was articulated by Ezra Klein in this video essay he did where he said the emergency is here, like the threat to rule of law has escalated so bad that we're facing, like it's It's finally here. We're facing that constitutional crisis. Do you buy that it's like things are that bad? Like it is an emergency. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Well, I mean, two part question, two-part answer. He is definitely, in the way he's gone about, responding to some of the students, the other people here on student visas who expressed hateful ideas, but only expressed hateful ideas, and didn't engage in violence or criminal actions. The way he has gone about that has given them the excuse to act as martyrs. And so it creates a sense of martyrdom when he's visibly suppressing, punishing people for their speech. Rather than for their conduct. Others are being punished for conduct. So is that a problem? Yeah, it is. Because if you give people who are hateful, who are potentially dangerous in some ways, if you give them an excuse to wrap themselves in the flag of martyrdom, you can reinvigorate the movement and definitely give them a certain energy, you can have a lift under their wings. Beyond that, the rule of law, the due process, yeah, there seems to be, even when… Trump is on to something that is important and valid. He seems dedicated to doing it in the cruelest and most self-aggrandizing way he possibly can. And I think that is largely because the man has a walking personality disorder. He's heavy on narcissism. And everything, there has to be an expression of his will. It can't be, well, let's implement these policies and wanna go through the system that might be established by law and by the Constitution. No, it's got to be the CEO handing the orders down and getting it done right now, even if it's in violation of established rights, of protections for rights, and of legal process for getting things done, if you actually find somebody against whom action might legitimately be taken. And so at the end of the day, yes, he does create martyrs. He's a threat to due process. And yeah, he has no regard, so far as I can tell, for abiding by the Constitution, for abiding court orders, and for abiding by the dictates of a system that is a political system and not a corporate structure that he personally owns. \n\nZach Weissmueller: What about you, Liz? Do you have any thoughts on the rule of law question?\n\nLiz Wolfe: Oh, yes. I think, you know, when people talk about Trump's deportation policy, they so frequently bring up the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, which makes sense. You know, he was basically tarred as a member of MS-13 by multiple members of the Trump administration. He was deported to El Salvador originally. He came to the U.S. illegally in, I believe, 2012. It took him like seven years to actually sort of attempt to seek legal status. And he had, you know, one arrest on his record and the cops basically said he looks gang affiliated. But, you know, then he was able to successfully convince a judge that he had credible fear of persecution from gangs because of his family's successful pupusa business in his own country. And so he was to get a sort of withholding of removal that basically shielded him from being deported back to El Salvador. He married a US citizen He was not, you know, a legal permanent U.S. resident, but he had a child who was an American citizen and a wife. And he was sent to CECOT, to El Salvador's, you know terrible maximum security prison without really getting sufficient trial, without getting the ability to sort of contest the charges against him that he was MS-13 affiliated. And to be able to make the case for why he ought to be to stay, or at least not to be deported back to that place that he had withholding removal from. Most people know of that case, right? Everyone's heard of that. They don't necessarily know the case of Ricardo Prado Vazquez, the Venezuelan migrant who was I think doing like a door dash job or something near the Canada-U.S. Border, took a wrong turn, went over the bridge, attempted to reenter the United States, was detained, was then sent to ICE custody. And then his family hasn't heard from him since then. He was confirmed to be deported from the United States. And the US government appears to have lost track of him. They don't know what happened to him or where he went. There's also, by the way, no indication that he's gang affiliated and his child hasn't heard from him for I think over a month now. You know, you look at the flights of Venezuelans who were deported, not to Venezuela because the Venezuelan government won't accept them, but to El Salvador. And you have these flights of, you know, 238 Venezuelans or like the New York Times did a long investigative feature, basically saying. Are these people the worst of the worst, as the Trump administration claims? Well, if you actually cross-check their records and look through a whole bunch of crime databases in Colombia, in Peru, in El Salvador, in Venezuela, in places where these people might have lived or passed through, you don't actually turn up a lot of evidence that indicates that all 238 of these people are brutal rapists and murderers. There is some number, I think it was roughly two dozen, that do have wrap sheets like that. And then some other fraction have more minor offenses, like much more minor, like stealing something, like petty theft. And then a whole bunch of those people actually don't have a criminal record. Actually, there's no information that links them to Tren de Aragua or any other sort of violent gang. At least to me, the fact that the Trump administration feels so comfortable saying, these people are all rapists and murderers. They're all MS-13, they're all Tren De Aragwa, and they feel comfortable deporting these people. Cutting off contact with their family, cutting off with lawyers, and in some cases, sending them to a maximum security prison where it's totally unclear what their fate will be. I mean, I don't feel good about this. And many people basically say, what did you expect? Did you expect a court date? Did you accept a habeas trial for every single person deported? With the scale of the migrant crisis under Biden, that was always impossible. And I think my response is, well, we're America. And we have certain constitutional guarantees. And it is important to me that our executive follows the orders of different court rulings, including the Supreme Court's ruling, which has said that Trump needs to facilitate the return to the United States of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. We consistently see Trump appointed judges basically slapping down the logic, the justifications that he's using. And look, I'm not saying that it should be a situation where every single migrant who has a sob story or who married a US citizen or who is a father gets total and complete amnesty forever. That's not what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that we do have the procedural mechanisms to ensure that people get their day in court and they at least get to contest the allegations against them, or maybe bare minimum, we could just not have members of the Trump administration lying about how violent and how heinous and how gang-affiliated these people actually are. Some of them very much are, and the most violent people absolutely do need to leave our country and be locked up for a long time. But it's important to me to be careful about this. I think anybody who actually cares about justice, who cares about crime, who cares about public safety, owes it to themselves and to other people to be honest and to be very careful with how they sort of sift through evidence. And I just think it's frankly very offensive that the Trump administration hasn't done that. And I worry about what type of precedent that sets. When we ignore due process and when we ignore lower court rulings, what exactly do we become?\n\nZach Weissmueller: Well, yeah, that's what I want to ask about, just to elaborate on one thing Liz was saying, and this will be open to anybody, maybe you'll have thoughts on it, JD, is I think that when it comes to thinking about the rights of immigrants, whether it's citizens or permanent residents or just people who are here on a visa, it seems like the kind of thing that is hard to get. Americans, a lot of Americans care about it. I think libertarians are particularly attuned to individual rights, whether it's the rights of an immigrant or, you know, stretching back to 9-11. You know, we were the people saying, like, maybe don't send these quote-unquote suspected terrorists to Guantanamo, or they are going to be hauled away with no rights. And that was not a popular position at the time. I wonder if… Like, do you think that there's any way that is there any way to get people to care about this and think about it in terms and like, should they care about it? Should they think about going beyond affecting this, you know, unpopular group of people known as illegal immigrants?\n\nLiz Wolfe: Well, my question to them is like, what exactly happens once Trump starts ignoring Supreme Court rulings? Like what actually happens, like truly, I don't think we want to know. I don' t think we wanna find out. And it's just wild to me that so few people have this sense of, you don't have to and you in fact shouldn't have allegiance to the Imperial executive, to any one branch of government, but you should have a respect for the way that checks and balances get to sort of curb the power. Of the executive when it's overreaching in the way that it has. And I am very concerned about what happens when you repeatedly undermine the judiciary. Like, where do we go from there if the Supreme Court can just be completely ignored by an executive that's very power hungry? Sorry, Jared.\n\nJ.D. Tuccille: No, no problem at all. I was going to say, I mean, one of the things, one way to get people perhaps a little more open to the idea, because I know people are not necessarily sympathetic to the courts. When we say due process, they imagine a long, drawn out process and, you know, but fundamental due process. The basis of it is proving an allegation. And a lot of people jump to the ideas, okay, the government's rounding up illegal immigrants who don't have a right to be here. Well, how about asking the government to demonstrate they've got the right people? Because that's the fundamental element of due process, that you actually have the person you claim that you have, that this person actually is an illegal immigrant and not a citizen that you've misidentified or maybe somebody who an ICE agent happens to have his eye on the guy's wife. I mean, we don't know. That's the fundamentals of due processes, proving you have the right person. It's the very first step. And if we can at least get to that point, I think we could work from there. It doesn't necessarily have to be a year-long trial for each and every single person who's accused of being an illegal immigrant. It might just be, how about making the government prove that this person is the person you say it is? You got the right name, and it's actually an illegal emigrant and not a citizen you misidentified.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Well, this is the really frustrating thing about the degree to which so much of the sort of collective media imagination has been occupied by Kilmar Abrego-Garcia's case. It's like we're all interested in reading the tea leaves to try to ascertain whether or not he is an MS-13 member and like his finger tattoos. What exactly does the marijuana leaf mean? What does President Trump think about that? And it's like, well, in a sense, this was a huge waste of time because when Trump came into office, he had to use Dave's hated phrase, a mandate to crack down on open board, open borders, I put in quotes, but like Biden era rampant immigration, he had mass popular approval for that. And it's a waste of our time to be focused on whether or not the marijuana leaf signifies MS-13, whether or not the skull tattoo signifies that, because the thing that should really matter is, is this person in the country legally? Is there a withholding of removal or not that prevents them from deportation? Are they legally eligible for deportation?\" And there's lots of people who absolutely fall under that criteria. So we really don't need to adjudicate whether or not they're Trendy or Agua or MS-13. And I think that our sort of, you know, popular health would actually be very well served by coming up with a system of doing that. And I think the Trump administration is being a lot more careful about making sure they're not tarring and feathering people who don't really deserve that. Like it should be. Enough just to say this person is in the country illegally, you know, we have a mandate to crack down on that type of thing, therefore we are deporting them and we're deporting in sort of like the most reasonable, low cost way possible where they're legitimately released into their home country and that's that. But they're not doing that, right? They're making a show of it and they're being, you know, as cruel as can be. And it strikes me as just like, it's like all this like a pageant, it's the show, it's this entertainment for them.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Let me ask about one of the other huge Trump policies of these first hundred days, which Dave brought up earlier, the topic of tariffs. And not only tariffs, but these unilaterally imposed tariffs, which is what has really riled up people like Rand Paul, who's taken a stand against that. We had him on the show to talk about why. We'll link to that. Essentially he thinks it's a wild abuse of executive power, regardless of how you feel about the tariffs themselves. And I think that a lot of libertarians, including me, were very concerned about the Kamala Harris economic agenda. I mean, one of the things I raised as to why I could not vote for her was that one of first and only concrete policy proposals she made was to set price controls on grocery stores. And so, you know, I could never vote for somebody that is economically illiterate, like that's a road to ruin. I would feel horrible about supporting that in any way, in any form whatsoever. But I do think that the markets have been in turmoil because of the kind of unpredictability of this. They're now recovering because Trump has, you know, made this deal with the U.K. and maybe there's more deals to come. Um, but. To me, it's been kind of unilateral, like the president can actually change the entire global economy this way. That's been kind of disturbing. And I think you could make a case that the kind of economic nationalism we're seeing might even be worse than what we would have seen under the Harris administration. Let's start with Dave. What do you think about the tariffs really being the central. And defining features of these first 100 days or so of the Trump administration.\n\n Dave Smith: I mean, just the economic illiteracy of it all is just infuriating. And it's like, you know, being as charitable as I can be here, because there is like, I think, a little bit of nuance to this, where, like, the current dynamic with many countries, is that there are countries that the U.S. subsidizes. Like both subsidize their military. We put them under our nuclear umbrella. We give them article five NATO guarantees of like, you know, helping defend them. And then those countries turn around and put tariffs on our products. And that is an outrage. I mean, that is truly appalling. Like that makes me white hot mad. Like someone should be shot over this. Okay, maybe not that, but it's like, it really is like an outrage Now, obviously, the correct answer, I think, from a libertarian perspective is that, well, then we shouldn't be subsidizing these countries and we should not be guaranteeing their protection, particularly like wealthy countries that are in less debt than we are. But okay, look, you could make an argument that, okay, in order to stop doing that, we would have to get this corrupt Congress, you know what I mean, to act and that's impossible to do. And so… Perhaps in theory, you could say that Trump could threaten tariffs against somebody. And if that resulted in them saying, okay, we'll lower our tariffs on you. If you don't come through with this, there could be a way in which you would threaten tariffs that resulted in lower tariffs for everyone. That would be a positive result. Not the problem is that that's not at all what donald trump's doing and that's not but that's also not the way he himself talks about it i mean he talks about tariffs and as if they are a good in and of themselves and that they make people rich and they may and and this is just totally backward you know i saw there was a a great uh… There's so but uh… If you guys are from a bob murphy is a senior fellow at the mises institute you are a really brilliant economist and he's really really great at the like. At things like this. But I remember, so he was reviewing, there was like a tariff versus free trade debate. And the guy who was arguing on behalf of tariffs, he brought up this Lincoln quote, which I'd never heard before. But the Lincoln quote, evidently is Abraham Ringgit said something like, he goes, you know, when we trade with the world, we get the goods, and they get the money. And when we train with ourselves, we keep the goods and the money. And like, it's one of those quotes that's got like a little bit of a ring to it. And you could see where that would maybe like convince someone to go, Oh yeah, you know, we get the goods out of the body and Bob Murphy's response to it, he just goes, uh, he goes, yeah, the first thing Abraham Lincoln did when the civil war broke out was put a blockade around the South. It's like, oh, I guess he was just trying to make sure they kept the goods and the money, right? Like he was trying to help the South. I'm sure that's why Israel has a blockade around Gaza right now. I'm sure why Churchill put a blockage around Nazi Germany, just because we wanted to help him so much. Bill Clinton just wanted to help Saddam Hussein in the 90s, right, because if you think about this, it's like talking about the minimum wage with leftists. What's the limiting principle here? If tariffs are good and they make us rich, well then why are we messing around with these 30-40% tariffs. Let's put 1,000% tariffs on that. Let's just cut off trade with the rest of the world. In fact, let's cut off the trade between the states. I mean, it's good, right? It's gonna, in fact, let's go off trade between you and your neighbor and everyone just has to produce everything on their own. That way, you keep all of the goods and all of the money and we'll all just be trillionaires, I guess. It's like, it's such economic illiteracy and it's infuriating. And then, and you know, the other thing to it, which I find truly remarkable, is such a huge part of the reason why Donald Trump is president again, right up there at the top, it might be the number one reason, is the price inflation during Joe Biden's presidency. And you know, truth be told, Donald Trump himself was very responsible for a lot of that price inflation, maybe not all of it, but it was on Donald Trump's watch that we locked down the country and printed $6 trillion, and that had a little something to do with prices going up in the following years. And, but for Donald Trump to be able to say, like, oh, you know, you have 30 dolls, maybe your kid will have two, as if, like the obvious follow up questions to that aren't like, okay, and what about the kid who's only got two dolls? Oh, they just get none, I guess. But the idea that first of all there's things that are a lot more important than dolls for your kids that the prices of which are going up. But the idea that anyone would, after the last few years, downplay the damage that rising prices does is just, it's disgusting. I mean, and this is a point of the picture where like, social conservatives really need to learn economics. Like social conservatives really need to learn their libertarian lesson because the truth is that it's not just like oh rising prices over here but that's just economic stuff over here like then we have these social issues over here they're all interrelated i mean rising prices destroys families it's the number one reason for divorce is financial stress this is this is what breaks up families this is What leads to little kids growing up without their dad around this is leads to men swallowing pistols this like it is It is a devastating force for working class and poor people when your prices go up. And there's something so elitist about it. Like, you know, like, look, I'm doing pretty well these days. If groceries go up by 30 percent, like I do, I'm annoyed, but it's not like the end of the world for me. But this is something like when you're a family, if you have the median household income in the United States is, I think, like high 70s, like 79 grand a year or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 5 Or something like that.\n\n Dave Smith: Right around $80,000 a year. Like if you're making the median household income and you have three or four kids and groceries go up by 20% or 30%, it is devastating. It ruins people's lives. And yeah, so it's bad economics and I can't believe that after the last few years, MAGA supporters can talk about rising prices as if it's not a big deal when it is maybe immigration was number one, it depends on which poll you look at, but it was either number one or number two, the reason why Donald Trump is president again.\n\nZach Weissmueller: And, you know, there was this hope, I think, that libertarians were going to exert some influence on MAGA. We had people like Vivek Ramaswamy in there, who was calling for this Libertarian Nationalist Alliance, and he was just kind of kicked to the curb. And now, history kind of repeats itself in this way, too. We were talking, when we talked with Vivek on this show, we talked a little bit about. How during the Pat Buchannon run, there was this alliance as well. And then basically Pat Buchannon ended up by the end, he was talking about trade wars, like every single time on the campaign trail. And there was a good retrospective written about this, about why it all fell apart that we can link to. But I'm curious to get Liz's thoughts on the tariffs, because you—you mentioned specifically in your reason to vote for Trump that the economic agenda, like me, you had major concerns. And I'm specifically interested to hear you talk a little bit about what Dave raised at the beginning there, this idea that maybe tariffs as a pure negotiating tool to eliminate. Trade barriers, to force other countries to drop their tariffs, maybe that is defensible.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Yeah, my sort of Trump theory of mind is that he's, I think, a little smarter than many people give him credit for. And so I am always interested in entertaining the possibility that this is in fact a grand negotiating tactic to attempt to impose really tough trade barriers that can induce other countries to come to the negotiating table and then decide to lower their trade barriers. If that is his goal, he's doing it in kind of an insane way, because for example, it was just announced this morning that the US and the UK have reached a trade deal. Okay, well, it's not like the U.K. was slapping massive tariffs on the United States. And so getting those tariffs removed, if that is in fact what will result, is not some huge win. I'm sorry, that's just pretty negligible. That's pretty minor. And so what he appears to be doing is not getting to an entirely zero tariff, complete free trade future. But something entirely different. And so I always want to like entertain, I don't want TDS to destroy my brain and I want there to always be this ability to say, hmm, is there this like 4D chess move that he is attempting to play and he's looking, you know, seven moves ahead and I'm not understanding that. Like, right, like I'm always interested in that. I'm gonna go full Scott Adams with it, but I think that it is good for people to think in those terms with Donald Trump. That said, it's so clear, you know, what Dave was saying is 100% correct. Trump appears to have this complete and total affinity for tariffs. He seems to be deeply worried about trade deficits just innately by nature of what they are without seeming to understand what they are. And when you look at the approach of his administration, it's very concerning to me, the number of Trump sink offenses, Trump boosters who seem to be. So down with excusing how much havoc this will wreak on the normal American family. And you look at, okay, well, people aren't having enough kids and his administration seems somewhat sympathetic to ideas about how to raise the birth rate. Well, it's not just that there's a bunch of only-tiled American kids out there with 30 dolls, which is intense materialism run amok. It's also big families that are the ones with 30 dollars. When you have eight kids, you have a lot of kid stuff, right? And so the thing that's so frustrating to me is like, he's willing to be so dismissive without understanding that people make lots of very rational choices, given the size of their families and the things that they value. And to act like it's just totally fine for him to basically force them into poverty or into worse living standards than what they've been accustomed to is something that just makes me, it makes me so angry. I was looking at Bari Weiss's tweet. She was excerpting Joe Nocera's work from the Free Press, I don't really know that writer, but she pulled a quote from it, which was, no one anymore on the left or the right denies that globalization has fractured the US, both economically and socially. It has hollowed out once prosperous regions, blah, blah blah, furniture making, car making areas. Okay, I deny that, right? I completely deny that and there's a ton of people who support free trade who can say yes. Globalization and outsourcing and, you know, the decline of manufacturing in the United States has certainly hurt some populations. And there is sort of cultural pain, cultural suffering that happens in those regions. But let's not act like the immense gains from globalization, the immense gain from outsourcing in free trade. Like we can't get into this mindset where we take these things for granted. Because if we do that, we will be in a situation where future generations are poor. Then what we've experienced in our lifetimes. And at least when I think about it, what type of life will my kid have? I don't want poverty for him. I want, you know, the abundance that we've grown accustomed to continue.\n\n Dave Smith: Yeah, there's also this weird conflation that goes on that I feel like Bari Weiss is guilty of there, where it's like, what exactly are you talking about when you say globalization? Like, are you're talking about global governance? Are you talking about the World Economic Forum? Are you talking about the IMF and the World Bank? Are you talking about America being an empire? Are you telling about America fighting seven disastrous wars over the last 25 years? Or are you talking about the fact that we trade with the world? And to just put it all on, Like as if that last one is the culprit in all of this. Like look, the truth is that the deindustrialization of America and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs It's like old, like basic, like Frederick Bastiak stuff. Unless you want to argue that we should block out the sun so that the candle makers can do more business, like unless you're arguing that we should like, like it hurts us if people are making stuff for a more affordable price. The reality is that. And this has been kind of the story of the united states of america rate is that like the size and scope of government just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and you go through woodrow wilson instituting the income tax in the central bank uh… FDR instituting a new deal to linden johnston in instituting that the great society to whatever keep going forward to the George W Bush expansions to the Barack Obama expansions the Donald Trump expansions we've now gotten to a point where we're, I think it's $1.3 trillion in interest on the national debt. Like if we balanced our budget, we still run trillion plus deficits every single year. And we can't tax the people enough and we can borrow enough. So we print the money. Essentially the American worker has to carry the American empire on his back. And then as these new industries aren't coming in to replace the old industries, and now when you don't have a system where like a young guy could get out of high school and get a job where he can support a family we're supposed to sit here and blame the Chinese for producing stuff for us and not look at Washington DC and how much they've robbed from the American people and so like when you talk about globalization yeah I'm an anti-globalist in a lot of senses but not in the sense that we shouldn't trade with the rest of the world It's just the most ridiculous\n\nLiz Wolfe: Oh, go ahead, Jerry.\n\nJ.D. Tuccille: I was just going to say, globalism has just become a bogeyman, for it represents whatever imagined wrongs are in people's heads about engaging with the world or about elites or about whatever it is that's bugging them and how they think the world has gone wrong. But the economic policy, the bad economic policy that has been the response of this has made that much worse, where it's the result not of, say, legislators arguing at coming to bad conclusions, but to the whims of one president. And this is what we're seeing now, I think, is the latest culmination. And unfortunately, it's not the end state, but the latest combination of turning the presidency into an elective monarchy, which we saw, I mean, four years ago, we were talking about Biden having set a new record for the issuance of executive orders, executive actions. Now Trump is invoking these tariffs, to impose these tariffs a 1977 emergency law. It was a bad idea then. People warned it would be misused by presidents. And it can be invoked simply by using the word emergency in an executive order. That's exactly what Trump did. So this is whim driven and it's so bad because it's one person's idea of what a tariff should look like when he wants to engage the entire world, bend the entire word to his will. And what we're seeing in this is kind of like the latest culmination of all the warnings about turning the presidency into a monarchy. And it's gotten as bad as it's been with Trump. And yet wondering how much worse it can get from here, but I'll bet it can actually get worse.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Yeah, and whether it's mourning the sort of decline of manufacturing in the Rust Belt or the decline of agriculture in the Midwest, the thing that's really frustrating to me about the Trump view of the world, and I guess some of the views proffered over by the free press, is that there's just this sense That the US economy is or ought to be static, not this dynamic ever-changing force. And it's like, as we gain the ability to industrialize further and to outsource more things, it is important and necessary and just a normal natural part of growth for industries to shift and for some industries to become defunct. And that's not, you know, like I go to Noleda, Manhattan today, and guess what? It's not all, you know, shirt-waist factors, right? Like, they're not- producing, it's not textile factories, they're not producing garments, right? The garment district no longer does that. That's not something that I lose a bunch of sleep over. And I understand part of the reason we're able to feel good about that is because so much time has passed, whereas with hollowed out, you know, areas with the decline of the Rust Belt, less time has passed. And we're seeing legitimately awful situations where there's lots of deaths of despair and people who are struggling to figure out how to transform their economy and help But it's really frustrating to me that people, I guess like Bari Weiss or folks at the Free Press seem to believe that it's the central planners that ought to sort of like deliver salvation to these people versus the fact that economies naturally go through these transitions. That doesn't mean that it is not very, very hard for the people who incur the cost, but the only thing to do is to continue to embrace a dynamic sense of what is to come. Central planners just can't save you from some of these hardships. I think it's important for libertarians and free marketers to not dismiss these hardships, right? If men are drinking themselves to death and killing themselves because they no longer have dignified work, that's something that as a fellow American, I'm very disturbed by. I'm very worried about that. I just really don't take that lightly. But at the same time, that can't be a reason to reject globalization and to force all Americans everywhere to cut their ability to buy things from other parts of the world. Like that's a crazy logical leap.\n\n Dave Smith: It's a very, a really, really important point, particularly for libertarians to really understand that it's like, it's not, it, it it's like in the same sense as like when Bernie Sanders is pointing out the insanely high healthcare costs and then advocating for universal healthcare. It's like don't, don't downplay the fact that there is a real problem with what he's talking about, just the fact that he's advocating for the worst solution, you know, doesn't mean that there isn't. And I'll tell you, I mean, I know people who like, I know this one like younger couple or like on my wife's side of our family. And they probably, they both work incredibly hard. Um, they're probably make a hundred grand a year between the two of them. I think he makes around 70 and she makes around 30 grand a year or something like that. And, you know, I was talking to him recently and it's like, dude, he's like, how am I ever going to buy a house? The houses around here in the good neighborhoods are going for 900 grand. How does anyone who makes 100 grand a year buy a $900,000 house? I mean, it's just like, and the thing about it is, is that again, what people are missing is they're going, okay, look, there was a time, and this is true, like in my grandfather's day, you literally could go wait online and then get a job at a factory and you could support a family off of that. My grandfather owned his own house, he worked at a factory his whole life. He owned his house, his wife didn't work, they had two cars, they sent two kids to college. Now, you can't do that anymore, but the thing is that it's all about the money. I mean, it's like even sometimes you'll see, Zach, I think me and you might've talked about this once, but you'll like even those leftists will have the charts of like when the working class stopped being able to afford all this stuff.

Jean Carroll weaponization lawsuit against President Trump.”\n\nAnother person close to the president said Joby’s “ties to Reid Hoffman, someone who funded political prosecutions of Donald Trump” were “concerning.”\n\nAnd a Senate Republican aide also claimed that some lawmakers on Capitol Hill were “skeptical of taking meetings” with Joby, “especially given Hoffman’s attacks on Trump and [Elon] Musk.”\n\n“The anonymous claims are ill-informed and inaccurate,” a Joby spokesperson told The Post Friday. “Joby is a proudly American company and global leader, employing over 2000 engineers and other experts, across 40 different US states, and our pioneering aircraft are designed, built and assembled in America.\n\n“From being the first company to deliver an air taxi to the Department of Defense to being the first air taxi to fly a demonstration flight in New York City, the progress we’ve made and the support we’ve received reflects the work of our incredible engineers, not the politics of any individuals.\n\n“We have been actively engaged with the Administration, including the White House, DOT and legislators on certification—as is appropriate for any company pursuing a first-of-its-kind FAA approval. We’ve received strong, bipartisan support across the board. We’ve also been consistent advocates for many of the priorities that DOT and FAA are championing, including air traffic control modernization and ensuring that eVTOL technology is commercialized here in the US.”\n\nJoby went public nearly four years ago as part of a SPAC deal with Hoffman’s blank-check company Reinvent Technology Partners, which was also headed up by Zynga founder Mark Pincus.\n\n“The Jetsons now become real,” Hoffman crowed to Bloomberg Technology in an August 2021 interview.\n\n“It’s Uber meets Tesla in the air — and that can transform space, people’s commutes, stop gridlock and have that not have the climate impact.”\n\nThe Reinvent deal helped seed Joby with more than $1 billion as it began pursuing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications, CNBC reported.\n\nHoffman had served on Joby’s board from the 2020 merger until 2024, but stepped down last year.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder remains a large stakeholder in the company with more than 30 million shares, per its latest quarterly SEC filings last month.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Hoffman donated more than $7 million to a pro-Harris super PAC after having bankrolled legal funding for Carroll’s sex abuse civil suit against Trump through his nonprofit American Future Republic.\n\nHe was replaced on the board last year by Michael Thompson, a Miami Beach-based investor who also helped establish Reinvent Technology Partners.\n\nThompson donated $200,000 to Musk’s America PAC to help re-elect Trump in June 2024, Federal Election Commission filings show, and has been bullish about Joby’s opportunities in Trump’s second term.\n\n“If our thesis on a company like Joby is accurate, you’re going to have the first new transportation modality in 50-plus years — and it’s going to happen in this term,” Thompson predicted on the “Citizen Podcast” last month.\n\nThompson recounted how the “moment for many Americans that air travel became tangible” was when President William Howard Taft watched a member of the Wright Brothers flight school take off from the South Lawn in 1911.\n\n“We’re hoping to replicate that this year and fly the Joby off of the White House lawn,” he said.\n\nOther leading eVTOL makers include Beta Technologies and Archer Aviation.\n\nThe White House, FAA and Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","summary":"Joby Aviation has scored federal approvals and contracts and hopes to begin taking passengers by early 2026.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/09/us-news/electric-air-taxi-firm-joby-aviation-eyes-white-house-landing-but-has-deep-ties-to-anti-trump-billionaire-reid-hoffman/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104175486.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VSjwv2TQ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 21:27:15","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":319709554,"title":"Abigail Spanberger Says She Can Take on Trump Without Bashing Him","text":"That’s an eternity in Democratic politics these days. The president lives to draw attention to himself, and his cuts to the federal workforce and federal spending are doing significant damage to the state of Virginia, where Spanberger is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee.\nYet one reason she is the early front-runner in the race is that Spanberger is so far refusing to allow rage about Trump to dominate the discussion. So when I ask where fighting back against the president ranks among her campaign priorities, Spanberger first talks about the new administration’s negative impact on everything from Virginia research universities to suburban Washington convenience stores to tattoo shops in coastal Hampton Roads. “I am focused on standing up for Virginians, and that means standing up to the Trump administration when their actions are hurting Virginia, Virginia’s economy, our workforce, our people, because that is the job of the governor of Virginia,” she tells me. “My favorite thing is when the pollsters come back and they’re like, ‘Wow, people are really talking about the economy.’ I’m like, No shit. Thank you for validating what I’m hearing on the ground.”\nSpanberger’s campaign—in a purplish state that has an incumbent Republican governor but went for Kamala Harris last November—is an intriguing test case for a Democratic Party that’s being roiled by arguments over how to rebound. The strongest energy has been on the populist left, with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing huge crowds for their “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies. I tell Spanberger I am not asking her to proclaim a solution for the party as a whole. “Everyone else does!” she says, both brightly and sarcastically. “We should just take a second and listen to people,” she continues. “We’re a broad-tent party, and I think we should celebrate that rather than trying to figure out, Okay, who was the most recently successful Democrat? Now everybody do the same thing.”\nSpanberger, 45, is tough, funny, and passionately pragmatic, a profile forged by her eclectic background. The daughter of a cop and a nurse, she was born near the Jersey Shore (her mother and aunt went to high school with Bruce Springsteen). As a teenager, she moved to suburban Richmond with her family, eventually graduating from the University of Virginia. Spanberger, a mother of three daughters, later became a CIA case officer, specializing in terrorism and nuclear proliferation.\nShe owes her political career, in a sense, to Trump. In 2018, Spanberger was a member of a group of Democratic women who ran for Congress for the first time in reaction to Trump’s original White House win. She served three terms in the House of Representatives, compiling a bipartisan legislative record, twice declining to vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, and occasionally criticizing President Joe Biden.\nIn November 2023, Spanberger announced she would leave Congress at the end of her term to run for governor in 2025. Mark Rozell, the dean of the school of policy and government at George Mason University, initially expected Spanberger to face a progressive primary challenger looking to “vanquish the opposition.” But no one emerged. “In statewide elections, Virginia can lurch from one party to the other, so it’s not really clear that running a more firebrand progressive would yield a good result for the Democrats in this state,” Rozell says. Stephanie Taylor, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (and a native Virginian), cautions against extrapolating from Spanberger’s middle-of-the-road approach to the national Democratic debate. “She is working to include progressives and progressive values into her coalition,” Taylor says. “But I would be careful about reading too much into the race.”\nThe Republican nominee is the state’s current lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears. She is already trying to lash Spanberger to Biden, pointing to the Democrat’s congressional votes on pandemic-era federal spending bills as being responsible for boosted inflation. Spanberger parries that Earle-Sears and her Virginia Republican colleagues were happy to take credit for spending all that infrastructure money. But then Spanberger does something more interesting than throwing partisan punches: She comes close to admitting that mistakes were made. “The choices we made in an exigent circumstance are choices that, at that moment in time, I stand by,” she says. “Now, hindsight being 20/20, we should all be learning from what we did or didn’t do. And in the event, God forbid, we are ever in that sort of crisis mode again, we will make better choices.”\nSpanberger is also making a choice when it comes to Trump and her campaign—hardly ignoring the president, but focusing on the wreckage rather than on resistance rhetoric. “While standing up to Trump, or the discussion of what Trump is doing, isn’t necessarily the thing that I lead with, it is the foundation on which there’s urgency to all of these types of things,” she says. Spanberger believes her part on the Democratic road to recovery is delivering on everyday needs, from broadband access to housing prices to teacher training, while defending core civil rights, including legal access to abortion. “Even talking about teacher residency programs—there’s a strong measure of success in those programs, and now the federal government has cut dollars.”\nThat framework makes sense given the job she’s seeking. One risk, though, is that Spanberger’s centrist approach might not meet the polarized moment and motivate enough Democratic voters in November. Spanberger scoffs at my suggestion. “Come to my events. They’re quite crowded and energized,” she says. “If you’re working 80 hours a week to pay the rent and put food on the table and, oh my God, hopefully your kid doesn’t get sick—they don’t want to be excited. They want somebody to fix it. They want to know that somebody cares and is decisively focused on the issues that matter to people. That is actually compelling. Whether it’s exciting, I don’t know. I’ll let people determine their own emotions.”","summary":"The no-nonsense Democrat, who is running for Virginia governor, tells VF that her party should “just take a second and listen to people” before committing to a strategy for reclaiming the White House.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/abigail-spanberger-says-she-can-take-on-trump-without-bashing-him","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/681e2a7ed58ffe00e31139ee/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/VF0525_Abigail-Spanberger_Tout.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 21:23:11","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.293},{"id":319733204,"title":"Biden Breaks Silence On Why Trump Defeated Kamala Harris, And It Had Nothing To Do With Economics","text":"Six months have passed since Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the November election for president, and many Americans are still mourning. The devastating blow divided the country even more, and now, former President Joe Biden is finally addressing his theories about why the Democratic party failed. \n\nSince leaving the White House, Biden has kept a relatively low profile. That is until recently, with him sitting down for several major interviews and making public appearances over the last few weeks. During an interview on “The View” Thursday (May 8), Biden spoke about last year’s campaign season, even making a surprising admission.\n\nAccording to the former president, Harris’ defeat didn’t come as a shock. “Not because I didn’t think the vice president was qualified to be president,” he clarified. Biden went on to defend Harris saying she was more than qualified to run the country. But there was two simple yet deeply complex things he believes stopped her from pulling out the final victory.\n\nIt’s no secret that Harris is Black woman. But despite making history as the first woman district attorney in San Francisco and the first woman to serve as vice president, Biden said it was her gender and race that many folks couldn’t see past. Plus, it didn’t help that the Republican party basically used her identity against her, just like they did during former President Barack Obama’s campaigns. \n\n“I was surprised because they [MAGA] went the sexist route, the whole route. ‘This is a woman,’ she’s this, she’s that, really, I’ve never seen a successful and consistent [of a] campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country — and a woman of mixed race,” Biden told “The View” hosts. Let’s all remember the right’s continuous attacks on Harris, previously calling her a “jezebel” and suggesting she slept her way to the top of the political ladder.\n\nThe same thing happened in 2016 with the battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump. Even “The View” host Sara Haines mentioned the 2016 voting frenzy saying Harris’ loss “was like 2016 all over again.” In the cases of Obama, Clinton, and Harris, each candidate presented a “radical” progressive change in the political system. But while Obama, a Black man, was able to win two terms, the ladies didn’t have the same success. \n\nOf course, if you were paying any attention to last year’s election, Biden’s recent remarks aren’t surprising. It was very clear from the beginning of Harris’ 100-day campaign that voters were hesitant to elect the first female president. But you know who called it? Black women. \n\nOn X, @judysquirrels tweeted back in November that Harris is “not radical, she just happens to be a Black woman.” Another Black woman, @tify330, wrote “People hate when Biden is honest, everything he said is true: Sexism, Racism, COVID, Pessimism, Negative view of Gov’t all played a role.”\n\nIt remains unclear if this country will ever be ready for a Black women to lead, or even a woman in general. But despite this, Biden continues to praise his former second in command. “We had a very successful effort to change the direction of the country and we did,” he said. “She was every single part of that.”","summary":"Six months have passed since Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the November election for president, and many Americans are still mourning.

What’s Next?","text":"A little over 100 days ago, President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term. In his inaugural speech, he promised to set this country back on track and undo the damage caused by Joe Biden and the Democrat Party. His plan? Secure our southern border, stop inflation, restore law and order, put America First on the world stage, and work every day for the American people.\n\nNot an easy task. But after what this country went through with Biden and Kamala Harris at the helm, President Trump knew there was no time to waste. And he’s kept his promises in record time.\n\nOn Day One, President Trump got to work. The president immediately signed executive orders to declare an emergency at the southern border, bring prices down, unleash American energy, combat fentanyl pouring into our country, restore free speech, and make America’s interests a priority again.\n\nThis is a president who is truly putting the American people first. His first trip as president was to my home state of North Carolina to tour disaster areas in the wake of Hurricane Helene. His administration has been working to help the Tar Heel State recover ever since he was sworn into office. In fact, the Trump administration recently approved a $1.4 billion grant to aid in recovery efforts in North Carolina.\n\nThese successes are just the beginning. Over the past 100 days, President Trump has worked tirelessly to Make America Great Again. But we must remember, this is not just his agenda; this is America’s agenda.\n\nIn November, he carried all seven swing states, won the popular vote, and helped Republicans carry the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Do not listen to the fake news when they tell you this agenda is unpopular. President Trump is delivering exactly what he said he would and what the American people voted for. This is the definition of “Promises Made, Promises Kept.”\n\nSo, what’s next?\n\nLooking forward to the next 100 days of this administration and the next four years, we must keep this momentum going. We need to ensure he has the support he needs in Congress throughout his entire term and not just the first two years. If we want to build a foundation for the future of this country and ensure President Trump’s successes last for future generations, we need to elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026. We also need to protect the integrity of our elections.\n\nPresident Trump, the Republican National Committee, and House Republicans have already started this work. \n\nJust a few weeks ago, the president signed an executive order to make sure only American citizens can vote. And the Republican National Committee was involved in more than 170 election integrity lawsuits last cycle—we are not taking our foot off the gas anytime soon.\n\nThe future of the United States depends on the policies we set now. If the Democrats gain control of Congress, they will stop the amazing successes of President Trump’s first 100 days dead in their tracks. This is not what the American people want.\n\nIf you want the United States to continue building on President Trump’s historic successes, then we need to elect Republicans in the House and Senate, so he has the support he needs throughout his entire four years.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

And sometimes this is a problem.\n\nThough when I say “sometimes”, what I mean is “always”.\n\nThis week, for instance, he announced that America won world war two. I’m sure this caused his fans over there to hold their hats to their hearts as they smashed up the nearest Volkswagen showroom in a frenzy of teary-eyed patriotism.\n\nBut it’s not entirely accurate.\n\nThe simple truth of the matter is that we held Hitler at arms’ length until the Russians were able to defeat his armies.\n\nBut there was no time to explain this to the Donald because he was busy thinking out loud again, saying that he was going to buy Canada and that America’s Declaration of Independence was all about love.\n\nAnd then he mused about how the troubling conflict between India and Pakistan has been going on for centuries. Which is odd because Pakistan was only created in 1947.\n\nTrump’s shaky grasp of reality is a worry. But then I do wonder what the world would have looked like if his rival, Kamala Harris had won.\n\nWorse, probably. Especially for people with testicles or a womb.\n\nIt’s incredible really that when the time came for the world’s most powerful country to replace Joe Biden, who was mostly dead, it offered voters a choice between a woman who wrote speeches using tiles picked randomly from a Scrabble bag, and a maniac with nylon hair.\n\nAnd waiting in the wings is JD Vance, a God botherer who thinks women who’ve been raped should be forced to have the resultant baby.\n\nAnd there’s no end in sight to this madness. Because of the way candidates are chosen (using money) only lunatics will ever end up in the White House.\n\nSo I wonder if maybe it’s time to change the role of the president.\n\nAt the moment, he or she wields enormous power, whereas our head of state, the King, does not.\n\nHe’s just a figurehead who’s wheeled out occasionally to open car parks and stand on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, in a snazzy uniform, waving.\n\nThat’s what they need in America. A president who opens stuff and waves.\n\nAND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nAnd do you know what? I don’t think Donald Trump would be totally averse to the idea. He wouldn’t have to bow out after four years. He could stay in office till he dies.\n\nAnd he could call himself King Donald the First and make people bow when they meet him. I think he’d like that a lot.\n\nTHANKS BUT NO YANKS\n\nSo let me see if I’ve got this exciting new US trade deal right.\n\nFrom now on, we will be allowed to buy terrible left-hand-drive cars that are far too big for our roads.\n\nAnd at night, we will be able to eat chicken that tastes vaguely of a swimming pool. Or beef that’s so full of chemicals, we will wake up in the morning with two heads.\n\nOn the upside, we are told we will now be able to export all the steel we make to America.\n\nHmmm. As I recall, we only have one steel plant left in this country and all it made last year was a knife and fork.\n\nObviously, I haven’t had time yet to read the small print in this deal but when I do, I think it’ll be even worse. Because we were being represented in negotiations by a man who can’t talk properly, and wears someone else’s spectacles. And he was up against a ruthless businessman who’s mad.\n\nThat said, however, it’s possible that Starmer’s new trade deal with India is better for Britain.\n\nMainly because he was negotiating with a man whose mind was on other things.\n\nLike dropping bombs on Pakistan.\n\nIF ever you’re in need of a laugh, go online and have a look on your local council’s website at the objections being raised by elderly people about all the planning applications.\n\nA belter caught my eye this week. A tennis club in Norfolk has applied for permission to keep the courts open until 10pm and locals, predictably, are furious.\n\nA chap called Keith is worried about the noise saying: “You’ve got balls bouncing off fences.”\n\nYes, Keith. That’s why none of us ever watches Wimbledon.\n\nIt’s too noisy. You can’t hear yourself think.\n\nA HARD LABOUR\n\nAS we know, the Labourites want to make sure that everyone who arrives in a dinghy on a beach in Kent is put up in a luxury hotel and given free food until we have built a nice four-bedroom home for them.\n\nHowever, this week, the Starmerists announced that in return, all these new boys – and they are mostly male – must learn English.\n\nGood luck with that. \n\nThe chap who delivers parcels to my farm about 500 times a day has been coming here for more than a year.\n\nAnd he still doesn’t know what “fragile” means.\n\nTA - TA TO NEW SAUCE\n\nI do love the result from a really stupid survey. And there’s a pearler this week.\n\nBecause Heinz has announced that 90 per cent of people aged between 18 and 30 would be interested in a new sauce to go with fish.\n\nWow. So that’s what the kids are talking about these days. I thought it was gay rights and -Palestine and who said what on TikTok.\n\nBut no. They’re in the gym and the juice bar and in the staff room at work, and all they’re talking about is how the world would be a better place if only there was an alternative to ketchup.\n\nAnd now there is. It’s from Heinz, surprisingly, who’ve launched a new line called Fish & Chips Sauce.\n\nExcept it’s not new. It’s just tartare sauce with a new label. And the fact is that it’s not quite as good as Thousand Island. Which I put on everything.\n\nIncluding biscuits.\n\nVOIGHT NEEDN’T BOTHER HOLDING ON FOR A NIRO\n\nJON VOIGHT is an Oscar-winning actor and father to Angelina Jolie.\n\nHe is also such an ardent MAGA fan, that he’s managed to convince Donald Trump that all films should be made in America.\n\nI have no idea how that might work.

We are happy to hear she is now feeling much better and wish her a speedy recovery.”\n\nKinsey has since addressed the matter on X on Friday afternoon, apologizing for the “scare last night.”\n\n“I want to start by thanking the incredible Fox News team and the EMTs who responded with such speed and care,” she wrote. “It was an unexpected and frightening moment, but thanks to their professionalism and kindness, I’m doing well.”\n\nShe also thanked “everyone who has called, texted, prayed, or checked in,” noting that their “support has meant the world.”\n\n“I’m taking it slow, staying hydrated, letting my body rest, and thanking the Lord that everything is okay,” she continued. “It may not have been how I planned to end the segment, but I’ll be back on your TV soon. Hopefully long enough to finally finish my point about Kamala!”\n\nBiden told The View on Thursday that he “wasn’t surprised” that Harris lost to Trump, clarifying that this was “not because I didn’t think the Vice President was the most qualified person to be president.”\n\n“But I wasn’t surprised because they went the sexist route the whole route,” he said of Trump’s campaign. “This is a woman, she’s this, she’s that. Really, I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country — and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nKinsey isn’t the only right wing operative to take an untimely fall this week.

Victor Davis Hanson breaks down the polling regarding Donald Trump\u0019s early 2025 presidency on today\u0019s edition of \u001cVictor Davis Hanson: In His Own Words,\u001d and asks the question: Were pollsters reflecting public opinion, or manipulating it?\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON: This is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. We've touched on polls before but I don't think I've seen anything quite as egregious in pollsters' bias as recently when they apparently or supposedly or purportedly surveyed the first hundred days of Donald Trump and the public reaction.\n\nAlmost immediately headlines blared, worst first hundred days in history. Trump drops from 52 to 41, 42. Everybody was confounded because the economic news was pretty good.\n\nJob growth was just spectacular, over 170,000 jobs. Inflation was down. Energy prices were down.\n\nCorporate profits were up. There was a movement on the trade question. There was no bad news except the controversy and chaos of a counter-revolution.\n\nSo what were the pollsters trying to tell us or were they trying to manipulate? And I think it's the latter. Larry Kudlow, for example, the former Fox business, I think he still is at Fox, he pointed out that when he examined the New York Times and the Washington Post polls, they were deliberately not counting people who surveyed that they were Trump voters in 2024.\n\nThat was half the country. They were only polling about a third. Think of that, a third of the people that said they voted for Trump, they polled.\n\nNot half. So of course their results were going to be disputed or suspect. But here's another thing.\n\nThere were analyses after each of the 2016, the 2020, and the 2024 elections about the accuracy of polls post-facto of the election. And we learned that they were way off in 2016. They said they had learned their lessons.\n\nThey were way off in 2020. They said they learned their lesson. And they were way off in 2024.\n\nAnd why are they way off? Because liberal pollsters, and that's the majority of people who do these surveys, believe that if they create artificial leads for their Democratic candidates, it creates greater fundraising and momentum. Kind of the herd mentality.\n\nOh, Trump is down by six. I don't want to vote for him. Then he won't win.\n\nThat's the type of thing that they want to create. I'll give you one example. The most egregious of all these polls was the NPR-PBS-Marist poll.\n\nThey have Donald Trump just very unpopular after 100 days. Very unpopular. This is the now defunded Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nThat umbrella organization from which this poll was funded and conducted. Do you remember that poll? It was the one poll that came out the night before the 2024 election.\n\nThey said that Kamala Harris would win by four points. And they said it was beyond the margin of error. And one of the pollsters said it's her race to lose.\n\nShe lost by a point and a half. They were five and a half points. Did they apologize?\n\nNo. Here they are again. And David Ploof, one of the directors of the Harris campaign, just recently came out and said, well, we had all these inside polls we never disclosed.\n\nBut not one of them, not one of them had Harris ever ahead of Trump. Inside polls don't lie because you pay somebody to tell you the truth. Nothing will get you fired and lose income quicker than to lie about a poll so that your candidate will be happy and rely on your false information.\n\nPeople don't pay for that kind of stuff. So in other words, they knew the whole time, the Harris campaign, that 15 of those 20 polls, 19 polls that all had Harris winning the election, they were all false. Of course they never said anything.\n\nAnd so here's my point. If you look at the polls that were the most accurate, Mark Pym was very accurate. He's a Democratic pollster.\n\nBut especially the Rasmussen poll and the Insider Advantage and the Trafalgar poll, they joined together and they had a 100-day survey. Rasmussen, each day of the 100-day period, he's issued a poll. And guess what?\n\nThey have Trump ahead by anywhere from two to three points after 100 days. And they were the most accurate. And yet, what do these news outlets say?\n\nThat Trump, it's a disaster, that he's polling. No, he's polling very well. Things are going very well because the pollsters that indicate that people support him are the only pollsters that have any reputation after this decade-long polling disaster in which their prejudices, their biases, and their hatred of Donald Trump affected their results and they were effectively in league with the Democratic candidate to create momentum rather than adhere to a spirit of professionalism and honor. Thank you very much.

He has campaigned on such policies since he first entered politics in 2015 and those ideas were the centerpiece of his legislative agenda when he was in office in 2017. Despite the Times’ decision to reprint Trump’s claim that he would \"graciously accept” higher taxes, there isn’t anything in his background supporting the notion that he would now back a tax hike on the rich.\n\nRelated | New York Times caught passing off GOP flack as average Black voter\n\nBy contrast, his Democratic political rivals like former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris have supported and proposed legislation that would raise taxes on the very wealthy. Such proposals have been steadfastly opposed by Trump and his Republican allies in Congress.\n\nThe last time Trump passed major tax legislation was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress promised that the bill would boost household income for the middle class and spark economic growth. It did neither.\n\nThe package included tax cuts that were “highly skewed” in favor of the super-rich, the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted in a 2024 report on the law. The group also noted that the law “benefited high-income households far more than households with low and moderate incomes,” creating a “windfall” for the wealthy while eroding the revenue base the government relies on.\n\nCongressional Republicans are currently in the process of pushing more tax legislation that would double down on the failures of Trump’s old law. The bill, called “One Big Beautiful Bill” because that’s what Trump demanded his priorities be labeled, cuts spending on programs like Medicaid in exchange for tax breaks that benefit rich people.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported on Friday that over 5.5 million people will lose health care coverage if Republican plans to roll back Medicaid expansion become law under the so-called beautiful bill that is being considered.\n\nDespite this information and Trump’s track record on taxes, The New York Times chose once again to amplify Republican spin—while hiding the truth from its readers.","summary":"In a report published Friday, The New York Times regurgitated President Donald Trump’s claim that he is backing away from supporting increased taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\n\nHeadlined “Trump Softens on Raising Taxes on the Rich, Saying G.O.P.

Walz encourages legislators, and anglers, to get the lead out","text":"CROSSLAKE, Minn. – It is a Minnesota tradition like no other that the final days of the legislative session and the opening of fishing season coincide by a matter of days each May. That means in the midst of negotiations to wrap things up at the state Capitol, the governor – for 77 straight years now – heads off to a lake or river to celebrate angling on the state’s abundant waterways.\n\nTalking about fishing and the goings on in St. Paul on Friday, in an exclusive interview with the Pioneer Press, Gov. Tim Walz said it’s time to get the lead out. And he was referring to both anglers and legislators.\n\nHe wants the legislative session to finish on time, and with an eye toward protecting the official state bird, he wants anglers to cut down on their use of lead fishing tackle.\n\nWith the May 19 deadline for adjournment of the legislative session now less than two weeks away, Walz said he will call a special legislative session, with a pre-set agenda agreed upon, if necessary, but it’s not something he wants to do.\n\n“If you don’t set a time to mow the yard, it doesn’t get mowed. If they don’t do some of these things, then I think you just have to set the time and recognize you can’t let the perfect get in the way of the good,” he said, urging lawmakers to compromise and get to the finish line on time. “And I think the longer you wait, it becomes harder, I think then it becomes, you just keep procrastinating. And so we’re getting late. There’s no doubt about that, but there’s still an opportunity to get this done.”\n\nHe pitched once again for his wish for a lower sales tax rate, accompanied by an expansion of the sale tax to include financial planning and wealth management services, but said he will be unlikely to veto a tax bill that gets to his desk, even if it does not include his reform idea.\n\n“I don’t threaten when I go in there, I leave things open,” Walz said. “And I just made the case on this for Minnesota. We’re talking about lowering the sales tax for 80% of Minnesotans as we see it. But right now, the sales tax excludes things like wealth management banking, things like that.”\n\nHe offered examples of what he sees as inconsistencies in Minnesota law, like the sales tax charged if you have someone trim your trees, but not if you have someone manage your money, or the sales tax charged on funeral arrangements, but not on the preparation of a last will.\n\n“So I said, you just expand that base, lower the rate. A lot of folks don’t use those upper end services, and just candidly, the folks who use them have a little more wealth,” he said. “I think the thing is, I’m bringing this up because people’s spending habits have changed. People are using more services and less goods. But we’ll see, and I think it’s just about having consistency in our tax system.”\n\nWhitefish Chain fishing\n\nAs is traditional for this event, which has been held everywhere from Lake of the Woods in the north to the Mississippi River near Winona in the south, Walz planned to head out with a guide on one of the dozens of lakes in the Whitefish Chain in the wee hours of Saturday morning. In Crosslake, members of the local Republican party were organizing a protest and boat parade for Saturday morning, which is not uncommon for a governor whose popularity in Greater Minnesota has varied widely since Walz was first elected in 2018.\n\nOne change the governor was advocating for this year is getting lead lures and sinkers out of Minnesotans’ tackle boxes, as ingesting the metal is harmful to aquatic birds, most notably the common loon. Legislation calling for a ban on lead fishing gear in Minnesota has failed at the state Legislature in the past. Walz said he would sign a ban if it got to his desk, but he also feels that encouraging changes rather than mandating them is the right approach.\n\n“Here in Minnesota, we still make it your option. We’re trying to educate people on this … Loons are our state symbol now. They’re on our state seal. Very important to who we are. Lead’s very, very dangerous to them,” Walz said, noting that he hunted pheasants with bismuth-based ammunition last year and liked the feel of it.\n\n“The waterfowl hunters have worked on this for years. I think there’s a move away from lead tackle. We’ve got Lindy and some corporations that are moving to that. I think it’s important to bring people along on their own terms. I don’t think an industry this big and the folks who’ve been doing this, that you dictate to them,” he said. “I know there is a school of thought that says we just pass a law and ban it. I think that having compliance with bringing people along, and more and more people are doing it. So I fish lead free, shoot lead free. I think (we) try to encourage people to go there, but we don’t mandate it.”\n\nLooking back on campaign\n\nMeeting with members of the media on radio row during the 77th annual Minnesota Governor’s Fishing Opener at Manhattan Beach Lodge in Crow Wing County, Walz admitted the relatively slow pace of events like these is a welcome change following the whirlwind that 2024 became for him last summer.\n\nWhen Walz accepted an offer to run for second in command at the White House alongside then-Vice President Kamala Harris, his life became a non-stop world of travel and thrust his family into the national spotlight. After the Harris/Walz ticket lost in November, he said getting his body back into shape has been a goal and while Walz remains thankful for the experience, he also values his time back in this land of 10,000 lakes.\n\n“I ate a lot, so I’m now trying to lose some weight. I was doing the ice cream at midnight type of thing,” Walz said, with a grin, looking back fondly on the campaign. “But it was quite a thing. Look, it was an honor to do it.

I've become a crank in my old age, but there are certain things that still make me watch with the wide-eyed awe of youth, and a papal conclave is one of them. The smoke, the bells ringing in unison across Rome. The people streaming into St. Peter's. The new pope being introduced to the entire world at the same time, using his first words to call for peace. I also just love that some version of the following phone call probably took place multiple times around the US yesterday:\"Hey! Remember Bobby from sophomore calculus? Did you hear about his new job? Yeah, he's the pope now.\"The whole spectacle yesterday at the Vatican was really special, and particularly well-timed for a certain Catholic former president whose first TV interview since the election was, thankfully for him, immediately followed by the white smoke and thus buried by the news that would follow. I speak of course of Joe Biden, who went on The View yesterday, looking and sounding worse than ever, where he delivered one of the most shameful, delusion, insulting and all-around sad public displays from an ex-president I can remember.Some of you get mad when I am hard on Joe, but I really have no—zero—compunction about it given his behavior throughout 2024 and now continuing into 2025. He is personally responsible for Trump's return. And yet, I do feel sorry for him at the same time, and direct my real disgust at the people around him, like Jill Biden. This man should be sitting on his favorite rocking chair on his porch in Rehoboth, regaling his grandkids with stories from his 50 years in politics and working on his memoirs. Why is he being wheeled out on a media tour?If you didn't catch The View appearance, Biden managed to do the following: take responsibility for Trump's win, while also saying he \"wasn't surprised\" that Kamala Harris lost, while also claiming he would have won, while also blaming her loss on—wait for it—sexism.Where to even begin with that. Harris lost because she was both a bad candidate and handed a total shit sandwich by Biden, who waited too long to drop out and then had the gall to demand she remain loyal to him while his own approval was -20 by the time he left office. Not even a politician as talented as Bill Clinton could have threaded that needle, while also fending off attacks from Trump. And Kamala Harris ain't exactly Slick Willie.Also, can the Dems please dispense with blaming everything on sexism or racism? Michelle Obama would have crushed Trump in a head-to-head matchup. It also absolves them for ignoring the proximate causes of Trump's return, which is their dereliction of duty on the core issues of inflation, immigration and crime. And it begs the question, if Kamala could never have won because of sexism, why the hell did Biden endorse her to succeed him?!Matt Yglesias, the center-left pundit, is calling for Dems to \"throw Biden under the bus\" after what he said on The View, and I agree. His post-election gracelessness, and the behavior of the people around him—specifically Jill—is grotesque. Harris should hold a presser today where she answers every question about just how much her boss had deteriorated, when, and who specifically was covering for him. We deserve at least that. And please, Democrats, I am begging you: stop defaulting to the sexism thing. It's so insulting to the American people and it comes across as you just shifting the blame for your own failures.On that lovely note, have a great weekend. Happy Mother's Day to all the moms reading, including my own. May your ungrateful children honor you for all the hard and overlooked work you put in every day.

The incident took place as she discussed former President Joe Biden‘s remarks regarding Kamala Harris‘s election defeat to President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n“This is about incompetency, it’s not about uh, uh, ideology,” Kinsey said as she appeared to lose her train of thought. Seconds later, she collapsed out of her chair and fell onto the studio floor.\n\nThe show’s host, Jonathan Hunt, remained in his seat, noting, “We’re just going to get some help her for Camryn.” He then attempted to give the broadcast over to another presenter, which didn’t pan out, forcing the show to cut to commercial break.\n\nWhen the show returned, he assured viewers that Kinsey was already doing better. “We want to give you a quick update. Camryn is up and moving,” he said. “We have paramedics checking her. We will keep you updated. We wish her all the best.”\n\nIt’s unclear what prompted this scary medical incident. However, many fans seemed most disturbed by the fact that Hunt continued talking to the cameras after Kinsey fell to the ground. \n\n“He didn’t even THINK about helping,” commented one viewer on a video of the incident. Another said, “Wow [he] just sits there and doesn’t help her. What a man.” A third wrote: “The way they filmed that feels like ‘The Office’.”\n\nAlthough most commenters felt that Hunt should have helped her, one user did defend him. “You all know there is a studio full of people? Someone would be helping her ... his job is to carry on.”\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Kinsey took to X, formerly Twitter, to reassure fans that she was doing better. \n\n“Wow, sorry for the scare last night. I want to start by thanking the incredible Fox News team and the EMTs who responded with such speed and care. It was an unexpected and frightening moment, but thanks to their professionalism and kindness, I’m doing well,” she said.\n\nShe continued to thank everyone who had reached out to her. “I’m taking it slow, staying hydrated, letting my body rest,” she wrote, noting “I’ll be back on your TV soon.” She then teased: “Hopefully long enough to finally finish my point about Kamala!”\n\nKinsey, 24, previously worked as an External Relations Director at the White House during Trump’s first term and has worked as a reporter and White House correspondent for One America News Network. Most recently, she’s been working as a political commentator. Kinsey is also the founder of Titan Media Strategies, a Florida-based company.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunt has been a correspondent for Fox News Channel in Los Angeles since 2002.","summary":"Political commentator Camryn Kinsey collapsed on air during a “Fox News @ Night” appearance.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/tv/2025/05/fox-news-correspondent-draws-criticism-for-on-air-conduct-after-guest-fainted.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/5SE7KRQ3IJGLZGNZWKMFEGNUD4.jpg?auth=6d8f8812bc4f3fd61f26d0b888ba79a4802c07e84e4dd8fca7838a16f7f2f0b2&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 17:31:31","author":"Kelly Corbett","authors":["Kelly Corbett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246}]}
