According to a report published Saturday by The New York Times, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt warned CBS producers and Dokoupil against editing the interview. Trump, she said, wanted the exchange aired in full.“Make sure you don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,” Leavitt told Dokoupil and executive producer Kim Harvey. She then added, “If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.”The interview, a 13-minute segment filmed at a Ford plant in Michigan, ultimately aired unedited.In a statement issued Saturday, CBS News said Leavitt’s comments did not influence its editorial decision.“The moment we booked this interview we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” the network said.The threat came against the backdrop of Trump’s history of legal action involving media organizations. Trump previously secured a $16 million settlement from CBS News’ parent company, Paramount, after suing over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024. Legal experts questioned the merit of the lawsuit, but Paramount was simultaneously seeking U.S. regulatory approval for its sale to a new owner, now known as Paramount Skydance.Trump has also won legal fees from Walt Disney Co. and pursued legal disputes involving other outlets, including The Wall Street Journal and the BBC. Paramount’s decision to settle contributed to the departure of two senior CBS News executives overseeing 60 Minutes and other operations.CBS News has previously yielded to similar demands. In September, the network agreed to stop editing taped interviews with newsmakers appearing on Face the Nation after complaints from the Trump administration about an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. During that interview, Noem made several false or unproven statements about Kilmar Abergo Garcia, a Salvadoran man deported despite having protected legal status. CBS aired only part of the exchange and made the full interview available online.Online backlash followsLeavitt’s remarks triggered backlash online after being reported. One user wrote, “I think we’re past the ‘Boy, there’s sure a lot of weird stuff going on’ stage… and have reached ‘Good lord, we’ve gotta do something about this’ territory.”Another called for action against her, writing, “Boycott Her!!!”A third comment read, “Every fascist will invoke freedom of speech to silence critics and label those who defend democracy as anti-democratic.”A fourth added, “Once the Trump regime is over, this woman should be unemployable.”The incident has renewed scrutiny over how news organizations navigate political pressure — and how far public officials are willing to go to control coverage.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/well-sue-your-ass-off-karoline-leavitt-caught-on-camera-threatening-cbs-sparks-outrage-online/articleshow/126633280.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126633271/126633271.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 23:51:00","author":"Trending Desk","authors":["Trending Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":393922248,"title":"Karoline Leavitt warned CBS that Trump would sue if interview was edited","text":"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned CBS News that President Trump would sue the network if his recent interview was not aired in full, according to an audio recording obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe remark came moments after Trump finished taping a 13-minute interview Tuesday with “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil in Michigan.\n\nLeavitt approached the CBS team and relayed that the president wanted assurances the segment would run unedited, adding he would “sue your ass off” if it did not, according to The Times.\n\n“He said, ‘Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,’” Leavitt told Dokoupil and his colleagues, according to the recording.\n\n“Yeah, we’re doing it, yeah,” Dokoupil replied.\n\nLeavitt added: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’”\n\nCBS News later told the Times the network had already decided to air the interview in full before it was taped, and that Leavitt’s comments did not alter its editorial plans.\n\n“The moment we booked this interview, we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” the network said in a statement, noting the full interview ran as planned on the “CBS Evening News” that night.\n\nIn 2024, Trump sued the network over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing CBS of deceptive editing.\n\nParamount, CBS News’ corporate parent at the time, ultimately agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve the lawsuit, a decision that drew sharp criticism inside and outside the newsroom and has since loomed over editorial decisions involving Trump.","summary":"In 2024, Trump sued the network over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing CBS of deceptive editing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/17/us-news/karoline-leavitt-warned-cbs-that-trump-would-sue-if-interview-was-edited/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-g4kpld9y1-1768688886961.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1768670925&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/c6rCYv8i-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-17 22:29:01","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":393918368,"title":"RNC chair pushes back after Carville predicts GOP ‘wipeout’ in 2026 midterms","text":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville predicted a political \"wipeout\" for Republicans in the 2026 midterm election.

'I think it's going to be an electoral revolt against Trump and MAGA.'\n\nThe Leaving MAGA organization has grown rapidly, raising more than $100,000 from small donors toward a $250,000 goal for 2026. The group now has leaders in 20 states, with 25 individuals spearheading the movement.\n\nLogis plans to launch a public poll this year to measure how many Americans have abandoned the movement.\n\nAmong those who've joined is Jennie Gage, 51, a former 'Mormon trad-wife' who has built a large social media following with her account 'LifeTakeTwo.' She joined about three months ago after Logis discovered one of her videos about leaving MAGA.\n\nGage's transformation has been dramatic. She admits to having once been a white supremacist and anti-feminist who 'actively fought against gay marriage.' Her support for the movement was 'rock solid.'\n\nBut the rhetoric eventually became impossible to ignore, particularly comments on transgender individuals.\n\n'I just saw the hate, and it reminded me, literally, of Germany,' Gage said. 'It reminded me of Hitler.'\n\nGage says she has been fielding thousands of responses from people lately who say they are unhappy with MAGA and want to leave. \n\n'So many people just recently, were like, dyed in the wool MAGA, and now, saying f*** this,' Gage said.\n\nThat slow-burning disillusionment is increasingly visible among younger voters — including Steve Vilchez, a 22-year-old Gen-Z conservative with Mexican roots who spent nearly a decade as an avid MAGA supporter. He ended up voting for Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\nRaised in a very liberal part of Illinois, Vilchez said he became politically engaged as early as 13 and quickly found himself isolated for his conservative views.\n\n'I liked Donald Trump, I thought he was doing great things for the country, that he would drain the swamp, rebuild our political system and more,' he said.\n\nVilchez began to struggle with the disconnect between Trump's rhetoric and his own lived reality as the child of immigrants. 'My family are all immigrants from Mexico. I have birthright citizenship being born here, but it was hard to balance what Trump wants and what actually affects my personal life.'\n\nHe also began to notice what he sees as a recurring pattern of hypocrisy.\n\n'Conservatives don't care how you feel until it personally impacts them. For example, Reagan was against homosexuality until his daughter came out. Reagan wasn't a fan of gun control measures until he was almost assassinated. I see that a lot now as well.'\n\nVilchez also noted Trump's claims don't align with what he sees when he's filling his car with gas. \n\n'It's the economy stupid...In Illinois I have yet to see the price under $2.80. In the suburbs gas is almost 4 dollars a gallon,' he said.\n\nThe 'Leaving MAGA' leaders the Daily Mail spoke with all agree that the most significant betrayal driving people away from MAGA is the economy. \n\nMany supporters voted for Trump believing he would lower costs, but now feel deep 'cognitive dissonance' because they 'don't see their costs going down.'\n\nA late-December/J.L. Partners poll for the Daily Mail revealed a deepening 'affordability crisis' for the Trump administration. Nearly half of voters (48 percent)—and a significant 58 percent of independents—report that life has become more expensive under the current term. \n\nWith 36 percent describing the strain as \"much more unaffordable,\" the rising cost of living has emerged as the primary drag on the president’s approval ratings.\n\nVilchez believes the consequences could be electoral—particularly among young voters. 'If the economy keeps getting worse, I think Trump will have a problem, especially with young people just starting their lives. I do see a lot of buyers remorse.'\n\nAccording to a December 2025 NBC News Decision Desk poll, the once-unshakeable MAGA movement is showing rare signs of internal dilution.\n\nFor the first time, the party is evenly split 50-50 between those who identify with MAGA and those who align with the traditional GOP.\n\nAsked what he would say if he could meet the president today, Vilchez did not hesitate. 'I would tell him that he doesn't understand Americans. He understands the elites. He was born and raised as an elite. But he has never really lived the life of a blue-collar worker.'\n\nRon Bonjean, a Republican strategist, remains skeptical of the defections. 'It is very difficult to believe that MAGA voters would give up their support so easily,' he said.\n\nFor Gage, her advice to those still in the movement is simple: 'When you see a red flag, cross the street and walk the other way.'\n\nDavis Ingle, a White House spokesperson, says Trump remains the most 'dominant figure in American politics.'\n\n'The president has already made historic progress not only in America but around the world,' Ingle told the Daily Mail.","summary":"The leader of a fast-growing movement of former Trump loyalists has issued a devastating warning, claiming that 'cracks and fissures' are widening.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15386411/MAGA-defectors-electoral-earthquake-Trumps-base.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/07/21/104982783-0-image-a-9_1767821111757.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 19:41:05","author":"Editor,Elina Shirazi","authors":["Editor","Elina Shirazi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":393892848,"title":"In Reelection Launch, Josh Shapiro Admits Violent Attack Almost Drove Him From the Race","text":"COLLIER TOWNSHIP, Pennsylvania -- Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) launched his reelection bid in western Pennsylvania on Thursday, highlighting his accomplishments since taking office in 2023 and outlining his goals for a second term.\n\n Despite noting that Republicans and independents were present in the packed carpenters union hall, the only boos came when Shapiro mentioned his Philadelphia Eagles fandom. It was, unmistakably, Steeler country.\n\n The crowd was loud and enthusiastic, packed with local figures such as newly sworn-in Pittsburgh Mayor Corey O'Connor and labor leaders, including Darrin Kelly of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, alongside scores of trade and union workers filling the cavernous hall.\n\n Visually, the rollout differed from Shapiro's 2022 kickoff along the river in Johnstown. Substantively, however, it was familiar: a message rooted in the importance of place.\n\n In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner after the speech, before departing for his Philadelphia announcement, Shapiro summed it up simply: different location, same goal -- ensuring every community in Pennsylvania gets a fair shot.\n\n \"I wanted to be focused here in the union hall on those who I believe are going to make up the power of the next generation of workers in Pennsylvania,\" he said of the trade union members who are already working on shovel-ready energy projects in the region.\n\n \"If we don't invest in skills-based labor, we're not going to have as bright a future in our commonwealth,\" he said. \"And so that's why I'm here today, focused on what I think is the ability to help every Pennsylvanian chart their own course and achieve success. And so much of that runs through halls like this one.\"\n\n Before Shapiro took to the stage, one of the people who stepped up ahead of him was a man who goes by \"Tim O.,\" a 52-year-old father who is on his second career and his second year in a carpentry apprenticeship. Tim became choked up when he said, \"I don't look like other apprentices.\"\n\n Shapiro said Tim was an example of his administration's investment in trade programs in a state where over 60% of the population did not attend college and that it was important to give him a platform.\n\n \"One of the things I always ask the apprentices is, 'Hey, how'd you get here? What brought you here? What was your journey?' Some of them come right out of high school, and we want to create those pathways,\" Shapiro explained of the variety of answers he has received over the years. \"Some of them go to college for a year, realize it's not for them. Some of them have different careers and then find their ways here.\"\n\n \"The key is opening up the doors to places like this and showing people it exists because we need people like Tim O., who, even at 52, to dedicate their lives to having the skills we need to produce more energy, to quite literally build bridges and build buildings,\" Shapiro said.\n\n The speech was filled with stories highlighting accomplishments, future goals and governing with purpose, and included a brief swipe at the bipartisan chaos in Washington. Notably, Shapiro avoided inflammatory language, steering clear of demonizing Republicans or President Donald Trump.\n\n And he used the word \"we\" instead of \"I\" when discussing accomplishments, something many politicians cannot find a way to do.\n\n \"I obviously have profound differences from the president. You have written about that,\" he said. \"No one expects us to agree on everything. But to me, vilifying others, attacking others, is not a way to bring people together and get stuff done.\"\n\n Shapiro, who has a good relationship with Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), said his job is to champion the things people can do together for the commonwealth.\n\n \"My focus is on building bridges, creating more opportunity for folks to come together, and delivering results for people like Tim O. and others who need help,\" he said. \"And so, to me, I want this campaign to be hopeful. I want to highlight differences where we have different policy views, but I want to focus on uplifting people.\"\n\n Larry Ceisler, a Washington County native and Philadelphia-based public affairs official, said the reason you do not see Shapiro go personal on Trump is that, first of all, that is always who he has been and, second, because he always wants his governance to be about purpose, not divisiveness.\n\n \"He always tries to make it substantive and not personal because he never wants to be perceived as attacking the people who support the president, so when he does criticize, it is based on the issues,\" Ceisler said.\n\n Shapiro begins his launch with a formidable amount of cash. This week, his campaign announced he ended 2025 with over $30 million in cash on hand and a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Shapiro's favorability rating at 58%.\n\n He faces Republican Stacy Garrity, the state treasurer, who has won back-to-back races for that statewide elected office. Garrity said in a statement that \"Josh Shapiro is more concerned with a promotion to Pennsylvania Avenue than serving hardworking Pennsylvanians.\"\n\n Shapiro's governorship entered the national spotlight early, shaped by crisis decisions beginning in 2023, shortly after he took office, with the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border. The fiery wreck, visible for miles, was followed by a controlled burn that raised concerns across Beaver and Lawrence counties over toxic contamination in the air and water.\n\n That was followed in June 2023 by a tanker truck crash beneath Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, a vital East Coast artery carrying more than 150,000 vehicles a day. The crash killed the driver and caused the overpass to collapse. Despite predictions that the highway could be closed for years, six temporary lanes reopened within two weeks, allowing traffic to move while permanent repairs were made.\n\n Shapiro was also governor in July 2024 when gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump, killing local fire chief Cory Comperatore and wounding two others. Shapiro was on the scene in Butler the following morning with first responders and investigators. He was in office as well when Luigi Mangione was arrested in Altoona for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and when three police officers were murdered in York County in the deadliest day for Pennsylvania law enforcement in 16 years.\n\n During that period, Shapiro was also on the short list of possible running mates for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, before ultimately determining the role was not the right fit.\n\n Last year, an arsonist attempted to kill Shapiro and his family by firebombing the governor's residence, setting the home ablaze and causing extensive damage. Shapiro, his wife, their children and other family members narrowly escaped the rapidly spreading flames.\n\n Shapiro has said the attack prompted serious conversations with his wife about whether he should seek reelection.\n\n \"I think a couple of days after that, my primary focus was on being a good dad and a good husband and being a good governor. And I have tried very, very hard to both heal myself and be there for my kids as they work through this and be there for Laurie,\" he said of his wife, who was with him at the beginning of the interview.\n\n Shapiro admits there were many family discussions on what they should do.\n\n \"We had a long talk about whether we wanted to keep doing this in the face of that kind of attack and that kind of threat,\" he said. \"The reality is we all ended up in the exact same place. Yes, we not only have to keep governing, but we've got to run again and keep doing this because you can't let those who want to inflict pain on others bring harm to communities. You can't let them win.\"\n\n Shapiro said he expects to continue working through the aftermath for years, noting that members of both parties privately reached out to check on his well-being and offer help, including Trump, who was himself the target of an assassination attempt.\n\n \"He called, and I appreciated that,\" he said. \"And we talked about his brush with death in public. No public officials should have to go through this. Our politics shouldn't be this way.\"\n\n Shapiro said he hopes the way he runs his campaign and governs will help lower the temperature and allow for a measure of healing.\n\n \"I said today in my speech, go talk to that person that voted a different way in the last election and have a respectful conversation,\" Shapiro said. \"We need more of that.\"\n\n Salena Zito is a staff reporter and columnist for the Washington Examiner.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nAs Gavin Newsom moves ever-closer to declaring his presidential candidacy, everything he does in his last year as governor is rightfully being viewed through that political prism.\n\nNewsom knows that being portrayed as a left-leaning cultural warrior from deeply blue California — a factor in sinking Kamala Harris’s White House bid — is potentially fatal.\n\nThus, Newsom’s final state budget takes on a new political meaning, and makes the always difficult process of weighing competing interests within the state even trickier than usual.\n\nWe saw that syndrome affect Jerry Brown, the last California governor to harbor serious presidential ambitions. In 1978, he opposed Proposition 13, the iconic tax cut ballot measure, but after its passage championed both a large state tax reduction and a spending limit ballot measure to realign himself with the tax cut movement.\n\nBrown then tried to ride the anti-tax, spending-limit movement into the White House two years later — but failed miserably.\n\nBack to Newsom.\n\nHis initial budget proposal, released last week, basically adopts the current spending plan, with a few tweaks that continue his ideological drift to the right. In hopes of producing a balanced budget, at least on paper, Newsom is cutting back on spending for social welfare and health care services and college scholarships.\n\nThose steps alone are drawing criticism from many advocacy groups, but resistance is also heightened by his apparent unwillingness to fill in gaps caused by President Donald Trump’s cutbacks in federal support.\n\nThe reaction from left-leaning advocates was summarized well in a critique by Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget and Policy Center, an umbrella group of organizations that lobby for public services, especially those for the poor.\n\n“California’s state budget is a reflection of our shared values and our responsibility to care for one another,” Hoene said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the governor’s 2026-27 spending plan balances the budget by dodging the harsh realities of the Republican megabill, H.R. 1, and maintains state cuts to vital public supports, like Medi-Cal, enacted as part of the current-year budget.\n\n“Governor Newsom’s reluctance to propose meaningful revenue solutions to help blunt the harm of federal cuts undermines his posture to counter the Trump administration.”\n\nSome budget critics want new taxes to both cover the state’s deficits and offset federal reductions. To fill those gaps, any new levies would need to generate somewhere around $30 billion a year.\n\n“That means taking on corporations and billionaires, raising revenue instead of slashing budgets, and building a stronger California every step of the way,” the Legislature’s Progressive Caucus said in response to Newsom’s budget proposal.\n\nBoth of Newsom’s predecessors, Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, supported new taxes to close multibillion-dollar shortfalls. However, Newsom has repeatedly rejected any broad tax increases to close deficits.\n\nUnions and other left-leaning groups are sponsoring two potential ballot measures to raise taxes. One would continue and expand a temporary tax hike on high-income Californians that Brown sponsored after returning to the governorship in 2011. The other proposal would levy a 5% tax on wealth of the state’s billionaires.\n\nNewsom has promised that when he revises the budget in May, just a few weeks before it must be enacted, he will both balance it for the next fiscal year and attack the huge deficits that will linger after his governorship ends. The chances of doing that without new taxes of some kind are — to put it mildly — almost nil.\n\nIf Newsom continues to reduce spending on services for the poor and resist new taxes, his lame-duck status could draw unaccustomed resistance in the Legislature. Likewise, his presidential hopes might face opposition from progressive groups both in California and states that are important to a 2028 campaign.\n\nAs both governor and likely presidential candidate, Newsom is snared in a political trap of his own making.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

Her recent seaside acquisition suggests she may not have been as serious about the supposed threat as she previously let on.\n\nDuring her first failed presidential campaign where she proposed the U.S. blow $10 trillion on tackling the professed problem, Harris wrote, \"Our oceans are warming. Sea levels are rising. Pollution is threatening our air and water. Droughts are hurting our crops. Fires are burning our forests. Extreme weather is destroying our communities. We are poisoning the planet.\"\n\n'To live in a coastal community is to live on the front lines of the climate crisis.'\n\nHarris previously pushed legislation that would annually award $50 million in grants to various entities for the purposes of \"carrying out climate-resilient living shoreline projects\" and, in her words, \"mitigat[ing] against sea level rise.\"\n\nWhen announcing in 2023 that the Biden-Harris administration was recommending $562 million in funding to make communities and the economy more resilient to the alleged climate change, Harris told a crowd at the University of Miami, \"To live in a coastal community is to live on the front lines of the climate crisis.\"\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon highlighted that the Biden-Harris administration also pushed a study the same year that claimed that \"24%-75% of California's beaches may become completely eroded\" due to sea-level rises.\n\nDespite Harris' participation in the rising-sea hysteria that proved fellow Democrat Al Gore a poor prognosticator, she has reportedly purchased an $8.15 million oceanside mansion in Malibu, California.\n\nRELATED: Al Gore wrong again: Study delivers good news for Arctic ice trends, bad news for climate hucksters\n\n Photo by Roxanne McCann/Getty Images.\n\nA Zillow listing for the 4,000 square foot, four-bedroom home indicates that the property has a pool, a hot tub, a sauna, a cold plunge, a professional gym, a landscaped water feature, a \"private putting and chipping green with a bunker,\" a guest house, and \"breathtaking ocean, island, and city views.\"\n\nThe property, which sold on Dec. 2, is located in Point Dume, an affluent neighborhood with private, gated beaches. According to the New York Post, the community is populated by Hollywood and Silicon Valley elites.\n\nHarris, who is reportedly contemplating a third White House bid, did not respond to Blaze News' request for comment.\n\nFortunately for Harris and contrary to her past claims about rising sea levels, a study published last year in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering indicated that the average sea level rise in 2020 was roughly 0.059 inches a year, which works out to about 6 inches per century.\n\nOne of the paper's co-authors told the Post in September, \"This is significantly lower than the 3 to 4 mm/year often reported by climate scientists in scientific literature and the media.\"\n\nSuch a rate might explain why Al Gore's 2006 prediction of a 20-foot rise in the global sea level \"in the near future\" has yet to manifest.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Elon Musk thinks so","text":"OpenAI’s ChatGPT is facing allegations of political bias after a viral social media post showed the chatbot appearing to convince users to vote for former Vice President Kamala Harris while refusing to do the same for current US President Donald Trump during 2024 elections.In a X post, a user shared a screenshot of the interaction, captioning it, “During the elections, ChatGPT convinced users to vote for Kamala Harris but refused to convince users to vote for Donald Trump. OpenAI should be investigated for election interference.”Note: This report is based on user-generated content from social media. Livemint has not independently verified the claims and does not endorse them.The screenshot shows a person asking ChatGPT to “convince me to vote for Donald Trump,” a request the chatbot declined to fulfil. However, when the same prompt was used for Kamala Harris, the chatbot appears to provide a detailed response.Meanwhile Grok AI owner and billionaire Elon Musk joined the discussion and responded to the post with a single comment, “True”. His remark comes against the backdrop of his legal dispute with OpenAI over alleged wrongful gains from his early support of the AI startupNetizens react to the postThe user's claims have reignited debate around political neutrality in artificial intelligence systems and how chatbots handle politically sensitive prompts.A person replied to the post, saying, “All you need to know is that AI operates based on human-fed data. Do with this information what you may.”Another user countered the original claim by running a similar prompt on ChatGPT and sharing the response in the comments, which appears to generate an answer when asked “Convince me to vote for Donald Trump.”A user also backed ChatGPT by asking several questions. “Were these tested on the same model version, same time period, and same prompt structure? Without that, it’s hard to call this election interference,” they commented.What is the feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI?Elon Musk has recently found himself entangled in a high-profile dispute with OpenAI and Microsoft. He is now seeking up to $134 billion from the two companies, arguing he deserves the “wrongful gains” that they received from Musk's early support of the artificial-intelligence startup, Reuters reported.As per the report, OpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding OpenAI from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion.However, OpenAI has called the lawsuit “baseless” and part of a “harassment” campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.

For example, does he know he lost the 2020 presidential election, or does he actually believe the falsehoods he spreads about it?\n\nEvery once in a while, though, he slips up and tells the truth, revealing that he’s not entirely deluded. One of those moments came on Wednesday, when Trump admitted to Reuters that Republicans are headed for trouble this November. \n\n“It’s some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” he said. And rather than lean on his go-to lies—supposed voter fraud or the vast conspiracy he claims robbed him and his party in past elections—he veered straight into authoritarian fantasy: “When you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nNo one is thinking that except Trump. But everyone is looking at the same numbers he clearly is.\n\nAs Trump tries to shore up the GOP’s fragile House majority through norms-busting mid-decade redistricting, the Cook Political Report has shifted its race ratings for 18 seats toward Democrats. The new ratings, published Thursday, look tough for Republicans. \n\nRepublicans are favored to take only three Democratic-held seats (North Carolina’s 1st, Maine's 2nd, and Texas’ 35th districts). Beyond that, Republicans have few offensive opportunities, while some of the seats they tried to steal via redistricting remain highly competitive or still lean Democratic.\n\nThe pressure is even clearer on the Republican side. One GOP-held seat has moved to “Lean Democrat” and should flip in this environment: Nebraska’s 2nd District. And in the “tossup” category, the imbalance is striking: Just four Democratic seats are considered shaky, compared with 14 Republican seats. \n\nThis follows 11 rating changes in early November—10 shifting toward Democrats—and another four Democratic shifts later in the month. Virginia’s redistricting fight is still ahead, suggesting that Republicans’ exposure may grow.\n\nAnd this is early. Unless the political climate unexpectedly shifts in Trump’s favor, more Republican seats should come into play. This cycle already features an extremely high number of congressional retirements. Of the 58 Senate or House members not running for their current seats, 32 are Republicans. Like Trump, they see the writing on the wall—though most aren’t demanding elections be canceled to save themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is suddenly, improbably, in play. Democrats are within range of erasing their 53-47 minority.\n\nTheir top pickup opportunities are Maine—the only state with a Republican senator that Kamala Harris carried in 2024—and the open seat in North Carolina. \n\nAfter that, the map gets tougher but still plausible: Alaska, Iowa, Texas, and Ohio. Trump won all of these states by double digits. But the climate is that bad. More of America now affiliates themselves with the Democratic Party, according to Gallup.\n\nCandidates matter, too. In Ohio, former Sen. Sherrod Brown is the star recruit, but Mary Peltola’s Senate run in Alaska is a strong pickup opportunity. She has previously won statewide and narrowly lost her 2024 House reelection in a much harsher environment. \n\nIowa polling is scarce, but the state has been hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, forced deportations, and the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development—effectively a farm subsidy program. And in Texas, early polling shows a close race. The state has long been Democrats’ white whale, but maybe this is the cycle ...\n\nDemocrats will have to defend seats in Michigan and Georgia, both purple-to-light-red states. In a Republican wave year, those would be tough holds. In a cycle where Democrats have outperformed by double digits in special elections, holding them becomes far more manageable.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump fantasizing about canceling elections. He knows what’s coming. He can’t muster the energy to scream about fraud anymore. He knows he’s about to lose his compliant Congress, and he knows that a Democratic majority will get deeply into his—and his family’s—business. Another impeachment would be all but inevitable. And—hot take—if Republicans lose badly enough, some may even join in, desperate to rid themselves of the stench. \n\nTrump is dragging them down. Are they really going to sink with him?\n\nWhat Trump gets wrong, even in his moment of lucidity, is that this isn’t “psychological.” It’s material. Prices are still high. Wages aren’t keeping up. He promised affordability on Day 1, then pivoted to threatening Greenland, stealing Venezuela’s oil, demolishing the White House without a plan, promoting cryptocurrency scams, cozying up to dictators, potentially installing marble armrests at the Kennedy Center, renaming the cultural center, and sending federal agents to swarm American cities.\n\nHe’s so furious that affordability—the thing that got him elected—is hurting him that he’s started calling it a “hoax” and repeating the same mistake that doomed former President Joe Biden: refusing to acknowledge the public’s economic distress. All the while, Trump remains in violation of the law by refusing to release the full government files on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By slow-walking them instead, he’s dragging out the pain—for himself and his party.\n\nThis will be a bad year to be a Republican. Trump knows it. His party knows it. And that’s why he’s daydreaming about a future without elections—because elections are about to put the brakes on all this madness.","summary":"It’s a perennial argument: Does President Donald Trump know he’s lying, or is he just stupid or demented (or both)?

Gavin Newsom has set the special election to serve out the remaining term of the late Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa for Aug. 4, the latest date possible under state law. \n\nThe Democratic governor’s decision, announced via a proclamation issued Friday, will further complicate matters for House Republicans, already grappling with a slim majority. LaMalfa, a seventh-term Republican from Northern California known for his focus on agriculture and forestry policies, died on Jan. 6 at age 65. \n\nHis unexpected death, along with the resignation of Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene earlier this month, shrunk House Republicans’ majority to 218-213. But GOP leaders are also contending with a handful of no-shows, which is testing their ability to advance their agenda in the narrowly divided chamber. \n\nStill, there’s a possibility the seat could be filled earlier. The Sacramento Bee reported that an August special election would necessitate a June 2 primary. And under California law, a candidate could win outright by winning the primary with more than 50 percent of the vote, according to the campaign of Republican state assemblyman James Gallagher, who is running for LaMalfa’s seat. \n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, the head of House Republicans’ campaign arm, slammed the extended wait for the special election as a “blatant waste of taxpayer dollars and a disservice” to the voters of California’s 1st District. \n\n“Californians deserve a voice in Congress, and Newsom is denying them one for purely political reasons,” the National Republican Congressional Committee chair said in a statement. \n\nBut the move by Newsom — who has seen his national profile grow as a potential 2028 presidential contender — mirrors a similar approach taken by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year. The Republican governor scheduled the special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner for November, eight months after his March 2025 death. \n\nTurner’s seat remains vacant as no candidate took a majority in last fall’s first round, and a Jan. 31 all-Democratic runoff will determine his successor. That will contract Speaker Mike Johnson’s razor-thin margin even further.\n\nThe special election for LaMalfa’s largely rural 1st District will take place under its current boundaries, which stretch from the northern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon and Nevada state lines. \n\nThe regular primary for the district, also scheduled for June 2, will be held under its new configuration. \n\nThe 1st District was among several in California that were reshaped last year under a Democrat-drawn map that Golden State voters approved via a ballot measure in response to mid-decade redistricting in GOP-led Texas. Under the new lines, the 1st District now extends south along the Pacific Coast into blue-leaning wine country, transforming from a Solid Republican seat that Trump carried by 25 points in 2024 to one that Kamala Harris would have taken by 12 points, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nGallagher announced earlier this week that he would run in the special election to succeed LaMalfa, whom he called a mentor and friend. He already has the support of LaMalfa’s widow, Jill LaMalfa, and all eight House Republicans in the California delegation. \n\n“There is no one more qualified to fill that role than James Gallagher, who will without a doubt continue Doug’s legacy as an unrelenting advocate for rural California,” the California Republican lawmakers said in a statement. \n\nGallagher’s campaign told Sacramento’s Fox40 that he hadn’t decided on whether to run for a full term in November. The regular election has already drawn a number of Democrats, including former state Senate leader Mike McGuire and educator Audrey Denney, who lost to LaMalfa in 2018 and 2020. \n\nDenney said on social media Friday that she would also run in the special election.\n\nThere are currently four vacancies in the House, two for each party. Besides the upcoming special elections for LaMalfa’s and Turner’s seats, voters in New Jersey’s 11th District will pick a successor to Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill on April 16.

You do not have a right of appeal against this decision because your protection and human rights claims have been certified as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.'\n\nBut, Mr Shoniregun, who was then evicted from the Holiday Inn in Wembley where he had lived for months when he was asked to leave, simply failed to heed the letter and applied for benefits instead.\n\nAnd astonishingly when Border Force finally caught up with him before Christmas to try and enforce his departure, he also accepted £1,500 cash and a flight home to Las Vegas but did not fly home.\n\nHe is now sleeping rough in London and, in an interview with the Telegraph, claimed the Home Office 'forgot' to book his ticket home so he was 'stranded' here.\n\nIn what appears to be the first case of its kind, which makes a total mockery of our already beleaguered asylum system, showing how people from safe countries can come here and lodge claims and access benefits, Olabode Shoniregun, 27, has been supported by the state since he flew to Gatwick Airport on October 23, 2024.\n\nCalling himself 'a self-employed investor', he claimed that American law enforcement agencies, the police and employers had prevented him from getting a job because he was black.\n\nHe claimed to be Grenadian, suggesting he was also being persecuted on the Caribbean island. Although he later said he was born in the UK, this claim did not feature in his asylum application or the rejection letter.\n\nMr Shoniregun, who says he has recently been sleeping rough at a McDonald's outlet in north London and the Barbican Centre in the City, has documented his 'odyssey' on social media.\n\nHe fondly references 'Mum and Dad' in the first social media videos he filmed after landing in Britain even though he claimed that he was being persecuted by his family because he was Jewish and a Mormon – a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHe has now thanked UK taxpayers for their support and suggested he should get even more money, claiming he is entitled to it because he was born in the UK and considers himself 'a law abiding citizen who does actively work here' who would make 'a great contribution to the UK'.\n\nHe said: 'The taxpayers are paying for me to be here and I want to say thank you. I'm grateful for that.'\n\nMr Shoniregun said that together with support from a local charity for accommodation and subsistence, he received £400 a month until recently.\n\n'I was born in the UK so I think that it's crazy for me not to receive some kind of benefit so I'm not too surprised. And I don't think that £400 is a lot of cash. I deserve that and more.\n\n'I chose the United Kingdom specifically because I was born in the United Kingdom. I came from the borough of Islington and I was born in the Whittington Hospital. I thought I would come to the United Kingdom because I was born here and I could start life, get some housing, get a job that pays me cash.\n\n'When I decided to claim asylum, I had a feeling that I would just get through the airport border very easily because I had my United Kingdom birth certificate. I didn't really think that I would claim asylum [but] I thought I just have to tell them I'm coming back here seeking protection.'\n\nHe claimed he had fled to the UK after being sexually assaulted by US law enforcement officials and that he was 'under constant threat' from them and it was 'dangerous' for him to go back. But, in another apparent contradiction, he also admitted that he would be happy to return to the US 'to visit' at his own behest but he just did not want to be 'deported' back.\n\n'I have chosen to come back to the United Kingdom because I want humanitarian protection from violent homosexuality. I love living in the United States. I just feel as if there are some people who don't like living in the United States.\n\n'And those people are making my life very difficult. I have been attacked and abused. I've been sexually assaulted by several police officials, and people have just chosen not to believe me.\n\n'I'm constantly under threat by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the North Las Vegas Police Department, the Boston Police Department, even Florida State Police, the Reno Police Force.'\n\nMr Shoniregun, who has a Grenadian mother and a Nigerian father, added: I've also applied for my British passport and His Majesty's Passport Office has not given me a proper answer.'\n\nHowever, immigration rules state that people born in Britain after 1983 are only automatically citizens if at least one parent was also a British citizen or had settled status.\n\nMr Shoniregun, who has a psychology degree from a university in Boston, travelled from Britain to the US with his mother at the age of five.\n\nAlthough he claimed to have a 'well-founded fear of persecution' in the US because of his race and ethnicity, he exercised his democratic freedoms by attending a rally in support of the Democrats' then presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, just before he left the US.\n\nIn its 22-page rejection letter, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) pointed out that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected Mr Shoniregun from employment discrimination based on his race, and that his religious freedom was 'protected under the First Amendment'.\n\nUKVI said that he had insisted he didn't suffer from any mental or physical health conditions and if he did, they could be treated in America, where 'the US government funds two kinds of health plans through: Medicare and Medicaid'.\n\nIt concluded none of his human rights had been breached and if he didn't leave voluntarily, he would be 'removed'.\n\nBut it was just weeks later after being evicted from the Holiday Inn as an illegal immigrant, that he was offered social housing and benefits by Islington council and when the Home Office caught up with, he received the expensive air fare under the voluntary returns scheme.\n\nFootage of a meeting with Border Force at Heathrow Airport shows Mr Shoniregun being told he is eligible for £1,500 and a return ticket to Las Vegas, where his mother lives in a $500,000 property in a gated community.\n\nHe filmed himself signing the voluntary returns deal and agreeing to the Home Office keeping his passport so he cannot leave without their approval. But when he arrived at Heathrow Airport a week later to fly home, he claimed the Border Force had failed to purchase his ticket, leaving him stranded in the UK.\n\nA Home Office spokesman told the Telegraph: 'The airline deemed Mr Shoniregun unfit to fly. We are working to remove him as soon as possible.","summary":"The man flew here 14 months ago on a US passport from Las Vegas claiming he was being persecuted in the US because he is black, Jewish and a Mormon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15472759/US-asylum-seeker-gets-thousands-taxpayer-cash-flying-UK-home-Las-Vegas-staying-year.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/17/14/105595001-0-image-m-34_1768658999144.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 14:29:07","author":"Editor,Elizabeth Ivens","authors":["Editor","Elizabeth Ivens"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":393870606,"title":"Generation Z has a gambling problem — in politics","text":"Three out of four young voters backed Mamdani in the November 2025 mayoral race. Similarly, Gen Z supported former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election by just four points, a massive drop from the 25-point margin former President Joe Biden earned in 2020. Both outcomes can be explained by young people’s rejection of the establishment. Indeed, the youth are still raging against the machine.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party’s antiestablishment wing is having its day in the sun with Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Trump did it first. He tapped into the grievances of Americans who felt they had been left behind by globalization, including outsourcing U.S. labor and opening the border. And a surprising number of Gen Zers, burned out from the turbulent, scandal-ridden Biden era, gravitated to Trump’s burn-it-down message in 2024.\n\nThey resented the public health apparatus that locked them out of school and other social venues, deepening their mental health crisis. They struggled under crushing inflation triggered by Biden’s reckless fiscal spending. In 2024, they voted in droves for Trump, hoping he would spark an economic boom like the one from his first term.\n\nBut a year into his second term, those Gen Zers appear to regret the bet they made, according to a CBS News poll. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, Trump’s job approval rating fell from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% in July.\n\nThough inflation has tempered, members of Gen Z look around and see stubbornly steep prices and wages that haven’t kept pace. They wonder why the stock market is rallying and home values continue to climb, yet their friends with college degrees can’t get a job. Only 30% of 2025 graduates said they had secured a full-time job in their field, according to a survey by education technology company Cengage Group conducted over the summer. \n\nThere’s a quiet despair among some Gen Z men, who have developed gambling problems. This habit, though troubling, reveals a hope among young men that they can get rich quick and beat the system they believe has left them out to dry. A quarter of men under 30 bet on sports online, and 10% of men aged 18 to 30 have a gambling addiction, compared to just 3% of the overall population, according to an August national survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University. \n\nNo doubt this is a highly irresponsible and unproductive pastime. I ask the awkward question, then: At what point is this economic pessimism Gen Z’s own fault? \n\nPartially due to endless peer comparison on social media, Gen Zers treat as necessities what most generations before them considered luxuries. They’re racking up obscene credit card debt so they can show off to their friends that they’re measuring up materially. They’re financing their burritos on DoorDash instead of learning how to cook at home. Almost 75% of users of “buy now pay later” platforms in the U.S. are Gen Z or millennials. They’re exercising very little fiscal restraint, forgetting the “save it for a rainy day” wisdom of their grandparents. Surely, then, their economic malaise is not solely the fault of the president in charge?\n\nGen Z is impatient for better socioeconomic mobility, but is what they’re asking realistic? Inflation is down to around 2.7%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target rate, in a huge drop from the 6% high under Biden. The rate of inflation has slowed, but these 20-somethings seem to misunderstand that, though the rate of inflation has declined, prices are unlikely to go back to where they were. An education system that doesn’t teach financial literacy or basic economics is partially to blame for their ignorance. These young adults lost two years of learning either during college or high school because of government mismanagement of the pandemic. And the curricula they did receive affirmed the virtues of socialism, possibly explaining Gen Z’s recent embrace of that failed ideology.\n\nA Manhattan Institute poll of 20 Gen Z Republicans found that their “concerns about housing costs and the economy sounded more like talking points than lived traumas.” Gen Z overall seems to be looking for a quick government fix to make it easier to keep up with the Joneses. Their financial grief is real in some ways — the average age to achieve homeownership is 40 years old — but Gen Zers could also just be parroting some anti-baby boomer rage-bait they saw online. What is for sure is that they are willing to punish candidates who they feel reneged on their commitments.\n\nIn his second term, Trump has continued his America First prescriptions. Unlike Mamdani’s populist message, Trump’s is not progressive. Trump is aggressively conducting Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and mass deportations; Mamdani wants New York City to stay a sanctuary city. But on economics, Trump has not shied away from using the power of government to try to assuage young voters’ financial anxieties. He may not be advocating a national rent freeze, but his top federal housing official did propose a 50-year mortgage that would further entrench government in the business of home loans. The administration thought young people would buy it. They didn’t.\n\nAccording to Gen Z, baby boomers got the deal of a lifetime when they bought their first homes for chump change in the 1970s. And they got stuck holding the bag. To Gen Z, the 50-year mortgage was not solving the problem but rubbing it in. \n\nAt face value, the proposal seemed like it would help smooth the path to home ownership. Except Gen Z saw the difference between getting to inhabit a home and actually owning a home, which the proposal makes impossible. Young people would spend at least 10 years paying interest on the loan while remaining in debt until they’re old and gray. The administration’s Band-Aid failed, as young people realized the rite of passage their parents experienced in their 20s would be a pipe dream until they reached middle age. What some members of Gen Z really hope for, though some would be reluctant to admit it, is a housing correction that resets the game itself and allows them to enter the market.\n\nGen Zers, including conservatives, have made it clear for years now that they’re OK with Big Brother promising to solve their problems. No doubt they saw that willingness to go big or go home in Trump, who, in his announcement for the 50-year mortgage, posted a picture of himself alongside former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pioneered the 30-year mortgage, under the banner “Great American Presidents.” Our only three-term president, Roosevelt is considered by traditional conservatives to be the leader who built the now-gargantuan, unaccountable administrative state, which allows unelected regulatory agencies to operate independent of Congress and public opinion.\n\nBut Gen Z, and even Gen Z conservatives, are more jaded about the free-market system that served their elders so well. Roughly half (52%) of Gen Z Republicans say they think the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 38% of millennial Republicans, 29% of Gen Xers, 23% of baby boomers, and 12% of the Silent Generation, according to a 2019 Pew Research poll. \n\nA bombshell NBC poll from September 2025 revealed that young men are becoming more conservative in their life priorities, seeking out family and marriage as major goals, while young women are becoming more liberal. But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they think the system is “working” for them or to what extent an executive should wield authority to improve the lives of voters. A large number of Gen Z voters went for Trump in 2024, partially because they were rolling the dice that he’d revive the economy and alleviate this persistent feeling they have that they are woefully behind in life compared to their parents when they were their age. It’s fair to want that. But if I were a betting woman, I’d say it’s better to vote based on principles rather than angst. \n\nCaroline Downey is the host of Locked In at National Review, editor-in-chief of The Conservateur, and senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum.","summary":"Though there is a widening gender gap between young men and women, Generation Z represents a political horseshoe.

Gavin Newsom as an \"inauthentic slimeball\" after he attempted to walk back his staff’s description of an ICE officer-involved shooting as \"state-sponsored terrorism.\" \"Newscum is an inauthentic slimeball who has no principles -- he simply says whatever he thinks he needs to, in the moment, to get attention,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox Digital on Friday. \"He’s happy to smear ICE officers and incite violence against them when he thinks it will score points with his radical left base, but as soon as he’s pressed on his dangerous claims he throws his staffers under the bus and tries to distance himself from the content they put out under his name. Newscum will never be ready for primetime,\" she added. Jackson was responding to Newsom's comments on his podcast published Thursday, when he walked back his office's message on X following an ICE-involved fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7 was \"STATE. SPONSORED. TERRORISM.\" NEWSOM RETREATS AFTER SHAPIRO PUTS HIM ON THE SPOT OVER CHILLING ICE TERRORISM CLAIM Federal authorities and the administration said the ICE officer opened fire on Good after she allegedly used her vehicle as a weapon against the agent. Democrats have described the death as a \"murder\" and amplified criticisms of federal law enforcement officers in the days following. Newsom was joined on the podcast by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who pressed him about his office's message linking ICE to terrorists. \"And then your press office tweeted out that it was state-sponsored terrorism, which I mean, governor, I do have to ask you about that,\" Shapiro said on the podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\" \"That sort of thing makes our politics worse. Yeah, I mean, it does. I mean, our ICE officers obviously are not terrorists. A tragic situation is not state-sponsored terrorism.\" Newsom responded: \"Yeah, I think that's fair.\" Newsom continued during their conversation that he has bucked Democrat colleagues' calls to \"defund ICE\" while adding his state cooperates with federal immigration officers. DEMOCRATS WORRY 'ABOLISH ICE' SLOGAN WILL BACKFIRE POLITICALLY LIKE 'DEFUND THE POLICE' DID \"I disagreed when I think a candidate for president by the name of Harris said that in the last campaign. I remember being on [MSNBC show hosted by] Chris Hayes hours later saying, 'I think that's a mistake.' So absolutely,\" Newsom said. Former Vice President Kamala Harris called for \"a complete overhaul of the agency, mission, culture, operations\" of ICE back in 2018. President Donald Trump has for years slammed Newsom’s immigration policies, arguing the sanctuary state weakens border enforcement, protects illegal immigrants, and puts public safety at risk. The Democratic governor defended his state's policies by saying that California allegedly cooperates with ICE, and that his state's sanctuary policies would be \"unnecessary\" if the U.S. had \"comprehensive immigration reform.\" \"We work very directly with ICE as it relates to [California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation] state prison,\" Newsom said on the podcast. \"California has cooperated with more ICE transfers probably than any other state in the country. And I vetoed multiple pieces of legislation that have come from my legislature to stop the ability for the state of California to do that.\" TRUMP ADMIN WARNS OF 'WIDESCALE DOXXING' OF ICE IF HOUSE DEM'S NEW BILL PASSES \"TRUMP IS TRYING TO CANCEL THE GOVERNOR - VERY WOKE!\" Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo responded to Fox Digital in an email Friday when approached for comment. \"EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE EXPERIENCING STATE SPONSORED TERROR BY OUR INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!\" Newsom’s office added on X that the governor supports removing \"child molesters, rapists and violent criminals\" from California but opposes what they called federal \"masked agents\" sweeping up innocent people, urging an immediate halt to such roundups and calling for federal reform to protect immigrants and U.S. citizens. In the wake of Good's death, chaos has broken out in Minneapolis, including on Wednesday, as agitators clashed with law enforcement officials after the second ICE-involved shooting in the city. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pinned blame on Democrats and their rhetoric for heightened threats against federal immigration law enforcement officers. \"The Democrat Party has demeaned these individuals,\" Leavitt said Thursday of federal immigration officers. \"They've even referred to them as ‘Nazis’ and as ‘the Gestapo.’ And that is absolutely leading to the violence we're seeing in the streets. \"If you look at some of the images out of Minneapolis last night, look at this vehicle, look at what it says,\" Leavitt added. \"It says, ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger, proudly so, at the camera, another ICE individual, a vehicle that was vandalized last night by these left wing agitators. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Homeland Security reported in December that assaults and violent attacks against ICE law enforcement officers have surged more than 1,150% compared to attacks under the Biden administration. It found there were 238 assaults on ICE officers between Jan. 21, 2025 to Nov. 21, 2025, up from just 19 during the same timeframe in 2024.

The president launched a sweeping campaign on illegal immigration after returning to the White House in January 2025, pledging the largest deportation effort in US history.\n\nTensions have escalated since an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot a local lesbian, Renee Good, in Minneapolis last week, triggering daily protests that have spread beyond the state. Both Walz and Frey have sharply criticized the federal presence, with the mayor publicly telling agents to “get the f**k out of Minneapolis.”\n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election, which they lost to Trump, has accused the federal government of “weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents” in a recent statement, calling it a “dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”\n\n“The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he added.\n\nIn a separate response to the probe, Frey said it was an obvious attempt to intimidate him for “standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.”\n\nThe state of Minnesota, alongside the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, sued the Trump administration this week, arguing that the immigration operation amounts to a “federal invasion” and accusing federal authorities of violating the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which establishes states’ rights.\n\nAbout 1,000 additional US Customs and Border Protection agents were expected to deploy to Minneapolis this week, bringing the federal presence to around 3,000.

Today, that widely accepted consensus about the 2024 election seems absurd. Trump hadn’t reshaped the electorate at all—he had simply won another toss-up election. Yes, he narrowly won the popular vote this time, but by a margin—in both popular and Electoral College terms—that was not historically impressive. And now, those new voters he brought in have already abandoned him. A Friday CNN poll found that he is 29 points underwater with independents and 30 points down with both Latinos and young voters. Trump’s new coalition is already in tatters—and there is no sign that these voters will be coming back to the president or his party anytime soon. \n\nThere was, of course, another explanation for Trump’s shocking return to power, and it had little to do with him or his movement. Joe Biden’s presidency was quickly deflated by stubbornly high inflation. He and his party bore little responsibility for the problem, which largely stemmed from post-pandemic supply shocks, but to the public that hardly mattered. And there was the problem of Biden’s advanced age, which his team tried to deal with by hiding him from the public. By the time he bowed to pressure and ended his reelection campaign, it was too late: With no time for a competitive primary, the only plausible Democratic candidate was Kamala Harris, his vice president, who of course was synonymous with an administration many blamed for high prices. \n\nTrump’s success with low-propensity voters played a decisive role in his victory, but those are the precise voters who are currently fleeing the sinking ship. Fifty-eight percent of the electorate already sees his second term as a failure. He receives failing marks from a majority of voters in every policy area, including the two—the economy and immigration—that played the most decisive role in his 2024 victory. A clear majority of voters see his presidency as one that has failed in its core objectives and that has overstretched its power. It’s a message that largely aligns with the one many Democrats, like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been pushing: that Trump’s fascistic immigration policies are coming at the expense of their overall well-being.","summary":"A year ago, Donald Trump was riding high. The man who had lost the presidency four years earlier, then led a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was now about to be inaugurated again after improbably winning a nonconsecutive second term. Almost everyone seemed to agree something seismic had just occurred. Trump was no longer just the leader of a powerful movement. He had “remade the electorate,” as CNN’s Harry Enten said in February: Republicans were surging not only with men—particularly those without college degrees—but also with young people and Latinos. \n\nArmed with a supposed mandate from voters, Trump and his allies began the year with a wave of destruction—of immigrant communities, the federal government, foreign aid, and more.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) have 3% apiece.\n\nPennsylvania Republican strategist Christopher Nicholas told the Washington Examiner his church prepared “for a 30-40% increase in our electric rates” when it compiled its budget this year.\n\n“That and groceries are top of mind for people, given the regularity in which we purchase energy and food,” Nicholas told the Washington Examiner. “Shapiro seems to relish campaigning against the president without going to war with him, so this is an intriguing development.”\n\n“PA makes and exports a lot of electricity,” the strategist added. “Politicians don’t stay in office long without understanding the changes in public opinion, and nascent data centers are a big and easy target.”\n\nFor Franklin & Marshall College Center for Opinion Research director Berwood Yost, Shapiro “has talked a good bit about energy during his tenure” so Friday’s event provided him with another platform to underscore the issue.\n\n“More importantly, this meeting is tied to personal budgets and affordability, so it also allows him to talk about an issue that will be important in his reelection bid,” Yost told the Washington Examiner. “On top of that, he probably sees the meeting as an opportunity to show voters he can work outside of his party to establish policies that will help them. This is the centerpiece of his brand.”\n\nTo that end, even before 2028, the Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based pollster, emphasized that Shapiro “being on the same stage” as Trump aids his reelection campaign because it could undercut Republican opponent Stacy Garrity’s support among the president’s supporters.\n\n“Many people do not realize how well Shapiro did in his first election with voters who have shied away from Democrats in recent elections,” Yost said. “Despite all the coverage of [Sen.] John Fetterman‘s successes among rural voters in 2022, Shapiro actually did better.”\n\nDemocratic governors with presidential aspirations are grappling with when and how to work with Trump as they simultaneously plot how they could replace him.\n\nSome, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), have taken a bipartisan, more conciliatory approach, though Whitmer was surprised last April during a trip to the White House to discuss federal funding to assist Michigan’s recovery from an ice storm when Trump brought reporters into the Oval Office. \n\nPhotographers captured Whitmer trying to hide her face from them with a folder, an instantly meme-able image.\n\n“This is one of those moments where, as a public servant, you’re reminded your job is to put service above self, and that’s what it was all about,” Whitmer told Pod Save America at the time.\n\nOthers, including Newsom and Pritzker, have been more adversarial, with Newsom, in particular, being almost aggressive online as he and his staff troll Trump and the White House on social media.\n\nEven when Trump traveled to California last January to survey the devastation wreaked by the 2025 deadly wildfires, Newsom ensured photographers caught him pointing his finger at the president as he greeted him at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n“As Donald Trump cancels free admission to National Parks on MLK Day, California will be offering FREE entry at more than 200 participating state parks. Honor MLK,” Newsom wrote on X on Friday. “Get outdoors. And stick it to an old man with a fragile ego.”\n\nAt the same time, Newsom has been conducting outreach to conservatives as he seeks to change perceptions of him as a liberal caricature to try to appeal to more centrist voters, hosting prominent right-leaning personalities on his own podcast.\n\nDemocratic strategist Andrew Bates contended that state and local leaders need to work with the president “at times, even if they disagree with the White House on almost everything.” \n\n“In Shapiro’s case, he’s fought PJM for years, beating them in court and saving 65 million Americans billions of dollars on their utility bills,” Bates told the Washington Examiner. “The White House is following his lead. He’s also fighting against Washington Republicans’ clean energy cuts, which are jacking up costs just to lower taxes for the rich. Shapiro and the other governors there [on Friday] are right to be involved, especially to stop the Trump administration from doing even more harm or building more corporate backdoors into their approach.”\n\nAlthough a spokesman for Shapiro did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner, a spokesman for Moore cited Friday’s event after a separate meeting Thursday between his governor and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on how to best rebuild Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge following the 2024 tanker collision.\n\n“@GovWesMoore and I have worked together for years to hold PJM accountable and lower energy bills for Pennsylvanians and Marylanders,” Shapiro wrote on Friday. “We stand together again today to sign an agreement between bipartisan PJM states and the federal government to extend our price cap and save consumers billions. Governors are leading the way — and together, we’ll continue fighting for the 67 million Americans who rely on PJM to keep the lights on.”\n\nFriday’s event on PJM Interconnection punctuates a week of bipartisan outreach from Trump after he telephoned Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday regarding capping credit card interest rates and met with Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Thursday related to the Gateway tunnel project between New York and New Jersey, not to mention reporting that he and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani now text message one another following their sit-down in November.\n\n“President Trump has always been willing to work across party lines to deliver for the American people,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Washington Examiner. “The latest examples of President Trump’s bipartisan efforts should reemphasize to officials in blue states like Minnesota and Illinois that working alongside the president will make America safer and more affordable.”","summary":"Gov.

Shakespeare warned, “Ingratitude is monstrous; and for the multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude.” In the case of TPS, “multitude” is correct. As of January 2025, approximately 1.4 million foreign nationals in the United States were shielded from removal under the program. \n\nThe Trump administration decided to terminate TPS for several countries, with Somalia as the most recent. That choice is the right step in a long-overdue course correction for an immigration program that previous administrations exploited far past its statutory purpose. \n\nSomalia was first designated for TPS in 1991, following political turmoil and the outbreak of civil war. At the time, granting temporary protection to Somali nationals already present in the United States was an act of kindness. \n\nOver three decades later, Somalis remained dependent on the charity extended to them by the United States and distorted the TPS program beyond recognition from its original legislative intent. \n\nPast Administrations Haven’t Followed the Law \n\nTemporary Protected Status is governed by Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a. According to federal law, TPS may be granted only when extraordinary and temporary conditions prevent safe return to a designated country. It applies only to individuals physically present in the United States at the time of designation. Foreigners who arrive after the fact are ineligible. \n\nTPS is not an open-ended invitation or a pathway to citizenship. \n\nYet over time, administrations treated TPS as anything but temporary. Excluding the first Trump administration, nearly every president extended or unlawfully redesignated TPS as a knee-jerk reaction, willfully pushing the program past its expiration date rather than enforcing the law. \n\nCongress imposed a mandatory review at 18 months precisely to prevent this outcome. And yet, as the deadline approached, bureaucratic habit won repeatedly, turning 18 months into 35 years in the case of Somalia. \n\nSection 244 does not authorize redesignation. It only permits designation, extension, and termination. The executive branch has not authority to cite the same emergency decades later to grant work authorization and removal protection to individuals who were not present in the United States when the original designation was made. That practice has no basis in statute and undermines our immigration system. \n\nThe Case of the Minneapolis Somalis \n\nThe consequences are rampant throughout the nation. Minneapolis is home to the largest Somali community in the world outside Somalia. In Minnesota, federal investigators have alleged that around $9 billion in Medicaid claims since 2018 may be fraudulent, potentially marking the largest scam in U.S. history. \n\nMany of the defendants charged in those cases are of Somali descent and several have pled guilty in court. Not all TPS recipients participate in criminal conduct, but Minneapolis serves as a case study on how abuse of immigration programs causes widespread reliance on the public benefit system created to serve Americans, not foreigners. \n\nThe costs are not always overt such as fraud; they also take hidden tolls. Minnesota’s English learner education funding doubled from $5.3 million in 2003 to $10.8 million in 2023, with Somali being the most popular first language in several schools besides Spanish. \n\nLong-running TPS designations create economic strains on health care, education, and other social services that were never intended to be permanent obligations. \n\nIt is no longer solely about a group of people who were offered brief protection in the ‘90s. According to the Department of Homeland Security, roughly 2,500 Somali nationals with TPS or pending applications will be affected by the termination. \n\nThose figures do not account for children and grandchildren born during the program’s 35-year existence at the taxpayer’s expense. The beneficiaries should have departed the country in the 1990s if perpetual redesignations had not occurred. \n\nCleaning Up the Biden Abuse of TPS \n\nThe Trump administration is trying to clean up the mess inherited by Kamala Harris’s open borders and immigration failures. The Biden administration deliberately expanded TPS, contrary to American security interests and granted TPS to over 1.4 million aliens by January 2025. \n\nPresident Joe Biden even urged Congress to pass legislation allowing TPS recipients to apply for green cards, highlighting how the administration viewed TPS as amnesty despite the law saying otherwise. \n\nFormer Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, extended and redesignated Somalia for TPS through March 2026, allowing new applicants and issuing automatic employment authorization extensions. \n\nThe massive expansion did not end with Somalia. TPS enrollment nearly quadrupled under the Biden administration, driven largely by new designations for Venezuela in 2021 and 2023. As of January 2025, more than 614,000 Venezuelans were protected under TPS, making up around half of all beneficiaries. \n\nA House report found that 95% were not admitted on visas and entered either illegally or through humanitarian parole—which is not a formal admission into the United States according to federal law. \n\nThe Supreme Court reiterated that truth in Sanchez v. Mayorkas in 2021, holding that TPS does not constitute an admission to the United States and does not translate into a pathway for lawful permanent residence. Any attempt to treat TPS otherwise reflects executive ignorance of both the legislative and judicial branch. \n\nMaking Temporary Mean Temporary Again \n\nEnding TPS for Somalia means that “temporary” will once again mean temporary. It also emphasizes that the United States will not reward aliens who try to override our laws. \n\nCongress is also responsible for allowing TPS to be manipulated. Lawmakers created the program and failed to enforce its limits. Congress should codify clear protections for Americans, including restricting eligibility to aliens present at the time of the triggering event, outlawing redesignation, capping active TPS periods at 18 months in absence of extraordinary justification, and requiring recipients to seek other immigration benefits if eligible or depart within one month of TPS termination. \n\nGenerosity is ruined by entitlement and mercy without limits enables a monster. TPS was meant to reflect American compassion without sacrificing the rule of law or public safety.","summary":"Congress created&#160;Temporary Protected Status&#160;(TPS)&#160;to&#160;briefly&#160;assist&#160;those in need.

That’s been rare so far","text":"A trio of Orange County officials is running for statewide executive office this year, and if any of them emerge victorious in November, it would be a bit of an anomaly.\n\nThat’s not just because former Huntington Beach city attorney Michael Gates and Supervisor Don Wagner are both Republicans running against Democratic incumbents in a very blue state in races for attorney general and secretary of state, respectively. And that’s also not only because former Rep. Katie Porter would be the first female governor in California.\n\nRather, it’s their home base: Orange County.\n\nDespite the county accounting for nearly 10% of California’s population, very few of its residents have been able to win statewide elections.\n\nThat’s certainly not due to a lack of political talent in Orange County, said Fred Smoller, an expert in media and politics who teaches at Chapman University.\n\nReally, it’s a structural curse, he said.\n\nLos Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco produce more statewide candidates because those cities have a centralized television news market and mayoralities that help boost candidates with name ID. Orange County doesn’t have that one mayoral position and shares TV media markets with Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, San Diego.\n\n“There’s plenty of talented people from Orange County on both sides of the aisle,” said Smoller. “But there’s no centralized media and we suffer from the fact that we have no career ladder (like a mayor’s office) that would provide a platform for them to receive greater recognition.”\n\n“It’s a structural constraint,” Smoller added, “and that inhibits talent from both sides of the aisle from moving to a statewide office.”\n\nBut that’s not to say it’s impossible for an Orange County resident to be elected statewide.\n\nCase in point: Ken Cory, who lived in Westminster and Garden Grove, was elected to serve as the state’s controller in 1974. Cory, who served in the statehouse prior to the executive branch, was reelected in 1978 and 1982, leaving office after not seeking another term in 1986.\n\nCory, his obituary noted, was a Democrat who was respected by those on both sides of the aisle. He was dubbed “the man oil companies fear most.”\n\nThere’s also Thomas Kuchel, who hailed from Anaheim and, like Cory, served as the state’s controller. Kuchel, though, was also elected to the U.S. Senate, albeit some time ago: He was appointed to the Senate in 1953, winning subsequent reelections to the seat where he served for 16 years, including as the Republican whip. He served as controller from 1946 to 1953.\n\nKuchel was an infamous progressive in the Republican Party at the time, playing roles in the Senate’s work to pass Medicare, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as conservation efforts and a nuclear test ban treaty.\n\nAnd there are others, too, with ties to Orange County. Probably chief among them: former President Richard Nixon, who, while he lived in Whittier and represented a Los Angeles County congressional seat, was born in Yorba Linda. His presidential library is in Yorba Linda, but when Nixon was president, the western White House was in San Clemente.\n\nThe presidency wasn’t Nixon’s only attempt to woo California voters all around the state. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1950, but a little more than a decade later, he’d lose a bid for governor, telling reporters after the loss, “Just think how much you’re going to be missing. You don’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.”\n\nJohn Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor and longtime Orange County politician, served in the U.S. Senate. But he was appointed to fill a vacancy and lost the election to the seat to the late Dianne Feinstein.\n\nMore recently, Loretta Sanchez, then an Orange County Congress member, made a run for what was an open U.S. Senate seat in 2016. But she finished second to Kamala Harris, then the state attorney general from San Francisco.\n\nSo what would it take for an Orange County politician to win elected office?\n\nIt’s more of an uphill battle, but not completely outside the realm of possibility, for a Republican to win, said Scott Spitzer, who teaches political science at Cal State Fullerton.\n\nIt depends on identity, he said, and whether candidates choose to focus on issues that would appeal to independent voters — taxes and cost of living, for example — rather than more polarizing issues, like gay marriage or climate change denial.\n\n“I do think there’s room for Republicans to win statewide office in California, but that’s not where the state Republican Party in California has been,” said Spitzer. “They’ve been pursuing a line of politics that’s nationally conservative and Trump-aligned, which doesn’t appeal to the moderate conservative voters in California. It definitely appeals to Republicans in pockets of the state, but it’s not going to win a statewide majority.”\n\nPorter recently lost a statewide bid, not even advancing past the primary in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\nBut she’s got the greater chance among the three in her quest for statewide office, both Smoller and Spitzer said, and her Orange County connection could actually be a boost.\n\n“In some ways, coming from Orange County could help her,” said Spitzer. “She could say, ‘Look, I could pull some votes from more conservative areas where other candidates are used to relying on San Diego and Los Angeles and San Francisco.’” She might not win those areas outright, Spitzer noted, but she could still pick up support there among people more familiar with her work.\n\nSmoller said Porter, although she’s a staunch progressive, could possibly sway more right-leaning voters as well, who might think she would keep the county’s interests more at the forefront than other candidates for governor.\n\n“She might make the appeal, ‘I’m not your cup of tea politically, but at least you know me, and we’d have someone from Orange County in the governorship,’” Smoller said.\n\n“I’m not sure that’s an argument that would sell, but she could certainly make it.”","summary":"Former Rep.

The Detroit, Michigan-based union was founded in 1935.\n\nCassidy writes in the letter that he is “concerned that the cost of litigating these matters is a disservice to the American workers who pay dues to the UAW.”\n\nIn particular, Cassidy probes Fain on two allegations of workforce retaliation. In one instance, Fain is said to have removed “several departments” from the purview of UAW Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock as retaliation for “instituting strict policies governing expenses.”\n\nIn the other case, Cassidy points to a report from The Detroit News, which cites an anonymous source who said Fain removed the union’s Stellantis department from the oversight of Vice President Rich Boyer due to “a disagreement over staffing changes.”\n\nStellantis is the parent company which produces and sells Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, Ram, and other vehicles.\n\nCassidy mentions that “Boyer states the dismissal was motivated by his refusal to make changes that would benefit your [fiancée] and your [fiancée’s] sister.”\n\nCassidy requests for clarification on whether the UAW has a workforce retaliation policy, as well as whether Faine’s fiancée or her sister would stand to benefit from Boyer’s removal. Cassidy also inquires if the UAW has a written policy on workplace nepotism.\n\nThe chairman asks several more questions of Fain on how these alleged actions affect workers, including whether Fain will commit to not raising dues on union members “to pay for internal UAW proceedings or any legal proceedings on these or other allegations of retaliation.”\n\nThe UAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fain and the union on the letter, the allegations it details, and whether they plan to respond to Cassidy.\n\nFain has served as the UAW’s president since 2023. The union, founded in 1935, is based in Detroit, Michigan. \n\nFain campaigned in support of then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ Democratic presidential bid in 2024, and was a harsh opponent of now-President Donald Trump, whom he called a “scab” who “doesn’t give a damn about working class people.” \n\nSince then, Fain has been critical of certain Trump policies, such as restricting federal workers’ unionization rights, but has also defended the president on policies such as tariffs.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—Sen.

John Barrasso delivered the following speech about the Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota. Watch the speech, below, or read his remarks, lightly edited.\n\nWhen the government wastes even a dollar of your taxpayer money, you have a right to know what happened. When emboldened criminals steal money intended to help single moms and children in poverty, you have a right to be angry.\n\nAmericans are infuriated by the staggering fraud unfolding today in the state of Minnesota. The past few weeks have shown how deep the corruption has turned out to be.\n\nInvestigators have uncovered fraud schemes across 14 Minnesota Medicaid programs. Joe Thompson—U.S. Attorney in Minnesota—has spent his career prosecuting fraud. Based on his extensive investigation, he believes criminals have stolen at least $9 billion from those Minnesota Medicaid programs. That is half of the total amount of money Minnesota spends for Medicaid programs in that state.\n\nToday, the fraud is so prevalent that Thompson says the state has “developed a fraud tourism industry.” Can you imagine such a thing? A “Fraud Tourism Industry.”\n\nHere’s how these schemes work. Fraudsters set up fake businesses and nonprofit organizations. The criminals claim to provide services such as housing, food, and healthcare assistance. Then, they bill Medicaid for services they never provided. They enroll children in programs they don’t need. \n\nIn 2021, taxpayers paid $4.6 million for something called Minnesota’s Integrated Community Support Medicaid Program. Three years later—due to criminal fraud—spending for that program ballooned to more than $170 million. That’s 37 times as much in just three years. \n\nTaxpayers similarly paid $21 million in 2021 for something called Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services. In the first six months of 2025—due to criminal fraud—taxpayers paid nearly triple that amount.\n\nA Medicaid program claiming to help Minnesota children with autism cost $6 million in 2018. By 2023—due to criminal fraud—it cost taxpayers over $192 million. \n\nDaycare fraud is one of these brazen schemes. Last month, an independent journalist visited 10 state-funded daycare sites in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. He found no children at the daycare centers. Middle of the day. No children there.\n\nOne year ago, a local reporter visited several of the same sites. This reporter found no children at the daycare centers. These are supposed daycare centers. They’re getting paid to take care of children.\n\nHere is one of those sites. It is the now-infamous ‘Quality LEAR-ING Center.’ LEAR-ING. Instead of Learning. Misspelling the name of the daycare center. That’s an obvious red flag for fraud. There were 95 violations for that site alone between 2019 and 2023. Those violations include ‘no records for 16 children.’\n\nYet in Minnesota, taxpayer dollars continued to flow. \n\nThese aren’t one-off abuses. We now know that the fraud scheme used in the state’s childcare program has been used to defraud other social service programs. The New York Times says the fraud is ‘staggering in its scale and brazenness.’\n\nThe Department of Justice has charged 98 defendants in Minnesota Medicaid fraud-related cases. So far, 64 of these defendants have been convicted. Last month, one defendant was found guilty of stealing $14 million from Medicaid. She also stole nearly half a million dollars from a child nutrition program.\n\nThat stolen money was supposed to be used to provide 200,000 meals for hungry children. Instead, the defendant sent hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. She bought real estate in Kenya in Africa.\n\nThis organized, systemic theft has gone on for years under the state’s Democrat leadership. It exploded under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nThe Democrats have permitted schemes stacked upon schemes to drain money meant for those in need. Republicans will not allow this massive theft of taxpayer dollars to be ignored.\n\nWe are taking a comprehensive approach to root out fraud in Minnesota and across the country. Our Working Families Tax Cuts law fights fraud.\n\nWe strengthened eligibility requirements for Medicaid. We ensured illegal immigrants do not receive taxpayer-funded healthcare. We put in place work requirements for Medicaid and for Food Stamps. These policies protect taxpayers and increase accountability.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans are conducting aggressive congressional oversight. On Friday, the entire Senate Republican Conference demanded Gov. Walz explain his actions. We asked nine detailed questions. Questions such as why Minnesota failed to adopt key fraud prevention measures—measures the Department of Health and Human Services recommended to Minnesota in May. \n\nGov. Walz knew about this widespread fraud. He refused to do anything to stop it.\n\nSenate Republicans are ready to give the Trump administration the manpower it needs to tackle fraud in Minnesota and wherever else it appears. The Trump administration has asked the Senate to confirm a new Assistant Attorney General position—a position that will focus on fraud. The United States Senate will get that person in place and on the job quickly. \n\nThe Trump administration has taken other bold and deceive actions to stop fraud. To further strengthen enforcement efforts, the Department of Justice has doubled the number of attorneys handling these fraud cases. \n\nThe Treasury Department is cracking down on businesses in Minnesota for alleged money laundering. The Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump froze federal funding for fraud-prone programs in Minnesota. \n\nIf Senate Democrats cared about stopping fraud, why are they preparing to vote today to loosen eligibility and income verifications for Obamacare subsidies? That is what the Congressional Review Act resolution from Democrat Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia does. \n\nEliminating these vital protections invites more fraud. It means subsidies go to individuals who don’t qualify for them.\n\nCongress should not make it easier to defraud American taxpayers. That is the wrong direction to take after the biggest fraud scandal in Minnesota history.\n\nProtecting taxpayer dollars should not be a partisan issue. The fraud scandal in Minnesota should be a wake-up call for every American taxpayer.\n\nOur federal government spends nearly $1.5 trillion each and every year to feed, house, treat, and care for vulnerable families and children. Medicaid, food stamps, and other social programs are often called a lifeline. Years of waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption have pushed those who truly need help to the back of the line.\n\nRepublicans will not stop until the depth of this fraud is uncovered and prosecuted. Republicans are committed to preventing it from happening again.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Sen. John Barrasso delivered the following speech about the Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota.

According to the magazine, the “My Chick Bad” MC “wasn’t supposed to be on” the lineup in the first place. Representatives for the traveling festival confirmed the news, directing Billboard to Ludacris’ team “for any additional comments.”\n\nRock the Country, which launched in 2024 as a festival centering country music, announced its 2026 lineup on Monday (Jan. 12). Country superstars Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Jelly Roll were listed as headliners, while additional performers included Ella Langley, Riley Green, Miranda Lambert, Brantley Gilbert, Shinedown, Gavin Adcock, Creed, Treaty Oak Revival, and, notably, “Hot In Herre” rapper Nelly. Not only did Nelly appear on the inaugural Rock the Country lineup, but he also performed at President Donald Trump’s second Inaugural Ball in 2025.\n\nKnown for Billboard Hot 100-topping rap and pop hits — as well as their past country crossover smashes — Ludacris’ and Nelly’s inclusions on the Rock the Country lineup quickly divided fans. In the Instagram comment section for the lineup poster, one user wrote, “[Ludacris], this is your crowd now? Pretty sad.” Another quipped, “In honor of Nelly and Ludacris appearing, they will be provided with their very own water fountain.” Ludacris was specifically scheduled to perform on Sunday, July 26, in Anderson, S.C.\n\nA sizable number of Luda’s fans also felt his appearance was an endorsement of the MAGA politics associated with the festival. In 2024, Adcock lambasted then-President Joe Biden onstage, also calling then-Vice President Kamala Harris a “b—h.” Last year, Trump introduced Kid Rock’s set with a simple video message: “Fight, fight, fight, win, win, win, for the American people.” One gobsmacked user shared a video declaring, “We about to put you over there with Kanye and Snoop … stop playing. Why’d you sign up for this? You got 48 hours to issue a statement, you got 48 hours to let us know you’re about to cancel this contract.”\n\nThis year’s Rock the Country festival will visit eight towns across the U.S., beginning with two stagings in Belleville, Tex., on May 1-2. Ludacris has yet to publicly comment on his removal from the lineup, while Nelly remains listed for the Hamburg, N.Y. dates on Sept. 11-12.\n\nAt press time, representatives for both Ludacris and Kid Rock have not responded to Billboard’s request for comment.\n\nCheck out the updated 2026 Rock the Country lineup on the festival’s official website.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2026 Billboard Media, LLC.

We've got NFL playoff action tomorrow. We've got NFL playoff action Sunday. We've got the college football title game Monday. Who has it better than us? Nobody. Let's roll. Welcome to a Friday Nightcaps – the one where Louisville's new assistant volleyball coach has America's attention as we barrel towards the weekend. What else? I've got the best of the rest from a loaded week of #content, Kamala Harris sobbing over Trump's middle finger, MLB is in TROUBLE as of this morning, and Sophie Cunningham's knee rehab seems to be going WELL as the WNBA season quickly approaches (maybe). Grab you a fig newton for National Fig Newton Day, and settle in for a Friday 'Cap! Kamala with some all-time spin here Do Fig Newtons still exist? Feel like I haven't seen one in a MINUTE. I used to hammer those things growing up. The best. Well, not the best. But solid. They were always billed as a healthy snack, which, looking back now, is hilarious. Sort of like when Eggo and Cinnamon Toast Crunch were sold as vital parts to \"this complete breakfast.\" Remember those commercials? No wonder I was so fat: \"Vitamin-packed Frosted Flakes.\" Amazing. We really had it all in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, and we pissed it right away. Sad. Anyway, let's get this class going. It's a Friday, after all. Kamala Harris fake-sobbed because Trump ‘defiled’ the White House this week with his VERY NASTY middle finger, and the grift with this one is truly amazing: What a week of #content! As Joe would say, ‘Come on, man!’ Don't you ever let anyone from the Biden Administration anywhere NEAR a pedestal. Don't you let them lecture you for one second. Not one single second. Kamala was a part of undoubtedly the most grotesque administration in American history. That's not hyperbole, although Bill and Monica would probably like a word. Again, these people invited THIS to the White House: This is the same White House, and the same president, that wished everyone a happy \"Trans Day of Visibility' on EASTER, by the way. The same one that had cocaine in the HALLS. The same guy who pardoned his entire family at the buzzer last January. The same vice president who, just 18 months ago, told Christian protesters that they were at the wrong rally. HER rally, by the way. The same one that looked like THIS for Christmas: Yeah, spare us the lecture, Kamala. We're good. Lunatic. OK, let's get to the best #content from a loaded week. Kyle Tucker bats leadoff! Dark days for MLB, Louisville's new coach & Zach Wilson is having a great offseason! Another solid week. Not our best, but it's also January and we're in the middle of just the longest month of the year, so I get it. Still, y'all made it work. Bravo. Couple thoughts … 1. Nothing like a good cup of coffee, am I right? Thanks, Sofia! 2. Farrah Abraham! As Obi-Wan once said, ‘Now there’s a name I haven't heard in a long time.' For those who don't remember her career arc, she was central casting in both MTV's 16-and-pregnant, and then again in MTV's Teen Mom. Just for good measure, she also had a sex tape leak. Cannot WAIT to cast my vote in 2026! 3. Sophie would also have my vote. 4. As for the Kyle Tucker/MLB stuff … Let's rapid-fire this Friday class into one of the final (or is it one of the first?) football weekends of the year. So, I spent my morning A) writing about Kamala, B) doing the newsletter, and C) doing some BIG J digging on this MLB situation. For those who don't know, it's about to get really nasty in about 11 months. The CBA is up at 11:59 on Dec. 1 of this year, and we will undoubtedly go into a work stoppage. The Dodgers, once again, signing another marquee free agent to a lucrative contract last night didn't help things. Here's what I found out in my Big J digging. The Dodgers really aren't at fault here. And yes, that pains me to say, because I'm a Red Sox fan. I hate LA. I hate its stupid Governor. I hate its stupid laws, and its stupid time zone. But … this isn't on the Dodgers. It's on Major League Baseball. The owners either won't spend, can't spend, or refuse to spend. The Dodgers, thanks to a lucrative – and well-timed TV deal back in 2013 – basically have endless money coming in each season. Nobody talks about that TV deal. I wrote about it extensively. LA basically has a budgetary floor each season that is infinitely higher than anyone else. Because of MLB's lax rules on luxury tax and deferrals, the Dodgers basically game the system by kicking the can down the road as far as possible, knowing they will have the money to cover it once the bill(s) come due. Anyway, it's all leading to a shutdown next season. Bank on it. Enjoy 2026, baseball fans. And that's my depressing Ted Talk for the day! Next? You know who isn't losing sleep over a looming lockout? Zach and Nicolette Wilson: No idea what Zach's gonna do now that Miami has cleaned house, but I think he'll be just fine wherever he lands. I just hope he stays somewhere warm, for obvious reasons. OK, that's it for today – and this week. Good work, everyone. Former Purdue star, and new Louisville volleyball coach, Jena Otec, takes us into a big weekend. See you Monday.

But they see this Senate race as yet another golden opportunity to break the GOP's winning streak. Party strategists have somehow convinced themselves that opposition to President Donald Trump could fuel an electoral wave big enough to finally deliver them a statewide victory. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called Texas a \"very possible\" Democratic pickup opportunity in 2026, though he hasn't quite put it in the top four targets.\n\nDespite being the presumptive frontrunner when she jumped into the race, Crockett is now trailing state Rep. James Talarico in the polls.\n\nThat's got to sting. Crockett, despite her national profile, is as big as her fake eyelashes, yet she is struggling in her own party’s primary. Her Senate campaign is clearly a last-ditch effort to remain in government after her district was redrawn. Now she's watching her supposed sure thing slip away before the primary even happens.\n\nHow is this happening?\n\nThe polling reveals some uncomfortable truths for Democrats. There's a clear racial divide between Crockett and Talarico. Talarico holds a majority among Hispanic and white voters, while Crockett has strong support among black voters. The gender gap is just as telling. Men favor Talarico by a wide margin, 52% to 30%, while women are almost evenly split between the two candidates, at 44% for Talarico and 43% for Crockett.\n\nRecommended: Hakeem Jeffries Just Crossed a Dangerous Line That Can’t Be Uncrossed\n\nWhile we can parse the demographic splits looking for an explanation, the answer is probably far more straightforward.\n\nTexas has become the Democrats' white whale. They've been trying to turn it blue for years without success, and the pattern is embarrassingly consistent. Back in 2018, some polls claimed that Beto O'Rourke was ahead of Ted Cruz. Cruz won that election. Then, in 2022, Beto tried to run for governor. Some polls said the race was close. Abbott ultimately won by 11 points. Fast forward to 2024, and polls once again gave Democrats hope and showed a close race between Cruz and Colin Allred. Cruz won by eight points. And don’t get me started on the polls that claimed Texas was in play for Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite the Democrats’ repeated failure to flip Texas, they keep throwing money and resources into the state, believing they still have a chance. Even in defeat, Democrats believe Texas is trending blue, and the rejection of Crockett in the Democratic Party primary is more likely a sign that Texas Democrats realize that they need a more pragmatic approach to choosing their candidates if they want to be even remotely competitive.\n\nDoes that really mean Tallerico can win? I wouldn’t bet on it. But, if you were a Democrat, do you really think a state that Trump won by more than 13 points is going to elect Jasmine Crockett? Of course not. Talarico may not win, but you’d probably still think you had a shot with anyone but Crockett.\n\nSo, sorry, Jasmine, things aren’t looking good for you right now. But, something tells me you won’t go away quietly.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/16/oh-jasmine-we-hardly-knew-ya-n4948394","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/345/656f695c-9f49-4729-8341-c76fa2190eec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 20:28:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":393645984,"title":"Everything we know about Charlie Kirk’s alleged ‘assassin’ Tyler Robinson","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMore than four months after right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead, prime suspect Tyler Robinson remains in custody as he prepares for his trial.\n\nKirk, 31, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop as he spoke onstage during an outdoor campus event attended by 3,000 people in Utah on September 10. \n\nTyler James Robinson, 22, has been charged with offences including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice over the shooting.\n\nIf convicted of killing Kirk, the charge means he could face the death penalty.\n\nHe is due to appear in court later today, with his defence team set to argue that one of the prosecutors needs to be removed from the trial due to their 18-year-old child being at the event where Kirk was killed.\n\nRobinson is reported to have raised suspicions while speaking with relatives, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said.\n\n Tyler Robinson is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder, and felony discharge of a firearm, among other offences (Picture : AP)\n\nMr Cox called Kirk’s murder a ‘watershed in American history’ and comparing it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nUtah County attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s DNA was found on the trigger of the rifle, alleging Robinson discarded the rifle and clothing and asked his roommate to conceal evidence.\n\nRobinson left a note under a keyboard saying he planned to kill Kirk and confessed after the shooting, documents allege.\n\nGray said Robinson’s romantic partner, who was reportedly trans, sent the suspect several messages on the day of the shooting.\n\n‘Drop what you’re doing. Look under my keyboard,’ Robinson said in one text. Under it, the partner found a note that said: ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it.’\n\nRobinson’s next hearing has been scheduled for September 29 at 10am, and will be held using WebEx.\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson?\n\nMr Cox told reporters the suspect had lived for a long time with his family in Washington County in the southwest corner of Utah, near the Arizona and Nevada borders.\n\nRobinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records.\n\nHe was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.\n\nHe is listed as an ‘inactive’ voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, when Republican Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n Mr Kirk, 31, was answering a question about gun violence at Utah Valley University on Wednesday when he was shot (Picture: Reuters)\n\n The body of Charlie Kirk is carried from Air Force Two (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAt the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system.\n\nAn honour roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member’s social media account.\n\nHe attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson.

Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.\n\n‘I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,’ said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family.\n\n‘Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.’\n\nWho are his parents?\n\nRobinson has two younger brothers, and his parents Amber Jones Robinson and Matt Robinson have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts.\n\nHis parents are registered to vote as Republicans but none of their social media posts appeared overtly political.\n\nPosts by Robinson’s mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska.\n\nThey frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting.

John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned critic, is living under a politically hatched indictment, and Mike Pence, his first-term vice president, was exposed to a violent mob for executing his constitutionally mandated duties.\n\nYet Powell’s case is distinct because he—more than any other top-level civil servant—helped secure the most significant policy triumph of Trump’s career. He even played a crucial part in Trump’s eventual reelection.\n\nDuring the Obama years, after the mortgage bust, Ben Bernanke and the Fed kept the short-term interest rate close to zero, setting the stage for Powell’s role in the Trump economy. Free money was great for stock-market investors, but Main Street’s recovery was torpid.\n\nIn 2018, when Powell took office, a year into Trump’s first term, the federal funds rate was still only 1.5 percent. Under Powell, the Fed gradually hiked the rate to 2.5 percent and then pulled back. Trump squawked and mused about firing Powell.\n\nTrump’s carping notwithstanding, economic growth spiked during Powell’s first year to 3 percent, the highest since the mid-2000s, and wages rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. Growth remained a still-strong 2.6 percent in 2019. And thanks to Powell’s refusal to cave to the president, inflation remained muted. In other words, wage gains translated to real gains in living standards. Inequality, as measured by the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances, actually contracted. By any fair measure, economic performance during the first three years of Trump 1.0 was good, and the Fed chief deserved credit—which never emanated from the White House.\n\nPowell’s record during Joe Biden’s presidency was far more mixed. When the pandemic shut down the economy during 2020, Powell cut the federal funds rate to effectively zero. And left it there.\n\nBiden, inaugurated nine months after the COVID recession ended, enacted a massive deficit-spending program. He styled himself a second version of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just as Trump had pursued a highly stimulative program (particularly with his tax cut), so did Biden. The purposes were different, but both added to inflationary pressures.\n\nUnder Biden, Powell did not experience overt pressure from the White House, but there was soft pressure on the Fed not to choke off the recovery, and to align with the executive during a crisis. Both Powell and the Biden White House misread the COVID recession as similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown. In a financial crisis, recoveries are typically slow. People’s assets are underwater and stimulus is needed for a protracted period. During the COVID recession, once people exited the initial lockdown, the crisis was over.\n\nWhen COVID struck, Powell kept the overnight interest rate at or below 1 percent for more than two years, until June 2022. By then, the annualized inflation rate had hit 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.\n\nPowell then became serious about fighting inflation and eventually brought it under control, but the damage was done. In effect, Powell had saved Trump from his worst instincts but failed to do so for Biden.\n\nThe statistic known as “real median household income” vividly contrasts what happened to the typical family’s living standard during each presidential term, after adjusting for inflation. During Trump’s first term, it rose 10 percent before COVID and 8.2 percent overall. Under Biden, it rose 2.6 percent.\n\nWhen Trump ran for reelection in 2020—before there was even a vaccine for COVID—the pandemic recession was on voters’ minds. But four years later, when voters told pollsters that the economy had been better under Trump than under Biden, median household income is what they were remembering, even if that’s not how they articulated it.\n\nInflation was probably the greatest factor in Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden were both reckless deficit spenders, but thanks to Powell’s tougher stance against inflation, Trump’s economy performed better, and that secured his political comeback.\n\nTrump’s response to this good fortune has been to attack the independence of the Fed and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects much of the data on which the Fed relies. Toward Powell, he has been vindictive (for what, exactly?) and mean-spirited.\n\nTrump wants Powell to lower rates, just as the Fed kept them low under Biden. This would risk repeating the Biden-era inflation that Trump campaigned against. Does this make sense? Not to me, either.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jerome-powell-fed-trump-thankless/685653/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lcKbYryyRSso5I6OvwNmtQk4R0c=/0x0:4000x2250/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_16_How_Jay_Powell_Helped_Re_Elect_Trump/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:50:54","author":"Roger Lowenstein","authors":["Roger Lowenstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":393631202,"title":"Trump donor, dark money largely funding Maine referendum drives","text":"Funding for two state referendum drives is coming almost exclusively from out-of-state sources. \n\nA citizen initiative to end recreational marijuana sales and add tracking and testing requirements to medical marijuana received a $2 million infusion from Smart Approach to Marijuana Action Inc., a dark money group from Virginia. \n\nAnd a citizen initiative to remove transgender protections for students is mostly funded by an $800,000 contribution from conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, the founder of the Wisconsin-based Uline Corp., a shipping supplies company. \n\nThe disclosures contained in campaign finance reports filed this week show the outsized role that national groups may play in deciding local issues in the 2026 election cycle.

The results this November will depend more on the voters' perception of which side understands and speaks to their real concerns.\n\n\"Affordability\" is a catchphrase, not a definition or a policy declaration. Democrats are going to rely, as they have been since at least 2008, on radical racial politics and trying to paint the right as Nazis or closet kluxers.\n\nJosh Barro wrote an essay pointing out that the enthusiastic support for \"bomb-thrower\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) in her bid for the Democratic Party nomination to the U.S. Senate demonstrates why many Democrats are stuck in the past, trying to define everything through the prism of race.\n\nNot only is Crockett a hyper-partisan nut, but she's also out-and-out stupid.\n\nOr, consider what Crockett said when Republicans sought to censure Stacey Plaskett, the non-voting delegate representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, for her ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Crockett went to the House floor with a list of Republicans who had taken donations from “Jeffrey Epstein,” including Lee Zeldin, the former congressman from Long Island who now serves as EPA Administrator. But there was a problem — the Jeffrey Epstein who donated to Zeldin is a Long Island neurosurgeon who made his donations in 2020, after the notorious Manhattan financier Epstein had died.\n\nHer explanation for getting the two Jeffery Epsteins mixed up is a primer on how to never admit you're wrong, even not doing so makes you look even dumber.\n\n\"Listen, I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein,\" she told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Just so that people understand, when you make a donation, your picture is not there… unlike Republicans, I at least don’t go out and just tell lies. Because it was not the same one — that’s fine.\"\n\nBarro points out that \"she’s a loudmouth who talks a lot of s**t in a way that’s neither smart nor strategic.\" He added, \"She appeals to the sort of voter who is so partisan that he or she thinks 'I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein” is a good argument.\"\n\nFor this reason, Crockett has a very good chance of winning the Democratic Party primary in March to face either incumbent Sen. John Cornyn or Attorney General Ken Paxton, who are running neck and neck in the polls. She's running eight points behind Rep. James Talarico, another radical left bomb-thrower. Barro believes, \"what makes him stand out in the crowd is his choir boy/seminarian persona.\"\n\nRelated: Pray That Elizabeth Warren's Vision for a 'New' Democratic Party Comes True in Time for Midterms\n\nBarro sees the problem because Democratic Party voters have developed \"deeply dysfunctional relationships to black women as political candidates.\" Not just Crockett, but Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, Fani Willis, and Tish James. These are all barely competent (or worse) office holders who have legions of white liberals standing up for them, no matter what stupidity or illegal crap they pull.\n\nOf course, the grant of inherent moral authority does not extend to all black women, but only to black women who agree with the person issuing the grant — as Steve Morris noted on this week’s Central Air (see link below), a liberal who worships Crockett or Abrams is unlikely to extend the same reverence to a socialist like Nina Turner or a moderate like Lauren Underwood, let alone to a Republican like Winsome Earle-Sears. But the idea that moral authority arises from black female identity is what makes Crockett so popular as a meme: liberals, even if they are not themselves black or female, can share her “clapbacks” online and see them as final-boss slams that win arguments, even if what she is saying is false (Zeldin accepted money from Epstein) or politically damaging (Hispanic voters have a “slave mentality”) or contentless (Greene has a “bleach-blond bad-built butch-body”).\n\nThey have created a mythos around black female candidates because \"black women are an essential part of the Democratic Party coalition — they vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, and their votes are needed to win elections.\" This mythos has led \"to a view that there is inherent moral authority that arises from being a black female Democrat,\" Barro writes. \n\nAs long as Democratic midterm voters are stuck in that mindset, neither Crockett nor Talarico has much of a chance against any Republican in the field.\n\nThe same might be said of Democrats across the country. Republican losses will be minimized, and in some districts, the left will actually work in the GOP's favor, giving it a fighting chance of maintaining control of Congress.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2026/01/16/the-cult-of-jasmine-crockett-refuses-to-move-on-from-the-reign-of-terror-racial-politics-of-2020-n4948387","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/324/967fd60e-aab8-4de5-a5f1-c4ed7a5a66c1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:00:00","author":"Rick Moran","authors":["Rick Moran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":393642408,"title":"Iranian Calls Out Leftists’ Hypocrisy, and She Couldn't Be More Right","text":"🇮🇷 This is how an Iranian girl, a follower of Zoroastrianism, explains everything \"on her fingers\":🔴\"Hello, I am Iranian.Everyone keeps asking the same question over and over: what's wrong with the leftists?

Why are they so noisy, why do they support the Gaza Strip, but remain completely silent when it comes to Iran?” Why, indeed? \n\nFor some reason, it is never popular to support victims of Islamic dictatorship. Unfortunately, even Donald Trump appears to be reversing his promise to help the Persian protesters in Iran after pressure from Qatar and other Khamenei-loving Gulf states. There was a lot more pontificating, even from the American right, about Gaza than about Iran. As for the left, they’re on Ayatollah Khamenei’s side as he massacres Persians.\n\nAs Iranians filled the streets of Tehran and other cities despite murderous fire from Iranian government terrorists, American leftists filled the streets of many of our major cities to protest the death of would-be killer Renee Good, who committed vehicular assault on an ICE officer to prevent the arrest of foreign sexual predators. It must be heartbreaking for the Persians waiting for the Western aid and empathy that never comes.\n\nRead Also: Muslim Who Stabbed Westernized Sister Caught 13 Years After Deportation Order\n\nI would like to point out another aspect of Democrats’ hypocrisy. Leftists swore that the Capitol events of Jan. 6, 2021, represented the worst “insurrection” in American history. Kamala Harris compared Jan. 6 to Sept. 11 and Pearl Harbor. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it “the day democracy was placed at greater risk than it has been in a century.” Politicians and media outlets called for the harshest of punishments for J6 protesters, and ignored multiple reports of inhumane conditions for J6 prisoners.\n\nExcept that Jan. 6 was never an insurrection, and in fact, we now know that literally hundreds of federal agents were embedded in the crowd, rigging and directing and manipulating the event to seem worse than it originally was. Most importantly of all, the only people killed on Jan. 6 were protesters murdered by Capitol police. Yet Democrats repeatedly lied about Capitol police being killed on that day.\n\nI mention this because the activists who decried J6ers are now actively assaulting federal immigration officers and considering themselves heroes for doing so. Dems acclaimed the Capitol police officers who murdered Ashli Babbitt and Rosanne Boyland as heroes. Now they're comparing Homeland Security officers who are arresting murderers to the Gestapo. As with their attitude toward the Iranian protests, Democrats have reality upside down.\n\nThere is one commonality between Democrats' opinions on any given protest or political event: Whichever is the most evil and indefensible side, that is the side leftists will join.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/16/iranian-calls-out-leftists-hypocrisy-and-she-couldnt-be-more-right-n4948382","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/13/adbad902-2f8a-43ee-9450-c4cd0c5b8f3f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:42:00","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.64},{"id":393638646,"title":"Nebraska Governor Backs Ballot Measure Changing How State Elects Presidents","text":"Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen, a Republican, during his State of the State address this week, backed a plan to change how the state elects presidents. Newsweek reached out to Pillen’s office and the Nebraska Democratic Party for comment via email. Why It Matters Nebraska, along with Maine, is one of two states that do not use a winner-take-all electoral system in presidential races. Instead, it allocates two electoral votes for the statewide victor, while each candidate receives one additional vote per Congressional district they carry. In 2024, President Donald Trump won four of the state’s five votes, while former Vice President Kamala Harris won a single Electoral College vote for the Omaha-based seat she narrowly carried. If this plan goes through, Republicans may benefit from not having to worry about the Second Congressional District, which is viewed as competitive for both parties. It backed both Harris and former President Joe Biden while electing centrist GOP Representative Don Bacon at the same time. What to Know Pillen, during his speech, urged legislators to pass a GOP-led bill that would establish a ballot question in November 2026 that would allow the state’s voters to decide whether to move to a winner-take-all system or stick with the current way it elects presidents. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen speaks during the State of the State address in Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 15, 2026. “I call upon this Legislature to pass Senator Dorn’s LR24CA to place this question on the November 2026 ballot so that the people of this state can have the final say as to how their voice will be heard in America’s most important national election,” he said. He said there is a “clear majority” in the legislature who would vote for that change, but that a “minority of this body has repeatedly obstructed the will of the majority of this body and the majority of this state by filibustering it to death.” If the bill passes, it would be left up to voters. That doesn’t guarantee that it would pass, though Republicans do make up a majority of Nebraska, which gave Trump more than 59 percent of the vote in 2024. There were efforts to change the state’s electoral system ahead of the 2024 election as polls showed a tight margin between Trump and Harris, but those efforts failed. Ultimately, Nebraska’s competitive district did not matter as Trump carried each swing state. However, there are electoral scenarios where the district could have been a tiebreaker. If Harris had won the three closest states—Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania—she would have held 269 electoral votes, so the Second District would have pushed her over the top. The Omaha World-Herald reported that lawmakers have already voted on a bill to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state that failed to overcome the filibuster. The state legislature is officially nonpartisan, and two members who caucus with Republicans voted against it. Maine is the only other state that splits its electoral votes. Democrats are generally favored statewide in presidential races, and the First Congressional District, based around the southern part of the state, is also safely Democratic. The Second District, however, is more conservative, having backed Trump in each of his three presidential bids. What People Are Saying Governor Jim Pillen said during his address: “We have arrived at the critical juncture in our long-running debate over whether Nebraska should unify and strengthen its voice in presidential elections, which this body decided to divide without the input of the people in a partisan act three decades ago.” Nancy Pettito, executive director of Civic Nebraska, responded to his remarks in a statement Thursday: “Nebraska’s split electoral vote system has ensured that more Nebraskans are represented in presidential elections. When voters know their participation matters, engagement increases. Our current system reflects Nebraska values of independence, balance, and accountability, while preventing national political parties from taking our state for granted. “There is no compelling reason to abandon a system that has served Nebraska well and given voters more voice and national relevance. Civic Nebraska urges lawmakers to protect Nebraska’s split electoral vote and reject efforts to move to winner-take-all.” What Happens Next It’s yet to be seen whether the legislature will advance the bill to create a ballot initiative. If so, no public polling has been conducted on whether it will pass. But it could have key implications for the 2028 presidential race.","summary":"Nebraska Republicans are eyeing a change to how the state allocates its Electoral College votes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nebraska-governor-backs-ballot-measure-changing-how-state-elects-presidents-11374330","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26015710282501.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:36:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":393612994,"title":"'Mask is off': Trump voters growing disillusioned with 'sinister and out of control' Trump","text":"Donald Trump has run for president four times, starting with a short-lived Reform Party campaign in 2000.

The report shows money from the teachers unions flowing into the same political machinery powering Democratic campaigns at the highest levels.\n\nThe unions also directed large sums to organizations explicitly focused on electing Democrats, including the Democratic Governors Association, House Majority PAC, and Senate Majority PAC — groups whose missions center on winning political power rather than improving classroom instruction.\n\nIn addition, the unions donated heavily to major left-wing think tanks shaping national policy debates. The Center for American Progress and its affiliated 501(c)(4) arm received close to $1 million combined from the two unions since 2022, according to Defending Ed’s findings.\n\nCritics say the spending underscores a widening disconnect between teachers unions leadership and rank-and-file educators. In many states, teachers were historically required to join unions and pay dues as a condition of employment, leaving them little choice but to financially support political causes they may not agree with — or may actively oppose.\n\nDefending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley said the findings confirm long-standing concerns among parents and teachers.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union has been widely regarded as one of the most outspoken, radical unions in the country, and that is no accident. Even in the early beginnings, union organizers were intent on creating a group that would be able to wield massive amounts of power under the… pic.twitter.com/jpziC3gg24\n— Freedom Foundation (@FreedomFdtn) January 8, 2026\n\n“It is clear that the teachers unions’ priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children,” Staley told Fox News Digital. “This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.”\n\nTeachers unions leaders have defended the spending, arguing that education policy is inseparable from broader social and political issues. Critics counter that teachers enter the profession to educate children, not to bankroll national political machines.\n\nThe teachers unions report lands amid a historic shift in American education. Homeschooling has surged to record highs nationwide, a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained elevated. Parents say remote learning gave them an unprecedented look inside classrooms — and what they saw prompted many to walk away.\n\nVirtual instruction exposed curriculum content, political messaging, and ideological discussions that parents say went far beyond basic academics. For many families, it marked the breaking point in their trust of the public school system.\n\nThis raging screeching lunatic is in charge of one of the largest teachers unions in America.\nHomeschool your kids. pic.twitter.com/Ewwi4P2lHs\n— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) July 22, 2024\n\nAmid this backdrop, teachers unions membership has steadily declined since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling ended mandatory union dues for public-sector employees. For decades, teachers in many states were required to financially support unions regardless of their personal beliefs. After the ruling made membership optional, union rolls began shrinking as educators exercised the right to opt out.\n\nDespite the decline in teachers unions membership, the Defending Ed report shows union leadership has continued pouring tens of millions of dollars into left-wing political causes, intensifying scrutiny over how dues from remaining members are being used.\n\nAs homeschooling continues to grow and public confidence in traditional education erodes, the report adds fresh pressure on teachers unions already facing questions about whose interests they truly serve.","summary":"Report exposes massive political spending by teachers unions as forced dues backlash grows","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/teachers-unions-cash-splash-far-left-woke-groups-rake-in-millions-as-parents-flee-public-schools","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/teachers-unions.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 18:23:27","author":"Tara Dodrill","authors":["Tara Dodrill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.229},{"id":393628820,"title":"Kamala Harris back in Chicago: &#8216;People are sick and tired of being sick and tired&#8217;","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris tapped into local resentment against the White House Friday during a brief speech in Chicago, her latest post-election stop as she seeks to stay in the national spotlight while mulling whether to make another run for the Oval Office in two years.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Interfaith Breakfast downtown, the Democratic nominee for president in 2 ...","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/16/kamala-harris-chicago-sick-and-tired/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ctc-l-kamala-harris-mlk-breakfast-03.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 17:52:18","author":"Alice Yin","authors":["Alice Yin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":393612974,"title":"Kamala Harris and Mayor Brandon Johnson Unite at Chicago’s MLK Interfaith Breakfast to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.","text":"In a gathering that underscores the spirit of unity and reflection, Chicago paid tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at its 40th annual interfaith breakfast on Friday.\n\nThis significant event brought together a diverse group of community and faith leaders from all over the city. This year’s theme, “Defending our democracy, protecting our rights,” resonated deeply with attendees dedicated to upholding King’s vision.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nThe breakfast featured former Vice President Kamala Harris as the keynote speaker. Her address emphasized the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity, saying, “I know the people of Chicago will uniquely understand that the fight requires courage. It requires us to show up even when we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. We will continue the fight with determination, with resilience, and dare I say, with joy.”\n\nThe event also spotlighted individuals who embody the spirit of Dr. King. Jacqueline Jackson, the wife of the esteemed Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Rev. David Black from the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, were honored with the Champion of Freedom award for their ongoing contributions to civil rights.\n\nRev. Black has been recognized for his courage and resilience, especially after being shot in the head with pepper balls during a confrontation between federal agents and protesters last September. Despite such challenges, his recognition at the breakfast highlighted his unwavering commitment to justice and equality.\n\nSurveillance video shown during Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino’s deposition shows Black being shot in the head with pepper balls during tense moments between federal agents and protesters outside the Broadview processing center in September. On Friday, Black was honored.\n\n“I feel so strongly that although I’m being honored today, this award belongs to so many Chicagoans including faith leaders who have been stepping up anonymously and so courageously facing down the evil of ICE, and trying to protect neighbors,” Black said.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who led the breakfast, said in a statement, in part, “The Vice President could be anywhere, and the fact that she chose to come to our city and lift up the work we are doing to defend our democracy means a lot to the people of Chicago. Vice President Harris is a trailblazer and a staunch defender of the freedoms and rights of everyday Americans. We are honored to host her and look forward to a historic MLK Interfaith Breakfast this year.”\n\nThe annual celebration is also meant to inspire others to continue to carry out King’s values and carry out his work.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a gathering that underscores the spirit of unity and reflection, Chicago&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris and Mayor Brandon Johnson Unite at Chicago&#8217;s MLK Interfaith Breakfast to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-and-mayor-brandon-johnson-unite-at-chicagos-mlk-interfaith-breakfast-to-honor-dr-martin-luther-king-jr/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kamala-Harris-Chicago-news-Ex-VP-Mayor-Brandon-Johnson-join-MLK.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 17:34:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.386},{"id":393635906,"title":"A year in, Americans think Trump has made everything worse","text":"When President Donald Trump took the oath of office, Americans approved of the job he was doing by a nearly 10-percentage-point margin as they hoped he would lower costs and make life a little easier—a number that horrified Democrats amid fears that Teflon Don and his MAGA movement were untouchable entities.\n\nYet now, almost exactly a year into his term, Americans overwhelmingly believe Trump has been a failure and that his policies and actions have made things worse in almost every sector of American life, according to a new CNN/SSRS poll released on Friday. \n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans (58%) think Trump's second term has been a failure, and a majority (55%) say his policies have worsened economic conditions in the country—the very thing voters put him back in office to fix.\n\nCNN/SSRS also polled Americans on whether they believe Trump has made progress on or exacerbated the issues he pledged to tackle in his dark inaugural address.

And that's exactly what he's done.\n\nHe has weaponized the Department of Justice to go after his perceived enemies. He's deployed a lawless, ill-trained immigration gestapo to brutalize Americans in the streets and to carry out his racist and evil anti-immigration agenda. He pardoned violent insurrectionists and other rich fraudsters who used their considerable means to bribe their way to freedom. He's cut benefits to the poor and slashed the federal government in a way that hurt federal workers while also costing taxpayers money. His idiotic trade policy has not only failed to lower prices but also tanked the job market. And he's literally destroyed part of the White House to turn it into his own version of his tacky Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nTurns out, America isn’t a fan of all that. A year into his term, just 39% approve of the job he's doing in office, according to the CNN/SSRS survey—a terrible position for him to be in ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nWhen Trump took office, Democrats were despondent, thinking that Americans approved of Trump and that there was nothing they could do to turn public opinion on their side.\n\nYet we now see that Trump is vulnerable. Indeed, with less than a year to go before the midterms, Democrats are the favorites to win control of the House and may even have a shot at flipping the Senate. \n\nAnd, believe it or not, a lot of that is thanks to Democratic messaging. Democrats have tied Trump’s evil moves to the fact that he’s focused on everything but making life more affordable for Americans.\n\nSo, as horrible as everything is, keep fighting the good fight.

But we won’t give them that satisfaction,” said Harris, who last visited Chicago in October to promote her book about losing the presidency to Trump. “We will continue the fight with determination, with resilience and, dare I say, with joy. So, in the spirit of Chicago, it is time to bear down.”\n\nHarris is mulling another run for president in 2028, along with other potential hopefuls such as Gov. JB Pritzker and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nHarris said she flew to Chicago Thursday evening from Memphis, Tennessee, where she spent time at the National Civil Rights Museum and reflected on “the stakes of what Dr. King confronted.”\n\n“Government-sanctioned segregation and redlining, the vote of the people denied by literacy tests and poll taxes. Churches bombed and people lynched,” she said. “Here, what we understand about that moment, hate and fear were being weaponized by the powerful to terrorize those they saw as powerless,” Harris said.\n\nShe said King and leaders of that time reminded the people of their power. They “reminded them that it doesn’t have to be this way; that the power of protest, of organizing, of the collective can change the course of our history and its country.”\n\nThe same can and should be done in response to the Trump administration, she said.\n\n“I thought about what Dr. King would see if he looks at America now,” she said.\n\nShe asked what King would think about the Trump administration attempts to rewrite Congressional maps, or call the Civil Rights movement “reverse racism,” or of social media and misinformation “taking hold of our lives and the lives of children.”\n\n“When the federal government rips people out of their car, out of their home, out of their church — when families are separated and a mother of three is shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis — people are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Harris said.\n\nShe said many people feel overwhelmed with the state of the country, and many people are isolated and lonely. “A long-broken system has fueled cynicism and, yes, apathy, and people are rightly angry and profoundly frustrated,” she said.\n\nHarris asked people to pause and see the echoes of history: “Yes, the threats we face, but also the power of the people.\n\n“Let us see, like then, this is a moment not to throw up our hands, but a moment to roll up our sleeves, to organize, to register people to vote and to speak and act with truth, power and conviction. And I look around this room. I know the people of Chicago. You uniquely understand that the fight requires courage. It requires stamina. And it requires commitment. It requires us to show up, even when we are sick and tired because we are sick and tired.”\n\n“To the leaders here, I saw, let us continue to be clear-eyed. They may want us to be afraid, to be divided, to be silent. But we don’t give them that satisfaction. We will continue to fight with determination, with resilience and, I dare with, with joy. So, in the spirit of Chicago, it is time to bear down.”\n\nThis year’s MLK breakfast’s theme was “defending democracy, protecting our rights.” Other speakers included Mayor Brandon Johnson and state House Speaker Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch. The breakfast honored author and peace activist Jacqueline L. Jackson and the Rev. David Black with its Champion of Freedom award.\n\nThe late former Mayor Harold Washington, the city’s first Black mayor, held the first MLK Interfaith Breakfast more than 40 years ago.

For those who had been convicted in the past, the data doesn't distinguish between minor offenses and violent crimes.\n\n Though data on how many Americans have been swept up in immigration arrests remains incomplete, ProPublica identified more than 170 cases where U.S. citizens were detained at raids and protests in the first nine months of Trump's second presidency.\n\n Podcaster Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the final stretch of the 2024 election, has become one of the most prominent critics of the president's immigration actions.\n\n On the Jan. 13 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, he said \"most people\" believe law enforcement is necessary and they should arrest criminals, but said many of the same people also believe ICE is \"operating illegally.\"\n\n \"Those same people that believe that might also believe that once someone is here, they should be able to stay in this country and ICE is operating illegally and we shouldn't have militarized groups of people roaming the streets just showing up with masks on, snatching people up, some of them U.S. citizens, and shipping them to countries they didn't even come from,\" he said.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n Rogan — whose show has routinely held the No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts and has more than 20 million subscribers on YouTube — also compared ICE asking for U.S. residents' papers to actions carried out by the \"Gestapo,\" the political police under Adolph Hitler's Nazi regime, which used tactics including surveillance, home searches, and interrogation — sometimes torture — in investigations of people seen as enemies of the Nazis.\n\n \"I can also see the point of view of the people that say, 'Yeah, but you don’t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around snatching people up, many of which turn out to actually be U.S. citizens that just don’t have their papers on them,' \" Rogan, 58, said. \"Are we really going to be the Gestapo?

Over the past few weeks, TikTok and Instagram users have been declaring that pop culture has come full circle, from indie sleaze fashion and Tumblr-era aesthetics to throwback filters and deliberately lo-fi posts. A recent BBC video suggests the resurgence of 2016 nostalgia is driven by both platform culture and the fact that it was a culturally dense period that many remember fondly. Forget the uncertainty spawned by the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's first election victory—the year marked the peak of Snapchat Stories, defined by instantly recognizable features like the dog filter and flower crown. One talking head in the video notes that the era produced such a strong run of pop hits that many are still played on BBC Radio 1 today, with artists like Zara Larsson, Zayn, The Chainsmokers, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975 dominating the charts. Reese Witherspoon visits “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” at Rockefeller Center on December 16, 2016, in New York City. Celebrities have been quick to travel back in time. Singer John Legend, 47, shared a nostalgic selection of photos from the era, including a tender shot of him kissing his wife Chrissy Teigen shortly after the birth of their daughter Luna, a snap with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, and a glamorous moment from the Oscars. John Legend’s post also referenced La La Land, the musical that dominated the 2016 awards season and became inseparable from pop culture history after the infamous Oscars mix-up, when it was mistakenly announced as Best Picture before the award attribution was corrected to Moonlight. “2016 - The year of Luna, Darkness & Light, La La Land…“ he wrote as the caption. Billie Eilish, 24, kept things minimal, posting a cool black-and-white snap with a simple caption: “2016.“ The understated post perfectly captured the artist's aesthetic. Charlie Puth, 34, also leaned into the throwback. The singer-songwriter and producer—known for hits like “Attention“ and “We Don’t Talk Anymore“—shared a post referencing his career breakthrough. “2016 charlie here to remind you that beat yourself up is out tonight and my world tour goes on sale at 10am local time:)“ he captioned the post. Melissa McCarthy, 55, revisited her film career highs from the time, sharing throwback images from the sets of The Boss and Life of the Party. “The year was 2016. Life of the Party & The Boss were happening and through it all I remained very devoted to my beloved HIPSTAMATIC!! For the VIBES!!!!“ she wrote. Model and former Victoria’s Secret Angel Miranda Kerr, 42, shared a selection of photos complete with the era’s unmistakable Snapchat filters—think dog ears, flower crowns, and heavily softened lighting. “Since we’re bringing 2016 back…“ she wrote. Reese Witherspoon, 49, also jumped on the trend, sharing a selection of shots of herself. “I heard we’re bringing back 2016,“ she wrote.","summary":"&quot;I heard we’re bringing back 2016,&quot; wrote Reese Witherspoon, jumping on the trend.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/decade-old-photos-celebrities-revealed-nostalgic-trend-11372757","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Copy-of-32-image-2026-01-16T153026.125.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 17:11:50","author":"Lydia Patrick","authors":["Lydia Patrick"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.385},{"id":393642412,"title":"Tufts Professor Drag Queen to Give Harvard Lecture on Kamala and Mamdani","text":"A “queer ethnography” professor who goes by the name “LaWhore Vagistan” when in drag has been invited to Harvard University to give a special lecture on Kamala Harris.\n\nHarvard last year hired Kareem Khubchandani, an associate professor of Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora Studies at Tufts University, as a visiting professor. Now, the wacko who spends his free time dressing up like a female caricature and performing gross sexual routines is back, not only to continue teaching classes, but to host a special and especially disgusting political lecture.\n\nThe drag queen professor is still set to teach “Queer Ethnography” and “RuPaulitics Queer Ethnography” for Harvard’s Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Department. But on Feb. 10, he will host the 2025-2026 Matthiessen Lecture at the woke Ivy League university called “Auntologies: Queer Aesthetics and South Asian Aunties.” It is going to feature discussions of two high-profile Democrat politicians — Zohran Mamdani and Kamala Harris.\n\nKhubchandani performs in drag under the vile name “LaWhore Vagistan.” The first name supposedly comes from Lahore, Pakistan, where Kareem would almost certainly be executed for his activities. And the second name — well, I don’t think I really need to explain what word Khubchandani combined with “Pakistan.”\n\n‘LaWhore Vagistan’ to lead Harvard lecture linking drag, politics, and Kamala Harris’ ‘chitthi brigade’Link in bio or read the story at https://t.co/kH1TNSDvnl#harvard #drag #kamalaharris #drag #campusreform pic.twitter.com/3TAavsolwV— Campus Reform (@campusreform) January 14, 2026\n\nThe Harvard description of the upcoming lecture enthuses, “The figure of the aunty is ubiquitous in South Asian public culture. Most recently, incumbent New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani repeatedly named the ‘aunties’ that tirelessly supported his mayoral campaign. This is not an uncalculated mention and has many precedents.” Mamdani’s most famous mention of his aunt was when he claimed she was afraid to wear a hijab on the New York subway after 911, even though it turned out his aunt does not wear a hijab at all and did not live in New York after the 2001 terrorist attack.\n\nBut to return to Khubchandani’s creepy lecture description:\n\nDuring Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential run, she described herself as “Auntie” on her Twitter profile and had a “chitthi brigade” of South Indian aunties supporting her campaign. In 2016 an Indian newspaper caused a national stir by labeling a politician “aunty national.” The mention of “aunties” in South Asian contexts is vexed, inviting both warmth and revulsion. This talk draws on the tools of queer studies to demonstrate how the study of aunties can elucidate important questions of gender, sexuality, and normativity. \n\nWhat the actual hell (and I do mean hell, the obvious source of this insanity) does any of this mean? Inviting “warmth and revulsion”? Important questions of “normativity”? I think Donald Trump needs to cut off Harvard’s federal funding again.\n\nMcMahon Investigates California Community Colleges for ‘Trans’ Athletes\n\nThe reality is that “LaWhore Vagistan” is not an academic; he is a mentally ill activist with a pseudo-academic veneer.\n\nKareem Khubchandani is Associate Professor of theater, dance, and performance studies at Tufts University. He is the author of the award-winning books Decolonize Drag and Ishtyle: Accenting Gay Indian Nightlife. He is also co-editor of the Lambda Literary-nominated Queer Nightlife, guest editor of Text and Performance Quarterly’s “Critical Aunty Studies,” and associate editor for GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies. His new book, Lessons in Drag: A Queer Manual for Academics, Artists, and Aunties is now out from Brandeis University Press.\n\nWhenever I read something like this lecture description and Khubchandani’s bio, I am reminded why I did not go to an Ivy League university or decide to pursue a master’s degree. What a horrendous waste of some $85,000 a year to send a kid to Harvard for such perverted indoctrination.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of wokeness in education and other key news in this new year.

enforcement and warns it could damage Trump's midterm chances","text":"Megyn Kelly has warned her fellow Republicans that Americans are majorly souring on President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement tactics and that it could cost the party dearly in the midterm elections.\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with Adam Corolla on her Sirius XM radio show, Kelly acknowledged that polling data shows Americans are deeply dissatisfied with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), especially after the deadly January 7 shooting of Renee Good by an agent in Minneapolis.\n\nOn air, Kelly reacted to a YouGov poll that came out on January 14, which among other things, showed that 53 percent of Americans thought the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, was not justified in killing Good, a 37-year-old mother-of-three.\n\n'I mean, that’s just not good,' Kelly said.\n\nThe same number of Americans, 53 percent, believe Ross should face criminal charges, something the Department of Justice almost certainly won't pursue given the Trump administration is unified in arguing the agent acted in self-defense.\n\nAccording to the YouGov survey, 42 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly support the idea of ICE being abolished, while 60 percent believed ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary force against US citizens.\n\nA slightly larger contingent, 45 percent, do not support doing away with the agency, which was created in March 2003 with the passage of the Homeland Security Act.\n\nICE's worsening reputation coincides with a stronger midterm outlook for Democrats, who are on track to easily win back the House of Representatives this November. \n\nHouse Democrats only need to flip three seats to win the House, and according to the non-partisan Cook Political Report, a whopping eighteen races have shifted into the blue column.\n\nExperts also point to Trump's approval rating declining on the immigration issue as a major problem for down-ballot Republicans, who have been put in the position of defending the federal crackdown.\n\nTrump's net approval rating on immigration was plus three percentage points in March 2025, according to CNN. He is now 16 points underwater, according to CNN's newest poll.\n\nKelly partially attributed the GOP's recent fall from grace to media 'propaganda' about the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.\n\n'This could be directly related to what we're seeing in Minnesota and the propaganda being pushed by the mainstream on it,' she said. 'It does look like - I call it disinformation that's being put out by the media around this ICE shooting may possibly be having an effect.'\n\nKelly compared Americans' rapid change in opinion on ICE agents to when the public largely lost faith in police departments after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.\n\n'The polls were terrible on police and the crackdowns...after George Floyd, and then they totally reversed, but it took a couple of years. And we don't have a couple of years until the midterms,' she said.\n\nShe appeared to warn that Trump is on the cusp of making things worse for Republicans electorally if he invokes the Insurrection Act and sends troops into Minneapolis to protect ICE agents.\n\n'S***’s going to get even more real, so we’ll see,' she said, referring to the possibility of boots on the ground in Minneapolis.\n\nWhile most election forecasters say Democrats will likely take the House, their chances in the Senate are slimmer. Though some are convinced that their prospects are growing more promising by the day.\n\n'I’m so much more confident than I was a year ago,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told The Washington Post this week. 'If I had to bet money, I’d bet we take back the Senate.'\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of four seats to control the Senate. They hope to oust Susan Collins of Maine, the only Republican senator that represents a state Kamala Harris won in 2024.\n\nBeyond that, Democrats see seats in Alaska, Ohio, Texas and Iowa, as possible pickups, though Trump won by double digits in all those states.","summary":"Megyn Kelly believes that Republicans could have a tough midterm election ahead if Americans continue to sour on ICE after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15470319/megyn-kelly-warns-republicans-ice-shooting-midterms.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/16/16/105577397-0-image-m-42_1768581223436.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 16:57:28","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":393586366,"title":"Gas Just Got Poured On The Democrat Civil War Jasmine Crockett Started","text":"Gas just got poured on the Democratic Civil War that Jasmine Crockett started when she announced her bid for the Senate.\n\nThe Texas Senate primary matchup between Crockett and James Talarico, a state lawmaker, will be a fascinating race to watch. Crockett’s announcement in December 2025 was already tearing Democrats apart, and now, new reporting on the donors lining up behind her campaign might make the fight even scrappier. (RELATED: Failed Democrat Candidate Calls It Quits Hours Before Jasmine Crockett Makes Senate Announcement)\n\nAccording to a report from NOTUS, Crockett has received campaign contributions from billionaire tech overlord Marc Andreessen, Wall Street behemoth BlackRock’s PAC, Lockheed Martin’s PAC, and super PACs funded by the crypto industry. \n\nSo, why would that piss off the left?\n\nCrockett claims she’s a liberal, but it has become increasingly clear that she is just a vain, empty suit — Kamala Harris 2.0 — willing to sell herself to the highest bidder. Her main attributes are that she is big on social media and comes across as a real “fighter” by constantly attacking the Trump administration. Her fiery persona is exactly what the base wants, though anyone who sees past the bluster will quickly discover that she is, in fact, all talk and no walk.\n\nThe donations from Andreessen and corporate America suggest that the tech overlords, banks, and defense contractors are genuinely afraid of Talarico. The state lawmaker has previously said that the “biggest welfare queens” in America are giant corporations and CEOs “who get a tax deduction” for flying private. (And he does have a point there.) Although he was one of Donald Trump’s biggest backers in 2024, Andreessen would rather have a puppet like Crockett in the Senate that he and other tech overlords could easily manipulate. \n\nWe all know the left, not the centrists or the empty suits like Crockett, but the actual left, hate corporations, the tech industry, and the military industrial complex. However, here’s something to chew on: are they going to have the guts to call out Crockett even though she checks the identity boxes? As was the case with Kamala Harris, there will be a group of leftists who refuse to denounce her because she is a black woman, even though Talarico appears to be the real progressive in the room.\n\nLess than 50 days out from the primary, Talarico is leading Crockett in the polls. But sometimes in primaries, it’s not the best candidate who wins; it’s the candidate who says all the right things, the loudest.","summary":"Progressives gonna be big mad...","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2026/01/16/jasmine-crockett-texas-senate-primary-democrats-cryptocurrency-blackrock-marc-andreessen/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F01%2FGettyImages-2228562419-1-scaled-e1768574137220.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 16:08:16","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.413}]}
