With a favorable map, a three-seat majority, and Vice President JD Vance as the tie-breaker, Democrats would need to net four seats to flip the chamber—an undeniably steep climb.\n\nThe challenge is obvious: Democrats must defend an open seat in Michigan and a toss-up seat in Georgia while also trying to unseat at least three Republicans, which would require wins in states President Donald Trump carried in 2024. \n\nYet, oddly enough, the mood in Democratic circles is optimistic. Party strategists point to a strong recruiting class, recent statewide wins, and the possibility that the political environment could shift further in their favor.\n\nTime isn’t exactly on anyone’s side. The 2026 general election may feel distant, but the fight for Senate control is less than a year away. With that in mind, here’s a rundown of the races that we think will define the battle for the majority.\n\nGeorgia (D)\n\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff remains Democrats’ most endangered incumbent, and Republicans are gearing up to pour tens of millions into defeating him.\n\nBut the GOP’s path got messier the moment Gov. Brian Kemp decided not to run, leaving a vacuum that quickly filled with Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nAnd Kemp has only complicated things since then, throwing his weight behind Dooley instead of either lawmaker—and triggering what’s expected to be a volatile primary.\n\n“Primaries tend to get competitive,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in November, regarding the brewing intraparty fight. “But we still think in Georgia, once the dust settles there and the smoke clears, that that’s gonna be a really good opportunity for us.”\n\nOssoff, meanwhile, is sitting on a formidable war chest and charting his own path. He voted against the deal to reopen the government, a move that suggests he’s betting on keeping progressive voters firmly in his corner heading into what’s likely to be one of the most expensive races of the cycle.\n\nFew primaries have exploded as quickly as the emerging Democratic fight in Maine, where the party is aiming to unseat Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nGov. Janet Mills entered the race in October, after months of behind-the-scenes recruiting by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But her path to the nomination isn’t guaranteed. Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran backed by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, has stormed the contest, quickly capturing attention and momentum.\n\nThe question now is whether Platner’s surge can last—or if it will fizzle under scrutiny. His campaign has faced blowback over a tattoo he had resembling a Nazi symbol, which he has since had covered up, as well as a series of offensive posts on Reddit.\n\nWhile that may leave Mills as the steadier option for Democrats, she comes with her own complications. She is 77 years old and running for a six-year term at a time when many in the party are calling for generational change.\n\nStill, Maine’s political landscape offers Democrats reason for cautious optimism. Collins’ approval ratings have slipped since her previous reelection, and the state favored former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 percentage points in 2024.\n\nEven so, Collins remains a formidable incumbent, making this a challenging—and closely watched—race for Democrats in 2026.\n\nNorth Carolina (Open R)\n\nRepublicans are bracing to defend an open Senate seat in North Carolina after Sen. Thom Tillis announced his retirement in June, citing clashes with Trump over the president’s tax and spending law. And Tillis’ exit has given Democrats a real opening.\n\nInto that breach steps former Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrats’ top recruit for 2026. Cooper formally launched his campaign in July, and his statewide track record is impeccable, winning all six of the previous statewide contests he’s run in. And so far, polls acknowledge that Cooper, with his far higher name recognition, is the early favorite.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has entered the fray. Endorsed by Trump, Whatley is unlikely to face a costly primary, though he may face other obstacles. He is not as well-known as Cooper, and he lacks a distinctive political brand, which could easily hamper his candidacy in a year not expected to favor Republicans.\n\nThat said, the Tar Heel State remains competitive. Trump carried it in all three of the most recent presidential elections. But with Tillis gone and Cooper in the race, the GOP’s grip on the seat is showing early signs of slipping.\n\nNew Hampshire (Open D)\n\nDemocrats face a key defensive battle after three-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she would retire. The seat opens the door to a familiar lineup of candidates in a state that has leaned Democratic in recent presidential cycles.\n\nIn a quirky twist, the GOP primary pits two former senators against each other: John E. Sununu, who lost this seat to Shaheen in 2008, and Scott Brown, who previously served in Massachusetts. \n\nSununu has consolidated support within the party, reflecting the broader effort to coalesce around a single candidate. A November poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center suggests he is the GOP’s strongest option for the general election.\n\nStill, challenges remain. A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state since the 2000 election. And whoever wins the Republican primary will likely face Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, a candidate with deep family roots in the state and a record of winning tough races. Polls currently show Pappas holding a slight edge against Sununu and a large one against Brown. If elected, Pappas would become the first out gay man in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who is popular, will also be up for reelection in 2026, which could complicate Democrats’ path to victory. \n\nIn an open race, anything is possible.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrats have secured the recruit they wanted most: former Sen. Sherrod Brown.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Brown survived two grueling reelection fights even as Ohio drifted rightward at the presidential level. In 2018, he beat GOP Rep. Jim Renacci by nearly 7 points in a state that Trump had carried two years earlier and would carry again two years later. But Brown’s run ended last cycle, when he lost to now-Sen. Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown is attempting a comeback against Sen. Jon Husted, whom Republican Gov. Mike DeWine appointed to fill Vance’s seat after he became vice president. Both Brown and Husted are cruising through their primaries, setting up what is sure to be an expensive showdown in the general election.\n\nHusted, armed with Trump’s endorsement, hauled in $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2025—“the highest amount ever raised by a Republican candidate at this stage of a U.S. Senate race in Ohio,” his team boasted. But Brown’s fundraising dwarfed it: He pulled in a massive $8 million in just six weeks.\n\nWhoever wins in 2026 will serve only the remaining two years of Vance’s term and will also have to face voters in 2028 for a full six-year term.\n\nMichigan (Open D)\n\nMichigan is once again shaping up as a major battleground. The state narrowly backed Trump in 2024, and its Senate seat is now open after Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced he would not run again.\n\nDemocrats are bracing for a competitive primary that spans the party’s ideological range. Four-term Rep. Haley Stevens is seen as the establishment favorite, while state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and progressive organizer Abdul El-Sayed are pitching themselves as candidates who can break out of that mold.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have consolidated support early. Trump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers for his second Senate run, after losing a razor-thin race to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin in 2024. Rogers, an Army veteran, is pro-tariff and doesn’t want the government negotiating drug prices to make them cheaper.\n\nHowever, despite Trump winning Michigan twice, that success hasn’t translated downballot. Michigan has been a Senate mirage for the GOP, which hasn’t won a seat there in more than three decades.\n\nFor now, Michigan is one of the true toss-ups on the map—an open question in a state that rarely makes anything easy.","summary":"The 2026 Senate midterms should be Republicans’ to lose.

In the now deleted Instagram story she shared to her eight million Instagram followers, the 27-year-old singer wrote that the late actress was \"the inspiration for [my song] red wine supernova.\" Chappell added: \"Rest in peace Ms. Bardot.\"\n\nThe \"Pink Pony Club\" singer quickly retracted her heartfelt tribute later on Monday after learning about Brigitte's controversial beliefs about the LGBTQ+ community. Chappell deleted the story honoring Brigitte and made another post, writing: \"Holy *expletive* I did not know all that insane *expletive* Ms. Bardot stood for obvs I do not condone this. Very disappointing to learn.\"\n\nChappell clearly did not know about Brigitte's controversy, as the late model and actress is featured in the first lyric of her hit song, \"Red Wine Supernova.\"\n\nChappell Roan's controversies\n\nThis wasn't the first time Chappell has been embroiled in a contentious online situation. When the singer rose to fame in 2024, she set boundaries with her fans. In a TikTok posted that year, Chappell told her followers: \"[I don't give an *expletive* that] abuse and harassment and stalking is a normal thing to do [to famous people.] That does not make it okay.\"\n\nResponses to the video were mixed. A few months later, Chappell refused to endorse Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election. After an intense amount of backlash over the comments, she told her TikTok: \"Yeah, I'm voting for *expletive* Kamala.\"\n\nAnd in March of this year, Chappell landed in hot water after her appearance on Call Her Daddy where she said: \"All of my friends who have kids are in hell.\"\n\nWhile Chappell is no stranger to controversy, she handled the backlash of her tribute Brigitte swiftly and explicitly. If you're like Chappell and didn't know the full story on Ms. Bardot, here's a quick breakdown of her most controversial moments.\n\nWhy was Brigitte Bardot controversial?\n\nThe French actress died on Monday, December 29 after a lengthy health battle. The French actress rose to fame in the 1956 film And God Created Women. Two decades later, she retired from acting and devoted her time to animal activism. The latter part of her career is where most of her controversy arose.\n\nBrigitte was fined by the French courts several times for \"inciting racial hatred.\" The most explicit incident was in her book, Le Carre de Pluton. She wrote: \"My land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims.\"\n\nFor her comment, Brigitte was fined 30,000 francs.\n\nThe late actress also spread homophobic sentiments. In her 2003 book, Un Cris dans le Silence, Brigitte called the LGBTQ+ community \"fairground freaks\" and cited them as part of the \"destruction\" of French culture.\n\nFurther, Brigitte called the #MeToo movement \"hypocritical, ridiculous and uninteresting” in a January 2018 interview with French magazine Paris Match. \"Many actresses flirt with producers to get a role. Then when they tell the story afterward, they say they have been harassed,\" she continued. \"In actual fact, rather than benefit them, it only harms them.\"\n\nIt seems that for these reasons, and many more, Chappell retracted her tribute to Brigitte after her passing.","summary":"Chappell Roan faced backlash on Monday, December 29 after sharing a tribute to Brigitte Bardot, who died on Sunday at 91-years-old.","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/875538/chappell-roan-brigitte-bardot-backlash-explained/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/3a0f317d2571-chappell-brigitte.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 21:59:22","author":"Tess Hill","authors":["Tess Hill"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":390201760,"title":"Democrats split on merits of Jan. 6 committee’s return to spotlight","text":"“I’m sure Donald Trump wishes it was old news, but it’s bringing it up again to mark the dreadful anniversary of the first attempted coup d’etat in American political history, at least presidential history, bears a harsh reminder,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner.\n\n“I think Jeffries’ idea is a stroke of genius,” he said. \n\nBut not all in the party agree with this sentiment. \n\nA Democratic staffer told the Washington Examiner, “Democrats ran on ‘Donald Trump is bad for democracy’ in 2024, and while true voters decided affordability and cost of living were more important, I worry that putting too much focus on something that happened five years ago, however horrific, distracts from the issues that everyday Americans are focused on right now.”\n\nThe staffer added that it’s not an “inherently bad idea,” but he does not “know if it’s going to resonate with anyone outside of Washington.” \n\nOthers believe the success of the effort will stem from the motives behind the hearing and the expected outcome.\n\n“It all depends on what the goals of the hearing are,” Sammy Kanter, CEO of Democratic political strategy company Girl and the Gov, told the Washington Examiner. “Is it to put facts on the record? Is it to bring eyes and ears back to a critical change point for people on Trump and the GOP? Is it to create a sense of pushback against the admin or underscore a contrast? There’s a laundry list of possible goals that goes beyond these, of course — the benefit analysis, regardless, depends on which of the goals they’re trying to achieve.”\n\nAfter a year of deep division between the parties in the House, Jeffries said the GOP has tried to “rewrite history” in the years following the riot.\n\n“We will examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration, expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President’s first day in office,” Jeffries wrote of the hearing’s priorities in the letter. \n\n“I think it’s a good idea, because it reminds Americans of the chaos that Donald Trump has created and his threat to democratic institutions,” Bannon said. \n\nExit polling from the 2024 election showed that many voters for former Vice President Kamala Harris ranked “threat to democracy” as an important matter. An election analysis from the law firm Kelley Drye concluded that voters who said democracy was their top issue voted around 80% for Harris compared to 18% for Trump. \n\nWhile “threat to democracy” ranked high in exit polls from 2024, the matter skewed to the left. Democrats are fighting to appeal to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to flip the House or the Senate to break up Trump’s trifecta in the last two years of his second term. \n\nThe matter surged after the president made massive, controversial, blanket pardons at the beginning of his second term for many Jan. 6 defendants, charged with taking part in the 2021 insurrection of the Capitol.\n\nTRUMP HOLDS OUT ON GIVING CORNYN KEY TEXAS SENATE ENDORSEMENT\n\nHouse Democrats formed a panel after the Jan. 6 riots to investigate and attempt to prosecute people connected to the event. The panel was joined by two dissident Republicans, former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.

Still, the balance shifted again after Celsi’s death reduced the Democratic caucus to 16 seats.\n\nSecuring a 34th vote would give the GOP two-thirds control of the chamber, allowing it to override gubernatorial vetoes, call special sessions, and confirm a governor’s appointees without Democratic support. \n\nA Democratic win Tuesday would keep Republicans short of a two-thirds supermajority, building on a streak of off-year wins and overperformances that have energized Democrats in Iowa and nationally. It would also require Republicans to secure at least one Democratic vote to confirm Gov.

Murrow in the Broadway version of “Good Night, and Good Luck,” having directed the award-winning film version years earlier.\n\n“Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” the Oscar winner told the Hollywood trade publication Variety, alleging that CBS and rival networks abandoned their duty by settling lawsuits with the president. \n\nHe said such moves have reshaped the American media landscape for the worse.\n\nEarlier this month, Weiss came under scrutiny for yanking a “60 Minutes” segment on the CECOT prison in El Salvador, the notorious site where the Trump administration sent migrants suspected of committing crimes.\n\nClooney did not go into detail about his criticism of Weiss, issuing a blunt, top-line condemnation, instead.\n\nThe star said the network has failed the basic sense of responsibility Murrow embodied — holding power to account when the other branches of government fall short.\n\nHe argued that the rot became undeniable when CBS settled Trump’s lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview rather than fighting it — a move Clooney believes cleared the way for Paramount’s sale to Skydance earlier this year.\n\nParamount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a defamation lawsuit stemming from a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nClooney also called out ABC parent company Disney for setting a lawsuit brought by Trump following on-air comments made by George Stephanopoulos.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, f–k yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country. That’s simply the truth,” Clooney told Variety.\n\nNotwithstanding his new citizenship, Clooney averred, “My primary loyalty is to my country” — apparently referring to the US.\n\nHe added that he is far more alarmed by the alleged collapse of a “functioning press” than by turbulence in Hollywood or the film business.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from the White House, Clooney, ABC and Disney.","summary":"Weiss has come under fire for her recent decision to delay the airing of a \"60 Minutes\" segment devoted to the CECOT prison in El Salavador.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/30/media/bari-weiss-invites-george-clooney-to-visit-cbs-newsroom-after-star-says-shes-wrecking-network/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/118031119.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZFey4S3H-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-30 21:37:14","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.065},{"id":390176514,"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene tells all on her MAGA breakaway and says she was ‘naive’ to believe Trump was ‘man of the people’","text":"Marjorie Taylor Greene is using her last few days as a member of Congress to reflect on how she believes she was led astray by President Donald Trump, who she now claims isn’t committed to helping his voters.\n\nIn a lengthy New York Times profile published Monday, she spoke in detail about the beginnings of her break with Trump and how it came to evolve over the first year of his second term.\n\nThe firebrand Georgia representative announced that she would leave Congress on January 5 amid her growing feud with the president and her dissatisfaction with the work of the Republican-held House of Representatives. Her exit will leave Speaker Mike Johnson with an even slimmer majority in the chamber.Greene told the Times that she had believed Trump was a “man of the people\" - but her views had “matured.”\n\n“I was just so naïve and outside of politics that it was easy for me to naïvely believe [in him],\" she said.What changed her mind, according to Greene, was getting an up close look at the darker aspects of the president’s personality. She highlighted his remarks at the funeral of Charlie Kirk, where Trump seemed to mock Kirk for rejecting hatred in politics, telling a crowd: “I hate my opponent and I don’t want what’s best for them.\" She also referenced the president's apparently cold response to a threat she received against her son’s life - that she supposedly had herself to blame for turning on Trump.\n\n“That was absolutely the worst statement,” Greene said of Trump's remark at the funeral. “ It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.” \n\nThe remark is one of the congresswoman’s most personal criticisms of the president to date and comes as she continues to accuse both Trump and Johnson of being out of touch with Americans, particularly on issues surrounding economic hardship and cost-of-living. While Greene’s criticisms have largely been focused on policy, she has also pointed out the wave of threats her office received after her dispute with the president began and blamed Trump’s own personal bullying for causing it. In recent interviews, Greene has suggested that she recognizes her own role in the acceleration of American politics into a toxic wasteland, and feels regret over MAGA’s contributions to that dynamic.\n\nShe reiterated that belief to the Times in early December, according to the newspaper: “Our side has been trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong. You just keep pummeling your enemies, no matter what. And as a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that. I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.”\n\nHer hesitance to descend into mudslinging hasn’t stopped the departing congresswoman from critiquing Trump’s priorities in the final days of her service. Over the past several months, Greene’s long history of skepticism towards foreign intervention or assistance of any kind led her to become one of the Republican Party’s leading critics of support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in Israel, including Israel’s brutal siege of Gaza over the past two years. The congresswoman has repeatedly argued that Trump is focused on foreign policy objectives over a domestic agenda aimed at cost-cutting in the federal government and dealing with the economic woes of the voters who elected him over Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nShe also was one of a few Republicans to prominently defy Trump on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nIn a pair of tweets Sunday and Monday, Greene once again made those arguments, writing in one: “DOGE was one of the most popular plans of the ‘24 campaign because Americans are beyond furious about the insane amount of waste, fraud, and abuse. Just outright stealing. Which is why I created the DOGE Subcommittee... [p]erhaps now the Speaker and the admin will take DOGE more seriously.”\n\nGreene lamented Trump’s back-to-back meetings with Netanyahu and, on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago in another tweet, exclaiming: “Can we just do America?”\n\nHer criticisms of Trump’s own social and political circles to the Times revealed a broader disgust with Trumpism and the public face MAGA chooses to present to the world, at Mar-a-Lago and in the media.\n\n“I never liked the MAGA Mar-a-Lago sexualization,” she told the Times. “I have two daughters, and I’ve always been uncomfortable with how those women puff up their lips and enlarge their breasts.”\n\nTrump and Greene’s dispute seemed by some political observers to be a long time coming, however. The Georgia congresswoman has been a frequent source of embarassing headlines for the Republican Party due to her past espousement of conspiracy theories including one often-mocked example where she suggested that devices in space controlled by the wealthy Rothschild family could be behind wildfires in the U.S., sparking the “Jewish Space Lasers” meme.\n\nIn Georgia, two major political battles are due to be fought in 2026: A race for Jon Ossoff’s seat in the U.S. Senate, and a gubernatorial election. Trump, as a kingmaker in Republican primaries, has been known to spurn even loyalists if he views them as weak general election candidates, such as was the case for Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s elections in 2025.\n\nGreene confirmed earlier this year that Trump’s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio commissioned a survey showing her losing the Senate race by double digits, and seemingly was already working for one of her would-be opponents. While she furiously denied a report that Trump himself had urged her not to run for Senate, Fabrizio’s loyalties could be taken as a sign of Trump’s, too.\n\nFiring back at the congresswoman, Trump has attacked Greene as “crazy” and claimed that he was considering support for a primary challenger in her congressional district before she chose to resign.","summary":"Greene’s rejection of MAGA becomes all-encompassing as she slams his responses to threat against her family and Charlie Kirk’s death","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-maga-b2892390.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/26/17/44/GettyImages-2064219528.jpeg?crop=3864,2576,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QwdStJwY-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-30 20:37:35","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":390189110,"title":"These Republicans Honored Kwanzaa On Second Day Of Christmas","text":"A few Republican elected officials in late December 2025 posted social media messages honoring Kwanzaa, a secular holiday founded by a black nationalist and convicted criminal.\n\nAs many prominent Democrats posted in honor of Kwanzaa, which kicked off Dec. 26, some sitting GOP officials, including Republican New York Rep.

He is a top Democratic target heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, DeWine, who leads a state that voted for President Donald Trump by double digits, posted a pro-Kwanzaa message on multiple social media platforms with his government account. The Republican governor referred to the controversial pan-African celebration as a “joyful and meaningful holiday.” DeWine’s X post, like Lawler’s, received significantly more comments, most of them negative, than likes.\n\n Fran and I wish all Ohioans who celebrate Kwanzaa a joyful and meaningful holiday. pic.twitter.com/3Pe2txo1zG — Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) December 26, 2025 \n\nBoth Lawler and DeWine are Roman Catholics.

Republican New York State Sens. Steve Rhoads and Jack Martins honored the holiday in X posts sent on Dec. 26, 2024, but did not send a similar post one year later. Republican Utah Lt. Gov.

Murrow when he stood up to Joseph McCarthy. At the time the film was released, Clooney – whose father was a longtime TV news anchorman – said he “intended to draw parallels between Murrow and how the media was covering the lead-up to the Iraq War.”\n\nTwenty years later, the story resonates differently now that Trump is back in office and hitting news organizations with billion-dollar lawsuits while threatening to pull their broadcast licenses.\n\n“When Clooney played Murrow last spring, CBS News was settling a frivolous lawsuit with Trump so that he’d approve the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance,” Variety’s Brent Lang noted. “That enraged Clooney, as did ABC News’ similar settlement with the president over a defamation claim.”\n\nWeeks before the president’s second inauguration, Disney – the parent company of ABC News – paid Trump $15 million to settle his complaint after anchor George Stephanopoulos incorrectly claimed on-air that Trump had been found “liable for rape” in the E. Jean Carroll civil case. (Trump was actually found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll.) \n\nWhile legal analysts told The Independent at the time that the “case against ABC would have been a close call” if it went to trial, First Amendment experts warned that the settlement would have a “chilling effect” on the media going forward. “Many in free press circles are holding their breath,” one stated. “There is concern that we are embarking on some scary times.”\n\nMonths later, amid a politically-fraught $8.4 billion merger with Ellison’s Skydance Media, Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle his defamation lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, despite CBS News lawyers calling the complaint “meritless.” \n\nThough Paramount’s leadership insisted that the settlement was unrelated to the Skydance deal, the merger was approved weeks later by the Trump administration. House Democrats have since launched an investigation into whether the settlement constituted a “bribe” to the president in order to secure the deal.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f*** yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney told Variety. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nClooney went on to express concerns over the “MAGA-friendly” direction of CBS News under Ellison and Weiss, who was hired in October. She has recently come under fire for spiking a 60 Minutes story at the last minute about the Trump administration sending Venezuelan migrants to the notorious El Salvador CECOT prison.\n\n“Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” he said. “I’m worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.”\n\nHe also grew more “animated” over his belief that some journalists and news outlets have abandoned their “mission to hold the powerful to account,” prompting him to reference a quote of Murrow’s from the film and play. \n\n“‘Let’s not confuse dissent with disloyalty,’” Clooney said. “I mean, what a beautiful, important statement about who we are at our best. But all too often we fall short.”\n\nWhile extremely worried about the state of the country and the free press under a Trump White House, calling it a “very trying time,” Clooney – one of Hollywood’s most outspoken liberals – also revealed that there was once a time when he was pals with the celebrity game show host turned president.\n\n“I knew him very well,” the Michael Clayton star proclaimed. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was.

Jean Carroll. Trump had been found liable of sexual abuse, but not rape. Though the judge in that case later found that bit of daylight to be a distinction without a difference, ABC caved and paid Trump $15 million. \n\nTrump sued CBS for election interference, claiming that editing choices made in a “60 Minutes” interview of former Vice President Kamala Harris were “partisan.” Though CBS shared the transcripts and unedited footage of their interview, the network’s parent company, Paramount, decided to settle.

In the video, Shirley knocks on the doors of several day care centers and demands to know whether the centers are engaged in fraud. It's a flashy piece of media, to be sure, and it caught fire over the Christmas weekend on YouTube and Twitter, where Shirley won praise from conservatives for covering a story that the mainstream media is supposedly refusing to touch.\n\nBut that is simply not true. Indeed, media outlets in Minnesota and around the country have been covering this story for months. Locally, the day care fraud story has been in the news for years—here's a Minnesota Public Radio article from 2015 about prosecutors targeting four potentially fraudulent day cares.\n\nI bring this up not to make a point about media criticism—that's the realm of Reason's Robby Soave, who may have more to say about all this in the near future.\n\nNo, my point in bringing this up is to highlight how long state and federal officials have ignored obvious and recurring problems with the Medicaid-funded programs that are at the center of the Minnesota welfare fraud story. Look at that MPR article from 2015. It deals with four preschools that received funding through the Minnesota Child Care Assistance Program. You can probably guess what state-run program spent $4 million on the \"Quality Learing Center,\" one of the daycare facilities featured heavily in Shirley's video.\n\nIn fairness, the Minnesota Child Care Assistance Program has a lot of company. So far, federal prosecutors have convicted 59 people and charged dozens more in various schemes that stole money from a wide range of programs, including ones aimed at feeding needy families and providing therapy for children with autism. One federal prosecutor suggested earlier this month that \"half or more\" of the $18 billion Minnesota has spent on Medicaid-funded welfare programs since 2018 might have been lost to fraud.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is now scrambling to cover his butt after this scandal exploded in the middle of his reelection campaign, has ordered a state audit of 14 Medicaid-funded programs deemed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services to be at \"high risk\" of fraud. It seems likely that the scandal will grow as more fraud is uncovered, more charges are brought, and public awareness of the mess grows.\n\nThere's no doubt that the scandal has become a bigger story because of Walz, who gained national prominence last year as Kamala Harris' running mate, and because it presents an opportunity to scapegoat the entire Somali immigrant and Somali-American community in Minnesota for crimes committed by a tiny fraction of those individuals.\n\nStill, the real problem here is a much more boring and less partisan one, and it starts with Medicaid.\n\nTechnically, Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, but the federal government's share has grown dramatically in recent decades while the state funding has flatlined. That's due to two provisions in federal law. First, there is the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, which varies by state and program. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent.\n\nSecond, and thanks to the Medicaid expansion included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid services provided to enrollees covered by the ACA are funded at 90 percent by the federal government.\n\nRegardless of the exact math, this cost-sharing scheme creates two correlated problems.\n\nFirst, it incentivizes states to come up with new Medicaid programs—for every dollar that state lawmakers agree to spend, they get several \"free\" dollars from the federal government to help pad the budget. In Minnesota, for example, only 42 percent of Medicaid spending is funded by the state.\n\nThe second problem is that states have little incentive to police the Medicaid spending they oversee. Governments are always bad at spotting fraud because they are spending other people's money, but the Medicaid matching grants double down on that problem: Most of the dollars being spent are not just someone else's money; they are coming from another government's budget.\n\nThink about the fact that state and federal prosecutors have been trying to bust fraudulent preschools and other Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota for more than a decade. And yet, there are always more. Law enforcement is doing its best, but the problem seems to be that the state's welfare bureaucracy is doing a terrible job of stopping the scammers in the first place.\n\nThe more you look at what prosecutors are saying about the latest fraud charges and convictions, the more obvious this conclusion becomes. Earlier this month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told reporters that two men from Philadelphia heard there was \"easy money\" to be made by scamming Minnesota's Housing Stabilization Services program, so they traveled to the state, enrolled their businesses, went back to Philadelphia, and filed fraudulent claims from there.\n\nThompson called that \"fraud tourism,\" but I see it more as the type of thing that should have been easily blocked if someone, anyone, in the Minnesota Housing Stabilization Services system was paying attention.\n\nIn fact, there was so much fraud in that one program that the state pulled the plug on it in August. And for good reason. As the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported in July (further proof that local media were not ignoring this story), the Housing Stabilization Services program was expected to cost about $2.6 million annually when it was created in 2017. By 2024, it was costing the state (and, thanks to Medicaid, federal taxpayers too) $107 million, and over 700 companies were on the dole.\n\nThis is not just a problem in Minnesota either. Medicaid fraud is remarkably common. The federal departments of Justice and Health and Human Services run a joint program to catch fraudsters, and in 2024 alone it accounted for 1,151 convictions that recovered almost $1.4 billion.\n\nIndeed, maybe the most noteworthy part of the Minnesota welfare fraud story is that it became such a big story at all. Again, I assume that's because these alleged frauds revolve around a pair of politically convenient topics: the Somali immigrant community in Minnesota and the state's hapless governor.\n\nAnyone who wants to stop Medicaid fraud should focus less on scoring partisan political points or demonizing immigrants and more on the boring work of fixing federal policy.\n\nTelling states to pay for a larger share of their own Medicaid spending seems like an obvious step in the right direction. It would give state officials—from governors like Walz all the way down to the lowest-ranking bureaucrat—a stronger incentive to prevent waste and fraud in the first place. It would reduce the burden placed on out-of-state taxpayers when states with lax enforcement allow fraud like this to occur.\n\nAs a bonus, it would also help reduce the federal budget deficit. Simply reducing the higher matching rate paid for enrollees covered by the ACA could save $500 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThen, of course, you also have to do the hard work of actually ensuring that welfare dollars are targeting the truly needy. Bureaucracies will never be perfect, but it sure seems like the one in Minnesota could be greatly improved.","summary":"Federal Medicaid policy creates little incentive for states to stop potential fraudsters.

They appear to have a warped sense of morality, deeming seemingly terrible acts to be moral, kind or right… Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, \"the most notorious traitor and rebel that can be\". They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well.\n\nWhat worked so witchingly for the Bard works for us, too: Couldn’t ask for a better intro for today’s column!\n\nThree women. Three merchants of mayhem. \n\nThree different agendas for 2026.\n\nAnd all three will be stirring the political pot, because they need chaos, conflict, and confusion to survive. It’s their livelihood; without it, they starve.\n\nMost of the time, people (and/or witches) act in their own self-interest. If they think it’ll benefit them, they’ll do it. So, to predict their future, all we need to do is reverse-engineer their goals, strategies, and worldviews.\n\nWhich is why we already know what 2026 holds for Kamala Harris, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Candace Owens.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nThe woman who would be Queen King wants you to know that Donald Trump’s victory in 2024 wasn’t her fault. Quite literally, the ENTIRE reason she titled her book 107 Days was to remind voters that her runway was too short; the deck was unfairly stacked against her. (Despite, you know, receiving her party’s nomination on a silver platter without any caucuses, primaries, or rival candidates.)\n\nCurses and drat: If only she had 108 or 109 days! Then, she surely would’ve mopped the floor with that no-good Trump. He wouldn’t have stood a chance!\n\nAlas, 107 days just weren’t enough.\n\nHarris still has her sights set on the White House, but the lineup of Donkeys is getting crowded: Fellow Californian Gavin Newsom has ascended; Gov. JB Pritzker (D-Ill.) is gobbling up headlines (and probably Cheetos); and AOC’s presence looms large.\n\nBecause of Newsom, Harris can’t play the California card. Because of AOC, she can’t play the woman card. Because of Pritzker, she can’t play the establishment card.\n\nIt leaves one card left to play: The black card — and I ain’t talking American Express.\n\nAbout 17% of all Democratic voters are black. And in a crowded, multi-person primary, a built-in vote of 17% can carry a candidate far. (Especially in South Carolina, where Joe Biden locked down the 2020 nomination by winning 61% of the black vote.)\n\nOf all the projected Democratic presidential candidates, there’s been a curious absence of black representation. Other than, say, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), the cupboard is bare. (And not to be unkind to Booker, but he somehow manages to be both black and completely colorless at the same time.)\n\nPrediction: In 2026, Kamala Harris will rediscover her black identity, campaigning tirelessly for black candidates in black districts throughout the midterms. She’ll start using a strong black accent that puts Hillary Clinton’s to shame.\n\nBecause if she captures the black voting bloc, she knows she’ll be in the driver’s seat for the 2028 nomination.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene\n\nThe soon-to-be ex-congresswoman wants you to know that she didn’t leave MAGA; MAGA left her. She’s still the same highly-principled conservative warrior, passionately fighting for America First principles.\n\nAnd she’ll attack President Trump over and over again — on leftwing media outlets like The View, The New York Times, CNN, and more — until you believe her.\n\nShe brings to mind another quote: “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.”\n\nGreene will begin 2026 by exiting Congress (conveniently enough, three days after her taxpayer-funded retirement benefits kick in). But we haven’t seen the last of her.\n\nAs long as she continues to attack Trump, she’ll continue to have value to the anti-Trump forces. That’s gonna be MTG’s new business model.\n\nAnd making oodles of money has always been a priority.\n\nFrom the Washington Times:\n\nSince taking her seat in Congress in 2021, MTG hasn’t just been making headlines; she’s been making bank. Her net worth skyrocketed from a modest $700,000 when she took office to a cool $25 million in just a few short years, according to Quiver Quantitative.Not bad when your annual salary is $174,000.Perhaps the answer to her incredible surge in wealth lies in her uncanny, almost clairvoyant, knack for stock trading. Since joining the House, Ms. Greene has executed a staggering 450 stock trades.Her timing was particularly exquisite. Take, for instance, a curious shopping spree this past April. According to financial disclosures, Ms. Greene went on a veritable stock-buying binge, snapping up $32,000 to $480,000 worth of shares in major tech and logistics companies like Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and FedEx.These purchases were made just hours before her one-time staunch ally, President Trump, took to Truth Social to declare it was “a great time to buy,” a message that preceded a White House announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs, which spiked the markets.\n\nPrediction: If MTG was motivated by the Almighty Dollar while in Congress — where she was, at least in theory, still accountable to her constituents — you better believe she’ll be pocketing as much moolah as possible while on the outside. (Traditionally, that’s when ex-congresspeople dramatically grow their wealth.)\n\nBecause she loves the limelight, Greene will try her hand at podcasting. Expect to see “The MTG Show” or something similar popping up on YouTube.\n\nBut her podcast probably won’t last very long, because she’s a lousy long-form communicator. Her voice is too flat and her face too Botoxed to convey emotions, and she’s never been a deep thinker. Instead, she comes across as droll, hysterical, and repetitive.\n\nGreene will quickly realize that the only way she’s gonna get media attention is by attacking Trump, criticizing Israel, and bad-mouthing MAGA. Everything else will fall on deaf ears.\n\nSo that’s what she’ll do in 2026.\n\nAnd as long as she doesn’t say something so bat-feces crazy that she’s un-hirable, we might even see her on CNN or MSNOW as one of their token “conservative commentators.” Either way, MTG’s 2026 will continue the way her 2025 ended: Waging war against Donald Trump, MAGA, Israel, and the Republican Party.\n\nRecommended: The 3 Biggest PR Losers of 2025 (and Poor Tim Walz Only Made the Honorable Mention List!)\n\nCandace Owens\n\nShe’s not a serious pundit or an investigating journalist; Owens — much like Tucker Carlson — is a political shock-jock. She is to political podcasts what Howard Stern was to AM radio.\n\nAnd we’ve seen the Stern “business model” in action long enough to know what to expect.\n\nShock-jocks depend on surprises and escalation. When they fail to up the ante, their audience walks. Novelty is everything.\n\nWhat shocked us the first time seldom shocks us the second time.\n\nWhich means Owens will be incentivized to double down on the craziness. Because if she goes backwards, she’ll lose her audience.\n\nRemember: Her audience doesn’t tune in because they agree with her. They’re there for the exact same reason Howard Stern’s audience was there: \n\nRatings Expert: The average radio listener listens for 18 minutes. The average Howard Stern fan listens for — are you ready for this — an average of 1 hour and 20 minutes.Kenny “Pig Vomit” Rushton: How can that be?Ratings Expert: Answer most commonly given: I want to see what he’ll say next.Kenny “Pig Vomit” Rushton: All right. Okay, fine, but what about the people who hate Stern?Ratings Expert: Good point. The average Stern hater listens for an average of two-and-a-half hours a day.Kenny “Pig Vomit” Rushton: Look, but if they hate him, why do they listen?Ratings Expert: Most common answer: I want to see what he’ll say next.\n\nBut escalation alone isn’t enough.\n\nSure, Howard Stern is still limping by on SiriusXM, but almost all the shock-jocks of his era were eventually banished from the airwaves. They kept raising the ante and escalating their shenanigans ‘til they crossed a line that shouldn’t be crossed.\n\nIt happened to the Greaseman. It happened to Opie and Anthony. It happened to Bubba the Love Sponge.\n\nAnd eventually, it’ll happen to Candace Owens, because there’s no other direction for her to go.\n\nInterestingly, the historic King Macbeth was deposed when Scottish rebels were assisted by another European power, the English. Owens’ undoing may come at the hands of the French.\n\nIn 2026, the Macron’s lawsuit against Owens should enter the deposition phase. That means, Owens will be legally required to answer very specific questions about her statements, beliefs, finances, and business model — and the same law firm that won a record-setting $787.5 million settlement from Fox News will be asking all the questions.\n\nI couldn’t imagine a more humiliating downfall for an “America First” podcaster: losing to the French!\n\nPrediction: In 2026, Candace Owens will double down on her conspiratorial gobbledygook, escalating her attacks on Jews, and trying to retain her audience by upping her insanity:\n\nNo matter how hard the GOP tries to make “radical Islam” happen, the base doesn’t care about it.We are way more concerned about Israel.You can deny reality and scream about Tucker, but the party can no longer be governed by those who refuse to acknowledge the Zionist…— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) December 27, 2025\n\nBut the same PR strategy that works on-air for political shock-jocks would be disastrous in a deposition. Here, Candace won’t be the one “just asking questions” — it’ll be a highly-trained lawyer who’s out for blood, knows the law, and is eyeing a multimillion-dollar payday.\n\nMost likely outcome: Candace Owens will overestimate her intelligence, try to spar with the lawyer, get raked over the coals — and then pay through the nose.\n\nAnd she’ll spend the rest of 2026 panhandling listeners for donations, posing as a “martyr” for free speech.\n\nOne Last Thing: The PJ Media YUUUGE Christmas/New Year sale is here — offering readers a whopping 74% discount(!) with the code MERRY74.

When asked why this one didn’t make the show, Rudolph had a pretty curt but understandable answer.\n\n“I mean, I did not have a take on Barack Obama at all,” Rudolph explained.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine, given how many impressions there have been of Obama over the years, as well as the comedian’s prowess with other political figures, including former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, at the time, Obama was new on the scene and Rudolph had nothing to work off of. It seems he noticed, as he gently let her know that something wasn’t working.\n\n“I remember the first time we saw each other was when we were about to walk out onstage,” she recalled. “I’m there waiting in my little Brooks Brothers suit, and I think we bound my boobs, and I used to play Scott Joplin, so I had my Scott Joplin wig on and I was standing there… he came over and I said, ‘Well, what do you think?’ And all he said to me was, ‘I don’t wear a three-button suit.’ I still don’t know what that means.

All but two of the facilities mentioned in the video had active licenses and were all visited by state regulators in the last six months. \n\nThe most recent inspection was on 4 December at Sweet Angel Daycare, a centre that has drawn particular attention on social media.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said earlier this week that he was aware of \"recent social media reports\", and that investigations into fraud in Minnesota have been ongoing since the pandemic.\n\n\"The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg.

The party formerly known as \"The Democratic Party\" became so toxic, so out of touch, that party leaders have been desperately casting about, looking for ways to get voters to forget \"The Democratic Party\" and embrace teddy bears, kitty cats, and other cuddly things.\n\nNot really, but dangling shiny objects in front of voters' eyes to make them forget Kamala Harris and her radical-left child mutilators has become a top priority for the party heading into the midterm elections in 2026.\n\nIt's beginning to face the fact that being the \"Anti-Donald Trump\" party just ain't cutting it. With less than a year to the pivotal electoral contests that will either point to a comeback or a collapse for the Democrats, the party is fractured, disjointed, and at each other's throats.\n\nWhat the party needs, say the gimlet-eyed political consultants, is an overarching, unifying theme that can unite the factions and bring about a victory that could sweep the Democrats back into power, where they will promptly take their revenge on Trump, conservatives, and all their other enemies, real and imagined.\n\nSome Democrats think they've found that unifying theme: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n“The contrast is so obvious. On one side, there’s the billionaires, and on the other side, there’s everyone else,” said Lakshya Jain, the co-founder of the polling firm Split Ticket. “I think [Democrats] should be bolder. A lot of tech companies have a lot of power, and they have a lot of capital and economic influence. But politically speaking, you can go a lot harder on economic populism. The public wants to see something bold on costs.”\n\nAmerica has a long, proud tradition of embracing technological change. It's the secret sauce of American capitalism. When Europeans fought tooth and nail to prevent rapid technological advances in transportation, for example, the United States raced ahead, viewing the locomotive, the steam engine, and the automobile not as threats but as the essential tools of a growing nation.\n\nThe American spirit has always been keen to master the new frontier — a lesson Democratic alarmists would do well to remember as they target AI.\n\nTo many people who spend their days thinking about how Democrats can energize their base and prove their anti-billionaire bona fides, going all-in on opposing the AI industry is one obvious, winning way to do so. The loosely defined coalition of people calling for this approach includes socialists, independents from rural states and mainstream Democrats who have turned concern about tech into a pet issue, arguing it can form the basis of a new populist brand of politics that has long proven difficult for Democrats to execute effectively and on a large scale — but whose time may have come.\n\nIndeed, the polls are telling Democrats to go all in on generating hysterical opposition to AI. \n\n\"Gallup polling showed that 80 percent of American adults think the government should regulate AI, even if it means growing more slowly,\" reports Politico. \"Pew, meanwhile, ran a study that showed only 17 percent of Americans think AI will have a positive impact on the U.S. over the next 20 years.\"\n\nHas America lost its nerve? No, but it's become cautious about a technology that might raise electricity costs, force millions of workers into unemployment, and alter America in fundamental ways that no one has been able to explain. \n\n“There’s both a political imperative and opportunity for the Democratic Party to take advantage of the fact that the AI billionaires are in bed with the Trump administration,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told Politico.\n\nThat's true to a point. Most mainstream Democrats are bullish on AI but tout the need for some regulation, for instance, to address affordability or intellectual property rights. \n\nThat's boring. To energize the base, populist Democrats want to go full-on, hair-on-fire, opposition to everything about AI, starting with the huge data centers springing up across rural America and going so far as preventing AI from being implemented in any useful way.\n\nSome Democrats believe it may be a way to win back the working-class voters they have abandoned over the last 20 years. \n\nFor the past several elections, Democrats have lost, by increasing margins, voters without college degrees. They are increasingly stuck with a white-collar base that disadvantages them politically and makes them seem out of touch in large swaths of post-industrial America. Now, though, white-collar workers are also deeply concerned about AI stealing their jobs. A passionate case against AI not only allows the Democrats to adopt a populist posture on a massive issue, these consultants and pollsters say; it also allows them to loop in their white-collar base to a populist cause.AI’s successes have already disproportionately affected white-collar work. In May, AI giant Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei cautioned that AI could soon eliminate up to 50 percent of entry-level white-collar jobs. But blue-collar work is at risk of further AI-driven automation, too, and blue-collar workers are already angry about rising energy costs. That both groups can be mobilized under the cause of protecting jobs against AI and lowering energy costs could be a game-changer for Democrats.\n\nRecommended: Innocent People Continue to Die Because Congress and the Courts Refuse to Face the Mental Health Crisis\n\n“I think it’s a massive political opportunity,” said Morris Katz, a strategist who has worked with incoming New York mayor Zohran Mamdani. “We’re seeing the ruling class try to, as a final act, make extinct the working and middle class in this country, and we need a politics that’s willing to name a villain … If NAFTA lost us a generation of white working class voters, this is our trade deal moment on steroids.”\n\nWhy would the \"ruling class\" try to \"make extinct the working and middle class\"? That sort of hysterical nonsense will serve as fodder for the Democrats as they seek to stop AI in its tracks.\n\nHappy holidays from PJ Media! We have a YUGE Christmas/New Year sale going on now!

Gov. Peggy Flanagan for wearing a “Handmaid’s Tale” outfit while pandering to Somalis.\n\nFlanagan praised the Somali community in her state in a video posted on Thursday by Somali TV of Minnesota, during which she wore a hijab, a head covering worn by some Muslim women, during her visit to a Minneapolis-area market. Jennings described the “catering” to the Somali community as “a little weird,” prompting Jamal Simmons, a one-time aide to former Vice President Kamala Harris, to interject. (RELATED: Journalist Who Visited Somali Day Care Centers Explains Why Media Missed Fraud ‘Kindergartener’ Could Find)\n\n“You gotta admit, though, the catering to the Somali community that goes on by the Democrats in Minnesota is a little weird, is it not?” Jennings asked, with Simmons responding, “I will tell you, I was in Minnesota two weeks ago. The people of Minnesota —”\n\n“They got the lieutenant governor up there dressed like The Handmaid‘s Tale. I mean, why do they cater —” Jennings said before Simmons interrupted, claiming, “That is out of line.”\n\n“The Handmaid’s Tale” is a dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, published in 1985, featuring a theocratic takeover of the United States. The novel was also adapted into a TV series by Hulu and ran from 2017 to 2025.\n\nJennings attempted to respond to Simmons by asking why Democrats put Somalis “at the center of everything,” but “CNN NewsNight” host Abby Phillip cut in.\n\n“Just a second, just a second, because I don’t, I don’t think it would be acceptable for you to make a statement like that about orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. Why on earth is it acceptable to make a statement like that about people —” Phillip asked before Jennings cut in, saying, “It is a white liberal woman dressing in a —”\n\n“I’m just saying — I’m just saying you are —” Phillip said before Jennings responded, “You’re saying Republicans are signaling at Somalis. The Democrats are the ones who put them at the center of a —”\n\nPhillip then accused Jennings of “denigrating” the religious practices of the Somali community, which is overwhelmingly Muslim.\n\n“You’re describing the type of dress as The Handmaid’s Tale, and you’re doing that to denigrate the religion of the people,” Phillip claimed. “It wouldn’t be acceptable if you did it with another group. So don’t — just don’t do it when it comes to Muslim people. That’s not okay.” (RELATED: Somali Scammers Stole Almost As Much In Blue State As Nation’s Entire GDP)\n\n“I’m simply pointing out it‘s Democrats — it‘s Democrats who have put Somali diaspora in Minneapolis at the center of their party and their state‘s politics,” Jennings responded. It’s a small portion of the population. There is a bunch of fraud that goes on and even Tim Walz has claimed that any investigation of this fraud is akin to white supremacy.”\n\nIn a Nov. 30 statement, state employees accused Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota of engaging in “systemic” retaliation against whistleblowers who warned of the fraud schemes.

Harold and Kumar go to White Castle firmly falls in the third category, the first proper coming-of-age movies that shows that second-generation Asian-Americans are just as assimilated as other races and have the same American dream: getting high, meeting girls, and binging on hamburgers.What set Harold and Kumar apart, was that it showed that the Asian experience wasn’t that different from the American one, epitomised by the scene where Kumar explains to Harold – while urging him to paraglide to a White Castle outlet – that their immigrant parents had come here because they were hungry, providing an adequate noughties update to the American dream. For a long time, Indian-Americans believed their story was headed there too.Not to White Castle specifically, but to a sort of ‘white castle’: where you are so integrated and assimilated that you are considered a beacon of society, an upstanding member of the Shining City on the Top of The Hill. A place where your faith was acceptable as all the other faiths that existed in the American tapestry.And then one Hanuman statue in Texas shattered that carefully crafted delusion.The statue built on private land, became a reminder that America’s promise of welcome often frays the moment difference stops being discreet. Even as Vande Mataram and The Star-Spangled Banner played on temple grounds, conservative Christian protesters gathered outside, denouncing Hanuman as a “demon god”. One local politician asked publicly: “Why are we allowing a false statue of a false Hindu God to be here in Texas? We are a CHRISTIAN nation.”Srinivasachary Tamirisa, a doctor who spent decades practising in the United States and quietly supported the statue project for more than twenty-five years, told the New York Times that he once viewed the country as a kind of promised land. When confronted by protesters, he said he tried to explain the figure they were objecting to. To him, Hanuman was not a demonic symbol but a spiritual guide, one meant to convey courage rather than fear.For the uninitiated, Lord Hanuman is not a god of domination or conquest. In Hindu tradition, he is the embodiment of strength governed by humility, power exercised in service rather than rule. He is the devoted follower of Vishnu in his incarnation as Lord Rama, remembered less for authority than for loyalty, courage, and self-restraint. The Hanuman Chalisa, recited daily by millions, is not a hymn of supremacy but of reassurance, invoking fearlessness, discipline, and moral clarity in moments of doubt.But what perhaps the disquiet that has been bothering Indian-Americans isn’t the protest. America has always had its fair share of protesters, a right enshrined in First Amendment. The tragedy was the timing which neatly folded into the rise of anti-Indian sentiment: online and offline, often juxtaposed with gleeful Hinduphobia.Read: The rise of anti-India hate onlineJust when Indians thought they were in, the newest adherents promising to make America great have been mainstreaming anti-Indian sentiment. To put it frankly, this wasn’t how it was supposed to be.“Gas, beds and meds”There is a comedian’s line that captures the Indian-American arc with more accuracy than any novel or academic paper. Nimesh Patel, a stand-up comic who was the first Indian-American to write for Saturday Night Live, explained how Indians had spent time looking at Americans and surmised: “They like to sleep, they like to eat, they like to drive. So they’re going to need gas stations, motels and cardiologists. Gas, beds and meds, baby.”So Indian-Americans arrived to fill the gap by becoming doctors, motel owners, convenience store operators, and more. Gas, beds and meds. A pithy line to explain the early immigrant experience.And Americans were very happy to accept these foreigners who fulfilled their basic needs handing them a funny accent and a recurring role in sitcoms. The Indian immigrant was perfectly welcome till he stayed inside the deal, as long as he remained industrious, grateful and most importantly socially quiet. As long as they remained a model minority who didn’t make too much noise, didn’t commit crimes and didn’t voice its displeasure too loudly. All that was set to change.ABCD: American-Born Confident Desi The second generation did not assimilate quietly. By the late 2010s, Indian-Americans were no longer clustered in a handful of “safe” professions. They were everywhere power accumulated.Technology was the most obvious arena. Satya Nadella at Microsoft and Sundar Pichai at Google were no longer immigrant success stories wheeled out to reassure America about diversity. They were the system itself. Shantanu Narayen at Adobe and Arvind Krishna at IBM reinforced the same quiet shock.Indians were no longer helping America run. They were deciding how it ran, or were deeply embedded in the operating systems that ran it.The spread did not stop at Silicon Valley.In science and academia, Indian-Americans occupied intellectual ground that did not require translation or apology. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Manjul Bhargava were not decorative achievements in a diversity brochure. They represented authority in the deepest traditions of Western knowledge. In engineering, Ajay V. Bhatt quietly underpinned everyday modern life. Nothing dramatic. Just infrastructure.Business followed the same arc. Entrepreneurs like Jay Chaudhry were no longer framed as immigrant hustlers. They were founders building companies central to American cybersecurity and defence. The Indian-American presence stopped being anecdotal. It became structural.Culture, too, shifted tone. Hasan Minhaj, Aziz Ansari, and Mindy Kaling did not explain Indianness to America. They assumed it. Their work treated Indian-American identity as an unremarkable fact of life, not an obstacle to be overcome. Representation stopped asking for permission.This should have been a celebratory moment in the immigrant imagination. Proof that quiet diligence eventually leads to acceptance. Instead, it became uniquely combustible. Because Indian success no longer looked like contribution. It looked like consolidation. And consolidation, when performed by a group long expected to remain grateful and invisible, unsettles even confident societies.By 2024, that unease could no longer be contained within boardrooms or culture pages. It spilled into politics.The US presidential election became the most India-coded contest in modern memory, with people joking that it was a Telugu–Tamil tussle between Second Lady–in-waiting Usha Vance (Telugu) and Kamala Harris (Tamil).During the GOP debates, Vivek Ramaswamy tangled with Nikki Haley, two Indian-American Republicans of different vintages. JD Vance, whom Donald Trump picked as his running mate, even waxed lyrical about how his wife’s parents’ Hindu faith helped him find Christ again. Trump went out of his way to court Indian-American and Hindu voters, wishing them Happy Diwali and promising to protect Hindu-Americans from the “radical Left”, a line often linked to California’s caste discrimination bill, which was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Some claimed the decision to veto the bill came directly from the White House while Kamala Harris was vice president.Meanwhile, the Indian-American contingent around the White House grew.Tulsi Gabbard, often considered an honorary Indian, was made head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kash Patel became chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Jay Bhattacharya was appointed director of the National Institutes of Health. Vivek Ramaswamy was brought in to spearhead Trump’s government-efficiency push. Harmeet Dhillon joined the Justice Department in a senior civil rights role. Sriram Krishnan emerged as a key White House voice on AI. S. Paul Kapur took charge of South and Central Asia at the State Department.A younger cohort, including Kush Desai and Ricky Gill, filled out the administration’s communications and national security benches.Across the aisle, Zohran Mamdani led a remarkable underdog campaign to emerge as New York’s mayor-elect, beating the likes of Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams. It appeared that Indian-Americans were no longer power-adjacent. They were calling the shots.The Hate MachineWhat changed was not Indian behaviour. It was American permission. For years, resentment towards Indian-Americans existed as background static. It surfaced as jokes about accents, casual remarks about outsourcing, the quiet assumption that Indians were useful but culturally odd. What has changed since 2023–24 is scale and legitimacy. Hostility has been systematised. It now moves fluidly between online ecosystems, mainstream media commentary, campaign rhetoric, and offline intimidation. What once lived at the edges has been invited in. The most comprehensive documentation of this shift comes from the Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), whose report showed how anti-Indian and anti-Hindu narratives exploded across social platforms before spilling into real-world consequences. The study tracked 128 high-impact posts attacking Indians and Hindu identity over a short window, accumulating more than 138 million views. The numbers matter less than the pattern. Online rhetoric primes offline behaviour. Contempt becomes consensus. Consensus becomes action.The CSOH report shows that Hinduism is no longer treated merely as a religion in these narratives. It is reframed as an ideology, a civilisational threat, something incompatible with American identity. Indians are no longer just immigrants or professionals. They are recoded as infiltrators, beneficiaries of unfair systems, demographic threats hiding behind legality. That framing explains why symbolic flashpoints now trigger disproportionate outrage. The backlash against the Hanuman statue in Sugar Land, Texas was not really about zoning laws or religious neutrality. It was about visibility. A Hindu god that refused to stay private. A faith that declined to remain ornamental. When a Republican Senate candidate publicly dismissed Hanuman as a “false Hindu god” and declared America a Christian nation, it was not an outlier moment. It was the logical endpoint of months of narrative conditioning.On the right, this hostility increasingly flows from Trump-era ideological infrastructure. Immigration debates have shifted from illegality to legality itself. High-skilled migration is no longer framed as economic policy but as demographic subversion. Figures like Stephen Miller have repeatedly argued that legal immigration is a loophole exploited to change America from within. Indians, because they arrive legally, in large numbers, and into elite professions, become uniquely convenient targets.That language filters downFar-right provocateurs like Nick Fuentes make the subtext explicit. Fuentes has attacked Vivek Ramaswamy for his Hindu faith, telling him to “go back to India”. He has also targeted JD Vance, mocking him for hosting a “traditional Indian dinner” and telling him to “eat shit” for what Fuentes framed as civilisational betrayal. The target was not policy. It was cultural permission. Who gets to belong, and on what terms.What makes this moment distinct is that the hostility does not remain quarantined on the fringe. It circulates upward.On the liberal side, the same permission structure manifests differently. Hindu identity is collapsed into caricature. Indian success is reframed as proximity to power. Hinduphobia is expressed through irony, mockery, and “analysis”.The Joy Reid episode captured this perfectly. When Reid speculated on air that Republicans could not accept a successor with a “brown Hindu wife”, before fantasising about a “white queen” replacement, she was not critiquing racism. She was reproducing it, using Hindu identity as a punchline. The fact that this passed largely without consequence speaks volumes.This is where Usha Vance becomes central to the story. Her elevation to Second Lady should have been unremarkable. Instead, her Hindu faith became something to be managed, joked about, explained away. Across the spectrum, reassurance carried an undertone of discomfort. Faith, when Christian, is tradition. Faith, when Hindu, is complication.The CSOH report makes clear that this dual hostility is not accidental. Indians and Hindus now occupy an uncomfortable position. Too successful to be ignored. Too visible to remain ornamental. Too assimilated to be dismissed as outsiders. And not yet protected by the reflexive moral guardrails that trigger immediate outrage for others.This is how the hate machine works. Not through a single ideology, but through convergence. Different vocabularies. Same permission.What defines an AmericanThis is where the argument inevitably lands. Not on immigration policy or social media outrage, but on the older, unresolved question that America has never quite settled. Who gets to be American, and on what terms.For much of the late twentieth century, the answer appeared settled. Ronald Reagan liked to say that while you could live in France or Japan without ever becoming French or Japanese, anyone from any corner of the world could come to America and become an American. It was a civic definition, expansive and reassuring, and it allowed the country to absorb wave after wave of newcomers without interrogating bloodlines. Belief mattered more than ancestry. Allegiance more than origin.The hate machine described above feeds on the erosion of that consensus. In recent years, conservative debates have drifted back towards inheritance, towards what is often described — sometimes openly — as Mayflower logic. The idea that Americanness is not simply a creed but a legacy, something passed down rather than opted into. That turn became visible in the Trump era and hardened by 2024.JD Vance has argued that America is not merely an idea but a people shaped by history, religion, and culture. It is a claim that sounds descriptive but functions as a gate. It asks not only what you believe, but where you come from, who came before you, and how comfortably you fit into a civilisational story.It is against this backdrop that Vivek Ramaswamy’s interventions at conservative gatherings like Turning Point USA became so charged. Ramaswamy insisted that Americanness is binary, not hierarchical. That no citizen is more American than another. That the Constitution does not recognise first-class and second-class belonging. When a Hindu son of immigrants has to defend civic nationalism to a movement increasingly nostalgic for inherited identity, the tension becomes impossible to ignore.The scrutiny surrounding Usha Vance makes the same point more quietly. Her presence at the centre of power has been treated not as routine, but as something that needs explanation. Her faith, her background, her marriage have been discussed in ways that suggest belonging is still conditional, still subject to review.This is why the hate machine matters. It is not merely about prejudice or online abuse. It is about a country renegotiating the boundaries of itself, and doing so at the precise moment when Indian-Americans, long convinced that assimilation was enough, discover that the definition of American is once again up for debate.The White Castle dreamNone of this is unique to Indian-Americans. That is the uncomfortable truth beneath the outrage.Every group that has passed through America’s gates has been told, at some point, that it has overstayed its welcome. Irish Catholics were once warned that their churches threatened Protestant civilisation. Jews were caricatured as alien elites who controlled finance and corrupted culture. Italians were dismissed as criminals, Chinese migrants as contaminants, Japanese-Americans as permanent suspects. Each wave was tolerated for its labour and distrusted for its difference. Each was told, in different ways, that assimilation was conditional.The White Castle dream was never a guarantee. It was a hope.Indian-Americans believed, perhaps longer than most, that utility would buy permanence. That if you studied hard enough, worked long enough, stayed legal enough, success would eventually dissolve suspicion. That you would arrive at the point where your presence no longer needed justification. Where you could be ordinary. Where you could waste time.What the last few years have revealed is not that Indian-Americans are uniquely targeted, but that they have finally reached the stage every visible minority reaches: the point where success itself becomes the provocation. This is why the Hanuman statue matters, and why it unsettled people far more than its defenders expected.Hanuman is not a god of conquest. He is not a god of domination. In Indian tradition, he is the embodiment of strength without arrogance, devotion without spectacle, power held in service rather than display. He is remembered not for ruling kingdoms but for carrying mountains, crossing oceans, and choosing humility over triumph. Hanuman kneels even when he is invincible. He exists to remind power of its duty.For generations, Hindu practice in America mirrored that ethos. Discreet. Contained. Basements and borrowed halls. Faith folded neatly into private life so as not to make anyone uncomfortable. Hanuman was worshipped quietly, kept small, kept safe.A 90-foot statue breaks that grammar.It was a visible reminder – at least to the more rabid adherents of MAGA – that there was an immigrant who wasn’t being polite. And that, more than theology, is what triggered the backlash. The discomfort was not about idolatry or zoning laws. It was about the collapse of an unspoken rule: you may belong here, but only if you remain invisible.The White Castle dream was never about hamburgers. It was about the promise that one day you would not have to perform gratitude or manage your difference. That your faith, your culture, your presence would not be treated as an interruption.What the Hanuman moment reveals is that Indian-Americans are discovering, late and painfully, what every other group eventually learns. Acceptance is not a destination you reach by working harder. It is a condition that must be defended once visibility arrives. And visibility, once achieved, cannot be put back in the basement.","summary":"Not to White Castle specifically, but to a sort of ‘white castle’: where you are so integrated and assimilated that you are considered a beacon of society, an upstanding member of the Shining City on the Top of The Hill.

In a video shared to TikTok on December 29, Hope Walz said, “I’ll be honest in saying, having the entire right-wing infrastructure launch a hate and bot campaign against you and your family, really sucks.“ Newsweek has contacted a representative for Hope Walz outside of regular working hours via email for comment. Why It Matters Tim Walz was Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate on the Democratic ticket in 2024. The eldest child of Tim Walz, Hope, made multiple appearances on the campaign trail with her father, with content she shared regularly going viral. Hope Walz herself does not work in politics, but following the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024, she amassed more than half a million followers on TikTok, sharing content which her followers have used as a how-to guide on how to navigate Trump’s second term. Hope Walz’s video comes amid a mounting fraud scandal in Minnesota, which in turn has seen a significant amount of criticism leveled at her father. The scandal erupted after more than 60 people were convicted over involvement with stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a federally funded nutrition program during the coronavirus pandemic, which involved the nonprofit “Feeding Our Future.“ The fraud case has drawn criticism from Republicans and the Trump administration. The case has become culturally fraught: 82 of the 92 defendants are Somali Americans, as per The Associated Press. Trump referred to Somali Americans as “garbage,“ and accused Minnesota’s Somali population of “ripping off“ the state, as the case began to make national news. Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz reacts with his daughter Hope Walz after accepting the Democratic vice presidential nomination on stage during the third day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 21, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. What To Know Speaking in the video, which as of press time has been viewed over 140,000 times, Hope Walz emphasized that she is a private citizen, but has received what she described as an “extreme“ and “overwhelming“ volume of direct messages, emails and comments, which she said were “peddling propaganda,“ and “pushing agendas.“ “I guess, with this administration and at this point in time, harassing people on the internet is OK,“ she said. She then shared a warning about the impact that negative online comments of this ilk can have. “This is how people get hurt,“ she said. “It really is.“ “I honestly never thought it was going to be me,“ she added. Hope Walz highlighted that she has a “great support system,“ and said that she is “very confident in who I am as a person and the work I do.“ “But living in like a post-truth world is really scary,“ she said. Hope Walz has regularly spoken out against Trump, the administration, ICE raids, and recently called Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, “embarrassing and gross.“ Beyond sharing political content, Walz shares outfit videos and sports related content. It’s not the first time that she has spoken about bots on her TikTok. In a video posted on December 4, she said, “The bots on this app lately are insane.“ In that video, she referenced the Minnesota fraud fallout and the response from the Trump administration. “I’ve literally never had so many bots in my comments. I don’t know, I think it’s because Trump decided that Minnesota is something he’s gonna go after and be, like, extremely racist to a really awesome community in Minnesota.“ While Hope Walz did not explicitly reference the fraud scandal in this most recent TikTok video, social media users have interpreted her comments as a reference to that fallout. Hope Walz has comments turned off on her videos. What People Are Saying Hope Walz, speaking in the TikTok video: “I am hopeful for the future, we have a lot of work to do to like get to a point where people don’t just believe what their leader tells them to and like spin reality to fit that, and instead like have empathy and critical thinking. But yeah, I’m gonna continue to do my own thing, I just felt the need to say that.“ Tim Walz, addressing the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal, on December 12: “We are a state that chooses not to let people go hungry or homeless or uneducated. However, that generosity has been taken advantage of by an organized group of fraudsters and criminals. Minnesota’s longstanding high standards of integrity of public funds go hand in hand with a culture of generosity. You can’t have one without the other.“ Gunther Eagleman, a right-wing political commentator who has over 1 million followers on X, in a post on X: “Tim Walz’s daughter Hope is now LOSING HER MIND after the entirety of the internet is LASHING OUT over the massive fraud discovered by Nick Shirley. She claims it’s all a “hate and bot campaign.“ Americans HATE corruption and will speak out!“ Brian Krassenstein, a left-wing political commentator, in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times: “Hope Walz hits the nail on the head here. The people pretending to be concerned with fraud and somehow blame Walz for it are the ones who literally voted for fraud.“ Eric Daughtery, a media personality and right-wing commentator, in a post on X viewed over 400,000 times: “Fraud Father Tim Walz's daughter is now FURIOUSLY accusing MAGA of stoking violence by exposing Somali fraud under Tim's watch.“ President Donald Trump on Truth Social: “Minnesota, under Governor Waltz, is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity. I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota. Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!“ What Happens Next?

Ted Cruz and former Democratic Congressman Collin Allred raised a collective $192 million. \n\nWhile Allred lost by eight points, supporters say Crockett has a few tricks up her sleeves. \n\n‘Psyop campaign’ \n\nCrockett may be a phenom on left, but among Republicans she’s dismissed as a joke. \n\n“It's a weird choice,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) told Raw Story. “Collin Allred’s obviously a better candidate.”\n\nCrockett’s entrance into the Senate race seems to have scared off Allred, a more moderate, former three-term Congressman — which Republicans claim was by design. \n\n“So there was a, what we would call a psyop campaign,” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) laughed while puffing a stogie on the Capitol steps. “I was out there doing everything I can, encouraging Jasmine to run. \n\n“They're trying to just anoint her, the Democrat, the far-left nuts have anointed her, and I think it's fantastic for Texas. That just says that they've lost their way. The Democrats have lost their way. They have been overtaken by the far-left nuts.” \n\n“We've got them up here. You know who they are. Jasmine's one of them, but Texas ain't going to put up with any of her bullsh—. They're just not.\n\n“We're really, really excited. We're excited. I was going to send Jasmine $100 bucks to say, ‘Get in this damn thing because you're going to be great.’” \n\nRepublicans report President Donald Trump is especially eager to defeat Crockett, one of his biggest critics. \n\n“You guys are kind of, like, chomping at the bit, right?” Raw Story pressed McCaul. \n\n“Yeah, I think some are. I think the president really is,” McCaul said. “I'm more worried about the primary.” \n\nDemocrats are praying the GOP primary descends into an expensive MAGA-establishment brawl, as four-term Sen. John Cornyn fights off controversial Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. \n\n‘Not very smart’\n\nCrockett’s only been in the Senate contest a couple weeks, and already Texas Democrats are calling foul. \n\n“What do you make of all these Republicans kind of laughing her off in kind of racist tones, it seems?” Raw Story asked. \n\n“Yeah. I think it's crazy,” Congressman Veasey said. \n\nBesides Crockett’s national appeal, Veasey says Republicans are kidding themselves if they think the contest is in the bag. \n\n“This is going to be a good year for Democrats,” Veasey said. “For them to look past any of our candidates is not very smart.”\n\nBesides Crockett’s appeal to her Dallas-area constituents, the Congresswoman is a rising star on the left who has been tapped to help rally national Democratic opposition to Trump 2.0. \n\nCrockett’s appeared with former Vice President Kamala Harris in six states, including swing states. Many of her congressional colleagues report she’s a hit with their voters too. \n\n“She's been incredible in motivating the base in my district,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — a member of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive “Squad” — told Raw Story while waiting for a Capitol elevator. “My base love her. The Democratic base in Michigan love her.” \n\nStill, Crockett has rubbed many in her party’s old guard the wrong way. \n\nFor example, she’s one of roughly 100 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, but one of the group’s two former chais, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), doesn’t have anything nice to say about her. \n\n“What has Jasmine Crockett meant to the party?” Raw Story asked. \n\n“I don't have much of a comment around that area,” said Pocan. “I don't usually deal in these areas.” \n\nPocan endorsed four Wisconsin candidates last month and backed Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris in their presidential runs.\n\nLike it or hate it, there’s a changing of the guard afoot in today’s Democratic Party, and to enlivened young voters, Crockett’s become a face of this new, restive and more progressive generation. \n\n‘Extremely effective’ \n\nCrockett has become known for melting the internet, by going toe to toe with the likes of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and even President Trump.\n\nBut she’s a lawyer by trade. \n\nHer colleagues see her serious side, but when the party’s locked out of all power across Washington, there’s little else Crockett can do but attack, attack, attack. \n\n“Has she been a serious lawmaker up here?” Raw Story asked. “Like, she's always going viral, but that's all people really know.” \n\n“In the minority, it's hard to get much passed at all,” said Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-MD). “Certainly, from the oversight perspective, she's been extremely effective.”\n\nWhile Crockett’s ruffled feathers across the proverbial aisle, she’s growing on some veteran members of the Congressional Black Caucus. \n\n“Clearly, she has a good voice that gets a lot of attention,” Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) told Raw Story. “They have some performative members, and so we need to be able to meet them.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — Republicans from Austin to the White House have been snickering since viral progressive phenom Jasmine Crockett announced her bid for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats.\n\n“It's going to be very entertaining,” Rep.

Averse to unpleasant candor, the Democrats’ governing body functions more like a PR firm than a political organization devoted to grassroots capacities for winning elections. The party’s leaders pose as immune from critique, even if they have led the party to disaster.\n\nUnwilling to depart from the party establishment’s culture of conformity, the DNC has remained under the Biden-Harris shadow throughout 2025. Release of an official autopsy might have shown that party leaders actually want to encourage public discourse about the missteps that enabled Donald Trump to become president again. But the DNC is proceeding as if there’s nothing to be learned from the tragic debacle of 2024 that its leaders don’t already know – and they don’t need to share their purported wisdom with anyone else.\n\nIn early December, the DNC featured Kamala Harris as the keynote speaker at the semi-annual meeting of its 450 members. Predictably, her formulaic speech received a standing ovation. No matter that in recent months, on the long book tour promoting her campaign memoir, Harris was notably incapable of responding with any coherence to questions about why as vice-president she claimed that Biden was fit to run for president in 2024 or, for that matter, to be president for another four years.\n\nThe DNC’s refusal to release its autopsy is in keeping with a pattern of evading hard truths that led virtually every elected Democrat in Washington to go along with President Biden’s insistence on running for re-election until his awful debate performance in late June 2024. Meanwhile, big majorities of Democratic voters were continually telling pollsters that they didn’t want Biden to run again.\n\nAn autopsy report with any value would not dodge such matters. Nor would it elide sensible questions about how much money went to insider consultants and advertising contractors as the Harris campaign managed to spend $1.5bn during the hallowed 107 days of her presidential campaign last year. An autopsy might also probe the moral and political consequences of nominee Harris continuing to toe the Biden line for huge arms shipments to Israel while its military continued to slaughter Palestinian civilians in Gaza; during the campaign and afterward, polling showed that she would have gained a substantial boost of votes by calling for an arms embargo.\n\nMonths ago, news accounts surfaced that release of the DNC’s autopsy would be postponed until after the November election. The draft autopsy reportedly avoided casting blame on Biden or Harris or other Democratic leaders. But as it turned out, even such a tepid autopsy would be too hot for the DNC leadership to handle.\n\nIn mid-December, when DNC chair Ken Martin announced the decision to withhold the autopsy from public view, his rationale reeked of elitism, perfumed as pragmatism: “Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.” The actual message to the party’s base – including millions of loyal volunteers and small donors – was that they couldn’t be trusted to know what party chiefs have learned from a report based on hundreds of interviews with people in all 50 states. At the DNC, the political calculus is that the basis for sharing such information should be need-to-know, and ordinary Democrats don’t need to.\n\nMartin’s explanation for hiding the autopsy – his claim that winning in the future would be hampered by the “distraction” of assessing the past – is backwards. Public candor about why Democrats lost the White House is not a “distraction” – it’s vital for disrupting the party’s repeated compulsion of making the same mistakes all over again.\n\nA former chair of the progressive caucus in the California Democratic party, Amar Shergill, was cogent when mentioned Martin in this acid X post : “Bury the report that will help Democrats understand how and why they lost.”\n\nThe DNC is now replicating the kind of tacit disdain for rank-and-file Democrats that fueled the 2024 catastrophe. Despite the lopsided poll numbers against Biden running for re-election, the attitude from the Biden White House and congressional Democrats was: we know much better than Democratic voters what they should want.\n\nDays before the DNC announcement about ditching its autopsy, my colleagues at RootsAction released our own in-depth autopsy, assessing what went wrong in 2024 and how to make crucial changes for the midterms and 2028. Written by journalist Christopher D Cook, the autopsy (“How Democrats Lost the White House”) focuses on these key points:\n\n Voter disenchantment: Losing 6.8 million voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 proved pivotal in the close 2024 election. Harris’s inability to mobilize those pro-Biden voters was a massive failure.\n\n Biden’s betrayal: Biden’s stubborn decision to seek re-election, and his refusal to step aside until very late in the process, robbed Democratic voters of open primaries and undermined Democrats’ chances.\n\n Abandoning the working-class base: With millions of Americans feeling desperate because of rising costs, the Harris campaign lost this Democratic base by bowing to corporate donors’ interests and failing to challenge the impact of corporate greed in escalating inflation.\n\n The Gaza effect: Harris lost many voters – especially young people, Arab-Americans and Muslim Americans, with sizable consequences in Michigan and other swing states – due to her refusal to indicate any openness to shifting her policy position on Israel and Palestine.\n\n Losing young voters: Extensive evidence shows a huge drop-off in Democratic support among young voters aged 18-29.\n\nSome of the bleakest findings in the RootsAction autopsy about the 2024 election involve similarities with the findings in the RootsAction autopsy about the 2016 election, “The Democratic Party in Crisis”. On matters such as the party standard-bearer’s support for corporate power and militarism, as well as failure to connect with young people and the working class while pandering to mythical troves of moderate Republican voters, the names Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris could often be swapped with complete accuracy.\n\nAs public scrutiny of the Democratic party’s recent history continues to be off the table at the DNC, one factor is its chair’s view that vigorous intraparty debate is unseemly. Before becoming DNC chair, Martin had told me on two occasions (once in 2019 and more politely early this year when he was making calls before the chair election) that he doesn’t think Democrats should be criticizing each other in public.\n\nThe future of the Democratic party is crucial because – given the structural realities of the American political system – this party is the only electoral vehicle for ending Republican control of the federal government. Anger and disgust with the Democratic leadership is fully valid. Yet strong progressives like representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Summer Lee and Ro Khanna would not be in Congress if they hadn’t run as “Democrats”.\n\nWhile ousting the Republicans from power is essential, progressives need to be fighting the Democratic party’s power structure that keeps impeding progress on that momentous task. Blockage of the official autopsy is symptomatic of the DNC’s deference to party leaders who engineered the disastrous 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nMartin won the DNC chair job almost a year ago without the support of Democratic heavyweights like Senator Chuck Schumer and representatives Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, who all backed Martin’s main opponent. Martin is not a favorite of many old-guard officials in the upper reaches of the party, and an autopsy with even a modicum of criticism in their direction might have sparked some kind of revolt. Martin opted to avoid any such problem by deep-sixing the autopsy.\n\n“It’s about protecting people who fucked up,” a DNC member told me. “Ken is trying to hold the DNC together. The decision about the autopsy is about trying to keep peace within the party.”\n\nBut a party unable to publicly examine its own failings is unlikely to climb out of the rut that proved so helpful to Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

But there are signs of change","text":"In early December, Andy Kim walked onto the Senate floor to give his first solo speech. By tradition, this is a formal introduction, the chance for a new congressperson to announce what he stands for.\n\nKim, a Democrat from New Jersey, told the story of his father's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease just a few weeks prior. After the appointment, Kim said he sat in his car in shock, replaying the words of the doctor who warned him that his next year was going to be hell.\n\nKim said the costs of care have already been \"catastrophic\" for his family. \"Why is it so hard to provide care in this country?\" he asked. \"Why is providing care so insanely complicated?\"\n\nThe takeaway: Family caregiving is so difficult that even a U.S. senator is overwhelmed.\n\nAnd even a senator doesn't know how to fix it.\n\nThere's consensus that something needs to change. Kim chose to focus this high-profile speech on family caregiving because it resonates: An estimated 63 million Americans currently care for elderly or chronically ill adults, according to a survey from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving. \n\nAnd 79% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats agree that the government needs to do more to help people caring for their family members. In 2024, both presidential candidates promised to do something about it.\n\nSince then, though, nothing much has happened at the national level. But a shift is underway, say policy-watchers and advocates for caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic made family caregiving more visible and changed its image. Since then, care is increasingly perceived as a labor and economic issue — a social concern rather than just a family problem. \n\nA broad coalition called Care Can't Wait brings together labor, aging and disability interests. It is pushing to put family caregiving on the national agenda by lobbying policymakers, organizing events, and raising awareness.\n\nIn the last few years, state governments have begun implementing policies to help caregivers, such as tax breaks, an innovative public long-term care insurance program, and new job protections for working caregivers. State-level policy experiments like these often build momentum for national-level change, say policy experts.\n\n\"There's been huge momentum in the last five years that I have not seen in the last 20,\" says Alison Barkoff, professor of health law at George Washington University and former assistant secretary of aging at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"I feel optimism that this is setting the stage for something big.\"\n\nGrowing needs and a patchwork of support\n\nThe number of family caregivers for adults has already doubled since 2014. And older people are now the nation's fastest-growing age group.\n\nHalf of them will eventually need daily help with even simple tasks like cooking, getting dressed and keeping house. Some will need much more extensive care.\n\nThat task will mostly fall to family and friends, because most people cannot afford to pay someone else to do it. Forty hours a week of paid caregiving help runs about $71,000 a year. The average annual nursing home bill is $110,000. Medicare covers almost none of it.\n\nFamily caregivers spend an average of $7,242 in out-of-pocket expenses every year, an AARP survey found in 2021. About a third dip into retirement savings or take on credit card debt to cover expenses like assisted living facility fees, home modifications, medical bills or adult day care.\n\n\"The cost of long-term care is exponentially higher than things like childcare that get far more attention in national media,\" says Nicole Jorwic, chief program officer at Caring Across Generations, an advocacy group focused on care.\n\nCurrently, there's no nationwide system for family caregivers to find out what help might be available. Eligibility rules vary widely, and caregiving programs or assistance are administered by a profusion of entities, from state and local governments to the Veterans Administration and nonprofits. The programs do not connect with one another, so caregivers must research each separately.\n\nAnd national policymakers have not acted to address the cash crunch or knit up the isolated sources of support into an actual safety net.\n\nThe most consequential caregiving-related federal action in 2025 was to trim nearly $1 trillion from the Medicaid budget over the next 10 years, which experts predict will translate into cuts for some of the roughly 4.5 million family caregivers paid through the program. \"Even the patchwork that did exist is getting shredded,\" says Jorwic.\n\nThe states step in\n\nThe picture is more promising at the state level. Across the nation, lawmakers are trying out policies to defray costs or provide new forms of help. These experiments are rapidly spreading.\n\nIn 2023, Oklahoma and Nebraska were the first states to adopt tax credits for family caregivers. Since then, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota and South Carolina have followed suit. Another dozen or so states are discussing similar bills, says Megan O'Reilly, vice president of health and family at AARP, which advocates for these laws. The credits reimburse family caregivers for expenses like home modifications or paid help, usually capped at around $2,000 to $3,000 a year.\n\nSome states also subsidize respite care in the form of short-term paid caregiving or institutional care, so that family caregivers can take a few days off or deal with other obligations.\n\nAbout 60% of family caregivers also work; many states are modifying employment laws to help them manage both responsibilities. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires certain employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, covers less than half of all American employees.\n\nIn the last few years, 13 states and Washington, D.C., passed laws requiring employers to offer up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Similar programs in Maine, Delaware and Minnesota are rolling out now. In these programs, payroll taxes cover the costs, much like unemployment insurance. In ten other states, including Texas and Virginia, paid leave is optional, and employers can add the benefit by buying commercial insurance.\n\nIn other states, laws that permit caregivers to take paid or unpaid leave now include in-laws, domestic partners, or even close friends. Other states, counties and cities like Delaware, Florida's Monroe County, and Battle Creek, Michigan created rules to explicitly protect against workplace discrimination, so workers can't be fired or demoted because of their caregiving responsibilities.\n\nThe most ambitious state caregiver support program to date rolls out in the next few days. In 2023, Washington workers started paying into a fund for universal long-term care insurance. In 2026, qualified workers will be able to tap into this pool to pay for in-home care, home modifications, and even meals and transportation, up to a lifetime limit of $36,000. Seven other states are considering similar programs, including big ones like California and New York.\n\nAltogether, one or more of these policies apply to the majority of the nation's caregivers, covering 25 states and 31 cities.\n\nThe care movement to come\n\nThese new laws add more patches to the patchwork. At the federal level, administrative tweaks to Medicaid rules in the last few years have also made it easier for certain caregivers to get training and help. But a truly comprehensive caregiver support system will require vision, big-ticket policies and big budgets, say the policy experts and advocates who monitor long-term care.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and John Moolenaar, R-Mich., introduced a bill to create a national long-term care insurance program to cover catastrophic costs of care. Payments would kick in only after the family covers the bills for at least a year. The idea is not only to help families, but to reinvigorate the long-term care insurance market, which currently covers only about 5% of the cost of care nationwide. This bill is supported by the National Alliance for Caregiving, among others. It was reintroduced in 2025.\n\nThe Care Can't Wait coalition's goals include a comprehensive paid family and medical leave law that would cover all working caregivers.\n\nThe coalition's biggest ticket item: Expanding Medicare to pay for long-term care, an idea that's been repeatedly proposed ever since the law was written in 1965. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign floated a modest version of this plan, with an estimated pricetag of $40 billion a year.\n\nAmbitious national efforts like these might not currently be realistic, advocates concede. But the sheer number of struggling family caregivers and the value of their work — estimated at $600 billion a year in 2021 — will force change, especially as older and disabled populations continue to grow.\n\n\"As a society, we are at a pivot point,\" says Jorwic. \"Economic forces are going to push solutions.\" The ultimate aim is to foster a new care movement — what Kim called for in his speech.\n\nThere are already subtle changes, says O'Reilly. When she and other AARP representatives meet with legislators, they no longer need to explain what family caregiving is and why it matters. Most often, someone on the staff has personal experience with it themselves.\n\n\"People are connecting with the issue, and sharing their own stories,\" she says. \"That's a transformation from where we started this work.\"\n\nKat McGowan is a freelance writer in California focused on caregiving.","summary":"Family members carry the burden and costs of caring for America's aging population.

It Won’t Give Up Its Influence.","text":"The pro-Israel lobby is confronting a growing problem. \n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee waged a proud and public campaign to assert its dominance last cycle — sinking more than $100 million into the 2024 elections to oust critics of Israel from Congress. AIPAC spent more on elections that cycle than any other individual single-issue interest group; celebrated its super PAC, United Democracy Project, as “one of the largest bipartisan super PACs in America”; and took credit for endorsing 361 pro-Israel candidates who prevailed in hundreds of races.\n\nThat success met with public disgust with Israel’s genocide in Gaza and drove a massive backlash, fueling a growing movement to eradicate AIPAC’s influence and propel insurgent candidates to Congress on pledges to refuse the pro-Israel lobby’s support. Now, as the 2026 midterms approach, AIPAC and its preferred candidates have pulled back from the aggressive electoral strategy they pursued last time.\n\nNone of this is to say that AIPAC is planning to let its influence slip away. While the group has not yet publicly endorsed any new candidates this cycle, there’s still time, and it’s working behind closed doors to boost its preferred candidates’ campaigns. Earlier this month, for example, AIPAC’s board president held a fundraiser for an Illinois House candidate who has said publicly that she isn’t seeking the group’s endorsement. In another district in the same state, AIPAC donors rallied around a real estate mogul’s congressional campaign.\n\nThe moves represent the latest in a series of strategic adaptations AIPAC has made in recent years while navigating a shifting political landscape on issues related to Israel. \n\n“They are fully aware their brand is in the toilet,” said former Rep. Marie Newman, D-Ill., whom pro-Israel donors helped oust in 2022.\n\nBy this time last cycle, AIPAC had already endorsed most of its slate. But with a growing field of candidates running on rejecting AIPAC money and attacking those who take it, the group is returning to a quieter strategy that it used for years to build its influence.\n\n“AIPAC is thought of toxically across the nation,” Newman said. “On doors, when you knock and go to canvasses and go to speaking engagements here, standard rank-and-file centrist Dems are like, ‘No, no more AIPAC and no more corporate PACs.’”\n\nMerely rejecting AIPAC money will not be enough to serve as the new standard for progressive candidates for long, said Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. \n\nSwearing off the group’s cash “doesn’t mean anything,” on its own, Friedman said. “What is going to matter is where candidates, or incumbents who are trying to return to office, where they stand on issues. As it becomes clear that AIPAC is going to work around the ‘people don’t want to take our money’ and find other ways to support candidates, it’s really going to be a question of, where do people stand on what are in some ways litmus-test issues for AIPAC?”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have picked up on the anti-AIPAC trend. During a press tour as rumors swirl about a potential run for president, Newsom said earlier this month that he won’t take money from the group. In October, Newsom told the podcast Higher Learning, “I haven’t thought about AIPAC in — it’s interesting, you’re like the first to bring up AIPAC in years.”\n\nDespite Newsom’s statements, his record on Israel policy leaves questions about how far he’d go to ally himself with the Palestinian cause. He’s celebrated accolades from far-right pro-Israel groups like the Anti-Defamation League, and his last two public statements on anniversaries of the October 7 attacks did not mention Palestinians killed. Newsom did not call for a ceasefire in Gaza until March 2024, after both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris did so.\n\nWhile some pro-Palestine advocates applauded Newsom for vetoing an online hate speech bill they said would have targeted politically protected speech, Newsom did not cite those concerns as part of his decision. California’s powerful tech industry had also hoped he would reject the bill. \n\nNewsom is also facing criticism over a controversial bill he signed into law in October to address antisemitism in California schools, which a coalition of teachers associations, civil rights organizations, and interfaith groups argue would censor legitimate criticism of Israel and pro-Palestine voices. Opponents are suing to stop the law from going into effect on January 1.\n\nAnticipating criticism, other candidates have kept their policy stances regarding Israel quiet. George Hornedo, who’s challenging Democratic Rep. André Carson in Indiana, had a secret pro-Israel policy page on his campaign website this summer that’s since been taken down. Hornedo has not said publicly whether or not he’ll take AIPAC money, but he told The Intercept that his campaign “rejects corporate PAC money.”\n\n“I’m not coordinating with, nor am I relying on or seeking, financial intervention from national organizations in this race. This campaign is focused on building support directly here in Indianapolis, not inviting national groups to shape or define the race,” Hornedo said in a statement. “On Gaza, my position is straightforward. Gaza should be flooded with humanitarian aid and the U.S. should not provide offensive weapons to any country unless their use complies with international humanitarian law.”\n\n“We’re seeing an uptick in Democrats who forswear AIPAC money because it’s become an electoral liability,” said Hamid Bendaas, communications director for the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project. “But it’s unclear if they will keep that standard by rejecting support from other organizations — chiefly but not limited to Democratic Majority for Israel — who have similar policy agendas to AIPAC, especially regarding more weapons to Israel.”\n\nIn its current approach, AIPAC has returned to a strategy in previous races when it funneled money to candidates through other vehicles to keep its name — and the criticism it’s increasingly drawing — out of the race. AIPAC donors have supported its picks by giving to other dark-money groups that outwardly have nothing to do with Israel policy, like the political action committee 314 Action, which helps elects scientists and last cycle flooded the campaign of Rep. Maxine Dexter, D-Ore. — whom AIPAC never formally endorsed.\n\n“We know AIPAC knows their brand is toxic,” Newman said. “So much so, they are taking their brand out of campaigns and funneling their money through other PACs and donors such as 314 science, DMFI, several small PACs, and of course individual AIPAC members who give as a donor because the candidates can say they received money from donors, not AIPAC, to avoid association with AIPAC.”\n\nAIPAC isn’t necessarily backing off under fire — it’s returning to the way it operated before it started spending directly on elections in the 2022 cycle.\n\nPrior to launching its super PAC and regular affiliated PAC, AIPAC was active in politics for more than half a century, working quietly in the halls of Congress and around Washington, D.C., to establish one of the most successful lobbying apparatuses in the country. First launched as a machine to counter negative press coverage of Israel, AIPAC quickly expanded its focus to influencing U.S. policy toward Israel. It positioned itself as a key source of information on Middle East issues for members of Congress and built out regional offices across the country, energizing a network of local pro-Israel activists. AIPAC has routinely lobbied presidents and congressional offices, funded trips to Israel for members of Congress and hosted members to address its annual policy conference, extending its reach into the halls of power without touching electoral politics.\n\nThe approach was hugely successful, allowing AIPAC to maintain the bipartisan pro-Israel consensus on the hill for decades. The group had long said it would never launch a PAC — but that changed as a growing number of candidates began running on criticizing unconditional U.S. military support for Israel in the late 2010s. AIPAC then began spending on campaigns, starting with funding ads from Democratic Majority for Israel, attacking Bernie Sanders in Nevada during his 2020 presidential primary campaign.\n\nIn 2021, the group launched AIPAC PAC, which allowed it to wade into congressional races; shortly after, it officially launched its super PAC, United Democracy Project. The group drew scrutiny in the 2022 cycle for endorsing 37 Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“Clearly, AIPAC knows exactly how toxic they are to Democratic Party voters who see them as a right-wing extremist lobby, championing a right-wing agenda, and funded by right-wing megadonors trying to buy our elections,” said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. “Voters are not interested in politicians who say one thing to their constituents and another to billionaire Republican donors, but AIPAC excels at finding candidates eager to reject authenticity and embrace moral cowardice if it means a seat in Congress.”","url":"https://theintercept.com/2025/12/30/aipac-campaigns-elections-israel-congress/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1133492421-e1766079504843.jpg?fit=5000%2C2500","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 11:00:00","author":"Akela Lacy","authors":["Akela Lacy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":390043922,"title":"The Daily Mail+ Power List of 50 women over 50: From stars of TV to titans of business and extraordinary campaigners making a real difference... our definitive guide to the women who deserve all the plaudits","text":"2025 has been a standout year for women over 50. These powerful females have been winning in everything from television and politics to sport and medicine. In fact there has been no better time to be female and 50-plus.\n\nAccording to Government data there are more and more women working in the second half of their lives – going up over 14 per cent since 2000. In no particular order we celebrate the incredible achievements of all those pioneering scientists, straight-talking campaigners and brilliant entertainers who are over-50 and enjoying every single second of their moment in the spotlight.\n\n1. Claudia Winkleman, TV presenter, 53\n\nIt’s not as if the self-described ‘tiny orange lady’ with the heavy fringe, panda eyes and pale lips was an unknown before this year. After all, she started appearing on our screens back in the late 1990s and, after stints on the spin-off show and the Sunday night results show, has been hosting Strictly Come Dancing since 2014.\n\nBut this year the addition of celebrities to the Bafta-winning Traitors series drew yet more fans to the show — and to her (not to mention to her Highlands-inspired wardrobe). So perhaps it was little wonder that, alongside Strictly co-presenter, Tess Daly, she was awarded an MBE for her contribution to broadcasting in the King’s Birthday Honours.\n\nWith her and Daly leaving the show, she’s free to pursue other projects, and rumours in the industry are that she’s in talks about her own chat show, a perfect vehicle for her signature combination of wit and warmth — watch this space.\n\n2. Baroness Heather Hallett, 76, former Court of Appeal judge\n\nGiven how much she’s achieved in her career to date, you wouldn’t have blamed Baroness Hallett for deciding that rather than chairing the UK’s Covid-19 Inquiry, she would just hang out in the House of Lords (she’s been a Life Peer since 2019).\n\nSince qualifying as a barrister in the early 1970s, she’s gone on to become one of the highest-ranking women in the judiciary, serving as vice president of the criminal division and overseeing everything from terrorism cases to the 7/7 inquests with calm, razor-sharp authority.\n\nHer calm demeanour, crisp questions, no-nonsense tone and visible empathy made The Rt Hon Baroness Heather Hallett DBE (to give her her proper title) the perfect choice to hold ministers, advisers and experts to account, with the damning conclusion that the UK pandemic response was ‘too little, too late’. In an era of bluster, Hallett’s silk-gloved steel has been a masterclass in public service — precise, principled and quietly fearless.\n\n3. Sarina Wiegman, 56, football manager\n\nThe Dutch dynamo is the woman who has transformed the Lionesses into the national football team (apparently there is an England men’s team, too) and this year cemented her status as the most successful England football manager ever.\n\nHaving previously captained her country and managed the Netherlands to a Euros win in 2017 and a World Cup final in 2019, she crossed the North Sea in 2021 and a year later saw England raise the trophy at the 2022 Euros.\n\nIn 2023 the team were runners up in the World Cup and this year she guided them to a second consecutive Euros win in Switzerland (and her third on the trot) — the first time any England senior side has bagged the top spot in any major competition abroad.\n\nLittle wonder she was named the world’s best women’s coach at the Ballon d’Or football awards, cementing her status as the FA’s most prized asset and, frankly, UK national treasure in a tracksuit – even made an honorary dame for her services.\n\n4. Maria Balshaw, 55, museum director\n\nDirector of Tate (the first female one ever) since 2017, with responsibility for all four galleries and their global reputation, this former academic made her name transforming Manchester’s Whitworth and Manchester Art Gallery. She oversaw their award‑winning expansions, proving regional museums could be both daring and deeply rooted in their communities — and picking up a CBE in 2015 for her work.\n\nFresh from publishing her book last year — Gathering of Strangers: Why Museums Matter — Balshaw helped Tate Modern celebrate its quarter-century in May and, more broadly, has doubled down on her ambition of transforming the galleries from hushed and stuffy temples into more widely accessible spaces. Her aim is to curate museums that are more inclusive, and more reflective of the world around them. To this end she continues to champion both access to all — with £5 tickets for under-25s — and a range of shows covering, this year, everything from Nigerian modernism and feminist surrealism to radical new media.\n\n5, 6, and 7. Marion Calder, 55, Trina Budge, 54, and Susan Smith, 53, campaigners\n\nThe trio — an NHS administrator, a farmer and a former fund manager — met on Mumsnet, united by their worries about how gender recognition reforms would affect biological women with regard to public board quotas in Scotland. The group they co-founded in 2018, For Women Scotland, shot to the top of the news agenda this year when their challenge to the Scottish Government reached the UK Supreme Court, culminating in April with the announcement by Lord Hodge that, in law, ‘sex’ refers only to ‘biological sex’ – a landmark ruling with significant implications not only for public board quotas, but for women’s single sex spaces throughout the UK.\n\nDespite being lauded by JK Rowling as ‘extraordinary’, Calder, Budge and Smith say they are just ‘ordinary women’ – though Calder does concede that Rowling has a point when she also calls them ‘tenacious’, admitting ’anger us enough [and] we will just keep going’.\n\n8. Julia Donaldson, 77, children’s author\n\nEven if you haven’t read to a child in the last 30 years, chances are you’ve come across the rhyming stories of Julia Donaldson. Her modern classics — The Gruffalo, Room on the Broom, and Zog — have turned reluctant readers into devoted bookworms, and netted her an MBE and a CBE, as well as the post of Children’s Laureate.\n\nAfter studying Drama and French at Bristol, she moved from publishing and teaching into writing songs for children’s TV, before one of them – A Squash and a Squeeze – became her first picture book.\n\nSince then she has written more than a hundred books and in January 2025 it was announced that the number of copies she had shifted catapulted her into the position of Britain’s best-selling author, above JK Rowling, since records began. With total sales now estimated to be more than 50million books, a live tour of her new book Paper Chase, and another story, The Scarecrows’ Wedding, the BBC’s big animation for New Year’s Day, her star’s not waning any time soon.\n\n9. The Queen, 78, royal advocate\n\nA long-time campaigner against violence against women, it was revealed this year that Queen Camilla had personal experience of sexual assault. In a book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, it was revealed the Queen told Boris Johnson that, as a teenager, she had used her shoe to fight off a man who attempted to sexually assault her on a train.\n\nSources at the palace suggest she was reluctant to talk about it, preferring to focus on the victims she now works with. Last year’s ITV documentary Behind Closed Doors showcased her commitment to this work, highlighting the issues involved with domestic abuse. And she’s hardly taken her foot off the gas this year.\n\nFrom opening a new ‘healing garden’ at the Asian Women’s Resource Centre in London, where she met women recovering from abuse and highlighted the specialist support needed for black and minoritised communities, to hosting events that bring together victim‑survivors, advocates and banking leaders to spotlight economic abuse and push for better systems in finance and law, she continues to speak up for the women who can’t speak for themselves, and to insist that domestic abuse is everyone’s business.\n\n10. Dame Esther Rantzen, 85, campaigner\n\nDiagnosed with stage‑four lung cancer in 2023, the indefatigable crusader was given months to live, until a ‘wonder drug’ gave her more time. Perhaps inevitably for a seasoned campaigner, she has spent this ‘bonus’ time doing what she has always done best: turning personal challenge into public change.\n\nAs the Assisted Dying Bill moved through parliament this year, she became its most recognisable champion, penning letters to every MP, sparring with critics on TV and urging politicians to vote ‘with compassion, not cowardice’.\n\nFrom championing children with Childline to alleviating loneliness for older people with The Silver Line, Dame (since 2015) Esther Rantzen who first found fame as the presenter of That’s Life! has always been one of life’s advocates and has helped millions of people in her lifetime, making her something of the nation’s unofficial agony aunt.\n\n11. Maggie Oliver, 70, campaigner\n\nFormer Greater Manchester Police detective Maggie Oliver is the whistleblower who refused to look away. After years in serious crime, she resigned in 2012 to expose the Rochdale grooming scandal, shining a light on catastrophic failures to protect abused girls and helping inspire the BBC drama Three Girls, which brought the reality of grooming gangs into living rooms across the country.​\n\nIn 2019 she channelled that fury into the Maggie Oliver Foundation, offering legal advocacy and emotional support so adult survivors can, in her words, turn ‘pain into power’.\n\nThis year she has been everywhere: fronting the #TheyKnew campaign and raising funds for strategic legal action against officials who ignored abuse, advising on the Government’s national audit into group child sexual exploitation, and calmly skewering ‘empty promises’ in a succession of TV interviews. More than a decade on, she is still pushing the state to treat victims as witnesses to crimes, not problems to be managed.\n\n12. Dame Joanna Lumley, 79, actor\n\nNearly six decades after her first screen roles, Dame Joanna Lumley is still joyfully over‑employed. While those of a certain age will know her as Purdey in The New Avengers, for another generation she was the champagne‑soaked Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous, (a role she fleetingly reprised alongside co-star Jennifer Saunders at Burberry’s fashion show in September).\n\nBut with two recent roles in some of the most talked-about dramas on screen, she is very definitely back in her natural habitat of scene‑stealing TV comedy, and has undoubtedly endeared herself to anyone hitherto unaware of her genius.\n\nAs well as taking on the role of Felicity, the gloriously imperious mother whose passive aggressive asides could strip paint in BBC One’s Motherland spin‑off Amandaland, she has also joined Netflix hit Wednesday as Grandmama Hester Frump, a magically mischievous matriarch created especially for her and quickly expanded.\n\nFar from easing off, she seems to be treating her late seventies as the start of yet another act.\n\n13. Nieves Barragan Mohacho, 50, chef\n\nSince arriving in London from the Basque Country in the late 1990s with limited English and a head full of flavours, Nieves Barragan Mohacho has quietly rewritten the capital’s Spanish food story. She rose through the ranks at Fino and then Barrafina, where as executive chef she helped it win a Michelin star and turned counter‑top tapas into the hottest ticket in town.\n\nIn 2018 she stepped out on her own with Sabor — which means flavour — in Mayfair, which picked up a Michelin star in its first year and has since become a perennial critics’ favourite for its tour of Spain’s regions, from Galician seafood to Castilian wood‑fired sharing dishes.​\n\n14. Asma Khan, 56, chef\n\nIndian‑born, London‑based Asma Khan has built a career on turning home cooking and sisterhood into restaurant gold. After moving to the UK to study law, she started a supper club in her home that grew into Darjeeling Express, now a Michelin‑Guide‑listed Soho restaurant famed for its all‑female, all‑South‑Asian kitchen of home cooks, rather than classically trained chefs.\n\nAlong the way she became the first British chef featured on Netflix’s Chef’s Table, a UN World Food Programme chef advocate and, in 2024, one of Time’s 100 most influential people.​\n\nThis year she became the first patron of the Sodexo Stop Hunger Foundation, proving that food isn’t just delicious, it can also be used for political good.\n\n15. Ruth Rogers, 77, restaurateur\n\nFor almost four decades, American‑born, London‑made Ruth Rogers has been something of a doyenne of the London food scene. In 1987 she co‑founded the River Cafe on a Hammersmith wharf with her friend Rose Gray, initially as a canteen for her husband Richard Rogers’s architecture practice. The simple, fiercely seasonal menu and light‑filled room soon made it a destination, earning a Michelin star in 1998 and launching the careers of chefs including Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley‑Whittingstall.​\n\nLast year, she opened the River Cafe Cafe, a more affordable offshoot across the garden that serves River Cafe‑grade ingredients at bistro prices — a smart move when times are as tight as they are. Her podcast, Ruthie’s Table 4 is into its fifth season and continues to attract the great and the good, including Kamala Harris and Cate Blanchett — and yet she’s still found the time to squeeze in her new book Squeeze Me a coffee table ode to the humble lemon.\n\n16. Sheila Dillon, 81, food journalist\n\nBritain undoubtedly takes food more seriously now than it did 30 years ago, and you can — in no small part — thank journalist Sheila Dillon for that. Originally from Lancashire, she worked on New York-based magazine, Food Monitor, before joining BBC Radio 4’s The Food Programme where she has helped to turn issues like BSE (commonly known as mad cow disease), GM crops and hospital food from niche worries into national conversations, picking up a shelf of journalism awards and an honorary doctorate along the way.​\n\nIn 2025 she remains at the heart of the UK’s food debate. She has fronted landmark episodes on everything from school dinners and communal dining to the closure of London’s historic wholesale markets and Denmark’s food revolution, and chaired judging for the BBC Food & Farming Awards, which she helped to establish in 2000. She continues to help us see food as more than just pleasure, but as politics, public health and culture too.\n\n17. Anne Mensah, 53, TV executive\n\nMensah is one of those largely behind-the-scenes people whose name you won’t necessarily know but who will undoubtedly have had an impact on your life — and your viewing habits. While she’s now vice president of UK content at Netflix, she’s been a serious player in UK TV for years, starting in script editing and rising through senior drama roles at the BBC and Sky – where she backed projects like Wallander, Patrick Melrose and Chernobyl.\n\nSince 2019 she’s been at Netflix and this year alone her team has delivered global hits such as the award-winning Adolescence and spy thriller Black Doves — not to mention previous hits such as One Day and Baby Reindeer, which led to Netflix picking up six awards at this year’s TV Baftas, as well as Golden Globes and Emmys.\n\nBut it’s not just her shows bagging the gongs. She was honoured with the Impact Award at the Black British Business Awards for championing diverse storytelling and named Outstanding Executive of the Year by the British Broadcasting Guild. And, to ensure what she starts is continued, she champions schemes like Bafta Breakthrough that pulls new talent up behind her.\n\n18. Abi Morgan, 57, screenwriter\n\nFor more than 25 years Abi Morgan has been creating the sort of work that holds your attention, whether on screen or stage. Born in Cardiff, she cut her teeth on the ITV drama series Peak Practice but has gone on to write some of the strongest real-life-inspired dramas on TV — from Sex Traffic and Tsunami: The Aftermath, to the newsroom thriller The Hour – which won her an Emmy. Eric, starring Benedict Cumberbatch was one of hers, as was divorce law saga, The Split — oh, and that adaptation of Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong? Yep, hers too.\n\nIn cinemas you’ll have seen her work through powerful films including Brick Lane, Shame, The Iron Lady and Suffragette. But, on a lighter note, she was responsible for bringing Bridget Jones’s midlife sequel, Mad About The Boy, to the big screen this year.\n\nAs for what’s next, word in the industry is she will adapt and direct her own bestselling memoir, This Is Not a Pity Memoir, for TV. Rest assured, Morgan has plenty more stories to tell.\n\n19. Dame Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, 59, judge\n\nThe daughter of Sikh Punjabi migrants who grew up in Leeds, Dame Bobbie Cheema‑Grubb has spent her career dismantling the idea that the senior judiciary must look and sound a certain way. Called to the Bar in 1989, she became the first Asian woman appointed Junior Treasury Counsel at the Old Bailey, then QC, before in 2015 making history again as the first Asian woman High Court judge. Along the way she helped reshape how courts treat vulnerable witnesses through the influential Raising the Bar report and prosecuted cases involving abusive clergy and corrupt lawyers.​\n\nThis year she has presided over some of the year’s most closely watched criminal trials, including sentencing former Reform UK Wales leader Nathan Gill for taking pro‑Russia bribes. But beyond the bench, she has been honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Women and Diversity in Law Awards, celebrated as a trailblazer whose very presence widens the path for others.\n\n20. Baroness Sue Carr, 61, judge\n\nBaroness Sue Carr of Walton‑on‑the‑Hill has the kind of CV that makes legal historians sit up. In October 2023 she became Lady Chief Justice of England and Wales – the 98th person to hold the role that oversees the entire judiciary but the first woman in the position’s 750‑plus‑year history.\n\nCalled to the Bar in 1987 and taking silk in 2003, she built a formidable commercial and professional negligence practice before moving to High Court judge in 2013, and Lady Justice of Appeal in 2020.​\n\nIn 2025 she’s been deep into the hard graft of modernising an overstretched court system. She has used major speeches and select committee appearances to argue for proper investment in the rule of law, technological reform that does not sideline vulnerable court users, and a judiciary that is more representative of the society it serves. At the same time, she continues to sit on significant appeal cases, making clear that even at the very top, judging – not just administration – remains at the heart of the job.\n\n21. Caroline Hirons, 56, beauty brand founder\n\nDubbed the most powerful woman in the beauty industry because of her ability to make or break a brand (thanks to the faith placed in her by almost 800,000 Instagram followers) Hirons has held almost every job in the business from counter girl to facialist trainer. Her 2020 bestselling debut book (skinCARE: The ultimate no-nonsense guide) scooped Lifestyle Book of the Year and she launched her own brand Skin Rocks three years ago.\n\nThis year she stepped things up another gear with a new book focusing exclusively on teen skincare published in June which became an instant bestseller, a slew of new products, including a hugely impressive hyperpigmentation serum and the launch of Skin Rocks Pro, a range of salon-only products and associated facials. With insiders flagging a January 2026 product as an industry first and one to watch, there’s clearly a lot more to come.\n\n22. Dame Cally Palmer, 67, health leader\n\nDame Cally Palmer has spent more than two decades proving an NHS hospital can be both world‑class and relentlessly patient‑centred. As chief executive of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust since the late 1990s, she has overseen its transformation into one of the top cancer centres globally, pioneering a model that combines NHS care, leading‑edge research with the Institute of Cancer Research and a thriving private patient service that feeds money back into frontline treatment. She picked up a CBE in 2004 and a Damehood in 2020 for services to cancer care.​\n\nSince 2015 she has also served as NHS England’s national cancer director, steering national strategy, securing investment for new drugs and diagnostics and chairing the board.\n\nIn 2025 she announced she would step down from the national role after almost a decade, winning tributes from colleagues for driving earlier diagnosis and improving survival, and freeing her to focus fully on the Marsden’s next chapter – from new research facilities to strengthening its global reputation as a place where patients receive not just treatment, but hope.\n\n23. Kathy Abernethy, 64, menopause specialist\n\nMenopause might have become a part of the national conversation in recent years but specialist nurse Kathy Abernethy has been talking about it for much longer than that. After leading an award‑winning NHS menopause service in London, she co‑founded the British Menopause Society, went on to chair it, and helped write its key handbook on menopause management – the text many GPs now reach for when a baffling symptom walks through the door. She is also author of Menopause: The One Stop Guide, a highly regarded book aimed at helping women make informed decisions about treatment.​\n\nThis year her influence has been as practical as it is political. She co‑leads the Coombe Menopause Clinic in south‑west London, offering evidence‑based HRT, testosterone and non‑hormonal treatments, and continues to run The Menopause Course, an education programme that upskills nurses across the UK. Fresh from serving on the healthcare watchdog’s menopause guideline group and finishing a six‑year stint helping to build start-up Peppy’s clinician‑led digital menopause service, she is now a go‑to commentator pushing for calmer, more balanced conversations about midlife health.\n\n24. Dominique Ludwig, 55, nutritionist\n\nWhile the rest of the country might be talking about Joe Wicks or Tim Spector, those in the know turn to Dominique Ludwig who, with a masters in clinical nutrition from King’s College London and more than 30 years’ experience, has become one of the UK’s most influential nutritionists.\n\nAfter early work in the food industry and clinics in Germany, she now runs Dominique Ludwig Nutrition, heads the nutrition department at the Meyer Clinic in Chichester, West Sussex, and works as a secret weapon nutritionist to high‑profile clients and Oscar‑winning actors, as well as imparting her knowledge to more than 700,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nHer trademark is a no‑nonsense, research‑led approach that focuses on blood sugar balance, gut health and eating real food, rather than endless restriction.​​\n\nThis year, building on her award‑winning Renew Reset Recharge 28 day online plan, she has launched The Triple 30, with its focus on 30g of protein per meal, 30g of fibre a day and 30+ plants a week. She’s also found time to write a cookbook, No‑Nonsense Nutrition (out in February), and is fast becoming the go‑to voice for women who want straight‑talking, sustainable, science-based advice on how to eat well.\n\n25. Ruby Hammer MBE, 64, makeup artist and founder\n\nThere are a handful of women in the fast-paced beauty industry who have managed to remain relevant and high profile for several decades, and Ruby Hammer is one of them. Born in Nigeria to Bangladeshi parents and raised in the UK, she worked her way from restaurant shifts to assisting backstage at London Fashion Week, before becoming a go‑to makeup artist for Vogue,\n\nElle and for supermodels including Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.\n\nIn 2007 she was awarded an MBE for services to the cosmetics industry after co‑founding high‑street game‑changer Ruby & Millie and helping introduce brands such as Aveda and L’Occitane to British shoppers.​\n\nToday her focus is Ruby Hammer Beauty. Launched in 2019, this tightly edited line of clever, multitasking products is designed to make makeup quicker and more intuitive. In 2025 she’s stepped it up a notch, winning a Who What Wear Next in Beauty award for her nail tool, picking up a CEW UK Achiever Award, expanding retail partnerships and extending the shade range of hero products like the Lip Serum Balm that blurs the line between skincare and colour.\n\nHer message – that true beauty is ageless, inclusive and rooted in confidence – lands louder than ever.​\n\n26. Dame Debbie Crosbie, 55, banker\n\nScottish‑born Dame Debbie Crosbie is one of the most powerful figures in British retail banking today. After joining Clydesdale Bank as a graduate trainee, she rose to chief operating officer, steering its de-merger and stock‑market listing, then took on the poisoned chalice of TSB in the wake of its IT meltdown, leading a turnaround that dragged the bank back into profit. In 2022 she became the first female chief executive of Nationwide Building Society in its 175‑year history.\n\nThis year has been a landmark even by her standards. She completed the £2.9billion acquisition of Virgin Money, announced record results, presided over Fairer Share – profit-share cash payouts to millions of members (even if some of them raised an eyebrow about her 43 per cent pay rise) – and committed to keeping all branches open until at least the start of 2030.\n\nIn June she was made a Dame for services to financial services, later received the Freedom of the City of London, and in December was appointed the Government’s new Women in Finance Champion, tasked with boosting female representation at the top of the sector.\n\n27. Dame Amanda Blanc, 58, insurance chief\n\nIf you’re not nose-deep in the money pages, you might not know Welsh‑born Dame Amanda Blanc, a queen in the world of insurance. She started as a graduate at Commercial Union (which later became part of Aviva) and held senior roles at Groupama, Towergate, AXA and Zurich, before becoming the first woman to chair both the Association of British Insurers and the Insurance Fraud Bureau.​\n\nIn 2020 she returned to Aviva as group chief executive and has spent the past five years simplifying the business, selling off non‑core operations, strengthening the balance sheet and refocusing on the UK, Ireland and Canada.\n\nThis year saw the completion of a £3.7billion acquisition of Direct Line, cementing Aviva’s status as Britain’s largest insurer, with operating profits up more than 20 per cent on 2024, and shares at their highest level in almost 18 years.\n\nRenowned for being uncompromising and detail-oriented, she recently stepped down as HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Champion, but continues to be a political force, advising Chancellor Rachel Reeves on the creation of a national wealth fund.\n\n28. Dame Emma Walmsley, 56, pharma chief\n\nAt the end of this year Dame Emma Walmsley will leave her position as chief executive of GSK, one of Britain’s biggest drug companies. Since taking up the role in 2017, when she became the first woman to lead a major pharmaceutical company, she has restored GSK’s position in oncology and helped them double down on vaccines.\n\nAs one of the highest-paid chief executives in the UK (last year she pocketed £10.6million and this year could take home as much as £21.6million), her take-home reflects her value to the company. She’s been instrumental in separating out GSK’s consumer arm, Haleon, which includes the likes of Sensodyne and Panadol, and on her watch both profits and FDA approvals have gone up.\n\nShe will stay on for most of 2026 to oversee a smooth handover and, while she hasn’t announced her next role, nobody’s expecting her to retire just yet.\n\n29. Caroline Quentin, 65, actor/gardener/artist\n\nWhile her on-screen role as the long-suffering girlfriend of Men Behaving Badly’s Gary (Martin Clunes) shot her to fame in the 1990s, more than 30 years later Caroline Quentin is still picking up plum roles, on stage and screen — most recently Arcadina in The Seagull at the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh.\n\nBut alongside her acting work, she’s quietly been growing in another direction, with plants and paint taking centre stage. A lifelong container‑gardener, she graduated from window boxes to a rambling Devon plot and now to a new cottage garden in Somerset, sharing the whole muddy, joyous process with a large online community via her 200,000-strong CQ Gardens Instagram account.​ Her pivot was completed by Drawn to the Garden, a bestselling British Book Awards‑shortlisted blend of memoir, planting notebook and her own watercolours.\n\nThis year has seen a live tour spun out of the book and a host of covetable gifts — from tea towels to cards, gardeners’ hand cream and soap (created with her talented skincare-brand owning husband, Sam Farmer), all adorned with her beautiful art.\n\nNow that’s how you write a second act.\n\n30. Margherita Della Valle, 60, telecoms chief\n\nIt’s increasingly rare these days for someone to spend their entire career at the same company, but that’s exactly what Margherita Della Valle has done. Now London-based, the Bocconi University graduate first joined Omnitel (now Vodafone Italy) in the 1990s and rose through the ranks, from marketing analyst to group CFO and, in 2023, became Vodafone’s first female chief executive — one of a handful of women at the head of a FTSE 100 company.\n\nReshaping, or ‘rightsizing’, the company has been her goal since taking the top job and 2025 has been the year where plans came good. She’s overseen the sale of Vodafone Italy (hot on the heels of last year’s sell-off of Vodafone Spain), pushed ahead the £16.5billion merger with Three and has committed £11billion to building the UK’s best 5G network.\n\nThe result? Since January shares are up by almost 40 per cent. That’s very definitely not phoning it in.\n\n31. Nnena Kalu, 59, artist\n\nWhile her name might not yet be as familiar as the likes of Damien Hirst, Grayson Perry, Rachel Whiteread and Anish Kapoor, the latest winner of the Turner Prize, Nnena Kanu has been working on her craft since the late 1990s.\n\nAutistic and with limited verbal communication, she’s the first artist with a learning disability to win the UK’s top art prize but has been in the art world since the 1990s, creating instantly identifiable ‘cocoons’ of tape, fabric and paper that grow into bold hanging sculptures and compelling floor‑filling installations, as well as abstract drawings.\n\nBorn in Glasgow to Nigerian parents and now based in London, her history-making win has been described as ‘seismic’, while other disabled artists have spoken about how she has inspired them, changing what they dare to dream of for themselves.\n\n32. Clare Waight Keller, 55, fashion designer\n\nTrained at Ravensbourne College of Art and the Royal College of Art, Clare Waight Keller cut her teeth at Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Gucci before taking the role of creative director at Pringle of Scotland and later Chloé.\n\nIn 2017 she moved to Givenchy as its first female artistic director, designing both menswear and couture and, most famously, Meghan Markle’s wedding dress, which was probably when she caught the eye of non-fashion types, too.\n\nExcitingly for High Street shoppers, her latest role is less haute couture. Having launched the design-led Uniqlo: C line in 2023, she was appointed Uniqlo’s overall creative director in autumn 2024. Her influence in creating functional yet stylish pieces in cuts that endure (at prices we can afford) has been apparent throughout this year’s collections, leading some to dub the Japanese store as a purveyor of stealth luxe looks for those without a stealth luxe budget.\n\nDemocratisation of great design — how quintessentially 2025.\n\n33. Dame Mary Berry, 90, cook and broadcaster\n\nLong before she became the nation’s grandmother‑in‑chief on The Great British Bake Off, Mary Berry was a demonstrator for the Bath Electricity Board, driving to customers’ houses and baking Victoria sponges to show people how their new ovens worked. Training at Le Cordon Bleu and a stint at the Dutch Dairy Bureau led to an extraordinary media career with stints in magazines, numerous cooking shows and more than 80 cookbooks to her name.\n\nIn 2025 she has marked both her 90th birthday and 60 years in food with a flurry of celebrations, including a special episode of The One Show, an appearance in Vogue – she was picked as one of the faces for designer Holland Cooper’s latest fashion campaign – and a bestselling book, Mary 90: My Very Best Recipes, complete with accompanying tour and a six‑part BBC series. There was also, of course, a slot in the December schedules for A Mary Berry Christmas.\n\nThis is one designer-clad dame who won’t be hanging up her pinny any time soon.\n\n34. Paula Sutton, 56, writer, stylist and author\n\nAfter years in London fashion PR and publishing, Paula Sutton swapped sample rails and shows for a Georgian house in rural Norfolk – and accidentally created one of social media’s most joyful corners. (Vogue dubbed her The Happiest Influencer on Instagram). Her Hill House Vintage blog — now an Instagram account with more than 610,000 followers — began as a way to chronicle family life and showcase her interior decor, but its blend of chintz sofas, frothy dresses and sun‑drenched lawns epitomised the ‘cottage-core’ obsession that gripped social media and has catapulted her into a new career — or careers.\n\nSince 2023, she’s been one of the hosts of Channel 4’s Millionaire Hoarders; last year she penned her first cosy crime novel The Potting Shed Murder; and this year has added Country Living columnist to her CV with a regular slot reflecting on the realities of village life behind the pretty pictures.\n\nThis year also saw the launch of her second cosy‑crime novel, The Body in the Kitchen Garden, plus a collaboration with sofa.com — there’s no doubt she’s sitting pretty, in every sense.\n\n35. Sarah Burton, 51, creative director\n\nThe last year has been one of great upheaval in the world of high fashion. Jonathan Anderson left Loewe, the Spanish brand that he’d taken from languishing to loved, to move to Dior. Over at Chanel, Matthieu Blazy took over from longtime Karl Lagerfield collaborator Virginie Viard. Finally and perhaps most significantly, Sarah Burton left her role as creative director of Alexander McQueen to begin a new role at Givenchy. Embracing a sensuality and feminine allure, her first two collections for the label this year (Autumn/Winter 25 and Spring/Summer 26) have already made the move a critical success. Indeed at the beginning of this month, she won womenswear designer of the year at the British Fashion Awards for her work since joining the brand.\n\nShe has cited much of her inspiration for her recent collections as being founded in the exquisite tailoring of Hubert de Givenchy’s earliest designs. We cannot wait to see what she will send down the runway next.\n\n36. Val Garland, 66, make-up artist\n\nFrom Alexander McQueen fashion shows all the way through to Lady Gaga album covers and quirky 1980s music videos, when you think of your favourite famous face, there is every chance that Val Garland has done their make-up. But she didn’t always want to be a make-up artist. She began her career by dropping out of school aged 15 and working in a hair salon in Bristol. She moved to Australia on a whim and, after years of doing hair and opening her own salons, she moved back to London with the intent of becoming a make-up artist.\n\nToday, Garland is the global director of L’Oréal Paris and a judge on BBC’s Glow Up: Britain’s Next Make Up Star. Celebs who love her include Helen Mirren and Lady Gaga, but she doesn’t just have fans in the starry world of showbiz, her Instagram is followed by 766,000 people.\n\n37. Gabby Logan MBE, 52, TV presenter\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Gary Lineker is no easy task, yet Match of the Day is safe in the hands of Gabby Logan. A former rhythmic gymnast who represented both Wales and Great Britain, she understands the world of competitive sport from the inside out.\n\nSince her time at Durham University where she briefly dabbled in radio, Gabby has carved a lasting career in broadcasting, from Sky and ITV sports to Final Score on the BBC, where she worked until 1998 before moving to ITV.\n\nThis year she has led the coverage of two major women’s sporting tournaments – the Euros and the Rugby World cup. Both of which England won. She must be a lucky charm.\n\n38. Collette Roche, 50​, football executive\n\n​One of the most senior women in English football, Collette Roche took on the role of Manchester United’s chief operating officer in 2018, after roles at Ford, Siemens, United Utilities and Manchester Airports Group. She’s the first woman to hold the role — and it’s not as if she was passed an easy ball. United are no longer in their 1990s heyday and have been through five managers since she took over.\n\nPart of her goal has been to improve facilities for the women’s team, and this year saw them making their third consecutive FA Cup final (even if they’ve only won one of those three). Crucially she’s now spearheading United’s push for a new £2billion stadium, describing it as a ‘once in a lifetime opportunity’ that will not only help the team, but also support the local area with a predicted 17,000 new homes and 1.8million additional visitors to the area each year.\n\nIn March this year, ​R​oche was ​r​umoured to be the leading candidate for ​the chief executive position at Newcastle United. Although the ​t​ransfer never happened, it’s a clear sign of just how highly she’s thought of ​i​n ​Premier ​League executive circles.​\n\n39. Dame Katherine Grainger, 50, athlete\n\nIt has been a stratospheric year for Glaswegian athlete Dame Katherine Grainger. The 2012 Summer Olympic gold medalist, four-time Olympic silver medallist, and six-time World Champion for Great Britain, was appointed head of the British Olympic Association – the first woman to take on the role in its 120-year history.\n\nIt’s clear she doesn’t lack the experience for the job: not only is she Britain’s joint most decorated female Olympian, but she’s also chaired UK Sport for eight years. On top of that she found the time to act as the Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University between 2015 and 2020 and is currently Chancellor of the University of Glasgow.\n\n40. Sharron Davies, 63, campaigner\n\nWith a swimming career spanning more than 20 years, and an Olympic silver medal in 1980, Sharron Davies was already a household name before her latest incarnation as campaigner for women’s rights in sports.\n\nA relentless and vocal advocate for the separation of sporting categories by sex, this year she launched the campaigning Women’s Sports Union with round-the-world yachtswoman Tracy Edwards. To cap off a year of all round heroism, in December she was named a new Conservative Peer in the House of Lords by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch.\n\n41. Vivienne Lewis, 63, businesswoman\n\nIt seems 2025 has been the year for women at the top of their game in the world of football. For Vivienne Lewis, daughter and heir to Joe Lewis, who bought Tottenham Hotspur in 1991, it could not be a more apt description.\n\nChief cheerleader at the north London club, where she’s apparently known as ‘Viv’, she’s the senior managing director of Tavistock Group, which owns the English National Investment Company – the majority shareholders at Spurs. To top it all off, Lewis is involved in running the family’s reportedly vast private art collection.\n\n42. Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, 65, actress\n\nFrom her pitch-perfect demonstration of repressed English yearning in Four Weddings and a Funeral to that monologue in TV series Fleabag, which brought her a whole new generation of fans, there are few actors who are as adored and respected as Kristin Scott Thomas.\n\nThis year has seen her once again winning plaudits for her portrayal of Diana Taverner in the fifth season of gritty spy comedy Slow Horses. Her depiction of the ice queen of MI5 captures the character’s composure and repressed feminine rage in a way that has resonated with viewers globally.\n\nNext summer she is slated to return to the stage as the lead in the West End run of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard.\n\n43. Dame Tracey Emin CBE, 62, artist\n\nFrom a tent appliqued with the names of past lovers and friends to an unmade bed that sold for almost £2.5million, Tracey Emin has never done art by halves. Since the 1990s she has poured autobiography into her work, becoming one of Britain’s most recognisable – and divisive – artists.\n\nA bladder cancer diagnosis in 2020 prompted a shift towards works that reflect the vulnerability of the female body and touch on themes of illness and survival, but also made her think about her legacy.\n\nMajor solo shows this year in Florence and at Yale’s Center for British Art, not to mention an appearance ‘in conversation’ at Frieze Masters, prove she’s just as relevant as ever. A point cemented by the announcement next year Tate Modern will host a major exhibition of her 40-year career.\n\n44. Kate Winslet, 50, actor/writer/director\n\nAlready an Oscar, Emmy and Bafta winner, Kate Winslet has spent 2025 adding new job titles to an already crowded CV. ‘Activist’ is nothing new – she’s always spoken out about body-shaming and the way women are treated within the industry – but this year marks her debut as a director.\n\nGoodbye June, a Christmas family drama for Netflix, is based on a script by her son Joe Anders and stars Helen Mirren, Toni Collette and Andrea Riseborough – as well as Winslet, who also produced the film.\n\nAdd a forthcoming HBO limited series Trust, which she executive produced as well as starred in, and 2025 looks like the year she’s fully claimed her place behind the camera as well as in front of it.\n\n45. Bernardine Evaristo, 66, writer and literary activist\n\nWhile Bernadine Evaristo started her career in theatre, co-founding Theatre of Black Women in the 1980s, it is as a writer that she has become a part of the national consciousness. Born in Woolwich to an English mother and Nigerian father, she’s long shown that everyday black experience belongs at the heart of British literature with novels The Emperor’s Babe, Mr Loverman and the Booker winning Girl, Woman, Other.\n\nThis year she received the one off Women’s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award, a £100,000 honour for her body of work and ‘transformative influence’ (which she donated to fund a new RSL prize celebrating pioneering women writers), while the BBC adaptation of Mr Loverman scooped two Baftas.\n\n46. Dame Maggie Aderin-Pocock, 57, space scientist and TV star\n\nAs a dyslexic child growing up on London council estates, Maggie Aderin Pocock was inspired by the Clangers and the moon landings, telling anyone who would listen she wanted to go into space. Despite a lack of support from her teachers, she hit the physics books anyway and a degree and PhD from Imperial led to work on missile warning systems, hand-held landmine detectors, the Gemini telescope in Chile and, later, instruments for the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nAlready beloved as co-host of BBC Four’s The Sky at Night, she was chosen to deliver this year’s Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, celebrating the 200-year anniversary of the educational event with an ‘epic voyage through time and space’ on BBC Four that doubled as a love letter to telescopes and curiosity.\n\nThis year her alma mater, Imperial, has named her its Distinguished Alumni winner, and there is also talk of future missions that might yet get her a little closer to the stars she’s spent a lifetime admiring.\n\n47. Mariella Frostrup, 63, broadcaster and campaigner\n\nOnce best-known for late night arts shows and book interviews, Mariella Frostrup has now become one of the UK’s leading voices on women’s midlife health. As the Government’s Menopause Employment Ambassador, she has spent the year talking to ministers, civil servants and employers about practical changes that keep midlife women in the workforce. On the back of the success of her co-authored book, Cracking The Menopause, she has co-authored another, Menolicious, a bestselling cook book packed with hormone supportive recipes.\n\nHer drive to make menopause care a fundamental part of healthcare received a boost this year after the Government agreed that menopause advice should be added to free NHS health checks, ensuring millions more get the support they need.\n\n48. Victoria Beckham, 51, designer and beauty founder\n\nBeyond the family fallout with Brooklyn, Victoria has had a cracking 2025. Her three-part Netflix documentary tracking her rise from Spice Girl to serious designer was one of the year’s most eagerly awaited binges, while her fashion collections drew some of her best reviews yet.\n\nThe beauty business hasn’t been slacking either. Victoria Beckham Beauty was behind one of the year’s buzziest complexion launches, with the £104 Foundation Drops – a cosmetic/skincare hybrid with input from Augustinus Bader – having beauty editors in raptures.\n\nOh, and with husband David made a Sir this year, Posh – sorry, Lady Beckham – can really live up to her best-known label.\n\n49. Professor Anne Trefethen, 63, computing and AI leader\n\nYou might not know her name, but Anne Trefethen is one of the biggest brains in tech and at the forefront of the responsible use of AI in the UK. Trained as a mathematician and computer scientist, she built her reputation in high performance and scientific computing on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSince 2005 she’s been in Oxford, where she founded the Oxford e-Research Centre, became the university’s first chief information officer and now serves as pro vice chancellor (people and digital) and professor of scientific computing, as well as a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, a trustee of the Alan Turing Institute and co-host of AI UK 2025, the UK’s national showcase of data science and artificial intelligence. Phew.\n\nWhere Oxford leads, others follow, so the fact that this year she’s overseen the roll-out of ChatGPT Edu and other generative AI tools to staff and students, might indicate the UK’s direction of travel. If that’s the case, best that someone like her — who believes AI should be used in ways that are positive, equitable, and grounded in human experience — is at the helm.\n\n50. Davina McCall, 58, presenter and midlife champion\n\nAfter three decades of live TV – from Big Brother to The Masked Singer – Davina McCall has become Britain’s go-to ringmaster for high-emotion, big-hearted entertainment. And she’s showing no signs of slacking, despite undergoing two serious surgeries this year — to remove a brain tumour and for early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThis year she’s been a multimedia queen with a book Birthing about pregnancy and a podcast Begin Again which has gone from strength to strength with guests such as Gillian Anderson and Richard E Grant. And, of course, TV, with Stranded on Honeymoon Island, a BBC One dating show for newly matched couples that critics hailed as a kinder, more relatable Love Island.\n\nAway from TV, she secretly married long-time partner, hair stylist Michael Douglas after the pair got engaged earlier this year.\n\nCompiled by Liz Hartley, Group Editorial Legal Director DMG Media; Justine Hancock, Assistant Editor (Health); Alex Brummer, Consultant Editor; George Bond, Sports Editor Mail+; Dinah van Tulleken, Fashion Editor; Claire Coleman, Beauty Expert; and Rosie Beveridge, Features Assistant.","summary":"We celebrate the incredible achievements of all those pioneering scientists, straight-talking campaigners and brilliant entertainers who are over-50 and enjoying their moment in the spotlight.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/lifestyle/article-15419979/Daily-Mail-Power-List-50-women-50-stars.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/29/18/105086681-0-image-m-184_1767032152647.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 10:17:55","author":"Claire Cohen,Claire Coleman,Editor,Rosie Beveridge","authors":["Claire Cohen","Claire Coleman","Editor","Rosie Beveridge"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.407},{"id":390022786,"title":"Stephen Colbert reveals why he wants to 'slip into the body' of Donald Trump for one day","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nHome and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Dec 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcclaimed actress, 48, says she plans to die by assisted suicide because she cannot overcome her mental illness\n\nFears Anthony Joshua's car crash injuries are worse than first thought: Sources say £100m Tyson Fury mega-fight is in the balance amid potential internal injuries and psychological trauma of seeing close friends killed\n\nAdam Peaty's ex girlfriend Eirianedd Munroe brands his surname change 'hypocritical' as she calls out his 'double standards' after marriage to Holly Ramsay\n\n'It's a lot of cash.

But I would slip inside the skin of our president.'\nWhen questioned why he chose the current 47th President of the United States, the star simply answered, 'I would resign.'\nColbert continued, 'I've anticipated this.

CBS should \"put him to sleep,\" NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!' \nEarlier this year in July, Colbert slammed Paramount - the parent company of CBS - for settling a $16 million lawsuit with Trump after he sued the network for airing an edited 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. \nDuring an episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, he called the move a 'big fat bribe.' \nHe stated, 'I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles: it's \"big, fat bribe.\" \nJust days after the episode aired, Paramount announced that Colbert's talk show would officially come to an end in May 2026. \nHowever, it cited finances as the reasoning behind the move - with claims that the network loses around $40 million annually with The Late Show on the air. \n\nStephen Colbert jokes that Paramount can afford his show\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:56\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\n'Stephen Colbert is a pathetic trainwreck, with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success,' Trump wrote \n\nView gallery\n\nJust days after the episode aired, Paramount announced that Colbert's talk show would officially come to an end in May 2026; outside of The Late Show in July 2025 in NYC\nEarlier this month, the comedian referenced to the company's financial reasoning to axe his show when Paramount made an $108 billion bid to buy Warner Bros.

Or was it because President Donald Trump, the political chameleon, had robbed the party of its lock on a multiracial working-class coalition?\n\nWhatever the reason, the party was dealing with what some members said was a \"seismic crisis\" or an \"existential threat\" to its long-term viability. In July, roughly half of all voters surveyed said they would consider joining a third party.\n\nBut, in the closing days of 2025, the pendulum appears to be swinging in the Democrats' direction.\n\nDems show promise in off-year elections\n\nMany of the party's candidates stormed to power in November's off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey, two states that have been largely Democratic blue in recent years but looked vulnerable only months earlier.\n\nTrump did better than expected in New Jersey in the 2024 presidential campaign — losing to Kamala Harris by just six percentage points, much better than his own past performances and how other recent Republican candidates have fared there. That red wave had some analysts wondering: is New Jersey the next swing state?\n\nBut GOP optimism faded quickly as the ballots were counted in the Garden State's gubernatorial election on Nov. 4. \n\nDemocrat Mikie Sherrill, a moderate, trounced her Republican opponent, winning by more than 14 percentage points. \n\nAnother centrist Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, cleaned up in Virginia, winning by 15 points in a state Harris won by fewer than six a year earlier.\n\nWhat followed those victories — and a strong showing for democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City's mayoral election — was a polling upswing elsewhere.\n\n\"These elections have all gone in favour of the Democrats — this is the so-called canary in the coal mine,\" Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia, said in an interview with CBC News. \"You are beginning to see cracks in Trump's power.\" \n\nEven in Florida, once a toss-up state that is now deeply red after some COVID-fuelled ideological and demographic changes, a Democrat won Miami's mayoral race this month with a strong majority. It was the first win by a Democrat there in 28 years and one the local media is calling \"a good omen\" for a party that has long struggled to connect.\n\nTrump approval ratings slip\n\nNationally, the Democrats are also seeing signs of life.\n\nTrump's approval ratings have slipped despite some successes like reining in crime and illegal border crossings. A recent Marist Poll shows the Democrats have a double-digit lead among voters heading into the 2026 congressional midterm elections — the first time in more than three years that Democrats have had a lead like that.\n\nThe sluggish U.S. economy appears to be what's driving voter unease and the Trump backlash, said Matthew Lebo, a professor of U.S. politics at Western University in London, Ont. \n\nWhile Trump boldly ran on slaying Biden-era inflation on “Day 1” of his presidency, the Democrats are trying, with some early results, to flip the script on affordability.\n\n\"Everything comes back to making the case for an affordability agenda,\" said Mamdani, whose campaign promises included free buses and daycare.\n\nSpanberger, meanwhile, promised to use state powers to cap drug costs and lower energy rates to address cost-of-living challenges Trump recently called \"a hoax started by the Democrats.\"\n\n\"Right now, the Democrats are ahead, and that lead should increase as more bad economic data comes out,\" Lebo said in an interview.\n\n\"Democrats will be far more energized to go out and vote against Republicans and Donald Trump in 2026 than Republicans will be to keep him propped up,\" he said.\n\nEconomic struggles could shape voting\n\nUnemployment is up, inflation is stubbornly high, tariffs have spiked the prices of almost everything — with data suggesting more and more of those trade-related levies are being borne by consumers, not just the businesses that initially pay them.\n\nExperts at the National Bureau of Economic Research say the import taxes have increased the inflation rate by 0.7 percentage points.\n\nThe stock market has surged after Trump's chaotic tariff rollout in April — the S&P 500, an index that tracks some of the 500 largest U.S. companies, is up about 18 per cent year-to-date — but those gains have not been felt by all, or even most, voters.\n\nAs Bill Clinton's ex-staffer, James Carville, famously quipped in the 1992 presidential election: \"It's the economy, stupid.\"\n\nThen-president George H.W. Bush, who registered some of the highest approval ratings ever recorded after he led the U.S. to victory in the first Gulf War, saw his support crumble as the economy faltered and tipped into a recession.\n\nCarville pressed his protégé, Clinton, to go all-in on economic woes during the campaign — a strategy that paid off.\n\nCould tariffs be a liability for Trump?\n\nThat's what Michael Negron, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former Biden White House official on the National Economic Council, thinks his party should do again in the 2026 midterms.\n\nNegron authored a recent report on the economic ramifications of Trump's tariffs, finding that small-business importers paid about $25,000 more per month due to those levies than they did in the same period last year — a huge increase that has been passed on to consumers in some cases.\n\nAs a result, Negron says many people now equate tariffs with inflation — and that's spurring some voters to rethink their allegiance to the president and his signature economic policy.\n\nPersistent inflation is \"one of the core drivers behind the president's unpopularity,\" Negron said in an interview with CBC News. \"Tariffs are a liability for him.\"\n\nWhile protectionist Democrats have supported tariffs in the past and some party-aligned trade unions have also voiced support for Trump's plan, Negron says the party has to forcibly denounce the policy Trump has pursued to appeal to voters worried about affordability.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election campaign, Harris tried to frame Trump's tariffs as a national sales tax. Though Negron says it \"didn't seem to really resonate with people\" at the time, that's changed.\n\n\"Trump has taken this obscure tax tool and made it mainstream. People know what it is now and they don't like what they see,\" he said. \n\n\"Trump's broad, sweeping tariffs are driving up costs for everybody and hurting small businesses — and Democrats have to be willing to say that.\"","summary":"For much of the last two years, the U.S. Democratic Party has been on its back foot, enduring painful electoral defeats to an omnipresent Republican opponent while grappling with a troubling decline in voter registration and a listless party base.

Bush, who registered some of the highest approval ratings ever recorded after he led the U.S. to victory in the first Gulf War, saw his support crumble as the economy faltered and tipped into a recession.\n\nCarville pressed his protégé, Clinton, to go all-in on economic woes during the campaign — a strategy that paid off.\n\nCould tariffs be a liability for Trump?\n\nThat's what Michael Negron, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former Biden White House official on the National Economic Council, thinks his party should do again in the 2026 midterms.\n\nNegron authored a recent report on the economic ramifications of Trump's tariffs, finding that small-business importers paid about $25,000 more per month due to those levies than they did in the same period last year — a huge increase that has been passed on to consumers in some cases.\n\nAs a result, Negron says many people now equate tariffs with inflation — and that's spurring some voters to rethink their allegiance to the president and his signature economic policy.\n\nPersistent inflation is \"one of the core drivers behind the president's unpopularity,\" Negron said in an interview with CBC News. \"Tariffs are a liability for him.\"\n\nWhile protectionist Democrats have supported tariffs in the past and some party-aligned trade unions have also voiced support for Trump's plan, Negron says the party has to forcibly denounce the policy Trump has pursued to appeal to voters worried about affordability.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election campaign, Harris tried to frame Trump's tariffs as a national sales tax. Though Negron says it \"didn't seem to really resonate with people\" at the time, that's changed.\n\n\"Trump has taken this obscure tax tool and made it mainstream. People know what it is now and they don't like what they see,\" he said. \n\n\"Trump's broad, sweeping tariffs are driving up costs for everybody and hurting small businesses — and Democrats have to be willing to say that.\"","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/democrats-are-feeling-good-2026-9.7029512","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/b85380ce-0816-4098-96fb-e386cd419bbf,1767055998298/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C3695%2C2078%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 09:00:00","author":"John Paul Tasker","authors":["John Paul Tasker"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":389998906,"title":"Donald Trump's unhinged 2025: Wildest and most shocking moments month-by-month","text":"Donald Trump, to the surprise of many people, won the 2024 election. Despite being the most unpopular President in history, according to polls taken throughout his first term - and despite spending the last few months of his presidency trying to steal the election he lost to Joe Biden, culminating in the most egregious and violent attempted coup d'état in American history, the election was expected to be close. In the end it wasn't a landslide, but it wasn't super close. Either the American people had forgiven Trump's transgressions, or more likely, had forgotten exactly how bad it got. A year into his second term in office, polls make him the second most unpopular President of all time. He's spending most of his time fighting the old wars of 2020, punishing his enemies and remodelling the White House to more closely resemble Mar A Lago. He schmoozes America's enemies and alienates her allies. He and his team are openly using far-right and white nationalist rhetoric to back up his foreign policy and immigration purge. He's doing everything someone might do if they wanted to commit an 'auto-coup', meaning he never has to leave office again. And unlike his first term, there seems to be nobody in the White House - and vanishingly few in positions of power outside of it - willing to stand in his way. Almost every day since Trump returned to office, I've written a roundup of the unhinged things he did the day before. Here's a roundup of the first year of those roundups. We could have predicted quite a lot of Trump's first term from two things that happened on his first day back in office. The first is who turned up to his inauguration. The ceremony, for the first time in a long time, didn't happen on the Capitol Steps, because organisers feared it would be too cold. So it was held in the Capitol Rotunda, a huge round domed space in the centre of the building. Many will recognise from the photos of January 6th, 2021, when marauding Trump fanatics stormed the building, seeking to mount a violent coup d'état by preventing the results of a fair, legal election being certified. But on the day of the Inauguration, there was a different crowd in the Capitol: Tech billionaires. Elon Musk was there of course, but so were Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and - much to the chagrin of many who thought his company, at least, was better than this - Apple CEO Tim Cook. It was a handy preview of the kind of people who would be seeking Trump's attention this time around. Recognising they would never get anything done in the United States without blowing smoke up this guy, so they'd better get in early to pledge their fealty. The other thing he did on his first day that was a preview of things to come? Within hours of taking office, at a rally of his supporters at the Capital One Arena, he sat down at a tiny table and signed the pardons of almost everyone who tried to steal the 2020 election for him. What else happened? Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, withdrew from the Paris Climate accords and pulled out of the World Health Organisation He laid the groundwork for his deportation purge, branding it 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion' Volodymyr Zelensky probably had some level of expectation when he came to the White House that he'd walk away with very little. I don't think he expected to be publicly berated and insulted by Trump and JD Vance, telling him he's been insufficiently grateful for American support for Ukraine. It's one of the most uncomfortable Presidential moments ever broadcast live to the world, and ensured the war would barrel on for yet more months. Meanwhile Elon Musk went on a tear through government departments, locking people out of their offices and allowing teenagers access to the private personal data of pretty much everyone in America. USAID, which managed most of America's foreign humanitarian programmes was gutted along with a bunch of other organisations that either Republicans hated or didn't do anything Trump was interested in. Then there was the thing where Musk emailed pretty much every government employee, hundreds of thousands of them, and suggested to them that they might want to leave their jobs. Also, one of Musk's team was a teenager named \"Big Balls\". Later in the month, Musk made an appearance at the CPAC conference in Washington DC, where he was given a gift on stage by Argentina's President Javier Milei - a giant gold plated chainsaw with which to cut through government spending. Musk waved it around the stage and shouted \"Chainsaw, woooo!\". I was there, it was one of the weirdest and lamest things I've ever seen with my two eyes. What else happened? Keir Starmer visits Trump to talk Ukraine, and to give himself a leg up in tariff talks by offering Trump another state visit Trump starts openly musing about \"taking over\" Gaza once the fighting stops Then he posts an AI video of what a Trump Gaza Resort would look like, which culminates in him and Netanyahu together on the beach Trump's revenge tour kicks into gear as he pulls security clearances from Joe Biden and a string of Biden Era officials. He announced the \"Trump Gold Card\", basically a visa exceptionally rich people could pay for, literally with his face on it He announced 25% tariffs on nearest neighbours Canada and Mexico. These will go on to be increased, decreased, paused and threatened a baffling number of times in a baffling number of different combinations over the following 11 months March saw Trump give his first \"joint address to congress\" - which is just what they call the State of the Union Address in the first year for some reason. During the speech he made troubling remarks urging Greenland to join the United States voluntarily, before \"We need it, for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or another...we're going to get it.\" To this day, we don't know if he's serious about annexing Greenland, but this week he did appoint an Ambassador to the country over the strong objections of Denmark, which owns it. Meanwhile, a judge got a little nervous about the administration's deportations to places like El Salvador, because of Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies act to bypass the usual deportation hearings. He said, 'alright, quit it and any planes in the air should just go ahead and turn around'. As it turned out, the administration basically ignored the order and allowed 260 people already in the air to be transported to El Salvador, destined for places likeCecot, the illegal torture prison where - the same month - Trump's administration \"accidentally\" deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man with a legal right to be in the US, and no criminal record. After being forced to bring him back to the US, the Justice Department would spend most of the rest of the year smearing Garcia with various unproven claims, and vindictively pursuing him through the courts in a bid to deport him. The case is ongoing. What else happened? With Musk's DOGE rampage having a knock on effect on his main business, Tesla, Trump decided to give him a li'l bump - effectively turning the White House lawn into a Tesla dealership, saying things like \"everything is computer\", and pretending to put in an order for one of Elon's electric cars. Trump went after a bunch of law firms that worked on investigations targeting him during his time out of office Trump signed an executive order pledging to eliminate the department for Education National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, apparently accidentally, invited the Atlantic's Editor in Chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, into a group chat with senior Trump officials. In the unencrypted chat, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive information about a future airstrike in Yemen. LIBERATION DAY! April 2nd 2025 will be long remembered as the day Donald Trump swanned out into the rose garden with an A3 poster board with a list of countries and the manifestly random tariffs they will have to pay on goods sent to the US. As the day went on it became clear that many of the tariffs had been developed not through some expert master plan, but cribbed from ChatGPT. For example, 10% tariffs were announced on the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are solely inhabited by seals and penguins. It also became clear that the markets had not dared to believe he'd actually go through with it - and reacted with widespread panic selling across global markets. It wasn't until Trump blinked a few days later and announced a 90-day delay in the tariffs being implemented that markets began to recover. The about turn was so abrupt it prompted the Wall Street Journal to coin the nickname TACO - Trump Always Chickens Out. What else happened Robert F Kennedy Jr fires huge numbers of staff and officials at the Department of Health and Human Services Trump launched a crackdown on Trans people, scrapping federal legal protections and banning them from military service Trump's Easter message was a legendary rant targeting \"Radical Left Lunatics\" and \"MS-13 Gang Members\". He wished those who \"CHEATED\" in 2020 a \"very Happy Easter!!!\" with \"great love, sincerity, and affection\" JD Vance visits Pope Francis in the Vatican. The Pope dies the next day. Trump took a jaunt around the Middle East to sign a bunch of investment and cooperation deals with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. He'll spend much of the rest of his first year crowing about the \"money coming in\" to the US from these deals, despite experts suggesting the purported value of them is wildly optimistic. Meanwhile, Qatar offers to give Trump a plane to replace the ageing Air Force One. In all likelihood the jet will never be Air Force One during Trump's presidency - it would have to be taken apart bit by bit by the security services to ensure it's not bugged, tampered with or full of Greeks ready to infiltrate the city of Troy. That takes years for a jet that hasn't been given to us by a foreign power, let alone one from Qatar, a state that has historically \"been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\" Not my words, but the words of President Donald Trump way back in 2017, before they offered him a free plane. And the jet, Trump says, won't be gifted to the nation, but will end up the property of the Trump Foundation, the body that is in charge of his presidential library after his term. So yeah. It's a gift for him. What else happened During a visit to the Jaguar Land Rover factory in Solihull, Keir Starmer announces he's spoken to Trump on the phone and secured an understanding for a future trade deal to avoid the worst of the tariffs. Instead of 25%, we'll pay a minimum of 10%, and be exempted from tariffs on a handful of goods like steel. That's the theory anyway, it's unclear whether this deal has ever fully gone into effect Days after the death of the Pope, Trump posted an AI picture of himself as the pope. It was later reposted by official White House accounts, prompting widespread horror and criticism Trump ousts Mike Waltz and gives him a new job as Ambassador to the UN. Trump talks to Putin on the phone...as his presidency goes on, this will be a regular feature in the days before he does something stupid and rash. Musk officially exits as a White House \"special employee\", just before the deadline where he'd have to make financial disclosures. At a Press Conference Trump says Elon is \"not really leaving\". Musk turned up at the press conference with a black eye, which he blamed on his son. The Trump/Musk bromance appeared to come to a crashing, shuddering close as the two started trading jibes on social media. It all culminated with this tweet from Musk: \"Time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” It seemed pretty wild at the time, but nobody could have predicted how consequential that tweet would become. What else happened? Protests swell in Los Angeles against immigration raids in the city. Trump deploys up to 4,000 National Guard and 700 marines to the city - a massive overreaction to a handful of violent incidents in otherwise peaceful protests Military hardware rolls through the streets of Washington DC, as Trump finally gets his birthday tank parade. It's a little underwhelming compared to North Korea, but was still jarring (at this point) to see so much armour in a Western capital city. Elon said sorry for the Epstein tweet. Some protests kick off elsewhere in the country, under the banner of \"No Kings\" Trump orders direct strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, claiming to have \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear capabilities Trump flew over to Scotland for a few days golfing at his bicoastal resorts. He made QUITE a lot of news during the visit, having another pop at Sadiq Khan, signing a trade deal with the EU...and admitting the reason he kicked Epstein out of Mar A Lago was because he used to \"steal\" the staff from his spa. Earlier in the weekend, Trump was spotted on the golf course with a huge entourage - and a couple of guys dropping easy Balls on the fairway for him to hit. Meanwhile, Todd Blanche, Trump's former personal attorney - and now Deputy Attorney General - sat down for two days of meetings with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's fixer and accomplice who is in prison for sex trafficking. Maxwell insisted Donald Trump had nothing to do with anything, and is a perfect \"gentleman\". A couple of days later she was moved to a cushier prison What else happened? Karoline Leavitt announced Trump has a benign venous insufficiency resulting in a bruise on his hand and swelling in his cankles. Trump visited Central Texas to meet with victims of the floods Trump attended the Club World Cup final, hands out the trophy and appears to pocket one of the medals. Trump announced a plan for a 60 day ceasefire in Gaza Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington DC to tackle what the White House claimed was a surge of violent crime in the capital. In reality crime had been decreasing in DC since well before Trump was President again. This all appears to have been provoked by the aforementioned \"Big Balls\", one of Elon's Doge kids, getting mugged. Meanwhile, Trump and Putin met in Alaska. The US literally rolled out the red carpet for a war criminal, before letting him ride in the back of a car with the President without translators, officials or security for several minutes. A few days later, Zelensky returned to the White House, flanked by several world leaders including Keir Starmer, and it was much more cordial this time. The summit ends without any real progress towards a ceasefire. What else happened? Trump took away Kamala Harris' Secret Service detail JD Vance took a trip to the UK to meet US troops. While staying at Chevening with David Lammy, the pair were spotted fishing without a licence on the estate. He also met with a host of right wingers during his stay, and also Thomas Skinner off of the Apprentice for some reason The Epstein/Trump story really kicked into gear in September, when the Wall Street Journal published a description of what it said was a sexually suggestive letter Trump had sent to Epstein for his birthday. But just a day later, the air was sucked out of Trumpworld when far-right influencer Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah. When he was shot, Kirk, a skilled orator and provocateur, was doing one of his regular public \"prove me wrong\" events, where he would invite people with different views to line up and argue with him in order to humiliate them. Following his death the surge of support for free speech was such that thousands of people across America - including TV host Jimmy Kimmel - were suspended or fired from their jobs for being insufficiently mournful. What else happened? The Justice department indicted James Comey, the former Director of the FBI, on nonsense charges of lying to congress - just days before the statute of limitations was set to expire. The charges were brought by Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump lawyer rapidly sworn in as a US attorney after nobody else would take the case. Letitia James, the former Attorney General of New York who prosecuted Trump in his time out of office, was also indicted on jumped up Mortgage fraud claims. The US launches its first strike against boats linked to Venezuela, which it claims are running drugs to the US. The strikes are immediately criticised as effectively being extrajudicial executions Trump visited the UK for his second state visit, meeting with the King, Queen, Starmer and not going anywhere near real people. Back home, Trump and RFK Jr hold a mad press conference claiming without evidence that paracetamol causes autism, and urging pregnant women not to take one of the only fever inhibitors they're allowed to take Trump gave a lengthy, rambling speech at the United Nations, berating other nations and complaining about the autocue not working Trump deployed troops to Portland, Oregon claiming the city was filled with \"domestic terrorists\" and describing it as \"war-ravaged\". In reality, the most exciting thing about the protests in Portland was a guy in a frog costume A lot of the energy in October was taken up by the government shutdown - forced by the Democrats in protest over Trump's budget bill failing to extend subsidies to keep healthcare affordable. But the real shock was on October 20th, when Trump without warning demolished the entire East Wing of the White House. He'd suggested for a while that he wanted to build a ballroom, but promised nothing would be done that would change the existing building. This was, of course a lie. The new ballroom is just part of a gradual process throughout the year to turn the White House into Mar a Lago. Every time the Oval Office was on TV, there was a fresh gold (painted) sconce or detail somewhere. The art deco bathroom in the \"Lincoln bedroom\" was torn out to make way for the kind of polished marble monstrosity one only sees in a building that either has Trump in it or written on the outside. He paved over the rose garden to put a patio out there to match the one at his Florida resort - inviting Republicans over for dinner and glad-handing on late summer evenings. Even the two enormous flagpoles he installed on the White House lawn were identical to one he has in Palm Beach. What else happened? Hamas say they've agreed to some of the 20 point plan developed under Trump's name to end the war in Gaza. Hostages started to be released Remember that strike on a Venezuelan \"drug boat\"? Well similar strikes continued in through October and by November near 80 people were confirmed dead. And reports suggested that during the first one, in September, Pete Hegseth gave the order to \"kill everyone\" - so when two apparent survivors were spotted clinging to the vessel's burning hull, a second strike was performed killing them too. Which would constitute at best murder and at worst a war crime. Hegseth denies either, bravely saying the decision to take a second strike was down to the commanding officer. He also claimed he couldn't remember whether he was aware survivors were on the boat, because of the \"fog of war\". The US is currently (still) not at war with Venezuela. What else happened? Kash Patel fired a top FBI official in a fury over backlash to his using a private FBI jet to go and see his girlfriend sing at a wrestling event Private emails from Jeffrey Epstein referencing Trump and his conduct with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and victims were published by House Democrats Under mounting pressure in the country and in congress, Trump agreed to sign a law forcing the justice department to release everything it has on Epstein within 30 days After being asked about the Epstein files during a press conference, Trump called for ABC News' licence to be revoked Trump fell out with former MAGA stalwart Marjorie Taylor Greene in spectacular style. She had a pop at him over the Epstein files. He started referring to her as Marjorie Traitor Brown. Greene announces she's to step down from congress. Trump did two wild things in December that beautifully illustrate how 'late stage Gadaffi' he has become in such a short period of time. First, having been cruelly overlooked for a Nobel Peace Price a few weeks earlier, Trump was handed a giant golden trophy by Gianni Infantini, the head of FIFA and a fellow traveller, to award him the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. People have been so eager to kiss Trump's ring, that a multimillion dollar sport organisation, the governing body for a sport beloved by billions of people...made up a peace prize to keep America's toddler king happy. The other thing he did was complete the most baffling coup he's been working up through the year - the takeover of the Kennedy Centre. The performing arts centre, known for its annual honours of important actors and musicians, is now called the Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts, after he (possibly illegally) fired the board en masse and replaced him with his hangers on and flunkies. He then presided over this year's honours, dished out to, among others, Kiss and Michael Crawford - Frank Spencer to you. What else happened? The DoJ came under fire for releasing only some of the Epstein files on time - and for managing to get a curious number of pictures of Bill Clinton over the line with redactions, while not managing to get any of Trump out there.

And of course, I understand why. But, please let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. What we are witnessing is a swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.”\n\nThe former vice president emphasized her intent to remain politically active through the PAC, stating, “I am going to travel, speak out, and help elect Democrats everywhere and I cannot do this alone.” She noted the importance of meeting early fundraising goals: “Donations are going to be critical.

Everyone will be watching, and I hope to file a big report.”\n\nThe text concludes with a fundraising link and an appeal to supporters: “Knowing you are still with me in this fight means a lot. – Kamala”\n\nThe announcement comes as Harris continues her public profile through media appearances, including a recent interview on the Rich Little Brokegirls podcast, where she offered dating advice. She encouraged women to “be kind to yourself and choose to be with someone who is kind,” and described relationship dynamics in terms of a “Friday night” versus “Sunday morning” phase.

That parking lot is empty all the time, and I was under the impression that place is permanently closed,' one resident who lives nearby said.\n\nAs many as 20 young children and toddlers were seen walking into the facility on Monday morning, prompting Ibrahim Ali, the son of the facility's owner, to hit back at reports it is usually a ghost town.\n\n'Do you go to a coffee shop at 11 p.m. and say, \"Hey, they're not working?,\"' Ali said.\n\nHe argued that when Shirley arrived and began filming the near-deserted facility, it had simply not yet opened for the day.\n\nHe said there were 16 children being taken care of inside the center on Monday. \n\nAli also attempted to shift blame for the incorrect 'learing' sign, accusing a graphic designer that had been hired of making a spelling mistake.\n\n'What I understand is [the owners] dealt with a graphic designer.

The \"autopsy\" had already drawn criticism after reports suggested it would ignore key election questions, such as whether then-President Joe Biden should have stayed in the race or dropped out sooner, and if then-Vice President Kamala Harris was the best person to run in his place.

(One of these “educational” facilities even misspelled “learning” on its signage.)\n\nShirley’s massively viral video — with 116 million views and counting — inspired others to dig into political donation records.\n\nSure enough, recipients of the daycare funding were making big donations to, you guessed it, Democratic politicians. \n\nFirst to come under scrutiny is Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents the district where many of the scams — which may have siphoned off a staggering $9 billion — are centered.\n\nOmar’s venture-capitalist husband is quietly scrubbing his website of key officer details as questions grow over how the congresswoman suddenly acquired a $30 million fortune.\n\nNow Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ bumbling 2024 running mate, is starting to get some tough questions. \n\nJohn Hinderaker, whose Minnesota-based Center for the American Experiment think tank has been on top of this fraud story for years, explains this scandal isn’t exactly new. \n\nA decade ago the FBI investigated Somali child-care fraudsters for opening daycare centers with no kids and collecting state money for fictitious children. \n\n“A number of Somalis went to prison, but it didn’t deter others from carrying out similar frauds, on a grander scale,” Hinderaker wrote on his PowerLine blog.\n\nWalz, who was in Congress when the last batch of Somali scam artists faced charges, can’t be ignorant of this history.\n\nDoes this mean Tim Walz is going to jail? Unlikely. \n\n“Did Tim Walz know the frauds were going on?” Hinderaker asks. “Of course. Even Walz isn’t that stupid.\n\n“But absent taking bribes, of which there is zero evidence, he has not committed a crime.” \n\nProbably correct.\n\nThe FBI is surging investigators to Minnesota in search of more fraud — and director Kash Patel says what we’ve seen so far just the “tip of a very large iceberg.”\n\nPerhaps high-level officials will someday face charges.\n\nBut until then, this scandal leaves additional questions to be addressed. \n\nFirst, with Walz on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, why did no national or local “mainstream” journalists look into all this? \n\nGiven the previous prosecutions, the background of a state’s governor on a national ticket should be a top priority for any honest press.\n\n(I know, haha, I said “honest press.”)\n\nEven now, Minnesota press isn’t covering this story. \n\nShirley’s findings went uber-viral on social media — but the Minnesota Star-Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press have said not a word about his post as I write. \n\nWell, like much of the national media, these papers have long had a hand-in-glove relationship with the state’s Democrats. \n\nAnd as humorist Jim Treacher puts it, they see their job as determining what stories the public doesn’t need to know about, because they might hurt the Democratic Party. \n\nThe other question, of course, is whether this scandal extends to other states, too.\n\nAnd the answer is, almost certainly. \n\nWhere money floats around without adequate safeguards, fraud is almost inevitable — and many federal and state programs seem almost deliberately designed to facilitate fraud. \n\nI added that “almost” purely out of courtesy. \n\nThis month a whistleblower in Maine alleged that the state’s Medicaid program was bilked out of millions by another Somali scammer.\n\nAnd California’s nonpartisan state auditor recently issued a report on “high risk” state programs that found billions lost to wrongful food-assistance and other welfare claims. \n\nThe extent of the loss is staggering, even to cynics like me. \n\nBut what do we do?\n\nWe could try to find more honest public officials. (Haha, I said “honest public officials”).\n\nExtensive arrests and prosecutions — not only of the scammers, but of the bureaucrats who turned a blind eye — won’t magically make our officials honest, but it might make them think twice. \n\nAnd we could simply turn off the cash spigot by cutting welfare programs way back. \n\nIf we leave more money in taxpayers’ pockets, it’ll be harder for public officials to steal it.\n\nI know, crazy talk. \n\nAnd yet — it would work.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"Where money floats around without adequate safeguards, fraud is almost inevitable — and many programs seem almost deliberately designed to facilitate scams. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/29/opinion/minnesotas-somali-scams-get-worse-by-the-day-who-will-pay/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/2025-washington-dc-committee-held-117980011-e1767052038471.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:47:43","author":"Glenn H.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X that he was aware of the video, created by right-wing influencer Nick Shirley, but insisted the FBI had already “surged” investigative resources and personnel to Minnesota as part of its ongoing fraud investigation that has largely targeted Somali immigrants. “The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,” Patel posted Sunday on X. Meanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office defended its ongoing efforts to crack down on fraud when it was asked about the video. “The governor has worked for years to crack down on fraud and ask the state legislature for more authority to take aggressive action,” a spokesperson for the governor’s office said in an email. “He has strengthened oversight — including launching investigations into these specific facilities, one of which was already closed.” The Justice Department has been running a sprawling fraud investigation involving some members of Minnesota’s Somali community for years. In 2022, during the Biden administration, federal prosecutors announced initial indictments in what they called a $250 million scheme to defraud a federally funded child nutrition program. As of last month, prosecutors had charged 77 people. They described Aimee Bock, who is white, as the mastermind of the operation. A jury convicted her in March. Shirley, 23, who describes himself as an independent journalist, put the subject of Minnesota fraud in the spotlight of conservative media in recent days. His report out of Minneapolis was quickly championed by Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and various right-wing outlets. His video has been viewed millions of times on X and YouTube. “Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet,” Shirley said online. “We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day.” Among other things, the video features Shirley in front of what appears to be an inactive child care center in Minneapolis with a sign that reads “Quality Learing Center,” including an apparent misspelling of “learning.” Shirley contends it received $1.9 million “from the government” this year. “This is open and blatant fraud taking place here,” Shirley insists, calling it “just one of the hundreds of child daycare centers here inside of Minneapolis being ran by the Somali population.” Shirley, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, is no stranger to right-wing media. He did a live interview with a protester at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot — who was later sentenced to prison before being pardoned by President Donald Trump — that he posted on YouTube. His YouTube channel says it has 1.2 million followers, and he regularly posts political content, including person-on-the-street interviews from numerous locations. In October, he was a guest at a White House conference on antifa, a decentralized set of extreme left-wing groups. There was no answer when an NBC News reporter called the child care center Monday. A Child Learning Center at that address in Minneapolis is licensed with the state to care for 99 children. The state has fined the facility twice since 2022 for allegedly not performing a required background check, and several violations were listed from its most recent licensing visit in June. The state Department of Children, Youth, and Families did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Shirley’s claim that this facility received $1.9 million in government funding in 2025. But DCYF commissioner Tikki Brown said at a Monday news conference that Quality Learning Center was closed last week and another center that Shirley visited had been shut down earlier. Brown, according to The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, also said the other centers Shirley checked out had been inspected in the last six months and no evidence of fraud was discovered. Walz’s office said in response to an email from NBC News also confirmed that Quality Learning Center had been shuttered and that the state Department of Human Services has “already referred these providers to law enforcement, and law enforcement has already conducted raids.” Shirley, accompanied by a researcher he identifies only as Dave, peppered apparent Somali immigrants at the sites they visited with questions and talked to people who said they lived in the area and insisted they have never seen any children at any of the locations. The Trump administration seized on the fraud scandal this month as it embarked on a crackdown on illegal immigration in Minnesota, which is home to about 80,000 people of Somali descent. Trump delivered several derogatory rants against Somali immigrants following news reports that dozens of people of Somali descent had been convicted in fraud schemes related to Covid relief that netted over $1 billion. “I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said. “I’ll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care. I don’t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason.” Walz blasted Trump for “demonizing” Somali immigrants. “If you commit crimes, you go to jail,” Walz said at an event this month. “Doesn’t matter what your race is, what your ethnicity, religion — but demonizing an entire group of people by their race and their ethnicity, a very group of people who contribute to the vitality — economic, cultural — of this state, is something I was hoping we’d never have to see.” Members of the Trump administration have also called for the resignation of Walz, a Democrat who was former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in last year’s presidential election, for allegedly failing to stem the corruption. Walz was the governor in 2022 when the Justice Department first began charging people in Minnesota with exploiting a federally funded nutrition program for children during the pandemic. “This was a brazen scheme of staggering proportions,” Andrew M. Luger, then the U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, said when the first federal charges were announced.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-surged-resources-mn-daycare-fraud-claims-kash-patel-rcna251373","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251104-kash-patel-zz-6d5a4e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:17:47","author":"Corky Siemaszko,David Ingram","authors":["Corky Siemaszko","David Ingram"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":389958366,"title":"Editorial: Chesapeake school officials shamefully embrace anti-trans panic","text":"The Chesapeake School Board this month effectively moved to ban transgender people from working as teachers and staff, proudly proclaiming its intolerance in a 7-2 vote that prohibited the use of pronouns that differ from employees’ birth certificates.\n\nIn succumbing to trans panic and promoting discrimination against a marginalized group, members of the School Board have made a decision that will reflect poorly on all that the city hopes to achieve. They may be cheering themselves today, but this ignoble act puts them firmly on the wrong side of history.\n\nOn Dec. 15, the School Board formally adopted a policy that discourages employees from “compelling any staff member to address any employee or refer to any employee in a manner that violates the staff member’s constitutionally protected rights” and “providing to a student his or her preferred personal title or pronouns if such preferred personal title or pronouns do not correspond to his or her sex.”\n\nThe effect of that policy is clear: It will single out transgender teachers, staff and students for embarrassment and ridicule. What school officials claim was a measure to improve tolerance in schools instead rips away the right of people in the district to be referred in the way they prefer. It is a clumsy attempt to erase the reality of transgender staff and students in favor of a narrow, outdated view of gender identity.\n\nThe policy reflects a growing and fervent campaign to push transgender Americans further into the shadows. Virginia voters saw this during the recent general election campaign, particularly by Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and John Reid, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. Those candidates sought to echo President Donald Trump’s attack against former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential campaign, which painted Harris as being “for they/them, not for you.”\n\nSingling out vulnerable groups for discrimination isn’t a profile in courage. And it’s extremely disappointing — and harrowing for transgender Americans — that polling suggests Trump’s line was an effective one. The president’s success with it opened the door to further legislative restrictions on transgender rights by the second Trump administration and by many Republican-led states.\n\nTrump’s Jan. 20 executive order about gender identity made it the administration’s policy to only recognize two genders, male and female. The administration has moved to separate transgender service members from the military and to restrict access and funding for gender-affirming health care — for adults as well as children. It guarantees more hardship for these Americans, more anxiety and depression, more suicide attempts and more deaths.\n\nNot that Republicans alone bear complete blame for participating in this ostracization campaign. In October, both U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner voted for a National Defense Authorization Act that included a conservative wish list of anti-trans measures. Twenty-six Democrats voted for the legislation.\n\nFor Hampton Roads and the larger commonwealth, the necessity of the NDAA outweighs the harm it will inflict on transgender Americans who faithfully serve this country, but these are the trade-offs and compromises that continue to push these marginalized people further out of public life. If elected officials such as Kaine and Warner won’t stand up for these Americans, who will?\n\nOne may not be well versed in the biological or physiological research about gender identity to understand that every person deserves to be treated with dignity. That they are entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness promised by the Declaration of Independence. And they should be free to seek economic opportunity, such as employment, without prejudice.\n\nIt’s critical to note that Americans who identify as transgender represent a tiny fraction of our population. Oftentimes these policies have the effect of targeting a handful of people who deserve our defense and advocacy, not our belittlement.\n\nChesapeake officials can frame this however they want, but the intent — and the practical effect — couldn’t be clearer. Their intolerance is a stain on the city and those affected deserve far better from their community leaders.","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/12/29/editorial-chesapeake-school-officials-shamefully-embrace-anti-trans-panic/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2020/02/09/C27UL2T7PVC3DJZ7QYAOSIPEEQ.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:15:54","author":"The Virginian-Pilot And Daily Press Editorial Board","authors":["The Virginian-Pilot And Daily Press Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":390016498,"title":"Los Tigres del Norte debut a new corrido on ‘The Simpsons’","text":"The iconic Mexican norteño group Los Tigres del Norte joined a roster of musical greats including Paul McCartney, U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers with their debut Sunday on “The Simpsons.”\n\nThe group performed an original corrido titled “El Corrido de Pedro y Homero” at the end of the episode, which is now available on Disney+ after airing on Fox.

But I would slip inside the skin of our president.\"\n\n As for why he'd want to embody the 79-year-old president — with whom he's frequently sparred — Colbert had a brief and decisive explanation, saying that if he could be Trump, \"I would resign.\"\n\n “I've anticipated this. No scandal, no confession, no Sturm und Drang,\" Colbert continued. \"Just go, ‘It’s been great. I’m the best, ever. I’m gonna go out on top. I’ve done everything. I’m just gonna go.’ That’s it. It can be a glorious ending, just end it.”\n\n After a moment of consideration, Colbert then wondered if the Freaky Friday-esque experiment would go both ways.\n\n “I have a harrowing follow-up question: Is he taking over my body for 24 hours?” Colbert quipped, joking that he'd tell his wife, “Darling, go see your sister for a while.”\n\n Colbert's remarks are the latest in his ongoing feud with the president, who recently slammed Colbert via Truth Social as a \"pathetic trainwreck with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success.\"\n\n “Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings,\" Trump added. \"Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, ‘put him to sleep,’ NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!”\n\n Trump has been outspoken about his opinion on Colbert in recent months, particularly since the comedian announced in July that his show would be ending in May 2026 after 10 seasons.\n\n News of Colbert's show ending came days after he blasted Paramount, the parent company of CBS, for its July 3 settlement with President Donald Trump for $16 million following a legal battle in which he accused journalists at 60 Minutes of deceptively editing a 2024 interview with his presidential election opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\n Along with his revelation of wanting to switch places with Trump, Colbert also shared during Political Gabfest whether he'd consider running for president in 2028.\n\n \"Absolutely, I should not run for president,\" he said of the frequently asked question from his fans.\n\n \"I understand why you'd want me to,\" he told the audience, before channeling his inner politician: \"I'd have to discuss with my faith leader and my family to see if, once my service on The Late Show ends in May, if I could be of some greater service to this nation that I love so much.\"","summary":"The late-night host did, however, express concern about what Trump might try to do as Colbert if they switched bodies in the hypothetical scenario","url":"https://people.com/stephen-colbert-switch-bodies-donald-trump-11876960","image":"https://people.com/thmb/DpVXd6MAXgwoERRVYUEjAZI8l0o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Stephen-Colbert-Donald-Trump-122925-ab840b8aa54441bbbfaac11cd0604598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 21:13:17","author":"Charmaine Patterson","authors":["Charmaine Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":389945278,"title":"Mayor Pete's secret... Kamala's revenge plot... and Gavin's hidden family weakness: MARK HALPERIN ranks eight Democrats in the running for the White House","text":"The ball hasn't dropped on 2025 but there's already buzz in the air over 2028.\n\nThe unofficial race for the White House has begun even if the candidates won't admit it and their press secretaries would sooner swallow a microphone than confirm anything.\n\nI am picking up an unmistakable energy among the whispering political class. Fundraisers are filling their calendars, donors are getting restless and eager office-seekers are gaming out where they'll work the rope lines for the 2026 midterms in March.\n\nFor Republicans, they're fieldling a small team this year, as President Donald Trump continues to suck up the oxygen in Washington, leaving tiny gulps of air for rumored aspirants like Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and even Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic side is generating a whole heap of speculation. And, while most voters are blissfully ignoring it all, I and others have begun handicapping the field. \n\nThough before I reveal my top eight picks for who will win the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, a few necessary caveats…\n\nOne, it's still early. No one knows what the primary election calendar will look like. The Democratic National Committee hasn't even received applications from the state parties (due in January) as they jockey to maximize their influence on the contest. As former President Joe Biden proved in South Carolina in 2020, a well-positioned primary victory can change everything. Order matters, but so does momentum and timing.\n\nTwo, some major figures will most assuredly end up not running. Right now, the party's vigor is on the progressive wing, but the mood of the electorate seems to change hourly.\n\nNow, without further ado, the eight most likely – as of this moment – Democratic nominees for president in 2028, ranked least likely to most likely.\n\n#8: Bronx Brawler\n\nSome say New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the most likely to win the nomination, others wouldn't rank her at all. But if the base of the party decides it wants a torch-wielding outsider, she becomes instantly formidable.\n\nHer strength is the unmatched grassroots energy she generates. Nobody else on this list can summon a movement the way she can.\n\nHer secret strength is that behind the scenes, she's built more bridges within the party than people assume, reaching out to more moderate members of her own party and even to a few Republicans.\n\nHer weaknesses? Skepticism from centrists, limited experience that comes with relatively young age, 36, and concerns over her seriousness. Running for president means sacrificing on nearly everything else. Insiders question if she's ready for that.\n\n#7: Chicago Style\n\nIf Democrats decide they want a billionaire after all—and stranger things have happened — Illinois governor JB Pritzker is waiting in the wings.\n\nHis greatest strength goes together with his most obvious weakness. With an estimated net worth of $3.7 billion from an inherited Hyatt Hotels fortune, he can self-fund, but many Democrats aren't eager to nominate someone who can buy their own campaign.\n\nHis secret strength is that he's deeply connected to Democratic interest groups, especially labor unions – and wears his working-class sympathies on his sleeve, advocating for minimum wage hikes and forgiving medical debt.\n\n#6: Tinseltown's man\n\nWes Moore is the charismatic governor of Maryland. Hollywood loves him — George Clooney is already aboard — and many Democratic donors and strategists do too. He's got that 'It Factor', a seemingly stellar résumé and the ability to dazzle donors and voters alike.\n\nSecret advantage: This US Army combat veteran is not just charming on camera; he's personally magnetic in the rooms and salons of the Democratic elite, which is where nomination fights are often meaningfully advanced.\n\nHis weakness is that he hasn't been in national politics long – and his accomplishments in public life can be listed on the back of a napkin. If the hype ever races ahead of the record or his glittering bio turns out to be less than all that, the backlash could be intense.\n\n#5: Southern Snoozer\n\nDemocrats dream of a candidate who can appeal to red-state voters and mild-mannered Governor of Kentucky Andy Beshear fits the mold. Some insiders nearly demanded that I place him higher. Still, others don't believe he belongs on the list at all.\n\nHis strength is that he looks like a president out of central casting and – believe it or not – that matters enormously in identity-oriented Democratic circles right now. His appeal appears to come from a steady calm persona — never rattled, never theatrical, reassuring to jittery party elders who crave stability.\n\nBut he's not exactly electric on stage. And, fair or not, Kentucky politics is not the big time. Some wonder whether he has the grits to withstand the brutality of a modern presidential campaign.\n\n#4: She's Baaaack!\n\nI didn't place Kamala Harris in my top eight just a few weeks ago, but she has begun to lean more openly into the notion that she's considering a run, with those close to her making it clear her recent interviews and book tour stop announcements are meant to send the signal that she should not be overlooked by the Great Speculators.\n\nHer known strengths are enormous: a national profile, deep relationships with core Democratic constituencies and the historic weight of being a former vice president. A lesser-known strength: privately, she is far looser, funnier, and more natural than the cautious politician Americans see on television. If she showed that version more often, some of her critics might soften.\n\nHer weaknesses are familiar: inconsistent execution, difficulty making crisp decisions under pressure, and skepticism from donors and strategists who simply don't believe she can win. That's a heavy headwind.\n\n#3: Mr Mayor\n\nPete Buttigieg is a prodigy of modern Democratic politics. He came on stronger as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who can speak six foreign languages and won a top stop as Biden's Transportation Secretary. But from there, he's seemed to have stalled.\n\nHis main strength is verbal: he can talk anyone into anything, or, at least, to anyone about anything. Bill Clinton likes to describe people like Buttigieg as folks who can 'talk the owls down from the trees.'\n\nHis secret strength is that he and his team are ruthlessly strategic when they need to be, ready, for instance, to stealthily drop opposition research on a rival when the time is right. But he still has a Black voter problem — a fatal one if he can't fix it. And some say he's too cerebral, too tidy, too much 'PowerPoint as a person.'\n\nPassion counts in politics. So does messiness. Buttigieg sometimes feels laminated.\n\n#2: Pennsylvania Pretzel\n\nJosh Shapiro is the popular governor of Keystone state, who may have already won the political lottery by being passed over by Harris to be her running mate in 2024.\n\nHis strength is obvious: he's a strong communicator, pragmatic progressive, pro-Israel and middle-of-the-road enough to win over moderates, maybe even some MAGA types.\n\nSecret advantage: He is favored by many of the party's power players — Pelosi, the Obamas, the Clintons.\n\nWeaknesses? The progressive left doesn't trust him, and some party insiders believe he hasn't shown the necessary steel and determination under pressure. In a nomination fight, you can't let incoming fire merely bounce off — you must send some back. Some members of Team Shapiro on aiming to fix this flaw pronto.\n\n#1: California Dream\n\nIt may come as no surprise that Gavin Newsom sits atop the list – not because he's the handsomest governor since the invention of hair gel, though that never hurts – but because he has momentum.\n\nHe's commonly treated like a shadow president in some Democratic circles – meaning he is driving conversation on terms that will be favorable to his candidacy.\n\nNot to mention, he has buckets of donor money, an established national profile and he exceeds the aura of a man auditioning for higher office every time he opens his mouth.\n\nThose are his known strengths. His unknown strength is that he has a killer staff—professional, experienced, and capable of building a national machine at frightening speed.\n\nWeakness? He can come across as a political show pony, all gleam and angles. Quietly, those around him say his ambition sometimes cools at inconvenient moments, often fueled by a family who is not super keen on a race.\n\nThat's the early, very early, list. It will shift. Some will swap out and in as the months go forward. And if you disagree — good. It means you're paying attention.","summary":"The unofficial race for the White House has begun even if the candidates won't admit it.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15409935/2028-white-house-democrats-newsom-harris-halperin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/29/17/105085417-0-image-m-18_1767030058660.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/09/2811544641708836953/1024x576_MP4_2811544641708836953.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-29 21:02:30","author":"Editor,Mark Halperin","authors":["Editor","Mark Halperin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":389913054,"title":"Byron Donalds faces racist attacks in Florida’s ugly GOP gubernatorial primary","text":"Florida’s Republican gubernatorial primary is getting ugly. \n\nAhead of next year’s election, nominees are trying to set themselves apart and demonstrate their political viability as they seek to outflank front-runner Byron Donalds, the staunch Trump loyalist who has received the president’s endorsement.\n\nThat desire has led to some eye-popping remarks from fellow GOP candidate James Fishback, who has continually resorted to one insult in particular to undermine Donalds: “slave.” \n\nNBC News reported on Fishback’s ties to allies of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis along with his controversial statements, including his claim that Donalds, who is Black, is a “slave” to “corporate interests” and “tech bros.” Last week, Fishback doubled and tripled down on his racist slur, telling Florida Politics that Donalds “has no right to complain” and shouldn’t be offended by the slur because, Fishback said, the representative’s ancestors weren’t enslaved in the United States.\n\nHis quote invoked themes popularized by some Black conservatives in the extremely online “American Descendants of Slaves” movement, who’ve sought to drive a wedge among Black people by differentiating those with recent immigrant histories from those without such history. \n\nPer Florida Politics, Fishback said:\n\nByron Donalds is a tether. He is not an American descendant of slaves. So when he cries like he has over the last couple of weeks because I call him a slave to the (American Israeli Public Affairs Committee), a slave to corporate interests, a slave to the pro-immigration lobby that has hurt every race of Americans but has also hurt Black Americans who disproportionately work in food, hospitality, leisure, and customer service. He is in no position, has no right to be complaining about me calling him a slave when he has absolutely no direct descendant of slavery in his family. He’s from Panama. He’s from Belize. His dad’s from Jamaica.\n\nOn Friday, Fishback shared a story on social media about Donalds’ fundraising, with a caption that called Donalds a “SLAVE who was auctioned off for $31 million.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/j_fishback/status/2004569442802667753\n\nDonalds’ office didn’t respond to MS NOW’s request for comment Monday on Fishback’s attacks. \n\nDonalds is one of few Black Republicans in Congress, and he’s often made it his duty to downplay racism in American society, such as last year, when he whitewashed and romanticized the Jim Crow era as a period when “the Black family was together” and voted conservatively. As my former colleague Joy Reid explained to him around that time, the notion was absurd, considering many Black people weren’t allowed to vote at all during that time because of the whole racism thing.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Donalds is now facing the same sort of racist attacks he helped fuel against Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential bid last year. After Trump and the conservative movement spread baseless misinformation that Harris wasn’t truly Black because she also boasts Indian heritage, Donalds downplayed the controversy and appeared to cast doubt himself on Harris’ Blackness.\n\nNow, it appears he’s getting a taste of his own MAGA medicine as an opponent to his right flank attempts to pull his Black card and label him a “slave.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/byron-donalds-faces-racist-attacks-in-floridas-ugly-gop-gubernatorial-primary","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767039767/251229-byron-donalds-es/251229-byron-donalds-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 20:51:01","author":"Max Burns","authors":["Max Burns"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":389918446,"title":"Senate pressure mounts as Minnesota fraud scandal continues to unfold","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Senator Jim Banks, R-Ind., is pushing for a federal investigation after sending a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calling for the agency to construct investigative reports of Somali networks as the roughly $9 billion fraud scandal in Minnesota continues to unfold. Banks serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), which oversees major areas of healthcare funding and policy. The Indiana senator pointed out that the Minnesota Child Care Assistance Program is administered by the state government, but is largely funded by federal tax dollars through two programs that provide roughly $300 million in federal childcare subsidies to Minnesota. On Sunday, Banks sent a letter to Alex J. Adams, the Assistant Secretary for Family Support, leading the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS.

Federal authorities in Minnesota opened a separate probe in 2022 into Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit that prosecutors later said played a central role in what would become one of the most extensive COVID-era relief fraud cases ever uncovered. As the case unfolded, investigators identified roughly $250 million in false claims, with 78 people ultimately facing criminal charges. Prosecutors have indicated the broader fraud tied to the scheme could reach as high as $9 billion. GOP LAWMAKER UNVEILS WALZ ACT AFTER BILLIONS LOST IN MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL A significant number of those charged were members of Minnesota’s Somali community. The scandal also sparked internal backlash within the state government. More than 400 Minnesota employees raised concerns that Gov. Tim Walz, who later became the Democratic vice presidential nominee on the Kamala Harris ticket, failed to respond adequately to repeated warnings about fraud and allowed retaliation against whistleblowers who tried to bring the misconduct to light. Banks notes the importance of ensuring everyone behind the scandal is brought to justice, as well as holding elected officials and those who had responsibility over the matter accountable.

It's true that some things just come out of the blue. \n\nBut many disasters are entirely predictable, and a good chunk of them could be prevented or mitigated if people made common-sense decisions based on clear cost/benefit calculations. \n\nYet time and again, policymakers will pretend that problems don't exist or even pursue policies that will make things worse, even though they have every reason to know that when the crisis comes, it will be a disaster.\n\nSometimes that is because, in the short term, they or their friends benefit from the policies. Sometimes, because averting them will cause short-term pain, and they are too afraid or too worried about losing their jobs to do what is necessary. And sometimes they believe that \"This time will be different,\" or they are caught up in a mania. \n\nWhatever the reason, it's the people who warn about the looming disaster who are seen as the bad guys, and even when they are proven to be right, most of the time, they are resented. \n\nConsider just a couple of examples:the welfare fraud that is finally being exposed, and the coming crash in gender ideology. In each of these cases, the people who had the power to avert the crisis went out of their way to make things worse for short-term gain, leaving a trail of victims and the entire society worse off.\n\nI chose those three because there was no particular lack of foresight or credible warnings, and the policymakers chose to exacerbate them for political gain. \n\nStill no coverage in NYT, WaPo, CNN, or Minneapolis Star-Tribune of massive fraud being uncovered in Minnesota.

I have little doubt that when all is said and done, tens or hundreds of billions of dollars will have flown out of our coffers to scammers, and I have about the same amount of doubt that high-level politicians and policymakers knew about much of the fraud. \n\nConsider the Daycare fraud that goes on in Minnesota. Law enforcement has known about it to some extent at least for about 8 years, and even prosecuted a few cases back then. \n\nThis is from a 2018 Minnesota criminal prosecution against Somali daycare fraudsters.In surveillance video, Somali parents would take their kids to the daycare, check them in, and then leave with them moments later.The owners of the daycare would then bill the state for a… pic.twitter.com/oXgbl2qtYj— Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 29, 2025\n\nWalz: “This is what happens when they scapegoat and this is what they happens when they no longer hide the idea of white supremacy…” Shirley: “Tim wants votes… There are entire apartment complexes where white people have been pushed out of these apartment complexes because Somalians have taken over.”“If you have a hundred thousand people that will vote for you … you're gonna enable and let this stuff happen.”\n\nEverybody is \"shocked\" by Nick Shirley's uncovering more than $100 million in likely fraud in just a day, but I wasn't, and I am willing to bet that nobody at high levels of government is either. I know legislators who have been trying to fight this for years and who have been vilified for doing so. \n\nWalz has known about this all along, and his administration has facilitated it for exactly the reasons Nick Shirley said. That was not a genius insight, with all due respect to Nick, but an obvious one. And even now, when the exposure of the fraud is an existential threat, many politicians are scared of the Somali vote, which has become so strong for the Democrats. \n\nThe Somali fraud complex is huge. Daycare fraud, autism centers, Feeding Our Future...The tab will grow past $10 billion in just a few years, and anybody who cares to know about it does. \n\nBut...for all involved, the incentives to keep it going were huge, even when they knew a cliff was at the end of the road. The incentive structure for maintaining the status quo was too great, and the problems were always in the future. \n\nThe same was true of gender ideology. Liberals wanted a new civil rights crusade, and the trans issue seemed to fit the bill after gay marriage passed. It appealed to the AWFLs and satisfied the big activist groups that give awards and money, and happened to make a lot of money for politically connected and wealthy doctors. \n\nSome people got caught up in the mania, but many more secretly worried that this was a bad idea; but opposing it meant paying a very high political price and perhaps career suicide, so they jumped on the bandwagon. \n\nIt paid dividends, until it didn't. Ask Kamala Harris about that, for instance, and take a look at the popularity of the Democratic Party. But even now, when the political price to be paid is high to stay on that bandwagon, the Democrats are staying because the true crash hasn't come. Everybody can see it coming, but when Gavin Newsom and Seth Moulton tried to pull back, they were whipped into line. \n\nIt will take another massive loss at the ballot box, and one that is totally predictable, to break the spell. \n\nWe face countless crises that are totally predictable, and in many cases, the people who are charged with averting them know they are coming and will do nothing. Whether it is dealing with the national debt, military procurement practices, Social Security, Medicare, or massive fraud in government, the short-term costs of doing the right thing exceed, in their minds, the long-term benefit.\n\nTrump was elected to break the stalemate, and at least he has the courage to attack the status quo. But as you can see, many Congressmen do not.\n\nCan he succeed? Not in one term. Without a MAGA successor, it's hard to see how things improve in the long run. So we better work hard to elect a successor who is willing to take on the status quo.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2025/12/29/nothing-happens-until-things-are-broken-n3810315","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/342/989b7995-bc8a-4f78-9541-0662ab916506.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 20:30:04","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.546},{"id":389950456,"title":"ROOKE: Democrats Willing To Chase Political Pipe Dream Straight Off A Cliff","text":"Democrats seem to be feeling energized by some recent positive results and a classic piece of liberal media optimism that paints a picture of supposed cracks in President Donald Trump’s rural support due to tariffs and policy reforms. But history shows they might be in over their skis.\n\nPolitico reported Saturday that Democrats believe they have a chance to gain significant support from voters in GOP strongholds in rural America. The story exemplifies how the Democratic Party, fueled by wishful thinking and a visceral desire to beat Trump at any cost, is poised to squander significant resources on an illusory opportunity in rural America. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) rolled out an eight-figure investment into a first-ever dedicated rural outreach program, complete with staff hires, voter mobilization, and ads featuring disgruntled farmers.\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be strategic. Democrats cite Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s November gubernatorial win in which she captured 46 percent of rural voters and outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris in 48 of 52 rural localities by attacking Trump’s tariffs and emphasizing affordability concerns. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\n“We have a unique opening because of all that’s happening with this administration,” Democratic Illinois Rep. Nikki Budzinski told Politico. She added that farmers and rural voters, who make up a significant portion of her district, “might be listening in a more unique way than they maybe have ever in the past. And we need to walk through that door.”\n\n Compete everywhere… this isn’t just about one cycle. We must have a longterm strategic plan to re-engage and eventually win back rural communities. #DirtRoadDemocrats @DirtRoadPAC https://t.co/0M0j1goVcA — Jaime Harrison (@harrisonjaime) December 1, 2025\n\nPolitical realities should show this as a profound misallocation of Democratic Party resources. Their move is driven more by ideological fervor and headline-chasing than by prudent political calculus. For example, Spanberger’s success in Virginia is notable but does not translate nationally. Virginia’s rural areas are influenced by proximity to suburban federal workers, and her centrist branding resonated in a state with unique demographics. Replicating her rural gains in deeper-red rural heartlands — like the Midwest or the Great Plains — requires overcoming decades of perceived Democratic neglect.\n\nDemocrats already lost a bid to pick up a rural seat in Tennessee. Republican candidate Matt Van Epps beat Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn for retiring Republican Rep. Mark Green’s vacant seat Dec. 2. Van Epps’ district is a quintessential red stronghold, stretching from parts of Nashville to rural Tennessee. Republicans have historically dominated here. Still, Democrats deployed their new affordability campaign strategy hoping for an upset.\n\nIn the end, Van Epps beat Behn by 9 points. While narrower than Trump’s 22-point win over Harris, Van Epps’ victory showed a hole in Democrats’ new plan.\n\nNicholas Jacobs and Daniel Shea note in their 2023 book, The Rural Voter: The Politics of Place and the Disuniting of America, that perceptions of Democratic indifference are deeply entrenched among rural voters. Authenticity and sustained presence are required to rebuild trust, not sporadic ad buys or listening tours. These voters still remember what happened to their family farms and rural communities after elite-driven trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which devastated local economies, imposed regulatory burdens on farming, and created cultural disconnects.\n\n Rural Americans deserve to be seen, heard and supported. That isn’t happening in D.C. Democrats can change that – and we plan to. https://t.co/zilveS3ubr — Andy Beshear (@AndyBeshearKY) December 9, 2025\n\nAdditionally, the opportunity cost for Democrats is staggering. Midterms historically favor the opposition, but only if resources are deployed efficiently. Diverting eight figures to erode margins in unwinnable rural districts dilutes efforts in competitive suburbs or urban turnout operations where Democrats are more likely to generate positive voter support. Democrats even admit that rural communities won’t be a gold mine of election-day votes. They merely seek to chip away at 80+ Trump margins.\n\nThe real reason Democrats are touting this campaign strategy and Politico is giving them the runway to do it is because it keeps donors engaged. It’s performative politics for elites sitting inside their offices, visualizing narratives of Democratic inroads in Trump country to generate media buzz.\n\nThe issue is that it spreads a bruised and battered Democratic Party, still recovering from 2024, too thin. They are diverting millions from winnable suburbs or shoring up their base, all for marginal erosion in places they’ll never flip. This Politico narrative offers false hope post-2024 that Democrats have been hoping for to drum up much-needed donor dollars, but in return could forfeit real opportunities elsewhere. (ROOKE: Trump Admin Sends Much-Needed Lifeline To American Farmers Just In Nick Of Time)\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Republicans shouldn’t remain vigilant in their duties to support rural America. After all, complacency is why Republicans were able to win over blue-collar voters after decades of being staunchly pro-Democrat. It’s now more important than ever for the GOP to deliver tangible results.

However, a large portion of that group is now sounding the alarm on his apparent abandonment of some campaign promises, including tackling inflation and the high cost of living, according to the report. \n\nAn overlapping group also balked at the administration’s deportation policies, according to the report, which was conducted by NBC and produced by Syracuse University and research firms Engagious and Sago. \n\nVoters in the focus groups were nearly unanimous in approving of Trump’s performance in the months immediately after he took office – but that started to change as the year went on, according to the report. \n\n\"Many of these voters gave President Trump a long runway well into the summer because they believed that he understands how business works better than they do and that his own fortune would eventually translate to enriching the country and their own finances or because they felt so strongly that unchecked immigration was a huge problem that needed a huge fix,\" said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship.\n\n\"But as the year wore on, we have seen a shift among these voters collectively, cracks in their faith, more questioning, oscillating or outright change of heart about Trump,\" Talev said. \"What we almost never see is a wish for a do-over vote or a rush toward Democrats for the answer.”\n\nMany of those surveyed were divided on Trump’s tariffs from the start. Others expressed disappointment that the president hasn’t focused more on tackling inflation. Even still, many gave the president grace in failing to make good on some of his campaign promises. \n\n“I think he has a grand master plan that most of us probably don’t understand,” Rozlyn C., a 44-year-old Georgia voter of Cuban descent, said. “I have faith that he, a hundred percent, has the best interest of our country at heart.” \n\nFewer than half of Trump voters across four focus groups said they felt he had made fighting inflation a top priority, according to the report. \n\n“I expected him to be aggressive in a lot of different areas and he’s doing exactly that – being aggressive in a lot of different areas of focus that concern the U.S. citizens. Every few days you’re hearing something different and you’re constantly seeing him at work, working, getting stuff done,” said 56-year-old independent Dorris S. \n\nHowever, some Trump voters were more critical of his efforts to combat inflation. \n\nRobert L., a 54-year-old Virginia resident who backed a Democrat in a November election for governor, said Trump’s comments about inflation improving are “delusional” and show that he is “out of touch.” \n\nAnother Virginia resident, Justin K., said he didn’t think Trump “tried at all” to tackle inflation. \n\n“He’s been focused on prosecuting his political enemies, pardoning people,” he said. “I don’t even think that there’s much a president can do on inflation, but I think that this was a kind of situation where he just said it to get elected.” \n\nThe president’s widespread tariffs also revealed a vast divide amongst his voters, with some voters expressing concerns about them hurting businesses. \n\n“I think that it’s ridiculous that we haven’t been charging tariffs for decades and we’re starting to equalize it,” said Hector L., a 55-year-old North Carolina voter who was born in Puerto Rico.\n\nHowever, some voters felt the tariffs unfairly impacted Americans. \n\n“Tariffs are a tax on the American people. That’s who pays for it, so I don’t support it,” said David S., a 47-year-old from New Jersey. “Every tariff that is put in place, from when Biden is putting ‘em in place, Trump putting them in place, they are taxes on the people who are importing. The people who are buying those imports are paying the tax.”\n\nMeanwhile, other voters said they were optimistic about Trump’s economic policies, stating they feel the country would still be worse off if Kamala Harris or Joe Biden had been elected instead. \n\n“I feel that if we were in the hands of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, that our country would be doing a lot worse than it already was. I feel like Trump has amended some of those wrongs that were done,” said Harmony D., a 26-year-old Michigan resident and independent who has voted for Trump twice. \n\nOther voters, however, called out Trump’s economic practices as being solely for his own benefit. \n\n“It’s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there’s no consequences,” Virginia’s Justin K. said.\n\nSome of those voters surveyed for the focus group also expressed concerns over Trump’s tackling of immigration issues, namely the administration’s deportation policies. \n\n“When it comes to immigration, a lot of respondents told us this year, ‘I like what the President is doing, but I don’t like how he’s doing it.’ This suggests they’re struggling to reconcile their vote for the President with executive actions they find troubling,” said Rich Thau of Engagious, who moderated the focus group sessions. \n\nThe report from NBC comes as Trump hits an all-time low approval rating of just 36 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll. \n\nIt’s the worst rating of any U.S. president at the end of their first year in power in the last 50 years. It also ties with Trump’s approval rating at the end of his first term in December 2017, when he received the same approval rating. \n\nAnother poll conducted by the NBC News Decision Desk last month found that both mainstream Republicans and those who identify as MAGA reported dissatisfaction with Trump.\n\nThe latest polling reveals a decline amongst his normally dedicated MAGA base. Although 70 percent continue to support him, the president has seen an eight-point drop from 78 percent in April.\n\nSupport for the president has fallen amongst mainstream Republicans, too, with approval dropping from 38 percent in April to 35 percent.\n\nThe poll also noted that there has been a drop in the number of Republicans who identify as MAGA. In April, 57 percent of Republicans polled considered themselves MAGA, compared to 43 percent who did not. \n\nThat number has now dropped down to 50-50, according to the poll.","summary":"White House’s handling of the economy and its deportation policy raising concern among Trump supporters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-voters-turn-midturn-elections-b2891727.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/29/16/50/GettyImages-2253856109.jpeg?crop=5687,3791.3,x0,y0.3&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YzF6xoHi-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-29 19:58:54","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":389940226,"title":"Will Minnesota Prosecute Nick Shirley for His Flagrant Act of Journalism?","text":"As of right now, Shirley's post with the 42-minute video of his investigation has more than 110 million views on X.\n\n🚨 Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet.

He's elbows-deep in the thing and not only knew about the fraud, but \"systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, [and] repression.\" Here's more from that report:\n\n\"Instead of partnership, we got the full weight of retaliation by Tim Walz, certain DFL members, and an indifferent mainstream media,\" Minnesota DHS writes. \"It's scary, isolating, and left us wondering who we can turn to.\"\"In addition to retaliating against whistleblower (sic), Tim Walz disempowered the Office of the Legislative Auditor, allowing agencies to disregard their audit findings and guidance. Media and politicians supporting Tim Walz or the DFL-agenda attacked whistleblowers who were trying to raise red flags on fraudulent activities,\" the post continues.\"This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz. Agency leaders appointed by Tim Walz willfully disregarded rules and laws to keep fraud reports quiet — even to the extent of threatening the families of whistleblowers,\" the post reads.\"As staff, we firsthand witnessed and observed fraud happening, yet we were shut down, reassigned, and told to keep quiet. Sometimes more. Leadership did not want to appear to discriminate against certain communities and were unwilling to take action such as stopping fraud, that would have an adverse impact on their image,\" the group wrote.\n\nThis is clearly a guy who has no problem retaliating against whistleblowers and someone who is cruel and petty.\n\nOn top of that, Attorney General Keith Ellison appears to have had a hand in the scandal, vowing to battle state agencies that were flagging applications for potential fraud.\n\nThat being said, I have to wonder this: will Minnesota attempt to charge Nick Shirley for his flagrant act of journalism? \n\nI fear they might.\n\nAnd the precedent is there, thanks to Kamala Harris. Back in 2016, Kamala Harris, who was then California's Attorney General, filed charges against pro-life journalists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. Why? Two years prior, they blew the lid off a story that showed Planned Parenthood was illegally harvesting and selling the body parts of aborted babies for profit.\n\nHarris got that ball rolling, and her successor, Xavier Becerra, filed felony charges against the two after Harris left the position and joined the Senate.\n\nOn top of that, her office illegally colluded with abortion providers and pro-abortion advocacy groups while she pursued that criminal case.\n\nAnd I'm not the only one to think this, either.\n\nI mean, why not?What’s the difference between Keith Ellison and Hasan Piker’s worldview? pic.twitter.com/MVDOdCU6j6— Mark Ashworth (@marklarflash) December 28, 2025\n\n\"idk what kind of fraud somalis in daycares are doing but i think it's a separate crime to try and storm w a camera into a daycare w kids in it???\" wrote Hasan Piker (spelling in context).\n\nAnd attorney Marc J.

They're the ones who like to find scapegoats, like the video maker they threw in prison after the 2012 U.S. Embassy attack in Benghazi that happened on Obama's watch, and while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.\n\nSo I can easily envision a world in which Shirley is arrested and hauled into court for exposing the fraud. Democrats will say he broke some other laws, of course, but we'll all know the real reason why they're punishing him.\n\nHere's hoping that doesn't happen, but I'm not optimistic it won't.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/12/29/vip-will-mn-charge-nick-shirley-n2668579","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/342/989b7995-bc8a-4f78-9541-0662ab916506.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 19:00:44","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.584},{"id":389923856,"title":"Maya Rudolph reveals what Barack Obama told her after unaired “SNL” sketch: 'Still don't know what that means'","text":"Barack Obama is so rhetorically gifted, he can shut down a sketch with a single comment that no one even understands.\n\n \"Do you want to tell everyone the first time you met Barack Obama and who you were dressed as?\" Amy Poehler asked her old pal Maya Rudolph during a recent live taping of her Good Hang podcast.\n\n \"Yes, I would love to,\" Rudolph obliged.\n\n The Saturday Night Live vets proceeded to recall Rudolph first encountering the 44th president \"dressed as Shirley MacLaine,\" and then again dressed as Obama himself. The sketch has become infamous because it never went to air — at least with Rudolph starring as Obama. After all these years, she's finally revealing why.\n\n \"It was a sketch where you and [Darrell Hammond] were Hillary and Bill Clinton at a Halloween party,\" Rudolph explained. \"I remember Barack was new on the scene, looking smooth. And at that time, I think Barack Obama masks were popular, because he was the new candidate. So the joke was going to be that I come in like, 'I'm Barack Obama!' and then he taps me on the shoulder with his mask and takes the mask off and he goes, 'Oh my God, it's the real Barack Obama.'\"\n\n The sketch, also featuring Fred Armisen, Will Forte, Bill Hader, Simon Rich, and Jason Sudeikis as various Democratic operatives, was to air as the cold open to the fourth episode of season 33 in 2007. \"We did that at dress,\" Rudolph said. \"And that was it. We did not do it at air. Thank God.\"\n\n Perplexed, Poehler asked Rudolph, \"Why? Do we know why?\" Rudolph's response was simple: \"I do. I mean, I did not have a take on Barack Obama at all.\"\n\n Rudolph said it was a brief and enigmatic exchange during dress rehearsal with the politician, then a senator from Illinois who had just launched his first bid for the presidency, that put a kabosh on her plan to double him in the sketch.\n\n \"I remember the first time we saw each other was when we were about to walk out onstage,\" she recalled. \"I'm there waiting in my little Brooks Brothers suit, and I think we bound my boobs, and I used to play Scott Joplin, so I had my Scott Joplin wig on and I was standing there... he came over and I said, 'Well, what do you think?' And all he said to me was, 'I don't wear a three-button suit.' I still don't know what that means. That's like a guy knowledge thing.\"\n\n Rudolph can admit that she \"didn't have a good impression\" of Obama, though it's a somewhat improbable claim, given her lauded characterization of Kamala Harris during the recent presidential election cycle, and her previous appearances as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\n Though Rudolph's Obama impression didn't ultimately make the cut, a revised version of the sketch did open the 2007 episode. It marked the debut of Jason Sudeikis' impression of Joe Biden, and saw Obama trade subtle barbs with Poehler's Clinton, whom he would run against and eventually defeat in the 2008 primary election. Obama was also given the honor of delivering the famed cut to credits, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\"\n\n You can watch the rest of Maya Rudolph's appearance on the Good Hang podcast above.","summary":"Rudolph laughed when recalling her canned impression of the former president, \"I did not have a take on Barack Obama at all.\"","url":"https://ew.com/maya-rudolph-reveals-what-barack-obama-told-her-after-unaired-snl-sketch-11872863","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/MndBXN_ddhnbj5W9hy8zMYF5Zhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Maya-Rudolph-Obama-121825-e8092a11169c46aeb910ffd91a1d600c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 19:00:00","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":389943244,"title":"Sister Bay trustee, Husby's owner allegedly burned Charlie Kirk shirt","text":"Chad Kodanko, a Sister Bay village trustee and part-owner of Husby's Food and Spirits, reportedly set a Charlie Kirk sweatshirt on fire, prompting threats and leading to his decision to leave the business and resign from the village board.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly transpired, but Kodanko apologized for his \"inappropriate behavior.\" The Door County Sheriff's Office said there is no active investigation because the office is waiting for the complainant to provide more information about what happened.\n\nWisconsin Right Now, a conservative outlet, first reported that Kodanko allegedly burned a bartender's sweatshirt in front of employees on Dec. 12.

The order had been made by Joe Biden’s administration.Kenneal Patterson – The Daily Beast: The headline insists veterans beg Ron DeSantis to stop killing them, and the copy states he is “slaughtering” vets. Small matter that these are individuals on death row for severely heinous crimes.McKenzie Funk – ProPublica: The outlet delivered a scathing exposé on the nightmare flights involving immigrants being deported. All the interviews with flight attendants took place during the Biden administration.\n\nIn a scathing piece, the claim is that Trump tried to get a congresswoman into his bed on Air Force One. What actually happened was that he asked a pregnant Anna Paulina Luna – with her husband – if she was uncomfortable, and if she needed to rest, he said she was welcome to use the bed on the plane. (Congratulations, Erkki!)\n\nThe new revelations reveal how Trump reportedly offered a female congresswoman his bed, as long as she kept it a secret from his wife.https://t.co/FasBSrXAQv— The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) March 17, 2025\n\nPRESENTATION PARADOX (When Initial Claims in a Piece Are Contradicted in the Report)\n\nFred Harter – Associated Press: The claim is made that HIV rates were spiking in Ethiopia due to DOGE cuts to foreign aid, except they measured this with infection rates from 2024.Ruth Marcus – Washington Post: The columnist claimed Trump lorded over the worst two weeks of a presidency and described him as a tyrant. Her proof: The sweeping way he was curtailing government influence.Karoun Demirjian, Sharon LaFraniere – The New York Times: In a lengthy piece detailing accusations made against Pete Hegseth ahead of his confirmation hearing, they detailed at length how his ex-sister-in-law claimed he abused her sister. Eighteen paragraphs later, they got around to a small detail: His ex-wife denied all of the claims.Alex Thompson – Axios: In a dose of oblivious comedy, after their book “Original Sin” came out, Alex Thompson defended a post showing clips of Jake Tapper denying Biden’s condition. Alex resorted to the excuses previously made of Biden, saying they were cheap fake videos of Jake.\n\nRon Bousso – Reuters\n\nAfter Spain suffered a massive blackout throughout much of the country, the report was headlined that we cannot blame this on renewable energy sources. This is repeated in the first sentence, and then the second sentence declares it was due to the management of the renewables grid. Deeper, Bousso cites the collapse of the solar power system. (Congratulations, Ron!)\n\nDon’t blame renewables for Spain’s power outage https://t.co/T2Nnch72eb https://t.co/T2Nnch72eb— Reuters (@Reuters) April 30, 2025\n\nHOAX & CHANGE (Reports on Completely Fabricated Events)\n\nMOMS DEMAND / EVERYTOWN – Many area news outlets ran a speech given by a former student at a Kentucky high school during an anti-gun rally. The problem was that no one in the groups vetted the speaker or his story of a school shooting that never took place.Bevan Hurley – The Times of London: In a bizarre tale, the paper first ran a piece where Bill de Blasio was critical of Zohran Mamdani. Then the former mayor denied the entire report. Then the paper claimed it had been targeted by a hoaxer posing as de Blasio. THEN, the whole story was revealed: The reporter emailed a person actually named Bill de Blasio, but he was not the actual mayor.Jack Smith / DOJ – While outlets were filled with complaints about allegedly improper lawfare, they shied away from the reveal that Jack Smith’s Arctic Frost investigation was a sweeping violation. Among his overreach efforts was investigating America First Legal Foundation for possible involvement in the January 6 activity. The organization had to come out to inform the press that it was not even formed until months after that date.Zohran Mamdani – Outlets energetically reported on the mayoral candidate’s claim that his aunt suffered after 9/11 because she was insulted for wearing a hijab. Then it was learned that his only aunt who is a Muslim lived out of the country at the time.\n\nDaniel Patrick Sheehan – Morning Call\n\nFor days, the press complex was filled with outrage that an elderly man died in ICE custody. When it was said that the agency had no record of this death, it became that he had been deported but died when held in a hospital in Guatemala. Then, authorities recognized that the photo being circulated was of a man from Chile who died about a decade ago. Since then, the family that fed this story had gone dark. (Congratulations, Daniel!)\n\nAnother HOAX!Luis Leon was never deported by ICE.Luis Leon did not die in the custody of ICE.Our ICE agents are already facing an 830% increase in assaults against them. The journalistic malpractice must end. pic.twitter.com/nEMlxSYYFt— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) July 21, 2025\n\nPOUNCE OF PREVENTION (when the press recasts stories to conservative reactions)\n\nJulia Ornedo – The Daily Beast: When it was revealed that Joe Biden was diagnosed with advanced cancer, clearly hidden during his term, it was said Republicans wanted to turn that into a conspiracy.Jacob Wendler – Politico: After the revelation of the grisly murder of a Ukrainian female in North Carolina, Jake said she was dragged into a political messaging war.Josh Fiallo – The Daily Beast: After the Minnesota school shooting, MAGA “seized” on the attacker being trans.Phillip M. Bailey – USA Today: When the disturbing Jay Jones texts about murdering his political opponents came out, USA Today saw a problem when Republicans pounced on the contents.\n\nCamille Von Kaenel – Politico\n\nAs the California wildfires raged and Democrat incompetence was exposed from the mayor’s office all the way up to Gov. Gavin Newsom, she brought the charge that pointing out the raft of problems was a case of Republicans seizing on the disaster and politicizing it. (Congratulations, Camille!)\n\nRepublicans are blaming Dem policies for the catastrophic wildfires tearing through Los Angeles. 👉 https://t.co/pp7CimBTaI pic.twitter.com/AR97OkuAJq— POLITICO (@politico) January 9, 2025\n\nMATCHING MEDIA MEMORANDUM (When Outlets Suspiciously Deliver the Same Reporting)\n\nThe Ambush Memo – After Trump kicked out Volodymyr Zelensky after the disastrous visit to the Oval Office, the common report was that Trump “ambushed” the Ukrainian leader.The Chaos Memo – With no real indicator why, numerous sources began describing the Trump administration with “chaos” at the same time.The Antifa Memo – Within a week, the common report going out was that Antifa is not an organization and that no one could define what it is.The Farm Memo – There was an explosion of reports that ICE agents had arrested children at a farm, avoiding the fact that minors were working there and that it was a marijuana growing facility.\n\nIn order to complain about the attacks taking place on drug cartels off the coast of Venezuela, many outlets claimed the military was targeting fishing boats. This, despite the videos showing hits on high-speed watercraft with quad outboard engines and no fishing gear present.\n\n🔥 “FISHING BOATS?” Fox News’ @JoeConchaTV blasts “foolish and pathetic” liberal media and Dems for pushing 'fishing boats' narrative in coverage of Trump’s strikes on suspected drug boats“The memos clearly went out: fishing boats. We saw in that montage over and over again.… pic.twitter.com/XEwnOwCKuo— TV News Now (@TVNewsNow) December 12, 2025\n\nPROSE & CONTRADICTION (Managing to Disqualify Claims in the Same Report)\n\nScott MacFarlane – CBS News: Amazingly, MacFarlane found it controversial to declare drug cartels as terror organizations, and then he showed a display recognizing the 100,000 deaths from fentanyl in this country.Theodore Schleifer, Jacob Reber – The New York Times: As the press was consumed with the messaging from the first No Kings protest, the paper obliviously declared the marriage of Alex Soros and Huma Abedin as one of “Liberal Royalty.”Jill Lawrence – The Bulwark: In a decidedly un-conservative stance, Jill declared it was time to have bold discussions on transgender issues. She says the Democrats need to “dominate the debate,” and to stop “avoiding confrontation.” Then the site turned off the comments section on the post.Ezra Klein – The New York Times: He delivered this gem of a commentary, saying President Trump lies about illegals receiving medical care, and then in the next sentence, proves him correct.\n\nIn a reference to a detail from Karine Jean-Pierre’s book, Alex stated that if a source is known to have lied about a topic, their call for comments to be off the record becomes invalid, and he can name them. He said this after the publication of his book “Original Sin,” which was filled with administration officials who had clearly lied but gave him details anonymously. (Congratulations, Alex!)\n\nIf you don’t tell the truth, off the record no longer applies.Here is Gilda Squire’s denial at the time.“This is unequivocally untrue.” https://t.co/GWBWPcD4cI pic.twitter.com/jfci8Cmz3l— Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) June 4, 2025\n\nNEWS AVOIDANCE SYNDROME (When Major News Items Are Entirely Overlooked)\n\nAccidental Omissions – The press was hyping any plane accident incident at the start of the year, but avoided reporting that there were fewer incidents than the prior year.No Scramble to Report – After energetically covering high egg prices from the day Trump took office, there was no coverage when prices plunged in March below those on inauguration day.Mary Beth Sheridan – Washington Post -- In a May report on the sharp drop in fentanyl seizures taking place, she worked hard to avoid giving credit to the toughened border policy.USA Today – In reporting immediately after the Minnesota private school shooting, it held back from mentioning the shooter was a trans individual, but it did imply that ICE detentions could have been a contributing factor.No Longer a Crisis – During the Jimmy Kimmel suspension flap, the press was excitable when someone shot at an ABC affiliate in California. They completely walked away from the story when it was discovered that the shooter was a left-wing activist.\n\nThe self-avowed extremism correspondent had previously promoted a special when he stated that he could not find examples of politically-driven violence on the Left. After a man in Boulder, Colorado, used Molotov cocktails to attack a group of Jewish people gathering in support of Israel, Donie immediately flew to the state – to cover the trial of My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell in Denver. (Congratulations, Donie!)\n\nAfter Terror Attack on Jews, CNN Sent Extremism Expert to Colorado - What He Focused on Was a Disgracehttps://t.co/EtTDmDIPNw— RedState (@RedState) June 4, 2025\n\nREPORTING ON THE MIRROR (When Newsmakers Are Making the News)\n\nDavid Muir – ABC News: When reporting on the California wildfires, Muir was wearing a fireman’s jacket, for some reason, and was spotted having it tailored for the cameras on scene.Patrick Healy – The New York Times: After his newspaper made an accurate report on Zohran Mamdani claiming to be black on a college entrance application, Assistant Managing Editor Healy had to explain themselves amid outrage, some of which was inside their own newsroom.Minnesota Star Tribune – The pro-Tim Walz newspaper, which has supported his union and taxation policies, closed down its local printing operations. It has outsourced the work to Iowa, where there are more favorable labor costs and better tax policies.Alex Thompson – Axios: While promoting his book release on the lies surrounding the Joe Biden presidency, Alex detailed an interview with one Biden staffer who was not only bold and upfront about their lying, but also expressed amazement at how the press would just regurgitate their lies without question.\n\nScott MacFarlane – CBS News\n\nIn a staggering dose of self-importance, the likes of which Jim Acosta would be impressed by, MacFarlane detailed how he was at the Pennsylvania rally when the attempt was made on Trump’s life, and Scott claims that he was the one who almost died. Even better, it was not because of the shooter, but he says the Trump crowd wanted to turn on the reporters on site…for no discernible reason. Just amazing. (Congratulations, Scott!)\n\nCBS's Scott MacFarlane claims that after Trump was shot \"I got diagnosed with PTSD within 48 hours. I got put on trauma leave, not because, I think, of the shooting, but because, you could, you saw it in the eyes, the reaction of the people. They were coming for us. If he didn't… pic.twitter.com/MfrQxN9mvh— Alex Christy (@alexchristy17) July 17, 2025\n\nSTEALTH STORY EVOLUTION (the Altering of News Reports on the Sly)\n\nSacramento Bee – The paper swapped the image used at a GOP event after criticism for showing one candidate apparently giving a Nazi hand salute.The BBC – After a headline that said a woman in Gaza dies of malnutrition, the outlet changed the headline to reflect she had leukemia and was in Italy receiving treatments.NBC News – In initial reports about the shooting at a New Hampshire private club, the network omitted that the shooter had shouted “Free Palestine,” and when shamed, entered that detail later without attribution.The Daily Beast – The outlet had to entirely take down a baseless piece alleging a connection between First Lady Melania Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nNatasha Bertrand delivered a report on the Iran bombing mission, saying that internal communications said the mission was not successful. This was instantly disputed by officials, and they stated that she was relying on a low-confidence early action report. The network went into overdrive defending itself, saying Natasha had included that detail in her reporting. Only she had not, and they added comments asserting it after the controversy. (Congratulations to all involved at CNN!)\n\nWATCH CNN LIECNN \"journalists\" parrot each other as they falsely claim Natasha Bertrand's initial reporting the Iran strike leak included the facts that it was a \"low confidence\" and \"preliminary\" report.Kate Bolduan proclaims: \"...about it being low confidence.
