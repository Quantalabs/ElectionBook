Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said in a interview that some of her allies are expressing concern for her safety as she runs for the U.S. Senate. While on the \"Native Land Pod\" podcast on Tuesday, Crockett discussed speaking with former Vice President Kamala Harris, the second Black woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate, about her decision to run for the Texas seat. She added that she was also speaking to members of the U.S. Senate regarding her campaign, highlighting one unnamed senator who warned that she should take precautions. CROCKETT FIRES BACK AT JD VANCE'S 'STREET GIRL' COMMENTS, SAYS IT'S A RACIST TROPE \"There is one member who was like, ‘I think you can do it. Like, I have no doubts,’\" Crockett said. \"And that particular member said, 'My biggest concern is your safety. If you tell me that you are going to take all the precautions that you need to take, then go for it. But I don't want you to become a sacrificial lamb.'\" Crockett said that Harris, whom she described as viewing her as \"family,\" expressed the same sentiment.

I'm going to need you to make sure that you're as safe as possible,'\" Crockett said. Crockett told host Angela Rye that she was working on being fitted for a bulletproof vest after beginning her campaign, saying she was not going to run without it. \"It is a sad reality, but I think about the courage that had to exist for those that came before me,\" Crockett said.

Though Republicans ridiculed and criticized the announcement, some Democratic colleagues have also reportedly privately voiced disappointment at the news. \"She might win a primary, but she ain't winning a general in Texas,\" one House Democrat anonymously told Axios. In June, Crockett previously expressed doubt about pursuing a longer career in politics because of death threats she has faced in her position.

We need to separate the worst from getting into the recycling bins, because the last thing we need to see is some of this behavior circulating once again. So, in the futile effort of improving the journalism landscape, we need to highlight the lowlights of 2025.\n\nHere at \"Riffed From the Headlines,\" it has been another year of compiling the worst and misbegotten in the media landscape. We began the year with the hope that improvements would be experienced. Our hopes were, not surprisingly, dashed. Thus, we are left with the task of delivering notice of the worst from the journalism industry, and for that, we have developed The Heckler Awards.\n\nThis will be a four-part series in which we will (dis)honor the events reported in the press this year, based on the evidence compiled in our daily column. We begin with technical awards, and that will then give way to specific honors in the various categories we use to organize the lapses in journalism ethics. Part One will honor industry-wide activity, while Part Two will recognize achievements by individuals and specific outlets, and then Parts Three and Four will entail the category \"winners.\"\n\nNow, with that pageantry aside, let us delve into the recognition and begin handing out the recognition of the news industry foibles for 2025, in this, the first round of The Hecklers!\n\nThe Industry Prevarication of the Year – The Epstein Follies\n\nThere were a great many corrupted storylines throughout the year, so choosing was not an easy task. But eventually we settled on the one item that seemed to be a throughline in the press for most of the year. The release of the Epstein Files occupied the press for most of 2025, beginning with the criticism that they were not released in a timely fashion. This led the press to – dare we use their term – \"pounce.\"\n\nThe accusations began early, then the delay in the release, and the announcement that there was not an actual \"list\" was all it took for the media to rush to conclusions. Later in the year, we saw the steady release of choice documents, all creating a maelstrom of accusations from the press. The common thread? It was all entirely supposition.\n\nEvery charge leveled at President Trump, every piece of \"evidence\" held up, and every claim that they finally had him pegged with guilt fell apart. The Democrats leaked choice emails and doctored photos to assign culpability, as the press obediently trumpeted the \"proof,\" and every time these examples fell apart faster than an IKEA bookshelf. The realization was that if Trump could have been brought down by Epstein evidence, it would have occurred years ago. The desperation was blatant, and the need to ignore Democrats proven to have Epstein connections made things worse.\n\nThe Media Mynah Birds Trophy – The \"Maryland Man\" Mystique\n\nAs the administration ramped up the deportation efforts, the press found their martyr, and it was a perplexing choice. Abrego Garcia was latched onto as their cause, an illegal alien with a checkered past and connections to El Salvador gangs. This was who they picked as their sympathetic figure?!\n\nYet, as he was rightfully deported, the press recast Garcia, referring to him as a \"Maryland father\" while ignoring his background, using him as a cudgel against Trump. Even when he was exposed as a domestic abuser, and then a case of him being involved in trafficking other illegals emerged, they still clung to him as their noble figure. This posturing fed into a year of other sympathetic stories where detained illegals were recast, as their valid deportation rap sheets were ignored to push the anti-deportation narrative.\n\nRecognition for Deep Sea Double-Tap Divisiveness – Drug Boat Criticisms Bombing\n\nThe obsessiveness in the press to bring down Secretary Pete Hegseth, at any cost, has been perpetual since he was announced as the appointee for the role in heading the War Department. The latest is the urgency to say he has committed a war crime by targeting drug boats off the coast of Venezuela. Specifically, one event where they targeted a boat and there were survivors, so a second strike was made. This is said to be a severe violation of war crime statutes, which collapses under scrutiny.\n\nIf the boat was initially targeted, why is a second strike considered problematic? And if double-tap strikes on targeted combatants are considered criminal, where was this media outrage when Barack Obama was routinely using double-tap drone strikes that took out first responders and civilians? The reporting today strikes as being deeply convenient.\n\nCollective Pearl-Clutching Honor – The White House Bawl-room\n\nIt was a tiresome time when every newscast had to have us feeling deep tremors of anxiety that President Trump was going to undertake the prospect of constructing a new ballroom on the White House grounds. All manner of fractured coverage ensued. First, it was destroying the main building, then it became that he was razing the historic East Wing (comprised mostly of empty offices and a kitchen that struggles to supply large events). Also, we were told he did not go through appropriate channels, that it was costing taxpayers too much, and that the private donations were a problem.\n\nWhat has cooled the coverage is how many past presidents expressed a desire for a ballroom, and that for most state dinners, guests walked through the East Wing in order to go to a party outside, held in tents.\n\nThis is actually hilarious because this photo shows invited guests walking **through** the East Wing to get to a **tent** set up outside for Biden’s state dinner.Which is…you know…the whole reason Trump is building a ballroom. pic.twitter.com/jsoFqzX3fK— Kristen Mag (@kristenmag) October 27, 2025\n\nThe Shutdown Shoutdown Citation – Slanted Coverage of Closing the Government\n\nWe endured the longest government shutdown in the nation's history, and the effects were so dire that some people actually noticed. Throughout the pointless power struggle, the press took the unanimous position that this had been entirely the fault of the Republicans. Despite, you know, the small detail about every single GOP member voting to keep things open.\n\nSomehow, the Democrats largely escaped blame despite being hailed for their strong stance, and even when they voted against emergency payments to the military and benefits programs, they were excused from culpability.\n\nIn the end, nothing at all was accomplished, and the press was left trying to sell the concept that Democrat subsidies set to expire by the Democrats and exploding the cost of the Democrat-crafted Obamacare was entirely blamed on Republicans.\n\nTaken Into Accountability Award – Media Defamation Suits\n\nIt was a year marked by media outlets being taken to task legally for errant and malicious reporting. An act that previously was difficult to enforce in the courts became a regular feature throughout the year. MSNBC settled a case where it lied about a doctor performing hysterectomies on immigrant women. CBS News also had a notable settlement with President Trump over the deceptively edited interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes. Most notable was in January when a jury ruled that CNN was liable for malicious defamation against a Navy veteran. Additionally, the president has two active cases going on, one against the Pulitzer Prize committee and one recently brought against the BBC.\n\nThe Droning Censorship Decree – Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Mark Kelly\n\nThere has been all manner of media wailing this year about censorship, with a notable component heard: Specifically, we cannot stop hearing from those supposedly censored! After CBS announced that it was not renewing Stephen Colbert's contract, accusations flew that he was cancelled by Donald Trump. The show is losing tens of millions of dollars annually, yet the \"cancelled\" host is still on the air, insulting the president nightly, until next summer.\n\nJimmy Kimmel was pulled off the air for a few nights following his comments about Charlie Kirk. More hysteria followed about the president being intolerant of criticism. Yet there is Kimmel, each and every night, braying about the man he says is obsessed with him.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) has been on a media tour for weeks now following the controversy of the Seditious Six video he took part in last month. If you have not heard Kelly declaring how he will not allow the president to silence him, go flip on your television – it is likely he is talking about not being allowed to talk by granting his 573rd interview this month.\n\nA Framed Pink Slip – NPR/PBS/CPB\n\nThe first half of the year was filled with segments, hearings, reports, and interviews with the leadership of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, as they strove mightily to fend off the looming threat of being defunded. Their words were not only futile, as the Big Beautiful Bill saw fit to yank the federal funding, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting folded as a result. All the emotional narratives were entirely empty, as it was shown.\n\nOne of the claims perpetually made was how people in remote areas relied on public broadcasters for emergency information. It had always been a laughable claim, but then it was exposed when the flash floods hit regions in Texas. After that natural disaster, it was found that the NPR station in that area never delivered weather alerts throughout the night when lives were affected.\n\nMedia Rennovation Recipients – MSNBC / CNN\n\nOne thing you can undertake when you are a foundering news network is changing your framework for the better. In the case of second place MSNBC and distant third place CNN, these are not exactly willing changes.\n\nCNN has long been struggling in the ratings and has long desired to enter the digital streaming marketplace. It has failed repeatedly. Most remember CNN+, the effort that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, only to be shut down in less than one month. Less known was the attempt to reconstitute things on the HBO Max platform, and that garnered little interest. So that was ended in October, as the network was set to unveil CNN Premium, a subscription service where people can pay for the content that most do not want to watch for free. How can it go wrong?!\n\nAfter Comcast Universal spun off its cable channels into a separate company called Versant, it also meant that NBC News was cutting off the cable news channel entirely. Over the course of months, MSNBC had to move out to get its own studios, was cut off from using manpower and equipment in D.C., had to rely on Sky News for syndicated content, and by November, divest itself from all connections to the broadcast network. It was rebranded as MS NOW (\"My Source for News, Opinion, and the World\"), and a $20 million ad campaign was launched to promote its rebranding.\n\nThe Trophy for Not Listening To Their Own Echoes – Ignoring the Russian Collusion Files Release\n\nFor most of a decade, the press had been entirely consumed with the coverage of the Russian collusion scandal…that wasn't. Just think back to the time when barely any newscast would take place without some mention of the scandal that was never alive but somehow would not die. But when this Spring saw Tulsi Gabbard releasing the full complement of intelligence files, suddenly the press had very little interest…at all. The story has been entirely forgotten by now.\n\nSomething about the Democrats' deceptive practices and the complicity of the press has inspired abject apathy in media circles.\n\nThe Plane Blame Game Award – False Reporting On Airline Accidents\n\nFollowing the jarring air catastrophe in D.C., when a military chopper collided with a landing passenger airliner, the press was intent on heaping the blame on President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. The intent was to suggest that cuts had led to staffing shortages in air traffic control towers, and for weeks, any incident to be found was blasted on the airwaves and across headlines. At one point, a plane that crashed during a landing was attempted to be blamed on President Trump and Duffy…despite that incident taking place in Canada.\n\nEventually, this narrative died off for two reasons. The number of airline accidents has been lower than the previous year, and staffing shortages were found to have been in place during the Biden years.\n\nRevisionist Thinking Recognition – New Criticisms of the Old Regime\n\nMaybe we can credit Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson for freeing the minds of some in the press. Their book \"Original Sin\" was comprised mostly of news about the Biden presidency that the press refused to cover during the Biden presidency. This sparked at least a glimmer of reports recasting some of the details from the previous four years.\n\nNew assessments about the economy from the past four years have occasionally seeped out. There was a willingness by The New York Times to take a new approach to Biden's actions at the border. And it was rather stark the way that former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was dumped on by many for her disaster of a book tour, where she appeared inept and incapable of speaking cogently. Now, this had always been the case with KJP, but in the past, when those of us would point it out, the press would act indignant.\n\nSomali Enchanted Evening Prize – Excusing Minnesota Welfare Fraud\n\nAs the case of the rampant government benefits scandal in Minnesota continues to grow, many in the press are showing more than a hesitation to cover this story. They seem intent on covering it up. As more evidence emerges that this entails billions of dollars of fraud, with fortunes being sent out of the country to Somalis, many outlets are taking the approach that it is wrong and mean to focus on the Somali community.\n\nOf course, there is more than just identity politics involved. The scandal is enveloping prominent Democrats, like Ilhan Omar, Tim Walz, and Keith Ellison, so they need to be brought on news shows to spin the scandal news and evade culpability.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting and opinion?

I always hide in the shadows. It’s the only way I can stay safe from retaliation.”\n\nShe goes on to ask, “Why? I expose terrible lies. I unmask the corrupt, and I make it available for all to see.”\n\nThe narrator then says, “My latest target? Let’s just say for one politician, it’s time to buckle up, sir. Go ahead, underestimate me. It’s amazing what you can learn when you hide in the shadows.”\n\nThroughout the video, images of Shapiro flash on screen, or his name appears. \n\nIt ends with the words “Twilight Justice [streaming early 2026].”\n\nGarrity campaign media consultant John Brabender said he was inspired to give the campaign advertisement an eerie vibe after the Hulu docuseries, “Death in Apartment 603: What Happened to Ellen Greenberg,” which investigates the controversial death of a 27-year-old Pennsylvania woman that was ruled a suicide. Shapiro received criticism for his handling of the Greenberg case while attorney general, but he has long defended his actions. \n\nGreenberg, who was an elementary school teacher, was found dead in her Philadelphia home in 2011 with 20 stab wounds from a large knife. \n\nThe medical examiner initially ruled it was a suicide, a ruling Greenberg’s parents dispute to this day. They believe she was murdered and said the state should have looked more closely at the evidence, which included bruises as well as the location of her stab wounds. They have spent years trying to change the cause of death and force an investigation into what they believe was the murder of their daughter. The Greenbergs have a lawsuit pending before the state Supreme Court, aiming to overturn the suicide ruling. \n\nWhen Shapiro was the state’s attorney general, his office reviewed the case, and a lower court judge acknowledged that the investigation was “deeply flawed.” However, the cause of death was not overturned, and critics have continued to comb through Shapiro’s time as state attorney general. \n\nThe series Brabender is producing for Garrity’s campaign will also be available on other social media platforms, including short-form content on Instagram, where most young voters obtain their information these days. \n\nSkipping traditional television spots to focus more on social media is a shift in how campaigns target voters, Fuyuan Shen, head of the Department of Advertising/Public Relations at the Penn State Donald Bellisario College of Communications, told ABC27.\n\n“We’ve definitely seen more ads like stories because of social media,” Shen added. “Oftentimes, that’s mixed with other information that’s difficult to sort out.”\n\nShapiro, who won his 2022 gubernatorial campaign by double digits, has become Pennsylvania‘s most popular politician by insisting that the government can still deliver for the people. He has a record that backs it up, including cutting bipartisan deals, reducing homelessness, and reopening a collapsed stretch of highway in just 12 days. \n\nShapiro, who is rumored to be eyeing a White House bid, has surged back into the spotlight, first by pushing back on former Vice President Kamala Harris‘s new book, then by strongly weighing in on the political violence spreading across the country. He has also taken President Donald Trump to task over divisive policies and a sluggish economy while meticulously building a national profile based on results and electability.\n\nPennsylvania, a critical swing state, is a near necessity for Democrats if they hope to win in 2028. It has the largest electoral prize among the key battleground states, and the last three presidential elections have been decided there by very tight margins. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 and 2024, while former President Joe Biden won in 2020. Shapiro was floated as a possible running mate for Harris in 2024, but she ultimately went with Gov.

This facility has become notable for its role in housing individuals deported by the Trump administration.\n\nDuring CBS’s routine 9 a.m. editorial meeting on Monday, Weiss, who is 41, clarified her reasoning. According to a report from The New York Times, she concluded the segment was not worth airing as it did not offer new insights or significantly contribute to the ongoing conversation.\n\nWeiss emphasized that similar work had been previously published by outlets like the Times, underscoring her commitment to pursuing innovative and thought-provoking stories as her guiding principle.\n\n“To present a story on this topic two months later, we need to provide additional depth,” Weiss explained to her team. The decision to pull the segment sparked some controversy, prompting a managerial meeting later in the day, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nThis decision did not sit well with some members of the journalistic community. Panelists on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” saw it as a setback for journalism. Joe Scarborough highlighted 60 Minutes Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi’s assertion that the piece was “factually correct” and had successfully passed five standards reviews.\n\nMika Brzezinski, co-host of the show, echoed these sentiments, stating, “I’ve been in those screening sessions. Having worked there myself, I can attest that they are incredibly challenging.”\n\nCBS News employees, meanwhile, have threatened to quit over Weiss’s decision, CBS sources told CNN. Insiders told the Guardian that Weiss promised to air the story as the backlash continues.\n\n‘The most rigorous, most difficult process, it is an important process. And every frickin’ word, every frame of video is picked apart by editors to make sure it is correct. I mean, that I- they promoted it? I mean, come on,’ Brzezinski complained on Monday.\n\nThe report was set to speak on ‘brutal’ conditions at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, and was spiked on Saturday, after the story had been fully vetted by researchers and lawyers, sources who spoke with CNN said.\n\nContributor Pablo Torre griped that Weiss was ‘not a reporter, not a journalist, [and] is cosplaying as one and is poisoning the well of one of the last bastions of investigative reporting that gets funded.’\n\n‘And Sharyn Alfonsi is a very good reporter,’ Brzezinski added.\n\nWeiss’s Monday call elaborated on a Sunday note she sent to top 60 Minutes brass that claimed Afonsi’s team did not get enough administration officials on the record for the ‘important piece.’\n\n‘At present, we do not present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT,’ Weiss wrote in the memo, according to Axios.\n\n‘What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing? Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy.\n\n‘I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.’\n\nEarlier in the day, an internal memo sent by Alfonsi to her fellow staffers was leaked to the press.\n\nAlfonsi, the correspondent who reported out the story, slammed Weiss’s decision as a form of censorship.\n\nWeiss – a former New Yorker Times opinion writer who is only weeks into her CBS News tenure – told the Times late Sunday night: ‘My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. \n\nShe said that ‘folding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason – that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices – happens every day in every newsroom.’\n\nShe maintained that the 60 Minutes team would get the greenlight to publish the piece when it adheres to her standards.\n\nBut, according to Alfonsi and the two CBS sources who spoke with CNN, the story ‘was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices’ as of Friday.\n\nThe sources also that the number of screenings before the initial signoff was somewhat out of the ordinary, with other shows being screened fewer times.. \n\nDespite the enhanced scrutiny, Weiss still had questions about the following morning, the sources said. It was lack of a response from the Trump administration that was her chief, CNN reported.\n\nAlfonsi argued that she and her team ‘requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House, and the State Department.’\n\n‘Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,’ she told colleagues. \n\n‘If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a “kill switch” for any reporting they find inconvenient.’ \n\nThe segment was set to surround a group of Venezuelan men who thought they were being sent back to their home country, only to end up at the Terrorism Confinement Center, widely known as CECOT.\n\nFollowing Weiss’s statement to the Times, it remains unclear when it will air. \n\nWeiss was hired by Paramount CEO David Ellison back in October.\n\nShe is the founder of the right-leaning Free Press, which was bought by Ellison during for $150million. Ellison, 42, is the son of billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison. He took the helm after the merger between Paramount and Skydance over the summer.\n\nThe deal caused over the editorial direction of CBS. The network was accused of bowing to pressure from the Trump administration by settling a suit with the president over a 60 Minutes interview in 2024 with Kamala Harris he said was ‘deceptively’ edited.\n\nDays after the suit was settled, the $8billion merger Paramount-Skydance was approved by the FCC. \n\nParamount is now launching a hostile takeover bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBari Weiss, the Editor-in-Chief at CBS News, recently provided further explanation regarding&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Media Showdown: Bari Weiss Stands Firm on &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; Deportation Story Amid Morning Joe&#8217;s Criticism first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/media-showdown-bari-weiss-stands-firm-on-60-minutes-deportation-story-amid-morning-joes-criticism/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bari-Weiss-doubles-down-on-pulling-60-Minutes-deportation-story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 21:28:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":388560012,"title":"DEEP STATE TRIGGERED: DOJ Staff Resignations Prove Harmeet Dhillon Is Doing Good Work at the Civil Rights Division","text":"More than 200 former staff at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division signed a letter condemning Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, and in doing so, they outed themselves as deep state actors and demonstrated Dhillon’s effectiveness in restoring the division to its true mission.\n\nThe lawyers wrote to “sound the alarm about the near destruction of the DOJ’s once-revered crown jewel,” but their complaints illustrate the problems the Trump administration seeks to address.\n\n“There absolutely is a deep state,” John Daukas, former acting assistant attorney general in the division in Trump’s first term, told The Daily Signal in an interview Tuesday.\n\nWhile many federal employees hold “career” positions that are ostensibly nonpolitical, many of them act against the president’s political appointees and frustrate the president’s agenda.\n\nAn April RMG Research poll found that 75% of the federal employees who voted for Kamala Harris last year, work in the District of Columbia, and make more than $150,000 annually said they would refuse to follow a lawful order from President Donald Trump, if they considered it bad policy.\n\nDaukas said many Civil Rights Division career staff he worked with acted on a similar mentality.\n\n“They acted like they were the policymakers, like they had been elected, as opposed to the president,” he recalled.\n\nWhile 80% of the Civil Rights Division’s cases are noncontroversial—fighting human trafficking or real discrimination—about a fifth concern “hot-button issues,” such as abortion, transgender ideology, and “reverse discrimination.”\n\nCareer staff “did great work” with “the meat and potatoes stuff,” but they proved obstinate on other projects, Daukas said.\n\nTrump 45 Examples\n\nCareer staff balked when the Civil Rights Division opposed racial quotas by supporting Students for Fair Admissions’ cases against Harvard University and Yale University.\n\nDaukas recalled that many career staff “refused to sign briefs.” The head of the education section said “all her people were ‘too busy’ to work on the case.”\n\n“We had to cobble together this hodge-podge of people from other divisions,” including some from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Connecticut, to do the job. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled against Harvard, striking down racial quotas.\n\nCareer staff also balked at investigating then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., for undercounting nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThe career staff “basically were dragging their feet. This is a technique they have—they just wait you out, thinking the administration will change,” Daukas recalled.\n\nCareer staff urged the politicals to investigate Texas and Indiana, instead. The political appointees wrote the letters themselves. Attorney General Letitia James, D-N.Y., ran her own investigation and found that Daukas’ suspicions were correct.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division also supported Idaho’s law banning boys from competing in girls’ sports, and the career staff refused to work on it, Daukas said. \n\n“We had about 400 attorneys in the Civil Rights Division, but it felt like we only had 15 or 20, who were the political appointees, willing to work on controversial issues,” he added.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division Letter\n\nThe former Civil Rights Division staffers’ letter—sent Dec. 9—unwittingly testifies to the importance of Dhillon’s work.\n\nThe letter notes that Attorney General Pam Bondi dropped a lawsuit challenging Georgia’s 2021 election integrity law—which former staffers say “made it harder to vote.”\n\nDaukas noted that the Georgia case was “totally bogus,” and that voting under the law has been easier than in many blue states. Yet the division brought the case because Biden had declared Georgia’s law “Jim Crow 2.0.”\n\nMentioning that case demonstrates “such a lack of self-awareness on their part,” Daukas said, because the case is “a paradigmatic example of the deep state and politics run amok.”\n\nThe letter also slams Dhillon’s decision to withdraw from settlement agreements regarding police wrongdoing in Minneapolis and other cities.\n\n“I was involved in the investigation of Minneapolis,” after the death of George Floyd in police custody, Daukas recalled. He said the division found evidence of potential police brutality but no evidence of racism. \n\nDespite the lack of evidence, the city of Minneapolis actually wanted a consent decree from the court, Daukas explained. “This is an inside job where they were colluding. The city wanted to be required to do these things, to spend money on social workers—it’s not like they were being punished.”\n\n“Thank goodness Harmeet and her team pulled this one back,” the former attorney noted. \n\nA Testament to Trump Reforms\n\nDhillon’s tenure marks a sea change from her predecessor under Biden, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. \n\nWhile pro-abortion vandals had targeted pro-life pregnancy centers and Catholic churches, Clarke prosecuted pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. Clarke and her division also consulted with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which puts mainstream conservative and Christian groups on a “hate map” with the Ku Klux Klan. \n\nTrump’s administration also marks a sea change from Biden on “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” While Trump has pledged to enforce civil rights laws—which protect Americans regardless of race, sex, or religion—he has rejected the Marxist identity politics that claims the only true victims of discrimination must be from previously oppressed groups. \n\nThe former staffers’ letter complains that Dhillon “launched a coordinated effort to drive us out,” but based on the leftist bias under Clarke, the Trump administration’s approach to civil rights law, and the letter’s own complaints, it seems the effort may have been more than justified.","summary":"More than 200 former staff at the Justice Department&#8217;s Civil Rights Division signed a letter condemning Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, and in doing so,...

Axios actually hits the lead here, although reporter Sara Fischer made sure to provide it on X/Twitter as well:\n\nSome nuggets in here @axios:- Can confirm WH, State Dept and DHS all provided on record comment in response to CBS News journalists’ request for comment ahead of the segment. None of those comments made airhttps://t.co/hFkRmt5Uv9— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) December 22, 2025\n\nReaders discover that the segment didn't include those comments in the first paragrph, although they have to get to the bottom of the story before the full picture emerges of the conflict between Bari Weiss and 60 Minutes' Sharyn Alfonsi:\n\nBetween the lines: According to a source familiar with \"60 Minutes\" correspondence with the administration, the \"60 Minutes\" team reached out to press officials at the White House, State Department and DHS, all of which provided comment to CBS News.None of those comments, which varied in length and substance, were included in the piece viewed by Axios.\n\nThat's not a \"between the lines\" issue. That directly reveals why Weiss pulled the segment in the US. For some reason, however, the Alfonsi segment aired in Canada, which Fischer viewed. It's not clear why Weiss' order didn't prevent the segment from airing in another country when Weiss had ordered it pulled in the US. One has to wonder whether that's clear to Weiss as well. Supposedly, the segment was transmitted \"via app\" to the Canadian distributor for 60 Minutes, but shouldn't Weiss' decision as the editor in chief of CBS News to keep it from airing have been universal?\n\nWhat is clear is that Weiss turned out to be correct in her assessment of the segment. Weiss first responded to Alfons's claim about political motives for spiking the story by saying it \"wasn't ready\" for air. Weiss then sent a more specific memo to CBS News personnel laying out the reasons for the decision, which included the need to get principals on the record to address the allegations:\n\nNew: See the memo Bari Weiss sent to some 60 Minutes staff on Sunday: pic.twitter.com/3ERieIGXLh— Isabella Simonetti (@thesimonetti) December 22, 2025\n\nMoney quote: \"Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don't tend to be shy. I realized we've emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.\" Well, surprise again! According to Axios, Alfonsi did get principals to respond, including that same DHS spokesperson and more. Rather than include that input, Alfonsi not only lied in the segment about not getting a response, she or the producers of 60 Minutes misled CBS News management about it. \n\nAnd now Axios has confirmed that, which shows exactly why Weiss got hinky after seeing the segment on Thursday. This is also not the first time that Alfonsi cooked a story at CBS News, either, so Weiss may have had her antenna up in the first place. As I noted in last night's Final Word, Alfonsi fronted a dishonest and false hit piece on Ron DeSantis in April 2021, accusing him of corruption in the deal with Publix to distribute teh COVID-19 vaccinations. It didn't take long for social media to connect the dots:\n\nThe entire reason I recognize the name is that she was the reporter behind the bogus DeSantis/publix hit piece.Link for a flashback: https://t.co/kSpbj2eeafIt was one of the most blatantly dishonest pieces of journalism I can ever remember. I would never trust a reporter who… https://t.co/gH3f6oJ62Z— AG (@AGHamilton29) December 22, 2025\n\nOh hey, Sharyn Alfonsi.

Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) December 22, 2025\n\nOh, and heeeyyyyy ...\n\nSharyn Alfonsi’s producer for the botched DeSantis story (Oriana Zill de Granados) is also the producer for the CECOT story. https://t.co/BByr8wnMan— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) December 23, 2025\n\nIt was so dishonest that even a Democrat involved called Alfonsi's report \"bullshit\":\n\nI did speak with @60Minutes. Never said I didn’t. They were very nice, but I told them that the @publix story was “bullshit”. Walked them through the whole process.The fact that I didn’t sit down on “camera” because I am responding to a 100 year emergency doesn’t change the truth https://t.co/G7QNsV42V5— Jared Moskowitz (@JaredEMoskowitz) April 6, 2021\n\nEven PolitiFact said at the time that CBS News owed everyone an explanation for how Alfonsi deceptively edited video of DeSantis to create a narrative rather than report the truth. The Daytona Beach News-Journal's editors wanted an explanation too, saying that Alfonsi's segment didn't \"even clear[] the bar as responsible opinion, let alone news. \n\nOf course, CBS News and 60 Minutes didn't learn any lessons about \"deceptively edited videos\" and narrative creation. They would use both again last year in their desperate attempt to make Kamala Harris sound coherent, and that time it cost Paramount $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over corrupt election interference. \n\nAnd so, here we are again, but this time CBS News is under new leadership. Will reporters finally get held accountable for producing dishonest hit pieces disguised as \"news\"? Stay tuned ... figuratively speaking only, that is. \n\nEditor's note: The crisis in media isn't just coming -- it has arrived.

In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nMs Alfonsi told the New York Times, which reported the note on the evening of Dec 21: “I refer all questions to Bari Weiss,” referring to the new CBS News editor-in-chief.\n\nNeither Ms Alfonsi nor Ms Weiss responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nCECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial.\n\nIt has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.\n\nSkydance Media, run by Mr David Ellison - the son of Mr Larry Ellison, a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump - acquired Paramount in August. Mr David Ellison helped secure regulatory approval for the deal with the promise that the CBS network would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of American viewers.\n\nPrior to the deal, Paramount paid US$16 million (S$20 million) to settle a 2024 lawsuit Mr Trump had filed over a 60 Minutes interview with former vice-president Kamala Harris, which he said gave a distorted view of his rival for the White House.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has said the settlement and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nOn Dec 22, Mr Larry Ellison stepped in to personally guarantee US$40.4 billion in Paramount Skydance’s latest effort to pry Warner Bros Discovery away from selling its prized Hollywood assets to streaming giant Netflix.\n\nThe deal would give Paramount Skydance control of CNN.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ms Weiss knew about the guarantee when she decided to hold the story. \n\nEarlier this month, Mr Trump attacked the new owners of CBS over a 60 Minutes interview with his former ally, Republican US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on the same day Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nIn an X post on Dec 22, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer implied that the 60 Minutes postponement was politically motivated. “Trump and his billionaire buddies are trying to shape what people see and hear to create their own alternative reality,” Mr Schumer wrote.\n\n“The Trump administration doesn’t have a veto on what stories get told. CBS should put the full, unedited version of this story on the air ASAP. A free press doesn’t kowtow to the president – it holds him accountable.”\n\nLink removed\n\nCBS removed a link to the “Inside CECOT” segment page on Dec 21.\n\nA description on its Paramount Plus website earlier on Dec 21 said the segment was scheduled to air at 7.30pm ET, with Ms Alfonsi speaking to recently released deportees about the “brutal and torturous” conditions they had endured in the prison.\n\nMs Weiss raised several concerns with 60 Minutes producers about Ms Alfonsi’s segment and requested a substantial amount of new material to be added, the CBS employee said. The New York Times reported that Ms Weiss suggested adding an interview with White House official Stephen Miller or another senior Trump administration figure.\n\nMs Weiss further questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the Venezuelan men who were deported, noting they were in the US illegally, the employee said.\n\nIn her note, Ms Alfonsi stated that her team had sought comments from the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Ms Alfonsi wrote.\n\nThe decision comes as the network goes through changes under Ms Weiss, who was picked to lead CBS News in October after CBS parent company Paramount Skydance acquired the online publication she founded, The Free Press.\n\nMs Weiss, a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal opinion writer, was considered by some analysts as a controversial choice as she had never managed a television newsroom or produced broadcast news content before.\n\nOn Dec10, she named Mr Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of its flagship CBS Evening News segment, replacing the dual anchor team of Mr John Dickerson and Mr Maurice DuBois.

The story, “Inside CECOT,” focused on immigrants sent to the notorious Salvadoran prison by the Trump administration.\n\nJournalists inside and outside CBS News criticized the decision by Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss, who took over the news organization in October after running a conservative website, The Free Press. Weiss says the story needed more reporting, including an on-camera response from the White House. But the story was held as the network’s parent company is pushing a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery — including CNN — and is reportedly seeking the backing of the Trump administration.\n\nWhat did the ‘60 Minutes’ episode show?\n\nThe story at the center of the controversy includes interviews with several people deported from the U.S. and sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\nThose featured in the episode recount torture and physical and sexual abuse they suffered at the prison, according to NBC News. \n\n“When we got there, the CECOT director was talking to us,” one detainee, Luis Munoz Pinto, told CBS. “The first thing he told us was that we would never see the light of day or night again.”\n\n“He said, ‘Welcome to hell. I’ll make sure you never leave.’”\n\n“60 Minutes” confirmed that authorities later released him from the facility. He said that he was awaiting a decision on his asylum claim in the U.S. when immigration authorities deported him. \n\nWhy was the show pulled?\n\nLess than two days before the episode was scheduled to air, Weiss requested editors to schedule, shoot, edit and add an interview with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who reportedly has devised much of Trump’s immigration policy. \n\nWhile last-minute edits frequently happen in the news, this wasn’t the first time Weiss had seen the episode and asked for edits, according to The New York Times. A day before, Weiss had suggested small changes and producers added them to the show. By Friday afternoon, “60 Minutes” editors gave CBS management the okay to start airing promotions of the show, according to The Times.\n\nThe publication also reported that Weiss did not appear at five screenings of the episode as producers worked on it. They say she could’ve raised concerns during any of those meetings. \n\nWeiss defended her decision during a routine staff meeting Monday.\n\n“I held that story because it was not ready,” Weiss said, according to a recording of her remarks obtained by several news outlets. \n\nWeiss said that while the stories of those detained were “powerful,” other outlets had already published similar stories on the topic.\n\n“The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment in this prison,” she said. If “60 Minutes” wanted to do the story, she said, “We simply need to do more.”\n\nProducers from the show said they had asked the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department for an on-camera interview, but all three declined.\n\nNewsroom’s reaction to the decision\n\nCriticism of Weiss’ decision was swift. The “60 Minutes” correspondent who reported the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, said the decision gave the White House veto power over stories it doesn’t like.\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, “we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\nJournalists agree that it’s important to seek comments from all sides to give readers or viewers a full picture of an issue. However, that’s not always possible, and occasionally a side doesn’t want to give its opinion. When that happens, most stories will note the unsuccessful effort to obtain comment but will ultimately still publish the story. \n\nExperts worry that allowing any party, especially a powerful entity like the White House, to prevent an outlet from publishing a story by simply declining an interview would create major problems. \n\nThe frustrations over the weekend carried over into the Monday staff meeting, according to The Times. Weiss said she wanted a newsroom “where we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters and do so with respect” during the meeting. \n\nBut in a later meeting with “60 Minutes” staff, Alfonsi reportedly said Weiss had never contacted her after pulling the episode. \n\n“Disagreement requires discussion,” Alfonsi said.\n\nWho is Bari Weiss?\n\nIn early October, CBS announced that it would hire Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. She brought no traditional news reporting or editing experience to the job, having begun her career at the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Weiss left the Times in 2020 after three years, saying she was “bullied” by colleagues over her political views. \n\nShe created a successful Substack that attracted more subscribers than any other political newsletter on the platform. It became so successful that Weiss hired 10 employees and adopted the name The Free Press. Paramount Skydance, CBS News’ parent company, acquired The Free Press for $150 million earlier this year. \n\nThe deal came shortly after the company paid Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit in which he claimed “60 Minutes” had edited a 2024 interview with Vice President Kamala Harris to boost her campaign against Trump. Legal experts agreed that the lawsuit had little merit since editing full interviews into small clips is an essential part of television news.\n\nIn the wake of the Trump settlement, Weiss’ entrance into CBS News’ top newsroom position was met with concern. Many worried her lack of newsroom experience and experience with reporters would hinder the company. \n\nMany also raised concerns over her possible conflict of interest since she reports directly to David Ellison, head of Paramount Skydance. David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, who is also a close friend of Trump and the largest shareholder of Paramount Skydance.\n\nThe Guardian recently reported that Larry Ellison had discussed who he would fire from CNN if Paramount Skydance purchased Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company. Paramount is also in the middle of a hostile counter to a deal between Netflix and Warner Bros.\n\nBy pulling the “60 Minutes” episode, Weiss added to concerns that she would skew the news to favor Trump. However, supporters say she makes editorial decisions without regard to David Ellison, according to The Times. But they have conceded that she was still “learning the ropes” and admitted she had mishandled the timing of her feedback. \n\nThe post Criticisms of CBS News grow as Canada airs pulled ‘60 Minutes’ story appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/12/23/criticisms-of-cbs-news-grow-as-canada-airs-pulled-60-minutes-story/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-15-6wjYbQ.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 19:24:52","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":388512912,"title":"Liberal Guests Outnumber Conservatives 90 To 1 On Late-Night TV In Second Half Of 2025","text":"In the second half of 2025, liberal guests outnumbered conservative guests on late-night television by a count of 90 to one. NewsBusters published the study this week after reviewing guest lists from the following shows between July 7 and December 19: Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, and The Daily Show. The study divided guests into two categories: partisan officials and journalists or celebrities. Among partisan officials, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 31 to 0. Notably, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on Kimmel’s show last week, where she said the American people deserved better than the Donald Trump presidency. So much for Colbert’s recent claim that he is \"more conservative than people think.\" Fox News host Greg Gutfeld was the sole right-leaning guest among 60 celebrities and journalists, with his August 7 appearance on The Tonight Show. \"Colbert led the way with 17, Kimmel came in second with seven, The Daily Show came in third with six, Meyers placed fourth with one, and Fallon interviewed zero politicians during the study’s run,\" NewsBusters added. Clearly, comedy is no longer the primary objective for late-night shows on broadcast television. Each has become a propaganda arm for liberal groupthink and the Democrat Party. And the results of the study are nothing new. NewsBusters has tracked late-night guest counts since September 2022. The cumulative total now stands at 604 liberals and Democrats compared to just 15 conservatives and Republicans — a 97 percent tilt. The industry has suffered greatly as a result. Earlier this year, CBS announced that Colbert would air his final show in May 2026. According to multiple reports, his show loses around $40 million per year. Given that Colbert remains the highest-rated host in late-night, it’s safe to assume Kimmel and Fallon aren’t making their networks much money either — if any. With high production costs and sharply declining viewership, questions about the long-term viability of the industry are fair. Will there be a single late-night program left on broadcast television by, say, 2035? Probably not. And the networks have only themselves to blame for making the editorial decision to wave goodbye to half the country.","summary":"In the second half of 2025, liberal guests outnumbered conservative guests on late-night television by a count of 90 to one.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/liberal-guests-outnumber-conservatives-90-1-late-night-tv-second-half-2025","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/07/screenshot-2025-07-18-at-3.36.44 pm-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 19:00:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":388521632,"title":"What Happened to His Lucrative Art Career?

The criminal son of the wildly unpopular former President brings nothing of value to the table, but Hunter is making the rounds once again. If Democrats think he's got a future in politics, they're kidding themselves, but it would be amusing to watch them try to make Hunter a thing.\n\nIn this most recent interview with host Shawn Ryan, Hunter touched on a variety of topics. As Townhall reported earlier, Hunter sounded \"positively Trumpian\" with his critiques of the Afghanistan withdrawal, calling it a \"failure,\" as well as immigration.\n\n\"We don't want immigrants that are coming here illegally, draining us of resources, and being prioritized above...anybody in our society,\" Hunter said. Did he miss his father's term in office?\n\nHunter also showed how profoundly privileged and out of touch he truly is, he had the audacity to talk about people avoiding consequences.\n\n\"And the truth of the matter is that it’s not any politician or federal government worker,\" Hunter said, referring to the media narrative that we should have a \"common enemy.\" \n\nHunter continued, \"Who’s benefiting right now? Whether the Democrats are in control of Congress or whether Republicans are, who ultimately seems to be benefiting?\"\n\n\"The people that are benefiting are the people that always, some way, avoid the consequences,\" Hunter said, forgetting his father gave him a sweeping pardon shortly before leaving office.\n\nThe interview also included Hunter's confession that he's millions of dollars in debt.\n\n🚨 NEW: Hunter Biden Reveals He’s Nearly $15 Million in Debt“I’ve got $15 Million in debt that I have no idea that I'm going to be able to pay off … We have no generational wealth.” pic.twitter.com/MICyagej7A— Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) December 22, 2025\n\n\"Litigation sucks,\" Hunter said. \"I've been tied up in criminal and civil courts...I don't know, $14, $15 million in debt that I have no idea that I'm going to be able to pay off.\"\n\n\"Millions of dollars of debt,\" Hunter continued. \"Nobody's riding to the rescue for Hunter Biden.

Reports from other news outlets indicated that the segment, which included allegations that Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison were tortured and raised questions about how the US characterized them, had first streamed on Canada’s Global TV app.\n\nReuters reviewed an online video labeled as the segment in question and carrying the Global TV logo in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. Global TV normally streams new “60 Minutes” episodes on Mondays, according to the app’s website. A “60 Minutes” spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the segment that apparently had been streamed and recorded by some viewers to be posted online.\n\nCBS abruptly pulled the segment hours before it was due to air on Sunday evening in the US, sparking accusations from inside “60 Minutes” and on Capitol Hill that the network, owned by Paramount Skydance, was engaging in self-censorship under political pressure. “The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of ‘60 Minutes’ has been updated,” the program posted on social media on Sunday, three hours before it was slated to air. “Our report ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast.”\n\n‘Not editorial’\n\nA CBS News spokesperson said in an email Sunday that the segment “needed additional reporting.” Sharyn Alfonsi, a correspondent who reported the segment, said in a note to her team that CBS pulled the report for “political” reasons, according to a CBS News employee who confirmed the note’s contents. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in the note, the CBS employee said on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their position. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAlfonsi told the New York Times, which reported the note on Sunday evening: “I refer all questions to Bari Weiss,” referring to the new CBS News editor-in-chief. Neither Alfonsi nor Weiss responded to Reuters requests for comment. CECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial. It has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.\n\nSkydance Media, run by David Ellison - the son of longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, Larry Ellison - acquired Paramount in August. David Ellison helped secure regulatory approval for the deal with the promise that the CBS network would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of American viewers. Prior to the deal, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a 2024 lawsuit Trump filed over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed gave a distorted view of his rival for the White House.\n\nThe FCC has said the settlement and regulatory review were unrelated. On Monday, Ellison stepped in to personally guarantee $40.4 billion in Paramount Skydance’s latest effort to pry Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O away from selling its prized Hollywood assets to streaming giant Netflix. It is unclear whether Weiss knew about the guarantee when she decided to hold the story.\n\nEarlier this month Trump attacked the new owners of CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with his former ally, Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on the same day Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nIn an X post Monday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer implied that the “60 Minutes” postponement was politically motivated. “Trump and his billionaire buddies are trying to shape what people see and hear to create their own alternative reality,” Schumer wrote. “The Trump administration doesn’t have a veto on what stories get told. CBS should put the full, unedited version of this story on the air ASAP. A free press doesn’t kowtow to the president – it holds him accountable.” \n\nLink removed \n\nCBS removed a link to the “Inside CECOT” segment page on Sunday. A description on its Paramount Plus website earlier Sunday said the segment was scheduled to air at 7:30 pm ET, with Alfonsi speaking to recently released deportees about the “brutal and torturous” conditions they had endured in the prison.\n\nWeiss raised several concerns with “60 Minutes” producers about Alfonsi’s segment and requested a substantial amount of new material to be added, the CBS employee said. The New York Times reported that Weiss suggested adding an interview with White House official Stephen Miller or another senior Trump administration figure.\n\nWeiss further questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the Venezuelan men who were deported, noting they were in the US illegally, the employee said. In her note, Alfonsi stated that her team had sought comments from the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote.\n\nThe decision comes as the network goes through changes under Weiss, who was picked to lead CBS News in October after CBS parent company Paramount Skydance acquired the online publication she founded, The Free Press.\n\nWeiss, a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal opinion writer, was considered by some analysts as a controversial choice as she had never managed a television newsroom or produced broadcast news content before. On December 10 she named Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of its flagship “CBS Evening News” segment, replacing the dual anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois. — Reuters","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/37555/world/america/cbs-pulls-60-minutes-report-on-salvadoran-prison-sparking-outcry/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2025/12/23/338687.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 18:45:00","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"kw","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":388521638,"title":"Some on the Left Didn't Take the Hannah Dugan Verdict Well","text":"On December 18, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was found guilty of a felony charge of obstruction. Dugan was arrested by the FBI in April after she allegedly helped illegal immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz leave her courtroom in an effort to avoid being captured by ICE.\n\nThe verdict came down after a short trial that lasted just four days. The prosecution showed the jury video and audio footage of Dugan, in public hallways in her judicial robes, moving ICE agents to the office of the court's Chief Judge Carl Ashley, and testimony from multiple witnesses who said Dugan's behavior that day was abnormal, often saying she seemed upset or agitated by the presence of ICE in the courthouse.\n\nFlores-Ruiz was scheduled for a hearing before Dugan on charges of domestic violence and his victims, an unidentified man and woman, were in Dugan's courtroom on April 18 hoping their abuser would face justice. According to witness testimony during Dugan's trial, Flores-Ruiz injured both victims so severely that they required hospitalization, and the victims were \"uncomfortable\" in the presence of Flores-Ruiz in the courtroom.\n\nBut Dugan decided her political agenda was more important than justice for those victims, and she helped Flores-Ruiz and his attorney into a non-public area of the courthouse. Flores-Ruiz was able to leave the building, but he was captured outside by ICE agents shortly thereafter. The prosecution had her dead to rights, and she was found guilty based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\nBut at least one Leftist knows who the real victim is here, and what it reminds him of: Nazis.\n\nThe Nazis arrested and purged judges who wouldn't fall in line. https://t.co/U7T0NZ142w— Joel Montfort (@jmontforttx) December 19, 2025\n\nMontfort's X bio says he's a political scientist. Then surely he'd know a jury of 12 Wisconsinites in blue Milwaukee County — a county Kamala Harris won overwhelmingly in 2024 — isn't anything like Nazi Germany, right?\n\nDugan was fairly tried and convicted by a jury of her peers for a crime that had myriad witnesses, including video footage and audio. No one is above the law, even if you disagree with the law. And federal immigration law trumps whatever policies or local laws places like Milwaukee County might try to implement to protect illegal immigrants.\n\nMeanwhile, it seems Dugan has nuked her entire political career in an effort to resist President Trump and ICE. On April 29, the State Supreme Court suspended Dugan from her duties as a judge indefinitely. After the verdict, Wisconsin Republicans, who control both the state senate and assembly, have vowed to impeach Dugan if she doesn't resign.\n\nIn a statement, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August said, \"If Judge Dugan does not resign from her office immediately, the Assembly will begin impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nThe statement also said, \"Under Article XIII Section 3(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution, '[n]o person convicted of a felony, in any court within the United States, no person convicted in federal court of a crime designated at the time of commission, under federal laws as a misdemeanor involving a violation of public trust...shall be eligible to any office of trust, profit, or honor in this state unless pardoned of the conviction.\"\n\nBecause these charges are federal, Governor Tony Evers cannot pardon her, and President Trump certainly won't.\n\nDugan faces up to five years in prison when she's sentenced. But no date has been set for that hearing, as Dugan's legal team has vowed to appeal.\n\nEditor’s Note: Democrat politicians and their radical supporters will do everything they can to interfere with and threaten ICE agents enforcing our immigration laws.\n\nHelp us hold these leftists accountable and expose their obstruction.

They have begun to shift their stance after gaining insights from within the organization.\n\nDuring a press conference detailing the arrest of the Washington, DC pipe bomber, Bongino emphasized his renewed commitment to being ‘guided by the facts.’\n\nPatel, speaking at the same event, stated, “An attack on American citizens, our legislative institutions, or our Capitol is an attack on our way of life.”\n\nSocial media users were quick to highlight what they perceived as hypocrisy from the FBI’s top figures.\n\nOne commenter found the remarks ‘ironic,’ labeling them as ‘unserious people,’ especially in light of Donald Trump pardoning 1,500 January 6 protesters on his first day in office. Another criticized Bongino, calling him a ‘clown’ for admitting his previous role involved spreading conspiracies.\n\n‘It’s really great they finally know the right guy to pardon,’ an X user sarcastially quipped.\n\nPatel and Bongino was a prominent pro-MAGA voices defending those who rioted at the US Capitol following Trump’s 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.\n\nAnd Bongino alleged on his podcast before earning his government job that Joe Biden’s FBI actually knew the identity of the bomber and was keeping it from getting out. \n\nOnce leadership was installed at Trump’s second-term FBI, Bongino was tasked with heading the effort to find and charge the person who placed pipe bombs outside the Washington, DC headquarters for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) on January 5, 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity, Bongino walked-back on some of his previous conspiracy rhetoric claiming the FBI was complicit in the bomb planting. \n\n‘I was paid in the past for my opinions, that’s clear, and one day I’ll be back in that space,’ the deputy director claimed. ‘But that’s not what I’m paid for now.’\n\n‘I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts,’ Bongino insisted, claiming the FBI would ‘be guided by the facts as this thing goes forward.’\n\nJust months before taking office, Bongino claimed on his far-right podcast that the pipe bomb ase was ‘the biggest scandal in FBI history.’ \n\nHe alleged that the agency knew the identity of the bomber and said the bombs were planted ‘to create a narrative that crazy MAGA people are trying to assassinate Kamala Harris.’\n\nOne X user gawked at Bongino’s comments to Hannity, admitting ‘he used to get paid to push conspiracy theories on the internet.’\n\n‘Most people already knew, but I still can’t believe he actually said it—what a clown,’ the user wrote. \n\nAnother wrote on X: ‘Are you going to mention that the guy is a Trump supporter who thought the 2020 election was rigged?’\n\nBrian Cole, 30, was the man arrested in Woodbridge, Virginia on Thursday morning for planting bombs on the eve of the certification of the 2021 presidential election. \n\nThe pipe bombs did not detonate and nobody was harmed, but the FBI says if authorities had not disarmed them in time they could have been deadly.\n\nFor four years the case lay cold at the FBI.\n\nThat is until Patel said that he and Bongino immediately went to work assigning a team to scour the evidence.\n\nAt a press conference with Attorney General Pam Bondi and US Attorney for the District of Washington, DC Jeanine Pirro on Thursday, the team confirmed there was no new information, evidence or tip that led to the identification and arrest of Cole.\n\nSpeaking to Hannity on Tuesday, Bongino said: ‘My first meeting, I swore in, and I kid you not, 15 minutes later I said, when I get in there I want a full brief on this pipe bomber case on Day 1.’\n\n‘And I looked at the case agent after getting a full brief on what they had done, and they had done a pretty extensive amount of work,’ he admitted. ‘They had chased down thousands of leads, six thousand-plus interviews had been conducted, hundreds of tips, and it still was relatively stale, the case.’ \n\nBongino said that only bolstered his desire to get to the bottom of the case and ‘track this guy down.’ \n\nAfter a nine-month operation, the deputy FBI director says the agency has succeeded in that mission.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, once known for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Dan Bongino Reveals Surprising Insights into January 6 Pipe Bomber Theory first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/dan-bongino-reveals-surprising-insights-into-january-6-pipe-bomber-theory/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dan-Bongino-makes-astonishing-admission-about-his-January-6-pipe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 17:47:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":388487042,"title":"60 Minutes deportation segment briefly airs in Canada after being shelved in the U.S.","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nInmates remain in their cell at the Centre for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT) in El Salvador.

Jerry Nadler's seat in New York, Federal Election Commission records show.\n\nThe supposedly conservative lawyer's decision to turn his coat fully inside-out has been years in the making.\n\nConway, the ex-husband of former Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway, turned sour after failing to seize an opportunity to serve in the first Trump administration's Justice Department.\n\n'It's time to lay it all on the line.'\n\nWhile Conway said that he changed his mind and withdrew his name from consideration to run the civil division of the DOJ in 2017 after Trump canned then-FBI Director James Comey, Trump claimed that Conway was \"VERY jealous of his wife's success & angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted.\"\n\nTrump added that Conway was a \"stone cold LOSER.\"\n\nOver the years, Conway grew increasingly antagonistic toward the president, ranting about Trump on cable news and attacking him in the pages of liberal publications.\n\nTwo years after weeping with joy in his MAGA hat over Trump's 2016 win, Conway said in an interview, \"I don't feel comfortable being a Republican any more.\"\n\nThe following year, he co-founded the anti-Trump group the Lincoln Project with a handful of former Republican operatives, including Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, Reed Galen, and John Weaver, who allegedly had a habit of sexually harassing young men online.\n\nRELATED: Why Democrats fear this midterm more than Republicans do\n\n George Conway bloviating on CNN. Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images\n\nAccording to a Dec. 17, 2019, op-ed that Conway co-authored with Weaver and the other Lincoln Project co-founders, the aim of the group was to \"stem the damage [Trump] and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American character.\"\n\nWith this aim in mind, the Lincoln Project proceeded to stage a white supremacy rally, bankrolled efforts to torpedo Trump-aligned Republicans, and churned out pro-Kamala Harris content such as the recent \"Be a Man, Vote for a Woman\" ad.\n\nAlthough Conway stepped away from the Lincoln Project in 2020, he did not give up his fixation with Trump.\n\nLast year, he supported Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign and launched a six-figure ad campaign hoping to dissuade Americans from voting for Trump.\n\nAfter spending years throwing his money and hopes after losers and lost causes, Conway has decided to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nIn the first post on his new Substack page, Conway noted, \"I'm going into the arena. I've already put my money where my mouth is, but now it's time to lay it all on the line. It's time to defeat Trumpism once and for all.\"\n\n\"We need Democrats to take over Congress — and not just any Democrats, but the most fearless and relentless ones,\" wrote Conway.\n\nWhile New York's 12th Congressional District is a safe blue seat, Conway is hardly the only Democrat hoping to make it his own. Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of President John F. Kennedy; New York Assemblyman Micah Lasher (D); Democratic Socialist gun critic Cameron Kasky; and former Clinton White House fellow Jami Floyd are among the Democrat candidates presently in the running.\n\nLike Blaze News?

The deep blue enclaves of Milwaukee and Dane County are offset by the redder \"WOW\" counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee, Washington), but America's Dairyland is firmly a purple swing state.\n\nThat's why Republicans must win the governorship in 2026. Outgoing Democratic Governor Tony Evers has left his successor a right mess to clean up. Thanks to Evers' greed, state taxpayers are on the hook for 400 years of school district tax increases. That's already causing sticker shock in communities where residents are receiving their tax bills. Nearly one-third of Wisconsin public school students can't read on grade level, and Black students in Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) test at the bottom nationally in reading and math.\n\nOn top of that, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction has investigated hundreds of educators for sexual misconduct, but kept parents and the general public in the dark until a bombshell report by the Cap Times blew the story wide open. Many of those educators got to keep their licenses and keep working in schools, by the way.\n\nLast week, disgraced Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was found guilty of felony obstruction for her role in hiding illegal immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz from ICE officials when Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan's courtroom on domestic violence charges. Shortly before Dugan assisted Flores-Ruiz, the Evers administration issued a memo about how to deal with ICE agents in the state's courthouses and other public buildings. Was Dugan using that directive as a motive for her actions on April 18? We may never know.\n\nSeveral Democrats have thrown their hat into the race for governor, including former Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes and current Lt. Governor Sara Rodriguez.\n\nBut Wisconsin Congressional Rep. Tom Tiffany has also entered the race on the Republican side, and he's already hammered state Democrats on illegal immigration and other hot-button issues. Tiffany also spoke at AmFest about the importance of fighting to preserve Wisconsin in 2026.\n\nWisconsin is not flyover country — Wisconsin is the backbone of America.It’s up to us to fight like hell to protect our way of life in 2026. pic.twitter.com/OT5XxfpaCW— Tom Tiffany (@TomTiffanyWI) December 21, 2025\n\n\"We are one election away from losing Wisconsin and the home we know,\" Tiffany said. \"And I refuse to allow Minnesota's madness and Illinois' insanity to take root in Wisconsin.\"\n\n\"We need a Wisconsin that thrives like Florida, Texas, and Ohio,\" Tiffany continued, \"a state where freedom grows, jobs are strong, and young people are proud to call it home. Wisconsin dairy fed America. Our foundries armed America. Our timber built America. Our workers powered America through recessions and wars and every challenge that was thrown at us.\"\n\n\"Wisconsin is not flyover country. It is the backbone of the United States of America,\" Tiffany said. \"And now we need to protect it. We already tailgate in ten degrees like we're in downtown Phoenix. If we can survive that, we can knock doors, we can make calls, we can fight and we can win.\"\n\n\"But you gotta fight like your future depends on it, because our very way of life is at stake. Wisconsin's comeback starts now, and Wisconsin's comeback starts with you,\" Tiffany added. \"We're going red in 2026. We are going red again in 2028 and we will make Wisconsin great again.\"\n\n\"And I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and I hope you will check out our movement in Wisconsin as we take the governorship in our great state at TomTiffany.com,\" he said before tossing an iconic foam Cheesehead into the crowd.\n\nThe likely Democratic frontrunner, Mandela Barnes, knows his radical Leftist agenda won't play well in Wisconsin. He's changed his tune on ICE, as well as defunding the police and cashless bail, since announcing his candidacy.\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Townhall, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.\n\nHelp us continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration and its successes.

Religion has sometimes been controversial at the United States military academies. In 1972, Attorney Warren Kaplan of the ACLU and Leo Pfeffer of the American Jewish Committee participated in a lawsuit involving students at West Point and Annapolis. The issue: ending academy regulations on chapel service attendance.\n\nArguing for Defense Secretary Melvin Laird were U.S. Attorneys Robert Hanlon and Thomas Flannery, John Adams for the military chaplains, and Joseph B. Friedman, of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. The brawl was a classic church-and-state imbroglio.\n\nSince 1821 at West Point, 1853 at Annapolis, and 1955 at the Air Force Academy, chapel attendance had been mandatory. Regulations for the United States Cadet Corps of the United States Military Academy were typical: “Attendance at Chapel is part of a cadet's training; no cadet is exempt. Each cadet must attend either the Cadet Chapel, Catholic Chapel, or Jewish Chapel service on each Sunday, according to announced schedules.\"\n\nIn recognition of the growing atheism in the cultural revolution of the 1960s, superintendents of the academies amended the policy in April 1969: \"It is understood that intelligent provisions must be made for bona fide cases where attendance would be in conflict with sincerely held convictions of individual cadets or midshipmen.\"\n\n“Thus, when the effect on the individual cadet is opposite to that intended, i.e., when he becomes incapable of observing, assimilating, or becoming involved with an understanding of the religious beliefs of men and finds himself turning away from an understanding of what their religious belief and value systems are, then he is relieved from the attendance requirement,” wrote District Judge Howard Corcoran in upholdidng the policy. \n\nThe ever-amazing District of Columbia Court of Appeals found that this broad regulation, which supports religious and non-religious practices equally, amounted to the establishment of a religion, as in \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Colonel Sylvanus Thayer, the father of the military academy at West Point and the one who began the policy, was likely not amused. \n\nIf this were a true established religion of the United States, would it have been called Judeo-Christian Atheism? Or today would it be Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Buddhist-Hindu Atheism? The Supreme Court punted on the case. This further chipped away at our national tradition of giving pride of place to religious practice for those in the line of fire. Anderson v. Laird became the governing law in this matter.\n\nWell, religious instincts among the young cannot be so easily extinguished. Remember when Sen. Kamala Harris asked a judicial nominee, “If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization [the Knights of Columbus] to avoid any appearance of bias?\" Never mind that President John Kennedy had been a member. This Catholic men’s association has 17,000 councils worldwide, including at military bases such as Camp Humphreys in South Korea. All the military academies have college K of C councils, including West Point and Annapolis.\n\nThis year at halftime, rather than kicking back and having a beer, which would never happen since cadets and midshipmen are not allowed to drink, something different happened.\n\nCatholics love their rosary and their sports. These Knights of Columbus college councils, independent of their academies, sponsored the Second Annual Halftime Rosary for cadets and midshipmen during the 126th Army-Navy Game in Baltimore. Approximately 250 cadets and midshipmen joined Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly, Supreme Chaplain Archbishop William E. Lori, and The Most Reverend Timothy P. Broglio, J.C.D., Archbishop for the Military Services. A commemorative rosary coin was given to participants.\n\n“The Knights of Columbus is again honored to join young Catholic men and women to pray the rosary during the Army-Navy football game, which draws us closer to Jesus Christ, our Holy Mother, and our Catholic faith,” said Supreme Knight Kelly. “These cadets and midshipmen are the best and brightest young adults our nation has to offer. As a retired naval officer, and as someone who joined our organization as a college knight, I am proud of their selfless sacrifice to our nation, and their witness to their Catholic faith.”\n\nRelated: Indiana Football’s 'Hoosiers' Moment Finally Arrived\n\nLawsuits aside, all service academies retain in some form the foundational basis for duty, honor, and country, which is faith in God. That is the ultimate basis of our common humanity and duty to each other. Otherwise, we are just serving our own self-determined interests and goals, whether they be career, fame, wealth, or vanity.\n\nGodspeed, Navy, Marines, Army, and Air Force!\n\nJoin PJ Media VIP today and get 74% off with promo code MERRY74.

At this point, Candace Owens is just about unstoppable. After her very public removal from “The Daily Wire,” Owens detonated the box she was put in, building a media machine that thrives on controversy, political defiance and a fiercely loyal audience that refuses to let her fade. Love her or loathe her, one thing is undeniable: the Republican establishment has tried to discipline Candace Owens — and failed. \n\nFolks thought she was on her way to become one of the most prominent voices in the right-wing political sphere, but her dive into the death of Charlie Kirk, combined with her MAGA flip, took everyone by surprise. Her boldness begs the question: could Owens topple the Republican Party? Here are 13 reasons we think the idea isn’t as far out as it sounds.\n\nOwens Gets Canned: ‘I’m Finally Free’\n\nWhat doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. And that saying has never been more evident than in Owens’ upward trajectory in the media. “The Daily Wire,” co-founded by Ben Shapiro, severed ties with the podcast queen after a public feud involving her pattern of antisemitic language, per CNN. We should’ve all known she was a sleeping giant when she wrote to fans, “The rumors are true — I am finally free.”\n\nHer Platform is Unstoppable\n\nOwens recently honored a staggering win for her platform. The podcast star celebrated becoming the #1 podcast worldwide for downloads and views per episode “without spending a single dollar on advertising,” she boasted.Owens went on to thank first lady of France, Brigitte Macron, for her controversial lawsuit, problematic yet beloved rap star Kanye — now just Ye — for giving her the courage to be bold, Ben Shapiro for firing her — which allowed her to blossom, and all the mess that brought her to the top. Savage.\n\nShe Won’t Be Tied Down to the Republican Party\n\nWhile Owens spoke on thanking her haters — and her “tiny engine” of a team — she questioned, “What is conservatism?” According to her she won’t be tied the Republicans or a conservative path, and instead claims to seek truth above all. “The Republican party is going through a moment,” Owens began, “I don’t wanna be tied down to the Republican Party. I wanna be able to say something against Democrats and Republicans. We’re doing that, we’re speaking truth, and we’ll continue to speak truth.”\n\nConservatives Sound Alarms\n\nTim Pool of “TimCast IRL” — who describes himself as left-leaning but is considered conservative — had a full-blown meltdown about Owens, declaring that she’s responsible for destroying Turning Point USA, and the splintering of the MAGA movement. “Candace Owens is a f***ing evil scumbag,” Pool stated, per the Post. “She is burning everything down, and she’s gloating and smiling while she does it.”\n\nDuring a recent episode, Pool claimed, “Who is destroying Turning Point? Candace Owens.” \n\nShe Doesn’t Take Sides\n\nWhile it may be hard to keep up with the conspiracy buff, it’s abundantly clear that she’s altogether against taking sides. Owens has built her brand on rejecting party loyalty when it conflicts with her personal worldview, even when that defiance costs her institutional support or political allies. All the while, she keeps on pushing. \n\nDistancing Herself From MAGA Mania\n\nAs Owens distances herself from MAGA mania, she’s signaling a shift toward a more self-styled, ideologically fluid position — one that prioritizes skepticism over party loyalty. Rather than losing her base, fans simply continue to follow her trail, while attracting viewers who are disillusioned with both major political camps.\n\nOwens Claims People Are ‘Waking Up’\n\nAs we previously reported, Owens detailed her position during an episode titled “Charlie Kirk Shooting Suspect Charged. Something Isn’t Right…” With over 200,000 fans on her live, she stated the viewers represent the people who are waking up.\n\n“This is not left or right— I don’t care. […] We are fighting evil people who rule over us and impact both sides,” said Owens. “That’s the wakeup call we all need right now and I hope people are waking up to that fact as we look into what happened here,” she added, referring to the shooting of her friend, Kirk.\n\nPeople Care About What She Has to Say\n\nHate it or love it, folks care about what Candace Owens has to say. And to be honest, even folks who disagree with her look out for what she’s going to say next. In 2024, Owens secured one of the highest-viewed Breakfast Club interviews ever, which accumulated approximately 3.6 million views. The episode shot up to iHeart’s Top 10 interviews of the year, further solidifying her position as an influential figure — for better or worse.\n\nShe’s Not Afraid of Backlash\n\nJust when you think Candace Owens hits the pinnacle of audaciousness, she makes another shocking claim. The political lone warrior alleged that abortion is a plot to exterminate Black babies, school shootings are the result of LGBTQ+ influence, and that the moon landing is “fake and gay,” per the Washington Post. You’d think people would back off. Instead, the political firecracker keeps rolling on.\n\nIs Owens Uncancelable?\n\nOwens told Intelligencer that she’s got spidey senses like “That’s So Raven,” expressing what it’s like to feel urgency in sharing information with her fans. “There’ve been moments in my life where something comes on and it’s so overwhelming that I have to act.” Mind you, all these cases unfolded — and she still skyrocketed to the top of the charts in the most successful podcasts.\n\nKamala Harris Isn’t Black, According to Owens\n\nThis one had folks in a chokehold. One of her episodes, titled “Breaking News: Kamala Harris LIED About Her Black Grandparents,” claimed the former Vice President fabricated details about her genealogy for the sake of resonating with the Black audience for votes. While the world clutched its pearls, offended by her claims, she wasn’t cancelled.\n\nShe’s Banned From Australia\n\nIn a head-turning series of events, Owens was straight-up banned from the entire country of Australia when Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke denied her visa application last October due to concerns regarding her “inflammatory” comments, we reported. Owens may not be welcomed on Aussie grounds, but she still isn’t cancelled. \n\nPolitics on Her Own Terms\n\nWhether she’s ousted from “The Daily Wire,” or facing relentless backlash over her statements on race, politics and global conspiracies, Owens has bounced back stronger every time. As she breaks from MAGA and Turning Point USA, while commanding a fiercely loyal audience, she’s showing that she doesn’t just influence the party — she could potentially destabilize it, reshaping political direction on her own terms now and in the future.","summary":"Candace Owens has repeatedly turned setbacks into comebacks.

Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.\n\nMorning Memo Live!\n\nJoin me Jan. 29 in Washington, D.C., for our first Morning Memo Live event. \n\nI’ll be moderating a panel discussion on the politicization of the Justice Department, featuring:\n\nStacey Young, a former 18-year DOJ veteran who is the founder and executive director of Justice Connection, a network of DOJ alumni providing support to current and recent DOJ employees;\n\nAaron Zelinsky, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Maryland who served on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, where he prosecuted Roger Stone, and who is now a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder in Baltimore; and\n\nAnna Bower, a senior editor at Lawfare who covers rule of law issues and fields wacky Signal messages from Lindsey Halligan.\n\nTickets are on sale now!\n\n===================================================\n\nWith New Facts, Boasberg Changes His Mind\n\nIn the constitutional clash over President Trump’s unprecedented peacetime invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has ruled that the Venezuelan nationals shipped off to El Salvador’s CECOT facility can challenge their designations as alien enemies even though they’ve been released to their home country and are no longer in custody.\n\nIn an accompanying order, Boasberg gave the Trump administration until Jan. 5 to come up with a proposed plan to “facilitate the return” of the former AEA detainees to the United States or to provide them with presumably remote hearings that give them the due process they were denied when they were summarily deported in March without notice or a chance to challenge their designations as alien enemies. \n\nWhile Boasberg also certified the former detainees case as a class action lawsuit, the real meat of his decision was a reversal of his own prior decision in the case over the summer. In light of the many significant new facts that have emerged, Boasberg reversed course and concluded that the detainees were in the constructive custody of the United States while they were being held at CECOT in El Salvador.\n\nBoasberg had previously denied them habeas relief because of a lack of constructive custody, but found a separate legal avenue in equity that entitled them to pursue their denial of due process claims. This time, Boasberg found both avenues available to them. Of the two, the habeas path is probably the stronger option and is more readily defensible on appeal. \n\nWhat changed Boasberg’s mind were the numerous revelations that have occurred since he first confronted the issue, among them: “statements by El Salvadoran officials, whistleblower statements by Government officials, public statements by top U.S. officials, and even clear evidence of a U.S.-Venezuelan prisoner swap.”\n\n“All in all, the undisputed factual record indicates that the United States and El Salvador have behaved as principal and agent in the detention and subsequent release of Plaintiffs,” Boasberg ruled, pointing to “three takeaways” from the new evidence:\n\n“El Salvador acted at the behest of the United States”; \n\n“it was indifferent to Plaintiffs’ detention outside of honoring its arrangement with the United States”; and \n\n“the United States retained the ability to control their release from CECOT”\n\nBoasberg zeroed in on the revelations by former DOJ lawyer turned whistleblower Erez Reuveni, including the notorious comment attributed to Emil Bove, who is now an appeals court judge: “According to his disclosure, the Principal Assistant Deputy Attorney General stated in a meeting that if courts attempted to stop the removals, DOJ would need to consider telling the courts, “Fuck you” and ignore any court order.”\n\nIt is, I believe, the first time Bove’s comment has made it into a judicial ruling, and Boasberg didn’t pull punches by redacting the curse word. Then again, Boasberg happened to be the first judge to get the administration’s “Fuck you” when it defied his orders and let the AEA deportation flights continue despite his orders to stop them and turn the planes around.\n\nBari Weiss Owns Spiking CECOT Segment\n\nEditor-in-chief Bari Weiss confirmed it was her decision to spike the 60 Minutes segment on CECOT, according to accounts from a CBS News staff meeting Monday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, the executive producer of the legendary TV newsmagazine told colleagues that she had fought for the segment but was overruled by Weiss, the WaPo reports:\n\n“In the end, our editor in chief had a different vision for how the piece should be, and it came late in the process, and we were not in a position to address the notes,” said executive producer Tanya Simon, according to a partial transcript of the meeting obtained by The Washington Post. “We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes, and I ultimately had to comply.”\n\nSimon succeeded longtime executive producer Bill Owens, who resigned in April over then-parent company Paramount’s grubby settlement with Donald Trump over how 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nWeiss intervened so late in the editorial process that the segment had already aired on a streaming service in Canada.

At the time of every other hearing she’s held in his two cases since March, he’s been in the custody of either El Salvador, DOJ, or ICE. \n\nXinis, who ordered him freed from ICE detention on Dec. 11, is treading very carefully around the edges of her jurisdiction as she tries to prevent the Trump administration from subjecting Abrego Garcia to further unlawful treatment, including re-detaining him.\n\nHere’s my brief dispatch. \n\nMass Deportation Watch\n\nNYT: Inside the Deportation Machine: How ICE has moved thousands of people through detention and out of the country\n\nWaPo: It’s a War: Inside ICE’s media machine\n\nAnother Unlawful Boat Strike\n\nOne person was killed in a U.S. strike Monday on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the eastern Pacific, bringing the death toll in the lawless campaign to 105. \n\nCannon Buries MAL Report For 2 More Months\n\nUnder a 60-day deadline from an appeals court to decide already whether to release Special Counsel Jack Smith’s report on the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon waited 49 days to finally rule … and then ordered the report kept secret for another two months. \n\nIn her ruling, Cannon said her order keeping the Justice Department from distributing the report would expire Feb. 24. She gave no explanation for that particular date. \n\nCannon ostentatiously extended an invitation for President Trump and his former co-defendants in the case to appeal her decision and try to keep the report buried for even longer: “Nothing in this Order prohibits any former or current party to this action from moving for leave to intervene, if warranted, and/or from timely seeking appropriate relief before that deadline.”\n\nAt the same time, Cannon issued a separate ruling that refused to allow the outside groups who had forced the issue with the appeals court — resulting in its November order for her to rule within 60 days on their motions, which had been pending since February — to intervene in the case.\n\nAll in a day’s work for Cannon.\n\nJohn Brennan Tries to DQ Cannon\n\nIn a highly unusual effort, former CIA Director John Brennan is trying to pre-empt Aileen Cannon from overseeing a retributive grand jury investigation that is reportedly the hub for all manner of Trumpian investigate the investigators conspiracies and claims. \n\nBrennan’s lawyers sent a 16-page letter, first reported by the NYT, to the chief judge of the Southern District of Florida to try to head off Cannon having a role in the grand jury that is expected to begin its work in January: “[W]e urge Your Honor to exercise your supervisory authority as Chief Judge to ensure the United States Attorney does not steer this matter to the Fort Pierce Division and to the courtroom of Judge Aileen Cannon.”\n\nThe chief judge had previously intervened privately to urge Cannon not to take the Mar-a-Lago criminal case after she’d overseen the civil Trump brought to try to head off the probe, the NYT reported in 2024.\n\nThe Bloodletting at Heritage Foundation\n\nThe fallout from Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts’ embrace of the Tucker Carlson interview with antisemite Nick Fuentes continues, with resignations by staffers, many of whom are fleeing to Mike Pence’s think tank.\n\nAmong the reported departures from Heritage: Hans von Spakovsky, the longtime voting fraud bamboozler who has been a TPM favorite for nearly two decades.\n\nOne note on how to make sense of this: It’s definitely driven by a split over antisemitism, but it goes a little deeper than the surface ripples of think tankers moving around\n\nAs I understand it, the think tank world is largely an eat-what-you-kill operation. Think tankers have particular funders, and particular funders have think tankers. So I suspect the underlying split here is among funders, and the WSJ report that broke a lot of this open gives a prime example of this:\n\nArt Pope, a longtime prominent donor in North Carolina, said he had stopped giving to the Heritage Foundation because he saw the group supporting populist economic policies in recent years. He is now giving to AAF, he said, in a bid to move the party in a different direction.\n\nWhether it’s existing funders pulling the plug and shifting their donations to a different think tank, or a think tank like Pence’s being able to entice new funders to support taking on refugees from Heritage, or a combination of both, the fault lines we’re seeing on the surface are probably the result of the seismic movement of funders. \n\nTrump’s Favorite Excuse in 2025 \n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nHot tips?

Jasmine Crockett Says She Won’t Be ‘Distracted’ By VP JD Vance Attacking Her With ‘Racist Tropes’","text":"Source: Omar Vega / Getty It’s a shame that being a prominent, outspoken Black woman in politics means you will spend your entire career justifying your very existence. One of the reasons Kamala Harris isn’t sitting in the Oval Office right now is that the misogynoir Black woman politicians have to fight through just to be marginally respected, let alone elected, is far too great. In the era of MAGA, it only seems to be getting worse. On Monday, we reported that Vice President JD Vance spoke during a Turning Point USA event in Phoenix, during which he declared to his predominantly Caucasian audience, “In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore,” as if there was ever a time when the largest and most powerful racial demographic in the world has ever been compelled to apologize for upholding white supremacy for 400 years, let alone just being white. As I noted in that report, when Vance says white people don’t have to apologize for being white, “what he’s actually saying is they don’t need to apologize for being racist.” And he demonstrated that in the same speech when he told his audience that Rep. Jasmine Crockett “wants to be a senator, though her street girl persona is about as real as her nails.” Vance’s brand of dog-whistling racism is nothing new to Crockett, which is why her clapback was as casual and unbothered as the blatant bigotry is when it comes from every mouth representing the Trump administration. “Anybody that you talk to knows my credentials. They know that I’ve gone to school. They know that I’m educated…but at the end of the day, I am who I am, and I am authentic,” Crockett said Thursday, on MS Now’s The Weekend: Primetime, recalling that Vance’s “street girl” reference mirrored the same “racist tropes” she had heard her “entire life.” “That is actually what they are fearful of…my authenticity, because it rings true with every single American, whether they’re a Texan or not,” Crockett continued. As I wrote previously, Crockett has never once claimed to be a “street girl,” a wannabe “gangsta” from the “hood” or the “fake ghetto hoodrat” white conservatives have repeatedly accused her of being, not because she has ever presented herself as such, but because they’re racist; so racist, in fact, that they can’t differentiate between authentic Blackness and what they consider “ghetto.” It’s the kind of blatant anti-Black racism that should be condemned — especially when it’s being perpetuated by the president, vice president, or any elected official — but, instead, it has been normalized by the MAGA world’s effort to make bigotry commonplace again. Still, Crockett isn’t cracking under that pressure, and she said she won’t be “distracted” by Vance’s remarks. “When they can tell me about their policies that are helping Texas, then we can have a conversation,” she said. “Until then, take whatever shots you want to take at me, because I have been a Black woman my entire life.” Exactly.

Donald Trump had just been triumphantly re-elected, with a victory in the seven key states and control of both Houses. Political capital that put him in a position of strength on the international stage.Meanwhile, in Europe, everyone was a bit jittery at the prospect of having to deal with Donald Trump again. Not simply because he had given European leaders a rough ride during his first term, but also because he had promised during his campaign to end the war in Ukraine \"within 24 hours.\"Paradoxically, Ukrainians were fairly satisfied with Donald Trump's victory. Their reasoning: Kamala Harris would have meant Joe Biden's status quo, if not worse, while Donald Trump might shake things up. Kyiv's European allies were less optimistic and feared the new American administration would simply turn away from the conflict in Ukraine, considering it a European problem and believing the United States had other priorities.It therefore seemed urgent to open a dialogue with Donald Trump. The occasion presented itself on December 6, 2024, with the reopening of Notre Dame de Paris. Emmanuel Macron invited Donald Trump as guest of honor and organized, on the sidelines, a three-way meeting at the Elysee with Volodymyr Zelensky. Contact was established. But the relief proved to be short-lived.From erosion to ruptureEverything shifted in February. On Wednesday, February 12, a phone call between Washington and Moscow hinted at an American intention to sideline the Europeans from the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.Two days later, on February 14, Europeans were aghast at JD Vance's speech in Munich, framed as an ideological declaration of war. That day, the US vice president judged that the \"threat from within\" was the most significant for the Old Continent, that Europe had renounced \"some of its most fundamental values,\" and that it trampled on freedom of speech.Finally, on February 28, JD Vance was again on the front line, in the Oval Office, in a now-famous clash with Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian president was accused of being disrespectful, insufficiently grateful to the United States, and, above all, of being the main obstacle to peace.For 80 years, the transatlantic relationship had been a pillar of foreign policy on both sides of the Atlantic, a factor of geopolitical stability, and the core of Europe's security architecture. However, in reality this relationship has been fraying for over 20 years.Successive international crises (Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan) divided the West - as Sylvie Kauffmann describes very well in a series of articles for Le Monde - while American presidents have long asked Europe to take charge of its security, to share the burden of Europe's defense.February 2025 nonetheless marked a rupture. Because now the Allies are divided over values, the US interferes in the internal affairs of European countries, and it is still tempted to give the nod to Russia.Trying to get back on trackIt is against this last point that European leaders fought throughout the year. This was notably the case with the summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15. A meeting that forced European leaders to go in force to the White House three days later to pull Donald Trump back to their positions. There were few concrete advances from this sequence. Only a diplomatic victory for Vladimir Putin. A leader under an ICC arrest warrant welcomed with honors on American soil.Then in late November came the US-Russian peace plan. A 28-point plan under which Ukraine would cede territory, reduce the size of its army, and renounce its ambitions to join NATO. The plan also provided for lifting Western sanctions on Russia, its reintegration into the G8, as well as a general amnesty. Again, it took a series of meetings for Europeans to modify this plan and avoid a form of capitulation for Ukraine.Substantively, negotiations keep stalling on more or less the same points. Europeans and Ukrainians want a ceasefire: stop the fighting first, then discuss the terms of peace. The Russians, in contrast, do not want a ceasefire; they want a peace treaty that addresses the \"root causes\" of the conflict. A position that, in reality, allows them to prolong the war and continue to gain ground while their negotiators rehearse the same obsessions. Then there is the question of security guarantees, essential for Kyiv, unacceptable for Moscow.The question now is how long this diplomatic game can last. The United States seems intent on re-engaging with Russia. A reset to establish a relationship that allows business to be resumed with Russia. In this framework, the war in Ukraine is an irritant and the Europeans are obstacles. For Washington, the quickest way to end the conflict is ultimately to twist the arm of the weaker party, i.e. the Ukrainians.\"I think they are weak\"And it is not just an impression; it also emerges from the new US National Security Strategy, published in early December. The document states that ending the fighting \"quickly\" and \"restoring strategic stability with Russia\" is a \"core interest\" of the United States. In essence, everything is summed up by the Kremlin's reaction, which said the document is \"consistent\" with Russia's view.This document also sparked strong reactions on this side of the Atlantic because it warns of a \"civilizational erasure\" of Europe, a way of calling on the continent to change course. In an interview with Politico a few days later, Donald Trump went further, describing Europe as a group of nations \"in decline\" and hinting that he could support political figures who share his agenda.In a world of power politics, in the age of predators, to borrow the title of Giuliano da Empoli's book, Donald Trump no longer hesitates to twist the arms of his allies. \"I think they are weak,\" he says in this interview about European leaders, \"I think they do not know what to do.\"It should be noted, however, that in the United States, even amongst Republicans, not everyone shares this vision. Within the Trump administration, Marco Rubio serves as a counterweight to pro-Russian positions, while Congress remains largely in favor of supporting Ukraine and still sees Russia as an enemy.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2026 thus provides that US military personnel in Europe cannot fall below the threshold of 76,000 for more than forty-five consecutive days, that any suspension of intelligence to Ukraine must be notified to Congress, and that the United States cannot abandon the post of supreme commander of NATO forces.Finally, to end on an optimistic note, there is an idea circulating among international relations specialists: perhaps one day the Charlemagne Prize should be awarded to Donald Trump. A prize given to outstanding figures who have worked for European unification. Because while many things can be reproached to Donald Trump, one must also acknowledge that he has the merit of confronting Europe with its responsibilities and forcing it to take its destiny into its own hands.Find all the articles in the \"2025 as seen by MarketScreener\" series:Tariffs, from market crash to the Supreme Court docketPolitical pressure and economic fog, the Fed in a perfect storm (forthcoming)","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/2025-the-year-of-the-break-between-europe-and-the-us-ce7d50d3de8cf027","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images//reuters/2025-08-19T052859Z_1_LYNXMPEL7I05S_RTROPTP_4_UKRAINE-CRISIS-SUMMIT.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 15:48:47","author":"Antoine Alves D'oliveira","authors":["Antoine Alves D'oliveira"],"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":388481312,"title":"A Banned CBS ‘60 Minutes’ Segment Has Leaked Online—It’s Raising Questions About Conditions in El Salvador’s Notorious CECOT Prison","text":"CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss blocked a 60 Minutes segment from airing over the weekend after legitimate concerns over copyright issues. The segment, which was later aired by Canadian broadcaster Global TV, focused on Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison, which falls under the Trump administration.\n\nVideos of the segment briefly circulated on YouTube, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter).\n\nStill, many were quickly removed due to copyright claims from Paramount Skydance, CBS News’ parent company. Yet copies of the clip were preserved on platforms like the Internet Archive.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAs per The Daily Beast, the footage was quite violent as Venezuelan college student and asylum seeker Luis Munoz Pinto described brutal treatment at CECOT.\n\n“There was blood everywhere, screams, people crying, people who couldn’t take it and were urinating and vomiting on themselves. Four guards grabbed me, and they beat me until I bled. They knocked our faces against the wall and broke one of my teeth.”\n\nIt is one of the largest prisons in Latin America, which started in 2023. It has a capacity to keep 40,000 inmates. Many deported immigrants, as part of Trump’s mass deportation drive, are currently residing there. The footage included interviews with these detainees, but was taken down.\n\nAs per NBC News, Luis Munoz Pinto said that the conditions of the people kept in the infamous prison were beyond comprehension. They could never leave, and he was waiting for an asylum decision when he was deported to CECOT earlier this year. He has since been released but continues to say that he endured four months of torture. \n\nThis CECOT story in summary is just evil for shits and giggles.\nTo intentionally make an example of men like Louise Munoz Pinto…who applied for asylum legally..with no criminal record…and deport him and others to be raped/tortured is a level of evil I can’t wrap my mind around https://t.co/5mhGDDYCW0\n— Cloud (@maestroxv_) December 23, 2025\n\nThe segment also featured clips of President Donald Trump praising El Salvador’s prisons and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanking El Salvador for working with the ruling government.\n\nWhen the Trump administration announced the mass deportation policies, they were aimed only to target illegal immigrants and criminals who would be deported through a proper legal process. \n\nHowever, as of 2025, several cases of abuse, forced arrests and messy detention cases have been reported across the country, making many citizens unhappy and causing unrest through protests and online feuds. \n\nJenique Jones, a credit specialist from Bethlehem and a longtime Trump supporter, told CNN’s John King that Trump has not kept his promises, and she feels let down, thanks to abrupt immigration raids, tariffs, and a million other impulsive changes in the system.\n\n“We changed presidents at the beginning of the year, and the guy who moved into the White House said that he was going to fix it,” King said. “Has he fixed it? Absolutely not,” Jones responded. “I’m definitely waiting for him to fix it.”\n\nFurthermore, CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss stated the story “needed additional reporting” before airing, as specific journalistic standards need to be met while content is published. \n\nCNN got rare, exclusive access inside El Salvador’s Cecot prison, where some of the country’s most notorious gang members are held.

She added that the network was delaying the story because the Trump administration’s declining to comment would allow the government to block coverage by staying silent.\n\nIn November, Donald Trump sat down with Host Norah O’Donnell for a 60 Minutes interview, which was his first since resolving a legal dispute with CBS News earlier in 2025. The popular network reportedly agreed to pay $16 million to settle a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who accused CBS News of deceptively editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nThe president had walked away mid-interview after he was upset.\n\nThe Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) is widely considered the harshest and most notorious prison in El Salvador and arguably in the World !🌍 pic.twitter.com/vzCRQgihGy\n— D1 (@Temsuntbaba) December 19, 2025\n\nAlso, just like CECOT, Florida’s Alligator Alcatraz has been slammed for its inhuman living conditions, allegedly comparing them to concentration camps. Situated amidst lush greenery, it was built in just eight days. The compound reportedly includes 200 surveillance cameras, over 400 staff, and a capacity for 3,000 detainees.\n\nRep.

At the time, he highlighted that California was getting very little in return from the Federal government despite paying massive taxes.\n\nGovernor Newsom’s Press Office posted, “WHY DO WE PAY FEDERAL TAXES???

Earlier in November, the President had an interview with Laura Ingraham, where he called Newsom a ‘horrible governor.’ Trump remarked, “I knew Gavin for four years. I got along great with him. But he’s gone radical left.”\n\nHe added, “If he ran the country like that, we would have an absolutely gonezo country. This country would be gone. The fact is, if I weren’t president, if Kamala [Harris] got in, you wouldn’t have $20 trillion coming in, you’d have money leaving.”\n\nThe feud between the two politicians is likely to intensify as Newsom is one of the frontrunners to become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee for the 2028 election, when Trump’s second term will come to an end.\n\nThe governor has already expressed his interest in running for the presidency, and it will be interesting to see how it further escalates tensions between him and Trump.","summary":"Newsom often takes digs at Trump on social media.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/gavin-newsom-reignites-old-trump-controversy-with-schlonged-remark-in-fresh-online-jab","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2025-12-23T173039.819.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 15:23:27","author":"Jashandeep Singh","authors":["Jashandeep Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":388455746,"title":"Late-night comedy shows booked 90 liberal guests to one conservative in late 2025, study shows","text":"A recent NewsBusters study indicates late-night comedy shows continued their trend of overwhelmingly booking liberal guests in the second half of 2025. \"The grand totals were 90 liberals and Democrats compared to one conservative,\" the report from Monday detailed.

In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAlfonsi told the New York Times, which reported the note on Sunday evening: “I refer all questions to Bari Weiss,” referring to the new CBS News editor-in-chief. Neither Alfonsi nor Weiss responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nCECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial. It has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.\n\nSkydance Media, run by David Ellison – the son of longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, Larry Ellison – acquired Paramount in August. David Ellison helped secure regulatory approval for the deal with the promise that the CBS network would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of American viewers.\n\nPrior to the deal, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a 2024 lawsuit Trump filed over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed gave a distorted view of his rival for the White House.\n\nThe FCC has said the settlement and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nOn Monday, Ellison stepped in to personally guarantee $40.4 billion in Paramount Skydance’s latest effort to pry Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O away from selling its prized Hollywood assets to streaming giant Netflix NFLX.O. It is unclear whether Weiss knew about the guarantee when she decided to hold the story.\n\nEarlier this month Trump attacked the new owners of CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with his former ally, Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on the same day Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nIn an X post Monday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer implied that the “60 Minutes” postponement was politically motivated. “Trump and his billionaire buddies are trying to shape what people see and hear to create their own alternative reality,” Schumer wrote.\n\n“The Trump administration doesn’t have a veto on what stories get told. CBS should put the full, unedited version of this story on the air ASAP. A free press doesn’t kowtow to the president – it holds him accountable.”\n\nLINK REMOVED\n\nCBS removed a link to the “Inside CECOT” segment page on Sunday.\n\nA description on its Paramount Plus website earlier Sunday said the segment was scheduled to air at 7:30 p.m. ET, with Alfonsi speaking to recently released deportees about the “brutal and torturous” conditions they had endured in the prison.\n\nWeiss raised several concerns with “60 Minutes” producers about Alfonsi’s segment and requested a substantial amount of new material to be added, the CBS employee said. The New York Times reported that Weiss suggested adding an interview with White House official Stephen Miller or another senior Trump administration figure.\n\nWeiss further questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the Venezuelan men who were deported, noting they were in the U.S. illegally, the employee said.\n\nIn her note, Alfonsi stated that her team had sought comments from the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote.\n\nThe decision comes as the network goes through changes under Weiss, who was picked to lead CBS News in October after CBS parent company Paramount Skydance acquired the online publication she founded, The Free Press.\n\nWeiss, a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal opinion writer, was considered by some analysts as a controversial choice as she had never managed a television newsroom or produced broadcast news content before.\n\nOn December 10 she named Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of its flagship “CBS Evening News” segment, replacing the dual anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois.","summary":"What appeared to be a “60 Minutes” report on a Salvadoran mega prison housing U.S.-deported migrants spread online on Monday, a day after CBS News pulled the segment prior to its scheduled Sunday broadcast, saying it needed additional reporting.

And if you're like me, you still shudder at the mere thought of what would have become of the country we love if the equally *brilliant* Kamala Harris had not been decisively mauled by President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nApparently, a group of nearly 100 Minnesota mayors has already learned.\n\nSo yeah, 98 mayors across Minnesota have sounded the alarm in a no-nonsense letter to Walz and state lawmakers, blistering the state’s fiscal mismanagement. The distraught mayors warned that what was once an $18 billion surplus has not only vanished under the far-left governor’s watch; the surplus has been replaced by a projected $3 billion deficit for the 2028–29 budget cycle. \n\nThe mayors went bottom-line, warning that Walz’s policies have strained their cities, harmed residents, and pushed Minnesota down in national economic rankings — evidence, they said, of the state government racing headlong toward \"fiscal disaster.\"\n\nTranslation: Just like most Democrat-run cities and states — only worse.\n\nThe letter states, in part:\n\nFraud, unchecked spending, and inconsistent fiscal management in St. Paul have trickled down to our cities—reducing our capacity to plan responsibly, maintain infrastructure, hire and retain employees, and sustain core services without overburdening local taxpayers.There is a growing disconnect between state-level fiscal decisions and the strain they place on the cities we lead. When the state expands programs or shifts responsibilities without stable funding, it is our residents—families, seniors, businesses, and workers—who ultimately bear the cost.\n\nBingo. The problem, of course, is that Democrat politicians gleefully embrace, as the old proverb says, robbing Peter to pay Paul, because — they believe — they will always have the support of Paul.\n\nTHE 'GIFT' THAT KEEPS ON GIVING: Walz Jumps Out of the Frying Pan Into the Fire As Federal Probe of Massive Minnesota Welfare Scam Widens\n\nBoom: Disability Advocate Lets Loose on Tim Walz and Minnesota Officials Over Fraud During State Hearing\n\nMinnesota Republican lawmakers put the blame — rightly so — on Walz and the state's Democrat lawmakers. State Republican Sen. Andrew Lang, who serves as the lead on the Senate State and Local Government Committee, said in a statement:\n\nGovernor Walz and Democrats passed unaffordable spending and tax increases along with unfunded mandates on the promise it would make life more affordable. In reality they just passed down the costs to local governments, schools, and small businesses, who in turn pass down costs to local taxpayers and consumers.Minnesota counties sounded the alarm early last session about the proposals to shift costs onto their budgets, so I’m not surprised that nearly 100 mayors across the state are raising their own concerns. This letter is a warning that we must reduce state spending, stop the massive fraud plaguing our state, and remove unnecessary mandates to keep life affordable for everyone.\n\nAgain, neither Walz nor Minnesota Democrat state lawmakers could care less about unaffordable spending, ridiculous tax increases, unfunded mandates, and fraud as long as they prioritize \"takers\" over \"makers.\" \n\nAfter all, that's the foundational tenet of today's Democrat Party.\n\nNote: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

He will say some things that they like, and he will put on a hard hat and get into a semi-truck and act like he is going to do things for people who drive trucks for a living. And so I think that’s part of it. I think that’s a huge part of it and an underrated part of it.\n\nBacon: So unpack. With all that said, we’re now in a place where there’s a New York Times story about how every Democratic figure is using the word affordability now, and you can really see that even some Republicans are using that word.\n\nI think Abigail Spanberger might mean different things when she uses it, but a lot of people are using that word right now. You also have the Democrats deciding to cancel the DNC autopsy—to decide that they’re not going to release an autopsy of 2024. So the question I want to ask is this: Post–2024 election, we’ve had a lot of discourse about what Democrats should do to win the quote-unquote working class.\n\nIf you were asked this, would you say, I reject the premise of the question—Democrats should win voters of all kinds, and this working-class framing is silly—or is there a Monica Potts plan for Democrats to win? How do we define the working class, and is there a specific set of things they should do?\n\nPotts: I think, yeah, I think I would reject the premise of the question because I think that one of the things that is always under-discussed when looking at results is the role of non-voters.\n\nAnd I think that the turnout in the United States is so low in general—a high-turnout presidential election has 66 percent of eligible voters voting in it or something like that. That’s high, and so that’s abysmal, to think about how much is at stake. How many Americans are not voting who could vote? So I think that you have to think about why aren’t people engaged in general, and why aren’t people... so many people who do vote are just voting just on partisanship.\n\nAnd I’m not a strategist, but I think the idea that Democrats need to go through their policy platform with a scalpel and excise the things that might be bothering working-class voters is really silly because that’s just not how voters make their decisions. I think the thing that Democrats have to decide if they want to win is what to be loud about and how to be loud about it.\n\nAnd so one of the things we know for sure is that their message is just not getting through as well as Republicans’ messages about them. And there’s a host of different reasons for that. But the decline of local news plays a huge role. We don’t live in a world anymore where you can sit down with a local editorial board at a newspaper, and that holds a lot of sway with the voters in that area.\n\nWe don’t live in a world anymore where a nationally televised interview is going to be watched by a lot of people at the same time who are going to use it to make up their minds. And I think that the way to reach voters is changing. And I think that how to be loud about the thing that voters care about over and over again—in a way that makes them believe that you too care about it—is really this: just do politics, go door to door, talk to people, get your message right, repeat your message over and over. I think that this idea that Democrats have tried to become too much of a surgeon and they need to just be a politician.\n\nBacon: I want to probe this a little bit. Okay. So it seems honest to me that Trump in 2016 was very loud about immigration—build the wall, the Muslim ban. And we can say Zohran Mamdani was very loud about affordability—freeze the rent.\n\nI also thought Kamala Harris was pretty loud about Donald Trump as an authoritarian, crazy person who would end democracy. And I would say Hillary Clinton was loud, too. So are you saying don’t be loud about certain issues that don’t work to be loud about? Or what are we saying here?\n\nPotts: Yeah, I think that there’s a few reasons that didn’t work. I looked at polling, and voters believed that Donald Trump would try to do bad things. But they didn’t believe the worst things that he said he was going to do, and they believed that there would be institutional stops on him. They believed Congress would be able to stop him, and they believed the Supreme Court would be able to stop him. And so they just didn’t see it as a real threat.\n\nAnother thing too—one of the things that voters did in states around the country is that some of them voted for Donald Trump while they also voted for a constitutional amendment in their state to protect abortion rights. So they didn’t believe that Donald Trump would go after abortion because he said he wouldn’t, even though he was head of a party that’s had that on their platform for generations.\n\nAnd so I think we have to keep that in mind again: that voters did not think that he could do... they think he just says crazy things and maybe he would try to do it, but the United States itself is a strong enough institution to stop anything really terrible from happening. And I think that’s a lesson to be learned too, because being head of a party that has promised to raise the minimum wage and protect workers’ rights for decades doesn’t get you anywhere unless you as a candidate are also saying that all the time.\n\nBacon: So when you say get—okay, so that’s an interesting point. Because I guess there’s this discourse about the party and the platform, but there’s also a discourse that the groups have too much of a voice and that they’re getting in the way. And it’s probably the case now, the way you framed it.\n\nThe groups are loud. They are the people who were saying defund the police. They were small in number, but they were loud, and they were very clear about what they were saying. Abortion-rights groups are very loud. I guess you’re right—if you’re Kamala Harris and you have a complicated tax credit to do X, and a group says something loud, that cuts through.\n\nOkay, so this is—so what does a party look like when it’s doing that? Is that what it is? How would they sound loud, about what? How would that look? Play that out. They need to sound loud about some things. What does that look like?\n\nPotts: Yeah, I mean I do think that part of what they need to be loud about is changing the economic story of America, because I do... overall, Americans do say they vote based on the economy—like that’s their number one issue almost all the time. And that’s... the economy is a huge word, and we could get into what they mean when they say that, but they do want to feel that they’re doing well in their lives. They want to have savings. They want to be able to relax and afford the things that they need. They want to think that their kids are going to do better than they’re doing. That’s like the fundamental American dream. That’s what they want: that they want a president who helps us do that, or doesn’t stop us from doing that.\n\nAnd I think that Democrats need to work really hard to change the economic story that Ronald Reagan told. And they need to say, “Right now, private wealth is bad. It’s keeping you from affording the things that you want. America right now is actually still one of the wealthiest societies that the earth has ever seen, but it’s really unfair that there’s no starter homes to buy if you’re, like, a family where the one person is a teacher and one person is like a mechanic.” Like, it’s hard to buy a house if you are that family.\n\nAnd I think that those kinds of stories are really important to change about the economy. I think that it would be undermining that idea that, like, private wealth generates wealth for all of us—that the government has no role in ensuring your economic security. I would change that story. Have a campaign speech written.\n\nBacon: As we were talking, I was thinking that maybe fighting oligarchy—I liked that, and I was glad that tour happened. But is Zohran Mamdani’s campaign a more effective form of whatever we’re talking about here? Like economic—I hate the term economic populism; it doesn’t really say anything. But is Mamdani, in a way, talking more about your life and how to make your life more affordable?\n\nThe oligarchy may be making your life unaffordable, but maybe you want to lead with affordability and then talk to people about the oligarchy, rather than leading with the oligarchy.\n\nPotts: Yeah, no, I think fighting the oligarchy is a little too abstract. And sounds uninteresting—sounds like a class assignment or something, all due... But I think that, yeah, I think Mamdani’s campaign was better because it was... it started from the person’s position. And also just Mamdani was a fantastic campaigner. Like, he was out in communities getting to know people, knocking on people’s doors.\n\nHe was listening to the things that they were saying, and he was framing a lot of his... a lot of his messages around the things that people were concerned about. But he also brought people together, created a sense of community around his campaign. He did fun things and reminded people about why they live in New York, even though it’s so expensive. So it wasn’t just all “New York’s a hellscape and you can’t afford anything.” It was like, “Look at this fantastic city. Let’s do a scavenger hunt in it and look at your neighbors and how great they are. And also let’s try to make sure that it stays this great for...” I don’t know how you nationalize it, but I think it’s doable, and I think it... it would be really important to do.\n\nBacon: So your autopsy would start with worldwide inflation. Joe Biden waited too long to run. Kamala had a hundred—or whatever—107 days. I guess she has a book. So I guess I do know this: You’d start with that.\n\nBut then what was—so I guess, on some level, I know there’s a debate. It’s bad the party did not release its autopsy. On the other hand, I do think I know why Kamala Harris lost. Do we need it? What did you make of this whole thing over the last week?\n\nPotts: I would personally be interested in reading the autopsy.\n\nI’m a journalist. But I don’t think it matters. People aren’t going to remember in six months that they didn’t do it.\n\nBacon: No. Forget about voters. Do you think we would’ve learned anything?\n\nPotts: No. I don’t think we would learn anything. I think we know why they lost. I don’t see in retrospect any way that she could have won. She was handed almost an impossible job. Fundamentally, I think that the thing that people keep forgetting—that I think it’s really important not to forget—is that last year was an anti-incumbent year across the board, around the globe, around the world.\n\nBecause there had just been in the four years that Biden was in office just a massive upheaval of the world—a once-in-a-hundred-year pandemic, a crazy economy that followed that, a lot of destruction and death and sadness. The start of the war in Ukraine, just a lot of stuff that really was no individual leader’s fault and a shifting world underneath their feet, and they wanted change. And so I think that was hard to combat across the board. And I think it’s really important not to think too much more. I don’t.\n\nBacon: The country was not—as this tells us—very little about the Democrats. It tells us the country is frustrated with incumbents and frustrated with Trump, not necessarily that Democrats have figured out affordability based on Mikie Sherrill saying these four things.\n\nBut how did you see the last result? I think the Democrats are right that they don’t necessarily need to release an autopsy, because they’ve figured it out. Because Trump being in the White House fixes—or accounts for—88 percent of their problems. Is that how you see it, too?\n\nPotts: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Like, I do think voters still want change. I think people voted for Trump not believing a lot of what he said, or not even really knowing a lot of what he said he was going to do. And now that he’s in, obviously they don’t like it, and for the next four years that is going to continue to be served up on a platter to Democrats. It’s easy to run against that. And so I do think that Democrats have to think about if they do get back in Washington, if they do get back power, they have to think about how to keep it.\n\nAnd I do think that the affordability issue is important because it is true that people feel that they can’t be comfortable financially in their lives—that no matter how hard they work, it gets sucked up into their electricity bills. They end up paying more for their home insurance; every raise that they get goes out the door straight away. And that is incredibly frustrating and disheartening for thinking about what the future holds. And so I think pounding on that is good.\n\nBacon: Last question. You said when I said about should they focus on the working class, you were like, “I reject the premise of that...” So do you think about the world in terms of voting blocs, in terms of states, in terms of racial groups, in terms of like... how do you? Just think voters are the moderates? Ideology? Do you think about the world? Because we’re having a lot of discussion about which, how, who they need to woo. And your... and you said nonvoters is one thing you said. So is that the group you’d press on the most?\n\nPotts: Yeah. They need to make sure that all their voters get out. They need to make sure that—which is going to entail getting them back in the game, because they’re frustrated and upset. They need to make sure that marginal voters get out and vote for them. They really should try to reach out to nonvoters. That’s harder, and that’s why politicians don’t ever do it. But that would probably change the game a bit. But I think also they just need to be loud about the right things.\n\nAnd then swing voters who make their decisions in September of 2026 will just have heard more about them and be more likely to listen to what they’re saying because it takes so much to break through. I think they need to think about that. I think they need to—as far as voting blocs—think about how to reach those groups best. But the message, I think, is the same. Enough thinking.\n\nBacon: Is that something they should be loud about? Or do you mean loud economics, or being loud about a lot of other things, too?\n\nPotts: Yeah. They should be loud about what’s going on with ICE, because it’s terrible, and people truly did not want that.\n\nThey voted for it, but they might not have realized that they were voting for it.\n\nBacon: Great place to end on. Great to see you. Happy holidays. I don’t think I’ll see you before the holidays. Take care.\n\nPotts: Yeah, you too. Happy holidays, everybody. Thank you.\n\nBacon: Thank you.\n\nPotts: Bye-bye. Thanks.","summary":"This is a lightly edited transcript of the December 22 edition of Right Now With Perry Bacon.

Jerry Nadler, who is retiring. The vocal Trump critic is likely to frame his congressional run around his top attorney credentials and willingness to serve as legal pitbull against Trump in Congress.\n\nConway, 62, is a mainstay in left-wing media and frequently rails against Trump on a podcast published by The Bulwark with the title “George Conway Explains It All,” which he co-hosts. He notably wore a shirt bearing the words “I am Antifa” at a “No Kings” rally in October, the Daily Caller News Foundation first reported.\n\nConway was reportedly hunting for a Manhattan apartment in November while mulling a congressional run, which could feed “carpetbagger” attacks.\n\nThe race for the central Manhattan district — including Central Park, Times Square and the Rockefeller Center — has attracted roughly a dozen candidates in the Democratic primary. The primary election date is set for June 2026.\n\nSocial media influencer Jack Schlossberg, the 32 year-old grandson of President John F. Kennedy, is also notably running for the seat.

Congress later codified that executive order as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill. The biased coverage of the networks has been obvious for years, and NPR's handling of the terror attack that killed two Israeli embassy staffers, as well as the assassination of Charlie Kirk, should have erased all doubts.\n\nBut here's more proof that defunding NPR was the right move. The network has announced it will no longer use quotes from Professor Carl Tobias.\n\nFrom the @semafor media newsletter: NPR says no more quotes from someone named Professor Carl Tobias pic.twitter.com/o0brCsLgrf— Max Tani (@maxwelltani) December 22, 2025\n\nIn the memo to NPR staff, standards chief Tony Calvin wrote, \"If Tobias' name sounds familiar, it's because Professor Tobias's hobby seems to be getting himself quoted about anything and everything in news stories. Professor Tobias often emails reporters offering his expert opinion on stories of the day and while I don't presume to judge his expertise in legal matters, the professor is certainly an expert at getting himself quoted.\"\n\nCalvin notes that Tobias appeared 77 times on NPRs website, and that \"in many of these quotes he's described as an 'expert' in whatever the story happens to be about.\"\n\n\"I propose that, as a collective New Year's resolution, we give the professor some (well-deserved) time off,\" Calvin added.\n\nAt first, this writer wondered if Tobias was even a real person, but it turns out he is. He's the Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond. According to his bio on the University website, Tobias \"writes in a number of areas, a particular emphasis on federal judicial selection,\" and has authored more than 120 law review articles.\n\nSo what kinds of stories was Tobias quoted in? \n\nOn December 17, Tobias was quoted in an NPR story about President Trump's lawsuit against the BBC. \n\n\"The facts benefit Trump and defendants may be concerned about reputational harm,\" says Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond who specializes in free speech issues. \"The BBC also has admitted it could have done better and essentially apologized.\"\n\nIn May, he was quoted in another interview about foreign students at Harvard, and after a federal investigation found that Harvard violated civil rights law, Tobias was quoted again on July 1 saying, \"It seems that HHS is attempting to ramp up pressure ahead of a possible settlement with Harvard,\" he told the network.\n\nThe very next day, Tobias was quoted in an article about the $16 million Paramount settlement with President Trump, stemming from the deceptively edited 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. \"Am I supposed to take that seriously?\" Tobias asked. \"I do not understand how suits that are arguably frivolous or meritless — that have very little substance and wouldn't amount to large judgment if you went to trial — are then settled for millions of dollars.\"\n\nIn 2021, Tobias was interviewed about the $2.5 billion Boeing settlement over 737 Max crashes. \n\nIn 2019, NPR said Tobias was \"an expert on opioid litigation\" in a story about Oklahoma winning a suit against Johnson & Johnson. \"These states and localities could take heart that they may well be able to impose liability,\" Tobias said.\n\nTobias was also interviewed by NPR about gay marriage in 2014, and in 2007, he was interviewed about a pet food lawsuit.\n\nIn the full email, there are even more examples of Tobias being listed as an expert and interviewed about various topics.\n\nThe full email, which is pretty amusing pic.twitter.com/34mMCCD0Gw— Max Tani (@maxwelltani) December 22, 2025\n\nThis includes interviews with The New York Times on a story about a sheriff accused of corruption, a story about DHS Secretary Kristi Noem reducing the number of international students at Harvard (NYT described Tobias as \"an expert on the federal courts\" in that article), and a story about YouTube settling a lawsuit with President Trump over the suspension of his account.\n\nTobias was also featured in The Washington Post on stories about Maryland judges pushing back against the Trump administration, as well as writing a number of op-eds for WaPo on the Virginia Supreme Court and the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Politico, Tobias was described as a \"frequent commentator on judicial confirmation fights.\" He's also been on NBC, ABC, and CBS, while also being quoted by the AP and Reuters. NPR member stations, including Houston Public Media, called Tobias \"an expert on judicial selection.\"\n\nThat's quite the wide range of expertise, no?\n\nWe're glad NPR finally committed a flagrant act of journalism by demanding reporters stop going to Tobias for quotes and interviews.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

USA TODAY has not been able to reach Alfonsi.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to CBS and Global TV Network about the piece airing in Canada.\n\nMore: Inside CECOT, El Salvador's notorious prison, where inmates never see the light of day\n\nWhy did '60 Minutes' pull segment on CECOT prison?\n\nThe shelved segment, called \"Inside CECOT,\" was set to feature interviews with Venezuelan migrants who had been deported to the CECOT prison by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the original programming note.\n\nThe log line said Alfonsi spoke to some of the now released deportees, who described \"the brutal and torturous conditions they endured inside CECOT,\" adding that the facility is \"one of El Salvador’s harshest prisons.\"\n\n\"60 Minutes,\" instead, aired a segment on a family of classical musicians, the programming update said. Viewers have since flooded the show's social media comments to call on the network to release the original clip.\n\nParamount, which owns CBS, has faced a year of shakeups. The company in October acquired the independent media company The Free Press and named its CEO, Bari Weiss, CBS News' editor-in-chief.\n\nWhat is CECOT prison?\n\nCECOT, which is officially called the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, is a prison in El Salvador that houses some migrants deported from the U.S. by the Trump administration as part of a deal between the countries.\n\nThe deal has been criticized by some because of the facility's reputation for brutal conditions.\n\nA Human Rights Watch report released in November details 40 Venezuelan prisoners' experiences at CECOT, where they alleged they faced constant abuse at the hands of guards. While the U.S. and El Salvador governments have accused these prisoners of being terrorists, the report also found many of them had not been convicted of any crimes.\n\nThe prison also made headlines earlier in 2025 when Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident and Salvadoran native who was granted legal protection to stay in the United States, was deported to the prison by the Trump administration on March 15.\n\nAbrego Garcia was released from prison Dec. 11 after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland said the Trump administration had no legal basis to expel him from the country. The Justice Department is contesting the ruling.\n\n'60 Minutes,' Paramount and Trump\n\nIn addition to Weiss taking the helm at CBS News, Paramount also underwent leadership changes this year.\n\nDavid Ellison, the son of Trump ally and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, took over as Paramount CEO in August after the company merged with Skydance.\n\nIn July — before David Ellison took over — Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" segment that aired last year. He claimed it was edited in favor of former Vice President Kamala Harris during the election cycle.\n\nBut despite Ellison's ties to Trump, the company hasn't been immune to the president's criticism.\n\nIn December, the president lashed out at CBS News over an interview with Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!\" Trump wrote Dec. 8 on Truth Social. \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well, far worse things can happen.\"\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount is also mounting a hostile takeover of Warner Bros. after losing a bidding war for the company to Netflix. Trump has repeatedly taken aim at CNN, which is owned by Warner Bros., saying \"it's imperative\" that the news network be sold.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

A massive new batch of files linked to the case has been released, and among the materials, there are suggestions that Trump may have flown on Epstein's private jet far more often than previously reported, including a trip with a 20-year-old woman. Let's find out more. According to , a US prosecutor indicated in one of the recently released (and quickly withdrawn) Department of Justice files on Jeffrey Epstein that President Donald Trump had used Epstein's private jet far more often than earlier known. The report further revealed that the internal January 2020 email from an unnamed assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York stated that flight records obtained the day before showed Trump travelled on Epstein's plane many more times than officials had been aware of, including during the timeframe relevant to potential charges in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. According to the, an internal email from a New York assistant US attorney revealed that Donald Trump was recorded as a passenger on eight flights abroad on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet between 1993 and 1996, including at least four trips with Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\"For your situational awareness, I wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump travelled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware), including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case,\" says the email. \"On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump and then-20-year-old [redacted].\" As soon as the information surfaced on social media, it quickly garnered the attention of netizens. One Reddit user wrote, \"People that voted for this POS with this information already practically known by most mentally competent people and had issues with Kamala Harris, they can get completely fucked. This is pretty much white privilege on display as a badge of shame for this country.\"\"What's really shocking is the redaction in the body of the message – the first one I've seen that clearly complies with EFTA,\" another added.

Sen. Janae Shamp's proposed bill would require the Arizona Department of Health Services to conduct or support research into the topic with help from other state agencies.\n\nResearchers would be tasked with identifying the \"initial emergence or earliest documented cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" and highlighting what the lawmaker believes are contributing factors. The bill cites several examples, such as media exposure and political polarization.\n\nThe bill also tasks officials to come up with ways to \"mitigate or prevent Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\nIf passed, the director of the Department of Health Services would have a year to supply a report to the governor, the Senate president and the speaker of the House of Representatives on the agency's progress.\n\nTo become law, the bill would have to pass several votes in the Arizona Senate and House of Representatives and be signed by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs. The upcoming legislative session begins Jan. 12. So far, Shamp has introduced bills ranging from a ban on fluoride in Arizona’s water system to expanding religious exemptions in the workplace.\n\nAccording to the online polling group Civiqs, Trump's approval rating has fallen consistently over the last several months. In Arizona, his approval rating sank to 42% based on the pollster's December analysis.\n\nHow would the bill define Trump Derangement Syndrome?\n\nThe term Trump Derangement Syndrome became popularized in Trump's second term to broadly refer to criticism of the president's actions and policies. The president used the term to refer to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and their supporters multiple times during his campaign.\n\nSenate Bill 1070 defines Trump Derangement Syndrome as a \"behavioral or psychological phenomenon that is characterized by intense emotional or psychological reactions to Donald J. Trump, his actions or his public presence as observed in individuals or groups.\"\n\nTrump recently used the phrase to refer to the late director Rob Reiner, who was a force against several conservative ideals. Trump suggested on Truth Social that Reiner and his wife were killed in their home as a result of their political beliefs, a statement that garnered criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio proposed a similar bill that would have required the National Institutes of Health to investigate Trump Derangement Syndrome. The bill did not make progress through the legislative process and is unlikely to pass.\n\nThis isn’t the first time “derangement syndrome” has been referenced in the political sphere. Psychiatrist and conservative writer Charles Krauthammer coined the term Bush Derangement Syndrome, referring to conspiracy theorists who believe former President George W. Bush was involved in the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks. \n\nSince then, the term \"Obama Derangement Syndrome\" was also used briefly to refer to conspiracy theories questioning President Barack Obama's citizenship.\n\nHelen Rummel is a reporter covering politics and higher education for The Arizona Republic.

But not only did he lose his crown, he's also losing his show. Stephen Colbert has been the face of \"The Late Show\" ever since his predecessor, David Letterman, stepped down in 2015. Colbert transformed CBS' long-running late-night show into #Resistance television, dedicating monologue after monologue to attacking President Donald Trump, elevating Democrats and boosting their agenda. However, it was no laughing matter for liberals when CBS announced in July that it had canceled \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and that it will officially be off the air in May 2026. Colbert's far-left fans were undoubtedly upset that their beloved Trump foe was being pulled off the air, accusing Paramount of bending the knee to an authoritarian. Trump rubbed it in by celebrating the move, writing on Truth Social, \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.\" STEPHEN COLBERT HAD LEFT-WING JOURNALISTS, HOSTS ON ‘THE LATE SHOW’ MORE THAN 200 TIMES It was the timing, however, that turned the cancellation into a controversy. Colbert had recently criticized parent company Paramount Global for settling Trump's lawsuit against the company over CBS' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the run-up to the 2024 election. The ordeal came as a long-planned merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, which needed approval from Trump’s FCC chair, was in its final stages. On a summer Thursday, CBS announced it would cancel \"The Late Show,\" insisting it was a \"financial decision\" and had nothing to do with the looming ownership change. \"'THE LATE SHOW with STEPHEN COLBERT' will end its historic run in May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season,\" CBS said in a statement. \"We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire 'THE LATE SHOW' franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.\" CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" adding, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\" CBS HOST POURS COLD WATER ON LIBERAL OUTRAGE TO COLBERT CANCELLATION, SAYS LATE-NIGHT INDUSTRY IS 'BROKEN' Later that month, the FCC approved the merger, paving the way for the deal to become official. Many critics, including top Democrats, accused the network of political motivation ahead of the Skydance merger. However, Colbert's show was reportedly losing CBS $40 million a year and had been running on a whopping $100 million budget per season. The decision to cancel \"The Late Show\" sparked an industry-wide panic over the future of late-night television, given Colbert was generally the winner in his 11:30 p.m. ET time slot, although he trailed Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, whose show airs at 10 p.m. ET. A column by The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle insisted that Colbert’s show was losing viewers and money due to people moving away from traditional TV — stating that’s the \"primary\" reason for the cancellation. JON STEWART BLASTS CBS FOR CANCELING COLBERT'S SHOW, CALLS IT ‘PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE’ FOR CORPORATE MERGER \"That, and not Colbert’s politics, is the primary thing you should be thinking about when you ask why the show was canceled. The great unbundling of the old networks and cable packages meant that late-night shows were no longer a hot media property but an economic liability,\" McArdle wrote. During his time as a lame duck late-night host, Colbert has continued to attack Trump on a regular basis. \"And now for the next 10 months, the gloves are off,\" Colbert said in July. After Trump taunted him over the cancellation, Colbert quipped casually, \"Go f--- yourself\" on the show. Colbert's show has been far more likely than his counterparts to have Democratic political guests and liberal media figures as top guests. While he landed superstar singer Taylor Swift last week, earlier this month he brought on MS NOW hosts Jen Psaki and Rachel Maddow as his lead guests in the same week.

This contrasts with establishment Democrats, who argue that a counter-platform targeting Republicans over the economy is the path forward to power. \n\nThe entrance of Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) into the Senate primary battle in Texas against Democratic state Rep. James Talarico has already led to frustration among Democrats that they will lose a seat they must flip if they are to have any chance of winning back control of the upper chamber.\n\nDemocrats have also bemoaned that Democratic Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn’s progressive ideology, which included support for defunding the police, may have cost the party the seat against Rep. Matt Van Epps (R-TN) for the state’s 7th Congressional District.\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate for Maine Graham Platner’s primary battle against term-limited Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME), who is backed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has been hit by controversy after the revelation of past racist, sexist, and homophobic comments, as well as a tattoo closely resembling a Nazi symbol. \n\nAnger over which Democratic candidates are supported by the party’s campaign arms, both formally and informally, has spilled out into the public.\n\nDEMOCRATS HEAD INTO 2026 WITH WIND IN THEIR SAILS AS REPUBLICANS CAN’T GET OUT THEIR OWN WAY\n\n“I think that the Democratic Party has done a poor job recently of deciding which candidates can win and which can’t,” Randy Jones, a Democratic strategist, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nJones argued that the “biggest mistake” Democrats can make right now is “trying to put our thumb on the scale” in the primaries, particularly when the party is suffering from a popularity problem. “This is not the time for us to play politics in primaries,” he added. “This is the time for us to get our base excited again about participating in the process. And I think we should stay out of the way.” \n\nDemocrats are reportedly furious over the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s lack of effort to prevent Crockett from entering the race, following former Democratic Texas Rep. Colin Allred’s withdrawal. Meanwhile, they are annoyed that they have meddled too much in the Iowa Senate primary, supporting Democratic state Rep. Josh Turek over Democratic state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, the executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce. \n\nHow big is the Democratic tent?\n\nOther Democrats have counseled that each race requires a candidate tailored to the demographics of voters who will decide the election. Socialist New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was better suited to win in the deep-blue city compared to the more moderate Govs.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) in their respective states.\n\n“I don’t think there’s like a one-size-fits-all for the country as we head into midterm,” said Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nFrustrated with establishment Democrats, more progressive candidates are challenging incumbents in primary elections. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Mamdani supporter, is challenging Rep. Dan Goldman’s (D-NY) reelection bid. Notably, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a “squad” member who supported Mamdani’s race, declined to say who she is supporting.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), the second-in-command House Democrat, is being primaried by organizer and former Waltham City Councilman Jonathan Paz, who said Democratic leaders are “failing” the party. Democrat Nida Allam, a progressive, is challenging Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-NC), with support from former Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman David Hogg’s Leaders We Deserve.\n\nHowever, Shroff also cautioned that Democrats need to do more research into the candidates running for office to avoid embarrassing new stories, such as Platner and Behn’s past controversial statements, as well as Virginia Attorney General-elect Jay Jones’s past violent text messages in which he suggested former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican, should receive two bullets in the head.\n\n“Some of these ‘outsider,’ atypical candidates that are exciting people and are resonating with people simply are not vetted to the extent that other more moderate or mainstream candidates within the party who either have held some local office before or gone through some sort of vetting process are,” Shroff said. “And I think that comes with, of course, risk, because you never know what’s going to come up then.” \n\nDemocrats are also facing questions about whether digital-savvy lawmakers, who can go viral on social media and raise vast amounts of money, are best positioned to flip GOP-controlled seats. \n\nAfter entering the Texas Senate primary, Crockett has faced criticism over past comments. For example, she has said Latino voters who vote for Trump have a “slave mentality.” However, even before her Senate campaign launch, she had raised more than $6.5 million in 2025. \n\nDallas Jones, a Democratic strategist based in Houston, warned that far-leaning Democrats may not perform as well in southern states. \n\n“While we’re the big tent party, there are different compartments in that tent, and they’re all different,” Jones said. “Progressivism, as we see it, below the Mason-Dixon line, which is where a lot of my work exists and has existed, it doesn’t necessarily sell.” \n\nBehn’s loss during the red-leaning Tennessee special election by just 8.6%, after Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024, was a “huge victory,” according to Jones. However, a moderate candidate could have been tighter, or Democrats may have prevailed, he added. \n\nThe centrist group Third Way has pushed Democrats to move away from radical ideology in an effort to win red-leaning districts next year. \n\n“There’s been a lot of conversation since that race, and, frankly, a lot of frustration, because there were absolutely folks touting the race in Tennessee as this is what happens when voters get a candidate running unapologetically on bold progressive economics,” Kate deGruyter, senior director of communications of Third Way.\n\n“And it turned out that those politically toxic positions are like anvils, and that is the reason why we have yet to see far-left endorsed candidates flip a single red seat in the entirety of the Trump era,” she continued. \n\nGOP ad makers have used some of the more controversial positions of the far-left to attack the national Democratic brand to “devastating effect,” deGruyter said.\n\nDEMOCRATS NEED TO TEMPER THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF A 2026 BLUE WAVE, DATA SHOW\n\nLiam Kerr, co-founder of the centrist group WelcomePac, said it’s incumbent upon the centrist movement to stage insurgent battles to wrest the Democratic Party from the power of the left-leaning faction. That may include conservative Democrats similar in style to former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\n“Progressives have built an effective outrage, marketplace, and business model, and centrists need to step it up,” Kerr said. “No one’s going to solve the centrist problem on a whiteboard or in a pitch meeting; it’s all by rolling up your sleeves and going out and trying something new and rallying people to your cause, and sometimes, yes, losing but then picking yourself back up again.”","summary":"Democrats are facing intraparty primary battles over which direction the party should take to regain power from the GOP-controlled House and Senate next year.

Beef explained as DJ Akademiks calls rapper \"self-serving\" ","text":"Media personality DJ Akademiks recently reacted to rapper Nicki Minaj's current feud with California Governor Gavin Newsom, calling the rapper's motives self-serving. For those uninformed, Minaj publicly criticized the politician when she made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA's America Fest on December 21, 2025. The Super Bass rapper joined Erika Kirk, TPUSA's CEO, for a Q&A panel where she lauded JD Vance and Donald Trump while sharply criticizing Newsom. According to Newsweek, the panel kicked off with Kirk asking Minaj to read out her past X posts about Newsom, including one where she called out the politician for his recent comments of support for transgender children.Kirk then asked Minaj what she wanted to say to Gavin Newsom at the time, with the rapper replying:\"Dear Newscum: we don't have a problem cleaning up the scum if we have to. Please try live. That's what I would say to Gabby Poo.\"Elsewhere in the panel, she urged young men to look up to JD Vance and Donald Trump as role models, as opposed to Newsom.Erika Kirk and Nicki Minaj at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest Youth Conference (Image via Getty)Following this, DJ Akademiks shared his thoughts about Minaj's recent appearance at AmFest 2025 and speculated on the reason for her recent vocal support for Trump's administration. The streamer claimed that Nicki Minaj's motives were more self-serving than supporting, pointing out that the rapper was not as vocal about politics during the 2024 presidential election. He also noted that Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B, two of Minaj's known rivals, vocally endorsed Kamala Harris during the election against Donald Trump in 2024.\"So, Nicki and Gavin Newsom, they are in full beef, y'all...Now, if I was her, I'd just move out of California. But I guess she likes it there...Kamala had Meg Thee Stallion and Cardi B, which are the biggest opps of Nicki Minaj, right?... I think Cardi B supported her, right?\" Akademiks said.He continued:\"Nicki didn't really show up, in my opinion...she didn't really say anything during the political season, but now...maybe she does feel this way, but it's definitely self-serving, not saying that it's bad that it's self-serving.\"Nicki Minaj's criticisms against Gavin Newsom came after the governor supported transgender childrenDuring his appearance on The Ezra Klein Show, which aired on December 10, California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed support for transgender kids, saying that he had a trans godson and claiming that he \"signed more pro-trans legislation\" than other governors. On December 12, 2025, Nicki Minaj took to X to unleash a series of tweets targeting Newsom, including one that seemingly mocked his support for transgender children.\"Imagine being the guy running on wanting this trans kids haha. Not even a trans adult would run on that. Normal adults wake up and think they want to see healthy, safe, happy and not Gav. The Gav-nots. Gav - not in, Gav out. Send in the next guy. I'm bored,\" Minaj wrote.In another post, Nicki Minaj described Newsom as \"the cute boy who got everything handed to him b/c of how cute & sexy & hot & smoking he was,\" suggesting that the potential presidential candidate would not be successful if he ran for the 2028 election.Nicki Minaj @NICKIMINAJLINKGavin is the cute boy who got everything handed to him b/c of how cute & sexy & hot & smoking he was. Oohhh look @‘m. Sitting there in that suit with the sneakers on. He thinks he’s Tom Cruise only difference is, his next mission IS impossible. He should get another leading roleAccording to Variety, Governor Gavin Newsom did not directly respond to any of Minaj's taunts online. However, on December 13, he shared a video featuring Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein set to Megan Thee Stallion's Hiss on X on December 13, 2025, seemingly as a response to Nicki Minaj's constant attacks against him on social media.For those uninformed, Hiss is widely believed to be a diss track about Minaj due to a lyric about Megan's law, a federal law that requires states to provide the public with information about registered s*x offenders. Minaj is married to Kenneth Petty, who is a level two registered s*x offender in New York, as reported by People Magazine.In his recent Rumble livestream, DJ Akademiks alleged that the leaders of the Democratic Party were using Minaj's husband as a reason to attack her. He further postulated that Minaj was upset at people using Megan Thee Stallion's Hiss to target her online, saying:\"They are definitely taking their shots at Nicki. I kinda feel like Nicki is more self-serving than she is really supporting...They are weaponizing the fact that Nicki Minaj had married this guy, who is a s*x offender. And they keep trying to get at her, and Nicki seems to be really upset that they keep using Megan Thee Stallion's song, and also the law is called Megan's law that kinda showcases the s*xual offenders.\"Meanwhile, Nicki Minaj showered praises on Donald Trump and JD Vance when she appeared on Turning Point USA's America Fest 2025 with Erika Kirk. Calling Trump a \"handsome, dashing president,\" Mianj said that both Trump and Vance \"have a very uncanny ability to be someone that you can relate to\" and were \"still connected to the world and what's happening in the world.\"","summary":"Media personality DJ Akademiks recently reacted to rapper Nicki Minaj's current feud with California Governor Gavin Newsom, calling the rapper's motives self-serving.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/news-what-nicki-minaj-say-gavin-newsom-amfest-2025-beef-explained-dj-akademiks-calls-rapper-self-serving","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/12/89e36-17664778447643-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 11:51:45","author":"Juhi Marzia","authors":["Juhi Marzia"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":388371570,"title":"President Trump calls the New York Times a 'serious threat to the National Security of our Nation' and says the outlet 'must be dealt with and stopped'","text":"Donald Trump has branded The New York Times a 'serious threat' to the security of the United States, claiming they must be 'stopped'.\n\nTaking to his platform Truth Social on Tuesday, the US President wrote: 'The Failing New York Times, and their lies and purposeful misrepresentations, is a serious threat to the National Security of our Nation. \n\n'Their Radical Left, Unhinged Behavior, writing FAKE Articles and Opinions in a never ending way, must be dealt with and stopped.

The judge said the filing was too long and too petty.\n\nJudge Merryday blasted the president for waiting until the 80th page of his lawsuit to formally accuse the paper of defamation.\n\nHe also suggested Trump had used the filing as a soapbox to air grievances against the paper of record, arguing: 'A complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective - not a protected platform to rage against an adversary.'\n\nThe jurist added: 'A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally or the functional equivalent of the Hyde Park Speakers’ Corner.'\n\nHe also told Trump that, despite being president, plaintiffs are supposed to 'fairly, precisely, directly, soberly, and economically' tell defendants in complaints why they are being sued.\n\nA spokesperson for The New York Times told the Daily Mail that they welcomed the ruling, which recognised the complaint as a 'political document rather than a serious legal filing.'\n\nTrump has repeatedly used the courts against media companies since his second presidential election win last year.\n\nHe has sued The Wall Street Journal for publishing a seedy birthday drawing the paper accused him of sending to late pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, and also secured $16 million settlements from CBS and ABC after suing both stations.\n\nThe CBS settlement was paid out after the president accused the network's flagship newsmagazine 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with his 2024 rival Kamala Harris.\n\nABC was forced to hand over the eight-figure sum after Good Morning America host George Stephanopoulos incorrectly stated the president had been found civilly-liable for the rape of E.

It could be one of the oddest election cycles in California’s 175 years as a state, albeit one that puts the state’s convoluted politics in the national spotlight.\n\nThere are so many Democrats running for governor that it’s theoretically possible for a Republican to win the office, despite the state’s deeply blue political profile, especially with the possibility of even more Democratic hopefuls jumping into the mob — as a herd of kangaroos is dubbed in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, both incumbent members of Congress and aspirants will be running in districts that have been radically gerrymandered to shrink Republicans’ tiny delegation even more, as Democrats seek to regain control of Congress.\n\nThe possibility of a Republican governor, although very scant, stems from the state’s top-two primary election system. All candidates, regardless of party, will appear on the same June 2 primary election ballot, and the two with the highest percentages of the vote — no matter how small those shares may be — will face each other in the November election.\n\nWith upwards of a dozen Democrats now running and the possibility of others, it’s possible the two Republicans in the mix so far — Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television commentator Steve Hilton — could theoretically finish one and two with perhaps as few as 10-15% of the votes each.\n\nIt’s not likely if the Democratic cohort shrinks in the next few months as the weakest contenders drop out, lacking enough money or poll support to continue. However, the lack of a natural Democratic frontrunner and the seeming lack of party leadership strong enough to cull the herd bolster the mathematical possibility of a GOP upset.\n\nHad former Vice President Kamala Harris or U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to run, either would have been the immediate frontrunner. But by opting out, they left a vacuum.\n\nAt the moment, former Congresswoman Katie Porter is leading the Democratic pack, albeit with scarcely double-digit support in the polls. She and former Controller Betty Yee are the only two women now running with Harris. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Sen. Toni Atkins out . Porter also gained recognition during her unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat last year.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer is currently the most visible contender, spending some of his immense wealth on television and internet ads to depict himself as a populist who rails against “Sacramento politicians” and promises to reduce electric bills — not unlike how Donald Trump achieved success.\n\nBeyond Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra appear to be the strongest Democratic strivers. However, everyone is still waiting to see whether Attorney General Rob Bonta or Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso will opt in.\n\nHaving so much uncertainty this late in the game is very unusual. However, at some point, perhaps around February or March, when the Democratic field finally begins to shrink, it will be possible to sort out the truly viable candidates from the wannabes and do some realistic handicapping.\n\nUntil then, as Willie Brown, the former state Assembly speaker and San Francisco Mayor and one of the state’s most astute politicians, put it to Politico:\n\n“The field is not considered of a quality that you as a Democrat would expect in California. We’re still pretty much carried away with stardom, with individuals who have some impact … We don’t have any candidates like that at the moment.”\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"The lack of a natural Democratic frontrunner and lack of party leadership to cull the herd bolster the possibility of GOP upset.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/23/walters-states-odd-election-year-starts-with-republicans-possibly-leading-governors-race/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/RPE-L-HARO-0828-09-WL.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 11:45:52","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":388407042,"title":"Who We Lost in 2025: Actors to astronauts, remembering those departed in this last year","text":"It never gets easy, our yearly look back at the many people — and some places, trends and other things — that departed in the past 12 months. But in so doing, we — meaning some of the Tribune’s critics, writers and contributors — are reminded of what a rich and rewarding spot we live. Though many of the people you will read about have had a global impact, most have plied their magic here, a nurturing place. We have been fortunate enough to share their talents, and if there is a minor joy to the making of these yearly lists, it is in knowing that you may never have heard of these people or tasted their creations. And doing so will surely make 2026 a bright new year.\n\nFrom Tribune columnist Rick Kogan\n\nIt is a long way from Lake Forest to the moon — 240,000 miles, give or take — and James Lovell made that trip twice, never setting foot on the moon but seeing things that few people have ever seen and living a life of estimable grace. He died in August in that leafy northern suburb where he had lived for many of his 97 years, running with his son Jay a terrific restaurant named Lovell’s.\n\nIt served good food and was filled with some of the memorabilia he had accumulated during his long, high-flying and honor-filled career. There was a moon rock and a framed “Apollo 13” movie poster signed by actor Tom Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film. Many of his obituaries understandably focused on Hanks, who posted his thoughts online, saying in part, “There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to places we would not go on our own. Jim Lovell, who for a long while has gone further into space and for longer than any other person on our planet, was that kind of guy. His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuel the course of being alive.”\n\nLovell wore the tag “hero” lightly. He was self-effacing, gentlemanly and energetically friendly. As an astronaut, he was a member of a very exclusive club. There have been 600-some people who have flown into space. By comparison, there have been more than 900 Nobel Prize winners and more than 3,500 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients.\n\nTo know him was to like and admire him. Local author Robert Kurson wrote about him in 2018’s “Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man’s First Journey to the Moon” that vividly captured that 1968 flight and its crew, Lovell and fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Bill Anders, the first humans ever to leave Earth for another destination and how this mission helped save the country’s space program.\n\nThe three of them are gone now, Borman dying in 2023, Anders in 2024 and Lovell in June. But they come to vivid life in the book. Kurson tells another wonderful story: “In all the time I knew Jim, he expressed just a single regret — that he’d been forced to give up flying at age 85.”\n\nGeorge Wendt was a child of Beverly, that tightly-knit, leafy neighborhood on the South Side. He was also a product of Old Town, that equally lovely but more frenetic neighborhood where he lived for a time and enlivened the stage of the Second City.\n\nWendt died of cardiac arrest on May 20 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1980 with his wife, Bernadette Birkett, whom he had met at the Second City. He was 76 years old.\n\nHe had grown up in a home near the corner of 92nd Place and Bell Avenue, where a street sign now features his name. The neighborhood is filled with fans and friends and many remember Wendt’s mom, Loretta Wendt, who died in 2010. That’s when George told me, “She was of her time, a housewife and mom, but I have always thought that had she been born in another era, she could have been as successful as Elaine May or Tina Fey.”\n\nSome famous folks showed up at a second City memorial service in October. Thoughtfully organized and hosted by two of Wendt’s oldest friends and collaborators, Tim Kazurinsky and Peter Burns, the event included film clips of Wendt’s decades-old work at the Second City, some riotously funny, some zany. These peppered a parade of speakers who offered anecdotes most pleasingly upbeat, and among them were Jim Belushi, Joel Murray, Mark Nutter, Tom Tulley, Bruce Jarchow and Nancy McCabe-Kelly, and all the way from Ireland, Vinnie O’Shea.\n\nWendt’s fame as Norm on “Cheers” — and the many Emmy nominations that came with it — understandably overshadowed his other work in TV, film and theater, of which there was plenty. He was also made larger than life through his turn on the popular Saturday Night Live bit about “Da Bears.”\n\nThe Second City memorial lasted a little less than two hours and it ended with a singalong (“Where Everybody Knows Your Name,” natch) and people walking out into the Old Town night knowing a little bit more about their old friend, colleague and relative, appreciating him more than ever, missing him too.\n\nWhen George Freeman was about to turn 92 years old in 2019, the Tribune’s former jazz critic Howard Reich sat with him and heard him say, “I’ve played with Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz, my brother Von, Johnny Griffin, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins. And, of course, I played with Charlie Parker. It’s just amazing.”\n\nYes, it was, and Reich was among those with whom Freeman shared his “extraordinary wealth of information … his experiences, insights and anecdotes.” George was also a world-class conversationalist and storyteller.\n\nI thought of Reich when Freeman died on April 1 and I recalled with pleasure the times that I was lucky enough to hear Freeman talk and play. I was also reminded what a glorious family he had, being the elder brother of Chicago tenor saxophone giant Von Freeman (who died in 2012) and their brother, drummer Eldridge “Bruz” Freeman (who died in 2006), and Von’s son, tenor saxophonist Chico Freeman.\n\nI was also drawn to the many stories Reich had written about this remarkable family and to George’s many late-career albums brought forth as the result of his relationship with Joanie Pallatto and Bradley Parker-Sparrow and their Chicago-based Southport Records. Just listen to any (or all) of these: “Rebellion,” “George Burns!” “George The Bomb!” and “Everybody Say Yeah!”\n\nYou may have noticed that the above story is punctuated with more than one “!” Few lives deserve them more.\n\nTony Fitzpatrick was a boundlessly creative man in many realms — visual arts, theater, film, radio, literature and random conversations — who died in October while awaiting a double lung transplant. He was only 66 and his family was with him, wife Michele and their kids, daughter Gaby (Gabrielle) and son Max, who said, “He put up an honorable fight, never gave up. He can now rest with Studs Terkel, Mike Royko, Nelson Algren, and Lin Brehmer as one of the greatest Chicago storytellers there ever was. He did everything and he did it his way.”\n\nYes, he did.\n\nA relatively aimless and hard-drinking young man born and raised in the western suburbs, a child of a loving family, he was a little angry and a bit crazy, searching for ways to express himself. He would find it first in art and then, after stopping drinking and finding Michele, dive into life with stunning energy.\n\nThere came an astonishing stream of paintings, poems, performances, etchings, radio and film work, prolific and successful and internationally acclaimed enough to make other artists envious.\n\nHis voice was common on radio stations, especially WLUP. He could be found at poetry slams and eventually on stages and screens, in such films as “Primal Fear,” “Mad Dog and Glory” and “Philadelphia,” and most recently as a security guard in the “Patriot” TV series.\n\nHe remained busy in his final weeks. A steady stream of pals, journalists and admirers visited his hospital room. One of them, the actor Richard Kind, the day after seeing Fitzpatrick in the hospital, was at Wrigley Field and dedicated (“Tony Fitzpatrick, this is for you”) his rendition of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.”\n\nFrom the hospital, he “hosted,” via Zoom, the opening of his new art exhibition, “Songbirds and Crucifixions,” at Great Lakes Tattoo. He gave interviews about his new book, titled “The Sun at the End of the Road,” filled with Fitzpatrick’s distinctive art, poetry and prose, and as he put it, “some of what I remember, some of what I have learned and damn near all of what I love — birds, stories, people and dogs.” Mostly people.\n\nFrom Tribune writer Nina Metz\n\nOne of the biggest movie stars of the 1970s, who could tackle everything from wry comedy to paranoid thrillers, Robert Redford’s appeal on screen was rooted in his elusiveness, thawing perhaps most effectively when playing opposite Paul Newman in 1969’s “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and in 1974’s “The Sting.” The driving force behind the Sundance Film Festival, he was integral in helping boost the work of indie filmmakers. Perhaps it’s poetic that a man so essential to the movies died as the film industry is experiencing its own kind of death.\n\nHBO’s streaming platform began as HBO Max, was changed to simply Max for reasons that defy good sense, and then changed back again to HBO Max earlier this year as part of the death of coherent media company branding. Who wants to bet a bunch of consultants made bank somewhere in this process? Joining the pack is Apple, which launched its streaming platform as Apple TV+ and then recently announced, with no fanfare, that the app would simply be known as Apple TV going forward. Sure. Whatever. At least cable channel MSNBC had a reason to rebrand as MS NOW; that’s because parent company (and NBC owner) Comcast is spinning off its cable channels that were formerly under the NBCUniversal umbrella into a new company and needed to create a distinction between (the old) MSNBC and NBC News. So “NBC” needed to be stripped of its identity. No doubt, there will be more rebrands in the year to come. Like that old saw about the weather, if you don’t like it, just wait a few minutes.\n\nSure, Disney only temporarily capitulated to the current presidential administration by suspending late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year. But that there was any suspension at all, thanks to pressure from the FCC, does not speak well for how media companies view their independence at the moment, or for the spines of their CEOs. Just look at Paramount Global, which pulled the plug on its late night talk show host, Stephen Colbert (whose CBS show will end this spring) and agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, leading many to speculate that both were done to ensure federal approval of Skydance’s recent acquisition of the company.\n\nFrom Tribune writer Christopher Borrelli\n\nWhen Michael Sumler died last spring in a car crash outside Atlanta, you could feel his obituaries straining to explain exactly what Sumler did as a member of Kool & The Gang. For Rolling Stone, he “worked alongside” the ‘70s funk legends. In Billboard, he was their “Beloved Hype Man.” Mitch Dudek, writing in the Sun-Times, was the most gracious: “Chicago Mike” kept “tabs on the group’s wardrobe” but also “hyped up crowds with dance moves and sang backup.” In a social media post after his death at 71, the band itself described the South Side native as their “longtime wardrobe valet.”\n\nSumler, no matter what you might call his role in the group, was a member of a loosely affiliated fraternity of entertainers who, though rarely celebrated, come to the stage first, working a waiting crowd into shape, prepping the room for the promised riches to come.\n\nThe most famous of these men (they were always men) was Danny Ray, who died in 2021 at 85. He was known for his superlative-fueled introductions of James Brown (“The Godfather of Soul! The Amazing Mr. Please, Please Please!”). Hype Men, as they’re best known, were once a must-have for a great R&B show, but hip hop made the role a stepping stone: What would Public Enemy be without Flavor Flav hyping Chuck D? Jay-Z was Big Daddy Kane’s hype man; Diddy played the part for Notorious B.I.G.\n\nSumler — who was more like Jerome Benton in The Time, attending to the look of the group and its choreography, then slipping in with the backup singers for the rest of a concert — was discovered by a member of Kool & the Gang’s security while playing a South Side club with his band Power Pac. He started touring with Kool & Co. in 1985, just as their ‘70s hits were being dwarfed by their 1984 blockbuster album, “Emergency.”\n\n“My father was a modest man, and yet … no, he was not!” said Monica Ford, one of Sumler’s two daughters. “We would go shopping and we would always end up talking to someone about Kool & the Gang — perfect strangers! My father loved being in music.”\n\nSumler grew up on 114th Street and spent most of his life on stages. “There are different things you can be in a group,” said Elesia White, Sumler’s other daughter. “My dad was part of the Kool family, but if you asked what he was? He’d say ‘entertainer.’”\n\nEdmund White, who died in June at 85, wrote about sex. Not exclusively; he wrote around 30 books, some fiction, some histories, some memoirs, many a blend. But sex was always prominent. It was his “great subject,” he liked to say. He first wrote about sex as a teenager, when he was growing up in Evanston and Rockford. Specifically, he wrote about gay sex, without apology, when the subject itself was culturally off the table. He wrote so early and so frankly about sex between gay men that two of his best-received books, “The Joy of Gay Sex” (1977) and “States of Desire” (1980), were made immediate antiques only a few years later, when AIDS started tearing through gay communities. White was present then, too: He cofounded the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1982, and was its first president; a few years after, he was diagnosed HIV-positive.\n\nHe was so associated with writing about sex, it’s important to say he was never one thing. He was a bright intellectual child, but his own mother, an Illinois state psychiatrist, labeled him “borderline psychotic.” I interviewed him several times over the years and he was always generous, though very discerning; extremely accepting but a bit snobby. “A Boy’s Own Story” (1982), his breakthrough, was often categorized as fiction but was closer to semi-autobiographical, particularly in recounting the cruelties of being gay in Chicago in the 1950s. It led to a trilogy — “The Beautiful Room is Empty” (1988), “The Farewell Symphony” (1997) — collectively recounting gay life in the late 20th century.\n\nStill, his writings on sex were so vivid — and cringy and explicit and elegiac, into his 80s — you had to remind yourself he could be hilarious and, as many critics noted, deeply Proustian, close to aristocratic, with a touch of Henry James. Every time I spoke with him, I could feel my cheeks reddening. The last time we talked, I asked, naively, when he was a kid growing in Evanston, did he linger over sex scenes in novels? He proceeded to tell me about the “several hundred” men he had sex with in Chicago before he was 16. As in his books, the details were extraordinary: “I would have sex with men in their station wagons, which would be full of their children’s toys.”\n\nWhite broadened the cultural portrait of gay life, and remained ambitious into his final years. In one of his last books, set in 2050, an elderly couple remembers their sexual partners. In meta fashion, White himself is one of those affairs. He imagines himself almost completely forgotten by 2050. You could sense anxiety about his legacy, though at the same time, as White once told the Paris Review, he never regretted what he wrote: “Something that would please me alone — that became my sole criterion.”\n\nWhen José Jiménez was a child, he moved around Chicago nine times and attended four different elementary schools. Jiménez, better known as “Cha Cha,” liked to repeat those numbers. He knew they told the story of gentrification in the city better than any neighborhood housing committee could. He understood it was not just his story but one shared by many low-income residents of Chicago who were displaced in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly around Lincoln Park. He died in January at 76.\n\nJiménez described himself as a “revolutionary,” not as the leader of a non-profit or a community organizer. Which was wise — there was nothing formal about his history: His family moved to the United States from Puerto Rico in the late 1940s when he was a baby, and, at only 11, he helped create the Young Lords street gang on the Near North Side. As he told interviewers later, Chicago gangs then were about territory, and Lincoln Park was ground zero for a huge urban redevelopment plan by Mayor Richard J. Daley.\n\nStill, fighting was involved. Jiménez landed in jail often.\n\nBut during one stint in 1968, he read Malcolm X and American theologian Thomas Merton and Martin Luther King, Jr., and left prison with a renewed vision for the Young Lords. They would be an activist voice of affordable housing and healthcare for Puerto Ricans, modeled on the confrontational tactics of the Black Panthers. He was so taken with the Panthers he connected to chairman Fred Hampton and — together with the Young Patriots, a group of White Southerners in Uptown — launched the Rainbow Coalition to build a united multiracial front. (Jesse Jackson would later name his National Rainbow Coalition partly in honor of the group.)\n\nThe Young Lords petered out by the 1980s, but not before confronting landlords, occupying buildings and starting community centers. They inspired similar groups around the country to be aggressive about social services, helping raise the cause of human rights in Latino communities. But as Jiménez told an oral history project on the Young Lords, they were accidental activists: “We were just trying to defend our ‘hood.”\n\nIf you added up every line spoken by Michael Madsen and Ron Dean in every movie and TV show they appeared in — and between the two, they appeared in more than 400, mostly in the ‘80s and ‘90s — it’s unlikely you’d have enough dialogue for an entire movie. Both grew up in Chicago and neither said much on screen. They were character actors — they didn’t have to. Madsen, who died in June at 67, played criminals with a steady brooding menace. Dean, who died in October at 87, played police with a ruddy, brooding command. They were like the Crown Victoria of actors, projections of authority.\n\nAnd yet here we are singling them out.\n\nThey were heavies, disposable but somehow weirdly timeless. Madsen was the one with a little marquee value: He was that guy who cut off the ear in “Reservoir Dogs,” and that guy in “Kill Bill” who buried Uma Thurman alive; he played Susan Sarandon’s restless beau in “Thelma & Louise,” and he was the guy who pulls the gun on the other guy who won’t fire the nuke in “WarGames.” He was a one-man film noir, like his hero, Robert Mitchum. Dean, meanwhile, was a great hard-ass. He played the hard-ass dad who drops off Emilio Estevez in “The Breakfast Club,” and a hard-ass coach in “Rudy”; he was a detective who sweats Harrison Ford in “The Fugitive,” and the cop who gets shot (in Twin Anchors restaurant) by Harvey Dent in “The Dark Knight.” He was that guy with the bullhorn in “Risky Business” who told Tom Cruise to “get off the babysitter.”\n\nStrangely, Madsen and Dean were also aligned in life. As a teenager, Madsen did jail time for burglary and theft; in his last years, he was arrested for child endangerment and domestic violence. When Dean was 16, he escaped a jail lockup, found a gun in a desk and shot to death a Chicago police officer; he served 12 years in prison. After he got out, he found his way onto local theater stages, eventually appearing at Steppenwolf and Goodman. Madsen was a mechanic in Wilmette when he decided to audition for Steppenwolf; he soon landed a small role in “Of Mice and Men.” Both were also poets who would have appreciated how lyrically twinned they were, a pair of everyday schmoes from Chicago with meaty faces who became shorthand for blue-collar guys.\n\nWithout Burt Meyer and Mario Pasin tinkering around the North Side, building a trading route to the North Pole and Santa Claus that continues today, it would be hard to picture nearly any Christmas morning between 1960 and 1995. Boomers and Gen Xers were the primary constituents of Meyer and Pasin, though, you could argue, their influence never faded. You might even say work kept them young: Pasin, who was born in Oak Park, died in August at 95, and Meyer, who was born in Hinsdale, died in October at 99.\n\nPasin was the owner of Radio Flyer, the Belmont Cragin toy maker responsible for the classic red metal wagon. In the 1960s, he took over the business from Antonio Pasin, his father, who had founded the company in 1917. Meyer was a toy designer whose inventions also became childhood benchmarks. He created Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. And Lite Brite. And MouseTrap. He spent 25 years at Marvin Glass & Associations, as one of the stars of a legendary team at the former River North studio that dreamed up Operation, Ants in the Pants, Simon, Spirograph, Inchworm, Gnip Gnop, Mystery Date …\n\nMeyer’s creations — which were designed for Marvin Glass and then licensed out to major toy manufacturers such as Hasbro, Mattel and Parker Brothers — took full advantage of the post-World War II plastics age. Mario Pasin, conversely, steered Radio Flyer into its wood-paneled wagon days, and NASA-inspired ‘60s designs, then wagons with a touch of ‘70s muscle car. The first plastic Radio Flyer wagon wasn’t introduced until 1994.\n\nThat you never heard of Meyer or Pasin speaks louder than a rusty wagon. After Pasin’s death, his son Robert, who became CEO in the ‘90s, recalled his father as a portrait of sturdy midcentury Americana, not unlike a RadioFlyer. “He just went peacefully about his business … puffing on his cigar while quietly sitting with my mom in the living room.”\n\nFrom contributing critic Bob Gendron\n\nRecent news of the Music Box adding a third screen to its revered Southport Avenue location next year would’ve doubtlessly thrilled Dennis Wołkowicz. A self-taught pipe organist and historical preservationist who performed as an accompanist to silent film around the Chicago area, he recognized the community connections between old theaters and their surrounding neighborhoods. He had a special passion for reinvigorating the Six Corners district on the Northwest Side — an area blocks away from the two-flat in which he lived his entire life.\n\nWołkowicz epitomized the get-it-done Chicago spirit. Against all odds, he signed on to manage the then-threadbare Gateway Theater — a gem inside the Copernicus Center in Jefferson Park — in the mid-’80s. He began the venue’s comeback by screening silent films and installing a vintage 1927 organ, a move that prompted him to sharpen his skills on an instrument he admired as an adolescent. In the next decade, Wołkowicz co-founded the Silent Film Society of Chicago. The nonprofit’s Silent Summer Film Festival drew 8,000 attendees in its heyday. One of Chicago’s last photoplay organists, Wołkowicz took on another challenge in the mid-2000s when he agreed to manage and renovate the neglected Portage Theater, which he helped win landmark status.\n\nHe will be missed for being seen and heard at the organ at film screenings around the city. Performing upwards of 60 dates per year, often under the easier-to-pronounce alias Jay Warren, he appeared at the Davis, Logan, Pickwick, Patio, Arcada and Music Box theaters, as well as City News Cafe and various churches. As time-old traditions of going to the movies give way to streaming, Wołkowicz’s legacy reminds us of the shared experiences and auditory delights lost by staying home.\n\nFor Jack DeJohnette, timing was everything. Arguably the most accomplished and prolific drummer to hail from Chicago, he started playing clubs as a teenager. During that era in the early 1960s, he found himself in the crowd for a local John Coltrane residency. When the saxophonist’s percussionist, Elvin Jones, failed to materialize at the start of a set, DeJohnette stepped in. The moment crystallized a career marked by boundless adventure, unflagging virtuosity and rhythmic innovation.\n\nThough DeJohnette departed for New York in the mid-’60s, he never forgot the sounds and lessons he absorbed in his hometown. A composer, improvisor, bandleader and sideman who possessed perfect pitch, DeJohnette left his mark on dozens of his own LPs as well as recordings by a who’s who of jazz giants — Miles Davis, Charles Lloyd, Keith Jarrett, Freddie Hubbard, Dave Holland, John Abercrombie and Pat Metheny included. His extensive work for a pair of seminal labels (ECM and CTI) with divergent tastes spoke to his adaptability, diversity and thirst for discovery.\n\nHard bop, funk, swing, psychedelia, electric fusion, rock: DeJohnette navigated those styles and others with command and sensitivity. He considered himself a “colorist” and relished the opportunity to tackle pieces he’d played before as if they were brand-new. His curiosity and aptitude never ebbed. He came full circle in 2013 at Millennium Park by reuniting with several Chicago visionaries who formed the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and with whom he collaborated half a century earlier. DeJohnette followed that feat by returning to the piano — his first instrument — for his first solo piano LP, “Return” (2016). In 2022, he won a Grammy four months before turning 80. Yes, we lost DeJohnette. But not the deep rabbit hole of records on which he’s credited and which beckon our attention.\n\nChicagoans might know Jerry Butler from his decades-spanning role as Cook County Board Commissioner. Others may remember him for improving healthcare access while chairing the Health and Hospitals Committee. However admirable, his public service pales compared to the outsized impact he made on soul music.\n\nHaving cut his teeth singing gospel in churches and crooning on street corners near his family’s residence at the Cabrini-Green housing project, Butler became the first lead singer for the Impressions. His resonant baritone, creamy-smooth deliveries, suave control and formal presence were such that the group’s label — Chicago-based Vee-Jay Records — plotted to feature him as a solo artist from the time the Impressions recorded their haunting debut, “For Your Precious Love.” (Rolling Stone ranks the 1958 single one of the 500 greatest songs of all time.) In “Move on Up,” his definitive book on Chicago soul, Tribune contributor Aaron Cohen views its creation as the lynchpin to an independent- and community-minded social shift that swept the city.\n\nDue to internal tensions, Butler separated from the Impressions in 1960. Over the next 15 years, he logged a string of solo hits, ranging from “Only the Strong Survive” and “Make It Easy on Yourself” to “Let It Be Me” (a duet with fellow Chicago transplant Betty Everett) and “He Will Break Your Heart.” The latter is one of his collaborations with childhood friend and former Impressions mate Curtis Mayfield.\n\nIn the process, Butler earned his “Iceman” nickname and induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Impressions. The biggest tribute of all? His music continues to transcend generations via cover versions by rock ‘n’ roll contemporaries like Bruce Springsteen, the Hives and the Black Keys.\n\nFrom Tribune critic Chris Jones\n\nThe silver-haired publicist was at once a classic, old-school Chicagoan and a fish out of Midwestern water, a glamorous promoter with all of the dynamic pizzazz of Hollywood or midtown Manhattan. Margie Korshak ran the media show at most every Broadway musical to play Chicago for five decades, took care of much luxury retail (in more ways than one), and banged the drum for concert venues. Just as importantly, she served as the mentor of the famed “Margie’s Girls,” acolytes who often went on to found their own agencies and businesses after seeing firsthand what a woman could do in this profession. Cheerfully typified by the pink neon “Margie” sign in her John Hancock Center office, Korshak was known for grabbing hunter and quarry alike by the hand and pushing them together as if it were their destiny. At her memorial service, the famed British producer Cameron Mackintosh sent a Broadway singer from her favorite musical, “Les Misérables,” to sing “Bring Him Home,” or, in this case, “Bring Her Home.” A grand exit, fully deserved.\n\nThe prominent, four-theater building on Halsted Street in Lincoln Park, the Royal George Theatre, now meeting the wrecking ball after a long period of uncertainty, was the epicenter of Chicago’s now struggling commercial theater sector, the home of populist entertainment like “Love Letters,” “Art,” and “Forever Plaid” (a six year run!). It also hosted the world premiere of what became “Smokey Joe’s Cafe” and the iconic first national tour of “Angels in America.” Stars aplenty appeared there, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, and rarely were its theaters dark. Chicago loses a very viable mainstage theater with nearly 500 seats, attached parking and a Lincoln Park location. No small matter.\n\nThe low-slung West Lakeview Stage 773 building might be architecturally unimportant but, especially when it was known as the Theatre Building, it played a vital role in the history of the off-Loop theater movement after its founding by Byron Schaffer Jr. in 1977. With three sought-after rental venues of roughly equal size, it served as an early-career home for numerous Chicago theater artists, from Joan Allen and John Malkovich to Aidan Quinn, William Petersen and David Schwimmer. The Theatre Building was the first Chicago home of the famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company and also hosted a long list of small companies, from Famous Door Theatre Company to New Tuners and Porchlight Music Theatre to the Bailiwick Repertory. Sacred artistic ground, you’d think, but soon to be merely condominiums and retail.\n\nThe founder of Theo Ubique Theatre Company, a tiny operation that spent most of its existence in a Rogers Park coffeehouse, Fred Anzevino was (as much as any single person), the inventor of Chicago-style musicals. Whether the show was “Light in the Piazza” or “Cats,” he’d cram prodigious young musical-theater talent into a tiny space and then also ask them to serve drinks at intermission. Actors made bank on the tips and audiences would flock to one of the few available tables to catch a glimpse of the stars of the future. Anzevino was a rare judge of talent, especially when it came to vocal quality. After his death this year, his new Howard Street theater was filled with artists and audience members, coming together in gratitude.\n\nTom Stoppard was simply far smarter than any other contemporary playwright and more able to make the connections that underpin our lives — he wrote of string theory and sex, God and risk management, rock music and physics. He was interested in how science meets art, love turns into betrayal, moral rectitude gets undermined by insecurity. He understood how the roll of the dice changes our fate, how life is mostly a game, how everything was just a whole lot more complicated than we realized when we sat down in a theater seat to unravel “Arcadia” or “The Real Thing” or “Rock ‘n’ Roll,” or “Travesties” or, especially, “Leopoldstadt,” his final opus where the theater’s greatest relative thinker homed in on what matters most to all of us: our identities.\n\nFrom contributing critic Lauren Warnecke\n\nFew made a bigger impact on Chicago dance than Shirley Mordine, who pioneered the city’s model for training and presenting modern dance at scale. Mordine, 89, founded the dance department at Columbia College Chicago, serving as its chair for three decades.\n\nIt was partially self-serving. In creating the Dance Center, as the department is now called, Mordine trained dancers in her idiosyncratic, theatrical style, bringing generations of students into her professional company, Mordine & Company Dance Theater. The company, which recently dissolved after more than 50 years, was a launch pad for myriad artists who trained, danced and performed with Mordine — giving them a reason to stay in Chicago.\n\nMordine was an uncompromising leader in the studio and the boardroom. When confronted with “Why?” she’d ask, “Why not?” Rigor and tenacity are how she got things done. In 1972, Mordine founded the Dance Presenting Series at Columbia College, convincing artists from across the country and globe to perform in Chicago for the first time or return after long absences. She launched a Chicago edition of DanceAfrica, which for years was a festival of traditional and contemporary African dance at the Medina Temple. Those kinds of partnerships laid the groundwork for many cross-cultural collaborations, which weren’t popular when Mordine arrived in Chicago in the late 1960s. Ever interested in the world, with dance as the vehicle to explore it, Mordine forged kinetic connections with breakdancers and Bharatanatyam artists — connections which today feel like second-nature among Chicago’s dance scene.\n\nDeath is delayed, but not denied, for the Fine Arts Building’s elevators. Construction has begun converting their system — believed to be the last manually operated elevators in the city and original to the 1898 building created for the Studebaker Carriage Company. Managing artistic director Jacob Harvey has said the building’s three Otis cabs, hailed by a single button ringing a bell on each floor, had become too cumbersome to keep; replacement parts were almost impossible to find. There’s also the matter of staffing them. Operator Waclaw Kalata, a fixture in the building for three decades, is both an artist and a scientist, performing a kind of precise choreography eight hours a day — a job younger generations have not found appealing, given the lack of remaining opportunities to do it. For hangers-on, the good news is, elevator construction is long and expensive. Already behind schedule, the Fine Arts Building expects at least one manual cab to run through 2026.\n\nFrom contributing critic Hannah Edgar\n\nIt wasn’t an LGBTQ event without Lori Cannon. Cannon’s wit was as incandescent as her signature flaming red hair, but her generous heart was brightest of all. She first became a local fixture after becoming one of the earliest Chicagoans to volunteer on behalf of those diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, at a time when the disease was still little understood. She earned the moniker “Chicago’s AIDS Angel” and a posthumous tribute from Gov. JB Pritzker, who praised her for “(leading) the way with chutzpah and humor.”\n\nCaring for others was second nature for Cannon, 74, who died Aug. 3 from pancreatic cancer. A lifelong Chicagoan, she spent much of her adolescence taking care of her brothers, both of whom had complex medical needs. Together with other activists, she founded Open Hand Chicago, a meal service for those bedridden with AIDS, in 1988. Its successor, the Edgewater food pantry GroceryLand, followed in 1994. She was instrumental in the creation of both ACT UP’s Chicago chapter and the Legacy Project, the organization behind the Legacy Walk placards on Halsted Street.\n\n“When my contemporaries were dying in my arms, literally dying in my arms, my life was changed. I knew I couldn’t count on the government,” Cannon told the Tribune in 2004. “That’s when I knew this was my mission. I knew I couldn’t save lives, but I knew I could serve.”\n\nAs medical advances allowed individuals to live with HIV, Cannon remained just as dedicated to awareness as she was four decades prior.\n\nA sign hung in GroceryLand read, “LATEST AIDS STATISTICS: 0,000,000 CURED.”\n\n“I can’t wait till we can shut down and hang up a shingle, ‘It’s been a pleasure to serve you, and now we’re going to do something else,’” she told the Tribune in 2004. “Studs Terkel asked me once, ‘What would your life have been like without AIDS?’\n\n“And I said, ‘Studs, I’ll never know.’”\n\nFrom contributing critic Britt Julious\n\nSlo ‘Mo was revolutionary. As Chicago’s longest-running LGBTQ nightlife party, the event not only offered a safe space for the queer community in the city, it brought together generations of music fans. That was in large part due to the ethos and efforts of founder and co-host Kristen Kaza.\n\nKaza deeply understood the power that music can bring to those across the racial, gender and generational lines. Slo ‘Mo was a welcoming and affirming place for queer folks to be free and fulfilled, loved and loud, happy and whole. And as Kaza shared with me, “Slo ‘Mo has played a beautiful role, contributing to the quilt of queer cultural experiences that weave intergenerational joy with the healing and connecting of music so unique to Chicago.”\n\nIts last monthly party took place in October, but organizers plan on celebrating the party’s impact with a proper farewell in 2026. And although Slo ‘Mo is sunsetting, its legacy will live on as a source of joy and resiliency, love and community.\n\nThey say all good things must come to an end, but that does not feel fair, especially for a place as beloved as The Promontory. The live music and event venue became a trusted source of music events and cultural programming for folks on the South Side of Chicago and beyond.\n\nNew venues pop up around the city overnight, it seems, and yet, most are concentrated in North and West Side communities, leaving the vast landscape on the South Side as something of a barren land. The Promontory fit in nicely, filling a large hole and offering Chicagoans, both from the South Side and beyond, a place to gather under the sights and sounds of Black music and culture.\n\nI spent many years attending concerts, readings and dance parties that traversed genres as different as jazz and Afrobeats, hip-hop and R&B, house and soul. Through it all was a singular vision of community and culture. It will be sorely missed.\n\nBorn and raised in Chicago, Ronald Michael Carroll took to music from a young age. His roots began in the church choir, but he gained an interest in house music during his teen years. That’s why the charismatic and prolific DJ Ron Carroll became a staple on the Chicago and European house music scenes, as a DJ, singer and producer. An advocate for the LGBTQ and HIV-positive communities, Carroll was an outsize influence for many decades.\n\nHis first record, “My Prayer,” released in 1993, was a perfect introduction to who Carroll was as an artist: open and spiritual, motivating and true. Those words, too, are at the root of what makes Chicago house music — and house music as a whole — so enduring for audiences around the world.\n\nLater, Carroll launched his own label, Body Music Records, and released a number of seminal records, singles and collaborations, including “Lucky Star” and “Back Together.” The latter, a gorgeous, sumptuous, soulful classic has been a dance floor standard for more than 20 years. Few things feel as profound and powerful as the moment a Ron Carroll track drops during a long, satisfying night out.\n\nCarroll died from a heart attack in September at the age of 57.\n\nFrom A+E editor Doug George\n\nLooking around Chicago theater, it’s worth remembering that a few companies and individuals were part of shaping what it is today, and that includes Joyce Piven, who died early in 2025.\n\nPiven, along with her late husband Byrne Piven, founded the Piven Theatre Workshop in Evanston in the 1970s. The studio counts John and Joan Cusack, Aidan Quinn and Lili Taylor among its students, as well as Piven’s own children, the Hollywood figures Jeremy and Shira Piven. As Chris Jones recounts in his Tribune obituary, Piven was an early member of the Playwrights Theatre Club, which started in Chicago in 1953 and eventually became Second City. For years, Piven Theatre also put on professional productions in Evanston’s Noyes Cultural Arts Center and was an early supporter of the playwright Sarah Ruhl. The workshop continues to train new classes of students, supported in part by a memorial fund in Joyce’s name.\n\nLastly, satirist Tom Lehrer died in July, his life and work memorialized in the Tribune by Rick Kogan. Born in New York and Harvard-educated, Lehrer had no connection to Chicago, aside from performing here twice at Orchestra Hall, and he produced most of his work in the 1960s. And that work consisted of just two studio albums and a handful of compilations.\n\nBut his songs managed to reach a generation of nerdy Gen-X listeners that tuned into weekly broadcasts of “The Dr. Demento Show” on the radio — a generation that memorized the periodic table for chemistry class by listening to “The Elements,” a song that consisted of nothing more than a lightning-fast recitation of all known chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan’s patter song “Major-General” from “The Pirates of Penzance.” A generation (or this member of it, anyway) much entertained by Lehrer’s layering of a jaunty piano melody with lyrics about murdering avian wildlife with cyanide in “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.”\n\nThat aforementioned radio program also deserves a mention. “The Dr. Demento Show,” hosted by Barry Hansen, was created in 1970, went into syndication in 1974 and broadcast until 2010 — its over-the-air run concluding following the loss of key station WLUP-FM in Chicago. Hansen shifted to online streaming until he retired this year, having helped launch “Weird Al” Yankovic’s career and bring new listeners to satirists like Lehrer, Stan Freberg and Bob Newhart. The final episode, released on Oct. 11, was a countdown of the show’s 40 most requested songs across its 55 years, culminating in “Fish Heads.”","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/who-we-lost-in-2025/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-robert-smigel-04_178582003.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 11:45:22","author":"Rick Kogan","authors":["Rick Kogan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.569},{"id":388342466,"title":"Outcry Follows CBS Pulling Program On Prison Key To Trump Deportations","text":"The leadership of CBS News was facing accusations of political meddling on Monday over a last-minute decision not to air a report on the notorious Salvadoran prison where US President Donald Trump has sent deported migrants.\n\nCBS had been due to air the investigation late Sunday about alleged abuses at the CECOT center in El Salvador on its flagship “60 Minutes” program, seen by many as one of the most prestigious and hard-hitting institutions in US journalism.\n\nBut the broadcaster quietly announced hours before showtime that the segment would “air in a future broadcast,” replacing it with a piece on the sherpas working on Mount Everest.\n\nA 13-minute video about CECOT bearing the “60 Minutes” logo was widely circulated on social media platforms X and Reddit late on Monday after the segment was reportedly aired on Canadian station Global TV.\n\nThe segment being circulated, titled “Inside Cecot” and viewed by AFP, featured Sharyn Alfonsi as correspondent and listed Oriana Zill de Granados as producer.\n\nAFP has contacted Global TV’s parent company, Corus Entertainment, for comment.\n\nCBS, which was purchased by the Trump-linked Ellison family earlier this year, said that the prison report needed “additional reporting.”\n\nMultiple US media outlets quoted the “60 Minutes” correspondent who oversaw the report as saying it had been pulled for political reasons.\n\n“Pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision; it is a political one,” Alfonsi said in a note to CBS staff that was first leaked by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCECOT is a huge, maximum security facility touted by El Salvador’s right-wing President Nayib Bukele as the centerpiece of his attempt to rid the Central American country of narco-gangs.\n\nHuman rights activists say inmates there are treated brutally.\n\nThe facility has been at the center of a major US legal case since March, when the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan and other migrants there despite a judge’s order that they be returned to the United States.\n\nSeveral deportees who have since been released have described repeated abuse at the facility.\n\nREAD ALSO: Filmmaker Rob Reiner’s Son To Be Formally Charged With Parents’ Murder\n\nCBS Owners Close To Trump\n\nCBS’s decision to shelve a high-profile story on the Trump administration comes as the broadcaster’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, is in a multi-billion-dollar bidding war with Netflix to buy Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nTrump has made clear he is taking a keen interest in the merger, which will likely need regulatory approval.\n\nParamount was purchased by the Ellison family earlier this year.

Last year, Bezos himself vetoed an editorial endorsement of Kamala Harris, and this year the opinion section has taken a decidedly rightward turn. Lastly, let’s not forget the $40 million that Bezos’s Amazon paid for a documentary about Melania Trump—one in which she has total creative control. Expect the film equivalent of blood-red trees.\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\nZuck might be Donald’s new best friend. The Facebook founder and Meta CEO even got to sit next to the wannabe autocrat during that infamous suck-up meeting at the White House in September. Trump was kind enough, in fact, to shield Zuckerberg from an uncomfortable question about free speech in Europe. In fact, ever since Trump threatened him with jail time, Zuckerberg has decided that Trump’s way is best. He’s changed the Facebook platform to Trump’s liking, allowing more right-wing hate speech and misinformation, and has become Trump’s fawner-in-chief. He even praised him on an earnings call early this year, declaring, “We now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning and that will defend our values and interests abroad.”","summary":"As we are in the season of giving, here is a list of the billionaire businessmen—plus one widow of a billionaire businessman—who gave President Trump everything he wanted this year.

Things like kidnapping people off the streets, cutting healthcare from millions of people, and murdering Venezuelans without cause. But as Langone sees it, Trump has “a good shot at going down in history as one of our best presidents ever.” This is a serious change of tune for someone who, following the January 6 attack on the Capitol, said “I feel betrayed” and vowed to support Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\nThe Winklevii\n\n","url":"https://newrepublic.com/article/204259/trump-10-biggest-shameful-billionaire-toadies","image":"https://images.newrepublic.com/61d43135a4284083dea8c93f0718e0a076648ca4.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 11:00:00","author":"Ross Rosenfeld,Ross Rosenfeldro","authors":["Ross Rosenfeld","Ross Rosenfeldro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.035},{"id":388450354,"title":"7 reasons to feel actually hopeful about the clean energy transition","text":"It’s been a rough year if you care about climate change policy in the United States.\nIn Washington, the second Trump administration has moved quickly to dismantle the scaffolding of federal climate action: pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement (again), freezing or clawing back clean energy funding, fast-tracking fossil fuel projects, and even threatening the legal foundation of federal climate regulation itself.\nWith the help of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, whole climate, science, and conservation programs have been gutted, public servants fired, and climate language scrubbed from federal websites. And just last week, the administration moved to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research — arguably the world’s most crucial climate-science research institution that touches nearly every corner of US weather and climate forecasting, from wildfire modeling to the computational backbone universities rely on. \nSo when we published Escape Velocity back in April — a project arguing that the clean energy transition had gathered enough economic and technological momentum to become effectively unstoppable — it was fair to wonder whether that thesis could survive this onslaught.\nThe past eight months suggest it can. \nLooking back at the period since we published the project, what’s surprised me most isn’t how much went wrong — it’s how much progress kept happening anyway. Here are seven developments from 2025 that have me feeling hopeful for our future.\n\nKey takeaways\n• Even with the Trump-era rollbacks, clean energy continued to expand because it’s now cheaper, faster, and structurally difficult to stop.\n• Around the world, solar, wind, batteries, and EVs are winning on cost — which means adoption no longer depends on climate virtue or friendly governments.\n• The world isn’t waiting for the US. China, Europe, and emerging markets are driving the transition forward, whether Washington participates or not.\n• But even in the US, red and blue states alike have kept expanding clean power — often for purely economic reasons.\n• This shift is sticky. Projects breaking ground now will shape the grid for decades, locking in progress that future administrations can’t easily undo.\n\n1) Renewables officially eclipsed fossil fuels globally\nIn 2025, the clean energy transition crossed a line that will be hard to uncross. For the first time, renewables overtook coal as the world’s leading source of electricity. In the first half of the year, solar, wind, and hydropower generated 34.3 percent of global electricity, edging past coal’s 33.1 percent — a quiet but historic turning point. Just as striking, solar and wind didn’t merely grow alongside rising demand — they met it entirely. As global electricity use rose about 3 percent, solar and wind expansion covered 100 percent of that increase, with solar alone supplying more than 80 percent.\nThe pace of change has been startling. The world added 380 gigawatts of new solar capacity in just six months — a 64 percent jump from the same period in 2024 — putting 2025 on track to shatter records yet again. What once felt like “alternative energy” is now the cheapest, fastest power humanity has ever built.\nBill McKibben captures this inflection point in his 2025 book Here Comes the Sun, arguing that the real breakthrough isn’t a new technology, but the realization that the energy transition is finally running on economics, not idealism. The sun, it turns out, is doing exactly what it always has — and at last, we’re ready to use it.\n2) Thank you…China?\nIf Reason 1 is that the transition crossed a threshold, Reason 2 is who pushed it there: China has turned clean energy into the default global option.\nChina is now the single most important force in the global clean energy transition. It is installing vast amounts of solar, wind, and battery storage at home — but just as importantly, it has driven manufacturing costs so low that clean energy is affordable almost everywhere else. (Let’s also be clear that this is all happening as China continues to take more of an all-of-the-above approach — boosting coal and natural gas capacity, too.) \nThat’s why rooftop solar is spreading rapidly across Europe, South Asia, and the Global South. It’s why batteries are getting cheaper. And it’s why many countries no longer face a stark choice between climate action and energy access.\n3) Coal is losing — even where it once seemed untouchable\nA global transition only matters if it shows up in the hardest places. In 2025, it did.\nPoland, one of Europe’s most coal-dependent countries, generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time in June. Coal also fell below 50 percent of Poland’s electricity mix for an entire quarter — a symbolic and material break from the past.\nMeanwhile, in the UK, coal has all but disappeared from the grid, while wind has become the country’s single largest power source. Unfortunately, in the US, however, the Trump administration is trying anything it can to save coal, which is beginning to modestly slow down its rate of decline here. \nCoal demand still reached a record high in 2025, but it’s clear that we are at or nearing the peak. The future prognosis is terminal: Coal is dying simply because it’s losing the math.\n4) Without Trump really noticing, the states became the backbone of US climate action\nDespite aggressive rhetorical and policy attacks on renewables, solar continues to dominate new electricity generation in the United States. And solar energy is the star of 2025: By early December, solar accounted for roughly 75 percent of all new generation installed this year, far outpacing wind, gas, and nuclear.\nWe can thank the states for that. \nIn 2025, states passed clean energy affordability laws, modernized grids, invested in transit, expanded solar access, repealed coal bailouts, launched heat-pump rebates, and defended projects under federal attack. \nFrom Illinois and Maine to Nebraska, Ohio, and Oregon, progress came not from sweeping national legislation but from dozens of smaller — and arguably more durable wins.\nAnd where it gets really interesting is in Trump country. This year, 80 percent of US solar manufacturing investment went to Republican-held districts, and most of the top solar-installing states now vote red. Texas leads as solar expansion in the state is on track to produce more electricity on the state’s power grid than coal for the first time. Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, and others are close behind. Of the 20 states that installed the most solar capacity since 2024, 14 of them voted for President Donald Trump last year, and there is now more solar capacity installed in Trump states than in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. \nAll of this means that, ironically, we’re actually in the midst of a development sprint. \nStates across the country are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before Trump’s rollback of federal clean energy tax credits takes full effect. The credits, created under the Inflation Reduction Act, cut project costs by 30 to 50 percent, making them “the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project currently in the pipeline,” said Patty O’Keefe of Vote Solar. \nSince Trump ended the credits in July, states including Colorado, Maine, California, New York, Oregon, and Minnesota have accelerated permitting, procurement, and grid connections to help developers break ground before the July 4, 2026, construction deadline. \nThose projects will keep generating power for decades, meaning today’s scramble will permanently tilt the energy system slightly more toward renewables, regardless of what happens in Washington next. \n5) Electric vehicles are gaining traction. Yes, really. \nThis year, more than one in four new cars sold globally was at least partially powered by an electric motor.\nThat surge wasn’t led by the United States or even Europe, but by emerging markets — especially in Southeast Asia — where EVs are becoming the obvious choice for new buyers. Globally, more than 25 percent of new cars sold so far this year were either an EV or plug-in hybrid. \nAccording to a new report published this week by global energy think tank Ember, which analysed available monthly data for 60 countries, new markets are making a rapid switch to plug-in vehicles, putting to bed the theory that EV adoption would stall outside of Europe and China.\nIn the US, the story is messier, with policy uncertainty slowing adoption of more efficient cars. But globally, the direction is clear: automakers are designing for an electric future because that’s where the customers are.\n6) Batteries are solving the renewables problem people worried about most\nFor years, critics dismissed wind and solar as unreliable. In 2025, battery storage finally made that argument feel outdated.\nThe US hit record-breaking storage installations this year, with utility-scale batteries strengthening grids and soaking up cheap renewable power when it’s abundant — then delivering it when it’s needed. Developing technologies are already extending lifespans and cutting costs; solar combined with battery storage and wind with battery storage as a combo deal are even on track to undercut fossil fuels in cost worldwide before the end of the decade. \nThis is what makes renewables infrastructure, not just energy sources.\n7) The Data Center elephant in the room \nOkay, okay — by this point in the story, I know what you’re thinking: What about data centers???? Isn’t the insatiable buildout of AI going to derail any positive developments? \nIt’s true that data centers are sprouting up across the American landscape like weeds. As of November 2025, the US had built 5,427 data centers — with capacity up by more than 40 percent since the start of 2025 — making it the world’s largest data center market by a significant margin. As data center demand explodes, companies increasingly rely on renewables like solar and wind through power purchase agreements — but because those sources are intermittent, developers are pairing them with battery storage and, more often, natural gas plants to provide round-the-clock reliability. In practice, that means data centers are pulling heavily on clean energy where available, while leaning on fossil fuels, especially gas, to guarantee constant power as grids and storage struggle to keep up.\nBut there’s even a silver lining here: As the grid needs more and more energy, grid operators are increasingly looking to build out overall capacity with renewable energy sources because they are so cheap. \nAnd then there’s also something interesting happening that makes me feel hopeful about climate activism: As AI-driven data centers spread across the U.S., community backlash is growing — and fast. This feels like a purpose that the environmental movement, which has seemed unmoored for quite some time now, could glom onto. In places like suburban Philadelphia, Michigan, Georgia, and Virginia, residents are organizing against massive data centers over concerns about rising electricity bills, pollution, and noise.\nPower prices are already spiking for American consumers, and community opposition has delayed or canceled nearly $100 billion in projects so far. What’s striking is how bipartisan and local the resistance is — and how politically potent it’s becoming. Data centers are turning abstract climate and energy issues into tangible, neighborhood-level fights, offering climate activism a new, concrete target with broad public appeal. \nAnd just last week, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, proposed a moratorium on new data centers because he says artificial intelligence is coming along too quickly and we need time for “democracy to catch up.”\nThe bigger story is hopeful — but it’s not over yet\nNone of this means the climate fight is won. Clean energy is growing fast, but not yet fast enough to avoid serious harm. Infrastructure bottlenecks remain. Inequities persist. And US political sabotage carries real costs.\nBut the clean energy transition no longer depends on a single election, a single country, or a single president. It’s being driven by economics, technology, and global demand — forces that are far harder to reverse than a regulation.\nThe United States may be choosing to give up its head start. The rest of the world isn’t waiting.\nAnd every megawatt we build anyway still matters — because every fraction of a degree we avoid is lives saved, futures preserved, and disasters that never happen.","summary":"It’s been a rough year if you care about climate change policy in the United States.

Even in dystopia, divorces and breakups raged on: Nicole Kidman and her pocket-sized Australian Keith Urban, Bronwyn Newport and her evil husband on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, and seemingly everyone from Love Island called it quits on their relationships this year. Even Steve and Emily Guttenberg didn’t make it.\n\nBut nestled amid all this loss was one victory for the year that reminds us that love is real, especially when it’s between two lovable losers. At the beginning of December, Katy Perry hard-launched her new relationship just a few months after ending her six-year engagement with Orlando Bloom, in a 13-slide Instagram dump of photos from the Tokyo leg of her world tour. Tucked among pictures of sumo wrestlers and jiggling pancake stacks were a few shots of her and her new man eating sushi and gazing at a light exhibition.\n\nHer new boyfriend is unlike anyone else she’s ever dated. He isn’t a B- or C-list celebrity like her first husband, Russell Brand, or her ex-fiancé. He isn’t a fellow creative, or even someone you’d expect Perry to run into at her neighborhood Erewhon. Somehow, against all odds—and lord, were there ever odds—Perry’s new boyfriend is none other than Canada’s only living fuckable prime minister, Justin Trudeau.\n\nOver the summer, TMZ first broke the news that the two were seeing each other, publishing grainy photos of the two of them out for dinner at Le Violon, a fine-dining restaurant in Montreal. The date was surprising to everyone, including those closest to Trudeau, partly because it was such an intense one. “It was a 14-, 15-hour date,” said one Ottawa-based political operative with close ties to Trudeau, on the condition of anonymity. “I was like, Why is Justin going on lesbian dates with Katy Perry?”\n\nIn mid-October, around (Canadian) Thanksgiving, according to people in Trudeau’s circle, he gathered a few of his closest friends and political confidants to tell them the relationship was real. Two weeks later, he and Perry were gleefully holding hands in Paris while celebrating her 41st birthday. “He was saying in mid-November he’s going to introduce her to his close guy friends, his childhood friends,” the Ottawa operative said. That’s a big deal for Trudeau; he’s maintained the same circle of friends since he was just the son of Pierre Trudeau, the 15th prime minister. Perry is the first woman he’s brought so closely into his fold since his 2023 divorce.\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention to the trajectories of these two once-loved figures of the 2010s, this coupling makes perfect sense for both of them. “Neither one has had a very good—let’s call it 48 months,” said Lainey Lui, founder and editor of Lainey Gossip and co-anchor on Canada’s eTalk. “He got divorced, lost his job, and needed a comeback story. She also left her relationship and she’s not the pop superstar at that level that she once was.” In October, Lui wrote about the two of them, “Two people in their flop era getting together to un-flop themselves is a good move!” Love, after all, is a perfect way for two celebrities lacking relevancy to find it once again.\n\nThe politician and the pop star are a misshapen romance novel come to life: They’ve connected during respective fallow periods in their careers and personal lives, each seeking a new way to enter public life. Perry was once the ultimate girl-boss raunchy white-girl popstar for the millennial generation, churning out steady hits and culture-defining music videos and performances. Trudeau was once a promising progressive hero for many Canadians and Americans who hoped his youth and nepo-baby bona fides would revolutionize Canadian politics and life.\n\nThe tide turned on each of them after their public peaks, and they separately had remarkable falls from grace. Perry’s latest album, 143, was a critical and commercial dud. (A song called “Woman’s World” produced by the guy Kesha sued for sexual assault? A pretty tough sell!) And while she has stumped for Democratic candidates in Trudeau’s flavo(u)r, like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, she’s maintained close ties to controversial figures like Jeff Bezos while supporting Republicans like Rick Caruso, alienating her more liberal fanbase. (Don’t even get me started on all the dying nuns and the veterans she keeps suing.)\n\nTrudeau, meanwhile, disappointed progressives and infuriated Conservatives over his time as prime minister. Those who voted for him grew tired of slick talk and little action around electoral reform or Indigenous rights. Right-wingers pointed to the skyrocketing cost of living in Canada, and the Liberal government’s mismanagement of immigration. No one seemed to think he could face Trump in a battle over tariffs after a brutalizing pandemic that shuttered so much of the country. But, plainly put, people just got sick of his shit: His gentle-parenting manner, sometimes bordering on condescension, stopped charming Canadians the way it once did. At the end of 2024, a few months before he stepped down, his approval rating was around 33 percent.\n\nTrudeau and Perry are icons of a political generation now mostly forgotten, namely a kind of middle-of-the-road liberalism that’s useless against MAGA-style Republicanism and tedious compared to Gen Z and Alpha leftism. They come from political and cultural worlds that no longer exist. No wonder they make such a perfect, if improbable, match. As we wind down yet another worst-year-of-our-lives, there’s so little to root for. But maybe these two crazy kids are the right place for us to put some hope for the future.\n\nJustin, as Canadians called him through his infancy, into his adulthood, and even through his time as prime minister, was made for public life. Notorious since his 1971 Christmas Day birth, Trudeau was born to father Pierre, the prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984. His mother, Margaret, was nearly 30 years younger than her husband, infamous for being beautiful, complicated, and flighty. Pierre is, still, one of the most beloved political figures in Canadian history, notorious for being clever, effective, and a little rude. (The night that Pierre and his Liberal Party were defeated in 1979, his estranged wife was clubbing in Studio 54 instead of tending to her family. She remains one of the most beloved ex-wives in Canadian history.) When they divorced, Pierre had primary custody of the boys, but Trudeau was always described as a “mommy’s boy.”\n\nTrudeau has always been famous and well-off, but the children of Canadian politicians aren’t the same as American ones. “Growing up as the prime minister’s son, there’s not a lot of wealth involved. It’s not like he grew up going on private jets,” said the Ottawa politico. “But everyone knew who he was, and so he naturally is a guarded person.” Perry isn’t the first famous person he’s dated, but she’s certainly the closest to his level of international recognition. That’s at least one thing they have in common: “It’s probably nice to be with someone who can understand not wanting to have your picture taken if you’re eating breakfast somewhere,” the operative said.\n\nWhen Richard Nixon visited Ottawa in 1972, when Trudeau was a few months old, he toasted him as “the future Prime Minister of Canada.” He became the custodian of the family legacy, in part through tragedy: His middle brother Alexandre was never much for the public eye, and youngest brother Michel died in an avalanche in the late ’90s. Pierre died in 2000, when Trudeau was 28, and his fame exploded in earnest when he delivered a eulogy that was broadcast across the country. “Until that moment,” Macleans wrote about Trudeau in 2000, “he had been almost unknown to Canadians. But when he started his eulogy he had their undivided attention.”\n\nWhen he was younger, Trudeau often talked about wanting to become a teacher. (He did teach briefly, at a high school, where he famously did brownface in 2001, which somehow didn’t kill his political future.) But his life would never be his own, and his entrance into federal politics felt inevitable. “His political beginning was a worldwide televised event,” Lui says. “That moment is almost storybook, almost cinematic. Every camera was pointed at him and he captured the world’s attention. His public life is defined by a moment like that. His ‘private’ life post-office is still going to be a show.” Pierre could be a bully, a brute, and was known as “Swinging Pierre” for his many sexual exploits. Trudeau’s touch, politically and personally, was always gentler. “He is more of his mother’s son,” said Shannon Proudfoot, a feature writer for the Ottawa bureau at the Globe and Mail. “He’s more expressive, emotive, heart-on-the-sleeve, touchy-feely.” Margaret used to call Trudeau “a very romantic boy.”\n\nAnd god, did he ever love to perform romance. For 18 years, he was married to Canada’s greatest cornball, Sophie Grégoire, before they split up in 2023. Grégoire was a well-known television host, but as Trudeau’s wife, she was perhaps best known for spontaneously bursting into song at a Martin Luther King Day tribute. (One source close to Grégoire explained her enthusiasm: “People outside of Canada don’t get it. She isn’t crazy. She’s just French Canadian.”) Trudeau’s love life has always been on display, and while the United States inched closer and closer to the first Trump administration, Justin and Sophie were a resplendent and attractive Canadian alternative. In a 2015 issue of Vogue, Trudeau was photographed not just as a young political upstart, but as a public husband, caressing his wife’s rump in a magazine. Have you ever seen a more romantic boy in your life?\n\nBut according to those close to Trudeau’s office, Grégoire was looking forward to duties akin to those of a first lady. In Canada, that sort of gig doesn’t really exist despite the early days of photo spreads and the official visits to India and Washington. “I think she thought it would be more glitzy and glam, more state visits,” said the Ottawa operative. “Reality hits, and, like, 24 Sussex is uninhabitable because there’s asbestos and rats in it. We don’t have an Air Force One. The planes were so old that we constantly had to refuel in Gander.”\n\nKaty Perry, one assumes, does not refuel in Gander. Who knows if she’s even been to Newfoundland? But maybe there’s some novelty for the two of them here: Trudeau finally gets to date someone who understands fame and excess as much as he does, and she gets to date someone impressed by a private jet.\n\nYou won’t find much reporting about Trudeau and Perry in the Canadian press. Canadian journalists don’t often busy themselves with the personal lives of politicians, in or out of office. “It’s not a protective, carrying-water norm,” Proudfoot says. “It’s a collective code that we focus on the work and not the person.”\n\nEarlier this year, there were rumblings that Trudeau was dating a lawyer based in Newfoundland. No one reported on it officially—the extracurricular activities of an outgoing prime minister would be too lurid for a Canadian audience—but photos of the two of them holding hands surfaced on X and in countless Canadian group chats. “Everyone knew, and it was like, Hey, isn’t that fascinating?” Proudfoot says. “But what is there for us to seize on?”\n\nAccording to people close to Trudeau, there was no overlap between the two relationships, and Trudeau was clear with her that they weren’t in any kind of exclusive relationship. He met Perry in February at the Invictus Games in Vancouver, and then later attended her Montreal concert with his daughter. It was Perry who apparently reached out to spend time together privately, and almost immediately, that previous relationship was over. And after that hours-long date in Montreal, there was only one girl for him, and it’s the one who got violently slimed at the 2010 Kid’s Choice Awards.\n\nPerry seemed to fall for him fast, too, which isn’t surprising if you ask at least a few women who’ve known him over the years. “He’s very sexy in person, in terms of how he carries his body. He’s charming and flirty to a lot of women,” said the Ottawa political reporter who asked to remain anonymous. “It doesn’t surprise me that months later, she’s like, I’m going to Canada, let me reach out to this guy and he can show me around.” It makes sense if you think about the entire ethos of Trudeau’s early political campaign: Man Hot. Down about politics? Look at Man Forearms. Worried about the economy? The bluest of Blue Eyes™ right here. The chief criticism around Trudeau was that he was all talk and all looks, but talk and looks are pretty good qualities in a boyfriend.\n\nKaty Perry is coming off a streak of resounding losses, both personal and professional. Her recent split from Orlando Bloom is her second divorce after she was famously dumped by her first husband, Russell Brand, mere moments before going on stage in Brazil in late 2011.Her current tour has been panned as has her music, and for much of the spring and summer, there seemed to be entire TikTok accounts dedicated to tracking how undersold her shows were. For the last decade, Perry has struggled with proving authenticity to her audience, who are less enthralled by her glittery costumes and Dennis the Menace personality. “The knock on Katy was that it was girlboss feminism,” Lui says. “But whatever the equivalent of girlboss feminism is as a prime minister, that would be Trudeau.” Perry’s romance with Trudeau is perfect in part because their form of political engagement—and the futility of it—is exactly in sync.\n\nAmong Ottawa reporters and those close to Trudeau, the pairing feels both ludicrous and exactly right. “It registered to me as an acid trip Mad Libs. It makes no sense, but on another level, it makes all the sense in the world,” said Proudfoot. For years while in office, Trudeau was a deeply unpopular figure in Canada, a joint enemy across the political spectrum. Now, he’s just some Canadian celebrity with international name recognition. “He’s yesterday’s man, and we’ve moved on,” Proudfoot says. “Maybe that’s why his relationship with Katy Perry is this object of amused fascination in Ottawa: She is the embodiment of the 2015 zeitgeist in 2025. It’s astonishingly symmetrical.” Their politics—or rather, the way their politics have aged—is what unites them.\n\nMaybe their compatibility is much, much simpler than all this intellectualizing about mid-aughts centrism. These are two cornballs who have found each other, thank god. Even Perry’s hard launch of their relationship is full of cringey, corny sweetness, including Trudeau gazing at her while she eats a mini uni. It’s cute! It’s mortifying. They deserve each other, which you can say either as a dig or as a kindness.\n\nThrough Perry, Trudeau has an opportunity to be the good guy—something he loves being, as any Canadian who’s suffered through one of his speeches about gender parity knows. “I think about the pictures of them coming out of the restaurant in Paris for her birthday,” Lui said. “He’s performing the role of ideal boyfriend in an A.I.-written rom-com: The pop star is on the road but her boyfriend surprises her for dinner.”\n\nTrudeau, at least, is playing the role. According to those closest to him, what he likes best about Perry is how engaged of a mother she is. (He, after all, sewed his son’s Halloween costumes even while he was in office, ducking out early to pick up fabric on the way home for Hadrian’s pants.) “This is the fantasy in the rom-com: The single mom who is the star wants to be appreciated, and also treated, indulged,” Lui said. “And here he is. He looks great in a suit!”\n\nYou’ll keep seeing Trudeau and Perry in 2026, rest assured. “It’s definitely not a flash,” said the Ottawa operative. “It has legs.” Trudeau’s former staff have gone from privately shrugging their shoulders about this particular exploit to accepting it as a real, important part of his life.They’re getting closer and more public. Trudeau is, notably, including Perry in his diplomacy work; their Tokyo hard launch was around a visit to Japan’s former prime minister, and not just her tour stop. Not quite a state visit, but a far cry from whatever it is that Orlando Bloom does for a living. (Selling cruises?)\n\nPerry has already met much of Trudeau’s circle in Ottawa. But maybe the greatest reveal of the intimacy between them isn’t in what they’re letting us see—public hand-holding, dinners out, Instagram posts.

I shared a few statistics from my recent book :\n\nWhen, in 1957, my dad bought the house I grew up in, the average cost of a single-family home in America was about 2.2 times the average annual wage. Today it’s more than ten times the average wage.When my Boomer generation was the same age as today’s Millennials, we owned a bit over 22 percent of the nation’s wealth; Millennials today control only about 4 percent of the country’s wealth (and it’s the same for Zoomers).From the 1930s right up until the Reagan Revolution, it was possible for seniors to live comfortably on Social Security alone; Reagan undid that with his “reforms” so today that’s nearly impossible.When I ran my first seriously successful business in the early 1970s, it cost me around $35/month for comprehensive health insurance for each of my 18 employees; at that time hospitals and health insurance companies were required by Michigan law (where I lived; most other states were identical) to be run as non-profits. Today, health insurance can be as much as one-fifth of a company’s payroll expense.When Reagan came into office in 1981, a single wage earner could support a family with a middle-class lifestyle, and fully 65 percent of us were in the middle class (up from around 20 percent in the 1930s). Today, after 44 years of Reaganomics, it takes two full-time people to achieve the same status, which triggers huge childcare expenses, which is part of why only 43 percent of us are middle class .\n\nFDR’s great — and successful — Democratic Socialist experiment following the Republican Great Depression was to drive the economy from the bottom up, reversing the “Horse and Sparrow” trickle-down economics and deregulation of the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover administrations that provoked the Great Crash.\n\nHe did that by:\n\nExpanding the notion of the commons — the stuff we all collectively own and is administered or funded and regulated by government — to include free public education nationwide (and cheap college), old-age retirement (Social Security), and public power and transportation systems (Tennessee Valley Authority, federal support for local transit, roads and highways).Legalizing unions, an effort that was so successful that when Reagan came into office fully a third of us had good union jobs and, because they set the local wage floors, two-thirds of Americans had the equivalent of a union wage and benefit package.Establishing a minimum wage on which a single worker could raise a family of three and still stay above the federal poverty level (today’s federal minimum wage is $7.25: adjusted with the Consumer Price Index, that $1.60 minimum wage in 1968 is equivalent to about $14.90 an hour in 2025 dollars).\n\nIn the years since, we’ve continued to expand the commons by establishing national single-payer healthcare systems for low-income people (Medicaid) and retired people (Medicare), both of which came out of LBJ’s Democratic Socialist program that he called The Great Society.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans and a few neoliberal Democrats have pushed back against these Democratic Socialist programs that made the American middle class the first in the history of the world to exceed more than half the population.\n\nReagan’s war on unions has cut our union membership down to well under 10 percent in the private sector.His gutting federal funding for education has exploded college costs to the point where three generations are saddled with over $2 trillion in debt that can’t be discharged by bankruptcy.Reagan’s tax cuts for the rich (from 74 percent down to 27 percent) and corporations tripled the national debt (from $800 billion to $2.4 trillion) just in his eight years; since then the four GW Bush and Trump tax cuts have, when combined with Reagan’s, produced a $38 trillion national debt so big that we now spend more on servicing their debt than we do on our defense budget or would on administering a national healthcare system.\n\nBack in the 1940s, after the incredible success of the New Deal, President Roosevelt wanted to further expand the commons by expanding the scope of his Democratic Socialist programs. Just before he died, he proposed a “Second Bill of Rights” that included:\n\n“The right to a useful and remunerative job in the nation’s industries, shops, farms, or mines. (Unionization and an above-poverty-level minimum wage.)“The right to earn enough to provide adequate food, clothing, and recreation. (Ditto and government as the employer of last resort.)“The right of every farmer to raise and sell products at a return that gives his family a decent living. (Don’t manipulate farm prices with stupid tariff wars, etc., and make the government the purchaser of last resort.)“The right of every businessperson, large and small, to trade free from unfair competition and domination by monopolies. (Break up the giant corporations and encourage average people to start small businesses, including with loan supports.)“The right of every family to a decent home. (Today this would mean no more corporations, hedge funds, and foreign billionaires owning single-family homes to squeeze us dry by jacking up rents.)“The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to enjoy good health. (FDR favored a single-payer healthcare system like Medicare for All.)“The right to protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment (i.e., robust Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance).“The right to a good education.” (Free or inexpensive college, quality public schools in every community.)\n\nMuch to the chagrin of my Republican-activist father, my grandfather (a 1917 Norwegian immigrant) frequently and proudly described himself as a socialist. When I asked him what he meant, he always pointed me to FDR, the New Deal, and his proposed Second Bill of Rights.\n\nAnd here we are again.\n\nMy grandfather’s generation saw up-close and firsthand the tax-cutting and deregulation binge of the Roaring 20s (which were only “roaring” for the morbidly rich), and then had the lived experience of watching FDR put the country back together and create the world’s first widespread middle class.\n\nMillennials and Zoomers today are seeing the same thing, between the Bush Housing Crash of 2008, the botched Covid Crash of 2020, and the GOP’s relentless program to drive the wealth of the nation into the money bins of the billionaires who own that party.\n\nThey see the example of most European countries, where the commons includes college (many will actually pay you a stipend to attend), healthcare, and daycare/preschool, and union density is often well above 80%. Housing is subsidized or heavily regulated, leading several to have essentially ended homelessness. Giant corporate monopolies are prohibited and local small businesses are encouraged.\n\nEuropeans call these programs Democratic Socialism or social democracy, and young Americans clearly are enthusiastic about bringing the “European Dream” to this country.\n\nMy sense is that — much like in the 1930s — a significant majority of Americans are sick of the neoliberal “let the rich run things because they know best” bullshit that Republicans, “Tech Bros,” and a shrinking minority of on-the-take Democratic politicians embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, nobody’s sure why the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is refusing to release the autopsy they did of the 2024 election, producing speculation it may have uncovered examples of Russian and Republican manipulation of both voters and the vote, but I’m guessing the real reason is that the neoliberals who largely run the DNC saw feedback that reflected the Rasmussen poll I opened this article with.\n\nThe exploding popularity of progressive politicians from Zohran Mamdani to Bernie Sanders, Jasmine Crockett, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aren’t an anomaly; they’re a signpost to both electoral and governing success for the next generation of genuinely progressive Democratic politicians.","summary":"The media is freaking out over a new Rasmussen poll that found:\n\n“A majority of voters under 40 want a democratic socialist to win the White House in the next presidential election.\n\n“… 51 percent of Likely U.S. Voters ages 18 to 39 would like to see a democratic socialist candidate win the 2028 presidential election.

Weiss, the Free Press founder named CBS News editor-in-chief in October, said it was her decision.\n\nThe dispute puts one of journalism's most respected brands -- and a frequent target of President Donald Trump -- back in the spotlight and amplifies questions about whether Weiss' appointment was a signal that CBS News was headed in a more Trump-friendly direction.\n\nAlfonsi, in an email sent to fellow \"60 Minutes\" correspondents, said the story was factually correct and had been cleared by CBS lawyers and its standards division. But the Trump administration had refused to comment for the story, and Weiss wanted a greater effort made to get their point of view.\n\n\"In my view, pulling it now after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,\" Alfonsi wrote in the email. She did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nAlfonsi said in the email that interviews were sought with or questions directed to -- sometimes both -- the White House, State Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story. If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a 'kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient.\"\n\n\"Spike\" is a journalist's term for killing a story. But Weiss, in a statement, said she looked forward to airing Alfonsi's piece \"when it's ready.\"\n\nSpeaking Monday at the daily CBS News internal editorial call, Weiss was clearly angered by Alfonsi's memo. A transcript of Weiss' message was provided by CBS News.\n\n\"The only newsroom I'm interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,\" Weiss said. \"Anything else is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nShe said that while Alfonsi's story presented powerful testimony about torture at the CECOT prison, The New York Times and other outlets had already done similar work. \"To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more,\" she said. \"And this is '60 Minutes.' We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Weiss' involvement in seeking administration comment was sought. She reportedly helped the newscast arrange interviews with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff this past fall to discuss Trump's Middle East peace efforts. Trump was interviewed by Norah O'Donnell on a \"60 Minutes\" telecast that aired Nov. 2.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of \"60 Minutes.\" He refused to grant the show an interview before last fall's election, then sued the network over how it handled an interview with election opponent Kamala Harris. CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying Trump $16 million this past summer. More recently, Trump angrily reacted to correspondent Lesley Stahl's interview with former Trump ally-turned-critic Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" was notably tough on Trump during the first months of his second term, particularly in stories done by correspondent Scott Pelley. In accepting an award from USC Annenberg earlier this month for his journalism, Pelley noted that the stories were aired last spring \"with an absolute minimum of interference.\"\n\nPelley said that people at \"60 Minutes\" were concerned about what new ownership installed at Paramount this summer would mean for the broadcast. \"It's early yet, but what I can tell you is we are doing the same kinds of stories with the same kind of rigor, and we have experienced no corporate interference of any kind,\" Pelley said then, according to deadline.com.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/dec/23/journalist-fumes-over-last-minute-pulling-of/","image":"https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.arkansasonline.com_default.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 10:26:00","author":"David Bauder The Associated Press","authors":["David Bauder The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4}]}
