Jasmine Crockett’s chances in Texas’ U.S. Senate race. While Crockett’s television hits and podcast interviews delight liberals, she’s only ever won in safely Democratic seats. Her preferred strategy of focusing on increasing base voter turnout has little track record of success. Republicans are openly ecstatic about her decision. \n\nBut if Democratic elected officials share this skepticism, they’re unwilling to say it out loud. They’re also not willing to fully back her campaign or endorse her over her primary opponent, state Rep. James Talarico. \n\n“It’s entirely possible that she can put together a good campaign,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).\n\n“She’s an outstanding person and an important voice in her state,” added Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).\n\n“I’m obviously focused on the House, not the Senate,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), declining to speak on the ambitions of one of the most high-profile members of his caucus.\n\nUncertainty about the utility of Crockett’s bid extended even to Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the members of the so-called “Fight Club” group of progressive senators pushing for a more aggressive approach to combating Donald Trump.\n\n“There are some places where the primaries are good, and there are places where they can be a pain in the ass,” Murphy told HuffPost. “A primary can, you know, ultimately cause a lot of new people to register and cause a lot of new people to get involved.”\n\nThe wishy-washiness greeting Crockett is reflective of the party’s uncertainty about how to navigate the anti-Trump, anti-establishment energy coursing through the party, which closely mirrors the GOP’s crack-up in the first half of the 2010s. Democrats are hoping to mirror the incredibly strong midterm election performances Republicans had in those years.\n\nBut they are hoping to avoid the downsides the GOP experienced in those years: Primary voters repeatedly picking weak candidates who handed winnable elections to the opposition. The consensus among party operatives is Crockett is the Democratic equivalent of Christine O’Donnell or Richard Mourdock, a candidate whose fighting spirit animates the party’s base but whose rhetoric — like Crockett saying conservatives are “inherently violent” or suggesting Latino Trump supporters have a “slave mentality” — repels swing voters. \n\n“This feels like a Democratic tea party moment,” said Adam Carlson, founder of the Democratic polling firm Zenith Research. “Democratic primary voters are tired of having candidates dictated to them, and they’re saying, ‘Stop telling us who’s electable. We’re going to vote for who we like the best.’” \n\nThe party’s establishment has long succeeded at closely managing primaries. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), known as a ferocious recruiter, was also adept at subtly and not-so-subtly discouraging candidacies, helping the party avoid contentious primaries in Florida and Kansas in recent years. \n\nAnd voters largely went along with party leaders’ wishes. In the first midterm under Trump, wins by insurgent progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) were the exception rather than the rule, with voters — especially in swing states and districts — backing moderate candidates seen as safe choices to win. That trend largely continued through the 2020, 2022 and 2024 elections. \n\nDemocrats in those elections often benefited from anti-Trump energy, and clear cases of the party picking the wrong nominee were few, far between and often limited to lower-stakes races for the U.S. House. But some party operatives fear they could be far more common this cycle.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) indirectly compared Crockett to Aftyn Behn, the Tennessee state legislator whose liberal stances and controversial social media posts some Democrats blamed for blowing the party’s shot at a deep-red House seat earlier this month.\n\n“I do know that Texas is red, and then I do know that you have to bring some people over to the other side,” Fetterman told HuffPost. “And now, what happened in Tennessee? You know, we had that total train wreck on our side, and that could have been actually really, truly competitive if it was like a more reasonable kind of a candidate.”\n\nCrockett’s entrance into the race seemingly forced former Rep. Colin Allred, potentially a much stronger candidate, to challenge Rep. Julie Johnson for a safe Democratic House seat instead. Allred ran 6 percentage points ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the state when he challenged Sen. Ted Cruz last cycle.\n\nAllred’s team portrayed his decision, which leaves Talarico as Crockett’s only competition in the primary, as a selfless one that would give the party’s nominee a 13-week head start in the general election by avoiding a runoff, which is a near certainty in the GOP primary between incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. (Texas requires runoffs in primaries if no candidate breaks 50% of the vote.)\n\nBut as the likelihood of Crockett running for Senate became clear in recent weeks, Democrats in the state couldn’t find anyone willing to discourage her. Senate Democrats do not yet view Texas, an ultra-expensive state that might only be competitive if Cornyn loses to the deeply conservative and ethically challenged Paxton, as an essential part of their pathway to the majority. \n\nEven if they had, Crockett, to put it lightly, does not seem to be the type swayed by the pleas of party elders. \n\n“It’s weird that people believe that I could win the races that I won and I’m just like out here willy-nilly,” she told CNN last week before officially announcing her decision. “But OK. I am very self-aware, right?”\n\nWith Allred out of the race, it is now a showdown between Crockett and Talarico, widely seen as another rising star in the party and someone who has amassed a $5 million war chest since entering the race this summer, according to the Federal Election Commission filings from October. (Crockett has roughly $4.6 million in her account.) \n\nCrockett’s unelectability, in the eyes of most Democratic operatives, comes down to both her insistence on turning out Democratic base voters at the expense of persuasion and her tendency to actively insult Trump voters.\n\n“There just aren’t enough Democrats to win using a base-heavy strategy in Texas,” Carlson said.\n\nThe other concern Democrats have about Crockett is, as one strategist put it, her “robust self-image.” Her campaign announcement did not include any mention of policies or voter concerns; it was a video of herself with audio of Trump insulting her. Early on in her kickoff speech, Crockett said she was running because “what we need is for me to have a bigger voice.” \n\nCrockett’s campaign did not respond to an email requesting comment. During an appearance on CNN on Monday night, Crockett went further than previously in suggesting she would reach out to some Trump voters. \n\n“We are going to be able to get people that potentially have voted for Trump even though I, obviously, am one of his loudest opponents because at the end of the day, they vote for who they believe is fighting for them,” she told host Laura Coates.\n\nBut she reiterated her top priority would be turning out otherwise apathetic voters, a strategy even many other progressives have backed away from. “Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to because there are so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas,” she said. “Listen, the state of Texas is 61% people of color. We have a lot of good folk that we can talk to.”\n\nOne Democrat working for a House campaign in Texas’ heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley — an area that has swung sharply to Republicans over the past decade — noted Crockett’s announcement video included no mention of the high cost of living, a message the party has used to successfully win back Latino voters elsewhere in elections this year.\n\n“It’s simply not the message these voters are looking for,” said the operative, who requested anonymity to speak frankly because his candidate is neutral in the Senate primary. “People here are worried about a downballot bloodbath.” \n\nWhile Crockett has an advantage in name identification and starts out in the lead, Democrats watching the race say she also has uniquely high unfavorable ratings, even among members of her own party. Talarico allies hope a closer look at Crockett’s record — including her past support for Israel, her ties to the cryptocurrency industry and her acceptance of corporate political action committee money — rather than just her TV appearances, will convince the party’s voters Talarico gives them the best chance of winning statewide in Texas for the first time in 30 years. \n\n“We’re building a movement in Texas — fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state,” Talarico said in a statement after Crockett’s entrance into the race. “Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-senate-race-democratic-party_n_6939989de4b0758c1aff338e?origin=top-ad-recirc","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69399929190000caf87f3c31.jpeg?cache=cdWWm9a14L&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 18:19:43","author":"Igor Bobic,Kevin Robillard","authors":["Igor Bobic","Kevin Robillard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.129},{"id":386897920,"title":"This High-Profile Race Shows Exactly What Has Changed In The Democratic Party","text":"WASHINGTON — There’s plenty of reason to be skeptical of Rep.

Comedian Jerry Seinfeld has talked about this problem, noting that he used swear words in his early routines but dropped them as his career progressed because he felt profanity yielded only cheap laughs.\n\n“I felt like well I just got a laugh because I said f—- in there,” he said in a 2020 interview on the WTF podcast with fellow comedian Marc Maron. “You didn’t find the gold.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Liz Huston said Trump “doesn’t care about being politically correct, he cares about Making America Great Again. The American people love how authentic, transparent, and effective the President is.”\n\nBut for Trump, the words that have generated the most controversy are often less centered in traditional profanity than slurs that can be interpreted as hurtful. The final weeks of his 2016 campaign were rocked when a tape emerged of him discussing grabbing women by their genitals, language he minimized as “locker room talk.” His “shithole” remark in 2018 was widely condemned as racist.\n\nMore recently, Trump called a female journalist “piggy,” comments that his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, defended as evidence of a president who is “very frank and honest.” Trump’s use of a slur about disabled people prompted an Indiana Republican whose child has Down syndrome to come out in opposition to the president’s push to redraw the state’s congressional districts.\n\nOn rare occasions, politicians express contrition for their choice of words. In an interview with The Atlantic published last week, Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., dismissed Harris’ depiction of him in her book about last year’s presidential campaign by saying she was “trying to sell books and cover her a—.”\n\nHe seemed to catch himself quickly.\n\n“I shouldn’t say ‘cover her a—,” he said. “I think that’s not appropriate.”","summary":"Leaders in both parties are openly using vulgarities.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/10/political-profanity/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_30408_08229f-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 16:58:03","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":386881244,"title":"WTF?

Comedian Jerry Seinfeld has talked about this problem, noting that he used swear words in his early routines but dropped them as his career progressed because he felt profanity yielded only cheap laughs.\n\n“I felt like well I just got a laugh because I said f—- in there,” he said in a 2020 interview on the WTF podcast with fellow comedian Marc Maron. “You didn’t find the gold.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Liz Huston said Trump “doesn’t care about being politically correct, he cares about Making America Great Again. The American people love how authentic, transparent, and effective the President is.”\n\nBut for Trump, the words that have generated the most controversy are often less centered in traditional profanity than slurs that can be interpreted as hurtful. The final weeks of his 2016 campaign were rocked when a tape emerged of him discussing grabbing women by their genitals, language he minimized as “locker room talk.” His “shithole” remark in 2018 was widely condemned as racist.\n\nMore recently, Trump called a female journalist “piggy,” comments that his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, defended as evidence of a president who is “very frank and honest.” Trump’s use of a slur about disabled people prompted an Indiana Republican whose child has Down syndrome to come out in opposition to the president’s push to redraw the state’s congressional districts.\n\nOn rare occasions, politicians express contrition for their choice of words. In an interview with The Atlantic published last week, Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., dismissed Harris’ depiction of him in her book about last year’s presidential campaign by saying she was “trying to sell books and cover her a—.”\n\nHe seemed to catch himself quickly.\n\n“I shouldn’t say ‘cover her a—,” he said. “I think that’s not appropriate.”","summary":"Leaders in both parties are openly using vulgarities.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/12/10/political-profanity/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_30408_08229f-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 16:58:03","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":386876588,"title":"‘Taylor Swift Is a Nazi’ Claims Were Spurred by a Coordinated Bot Attack, Study Finds","text":"When Taylor Swift released her twelfth studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” in October, the album sparked record streams as well as an onslaught of criticism. While a portion of the online discourse it provoked was centered around whether or not the album was actually good, a parallel wave of attacks accused Swift and the album of promoting ultra-right-wing ideology.\n\nUsers across platforms claimed that the song “Wi$h Li$t,” in which Swift sings about her only wish being to settle down, was an implicit endorsement of MAGA values, even though the singer had publicly endorsed Trump’s opponent, former vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Some even claimed that a line in the song, in which Swift sings “have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you” in reference to her fiancé, football player Travis Kelce, had white supremacist connotations.\n\nAccounts also claimed that the lines “I’m not a bad bitch, and this isn’t savage” in the song “Eldest Daughter” and “sleepless in the onyx night, but now, the sky is opalite” from the song “Opalite” were racist digs at Kelce’s ex-girlfriend, who is black.\n\nOther posts even claimed that a necklace merch with lightning bolts on it was actually a Nazi dog-whistle for vaguely resembling “SS.”\n\nNow, according to new research from behavioral intelligence startup GUDEA, at least a good chunk of these online attacks were spurred by inauthentic social media accounts in what looks to be a coordinated attack on Swift’s reputation.\n\nGUDEA examined thousands of posts from 18,000 accounts across 14 social media platforms made in the first two weeks following the album’s release, to find that the “Taylor Swift is a Nazi” narrative was spurred by accounts that behaved like bots. The inauthentic narrative acted as a catalyst for authentic conversations, like one comparing Swift to self-proclaimed Nazi Kanye West.\n\nSurprisingly, though, it was the Swifties that inadvertently ensured that the attacks reached their intended impact. These false narratives were basically “rage bait” designed to provoke real users and strengthen the narrative’s visibility. So ultimately, it was established accounts and influencers that took the false narrative from the confines of the fringe corners of the internet to the mainstream conversation. Every time a fan interacted with the false claims to refute them, it only fed the narrative for the algorithm.\n\n“This demonstrates how a strategically seeded falsehood can convert into widespread authentic discourse, reshaping public perception even when most users do not believe the originating claim,” the researchers wrote, adding that the pattern is “a hallmark of successful narrative manipulation.”\n\nIt’s not clear who orchestrated the bot attacks or what they could be gaining from this. But the researchers did find significant overlap between the accounts that pushed the narrative and accounts involved in a reputational attack campaign on actress Blake Lively, who is in the middle of a sexual harassment and online smear campaign lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni.\n\nGUDEA’s head of customer success, Georgia Paul, told Rolling Stone that the culprits could also be nefarious actors asking themselves, “If I can move the fan base for Taylor Swift —an icon who is this political figure, in a way— does that mean I can do it in other places?”\n\nUltimately, what the incident highlights is just how scarily close our new digital reality has come to the “dead internet theory.” Bots are flooding all corners of the web, and they are actively shaping our own experience of it.\n\nAccording to Cloudflare data, roughly 30% of all internet traffic is now bots. GUDEA founder and CEO Keith Presley’s estimate is even higher at 50%.\n\n“The internet is fake,” Presley told Rolling Stone on Tuesday.","summary":"Bots manipulated online discourse to convince people that Taylor Swift was MAGA.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/taylor-swift-is-a-nazi-claims-were-spurred-by-a-coordinated-bot-attack-study-finds-2000697793","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2673688277-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 16:30:06","author":"Ece Yildirim","authors":["Ece Yildirim"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":386875232,"title":"End Stage of Grief: Democrats Might Be Settling for the Best of the Worst","text":"The two biggest names in Democratic Party presidential circles are being swished around again, and while probably and arguably also the most laughable, the fact remains it's all they seem to have at the moment.\n\nThis fawning little number was in Democrat and decent guy Dan Turrentine's X feed yesterday.\n\nHe didn't write it, but did note that it confirmed things he'd been told earlier about the subject - Kamala Harris can't shake her aspirations to the throne.\n\nI have said it since late Spring, when I heard from two birdies in her orbit: @KamalaHarris badly wants to run again in 2028. https://t.co/gR7dlePc9N— dan turrentine (@danturrentine) December 9, 2025\n\nIt's really a love letter wrapped in news article camouflage.\n\nThere are gentle criticisms offset by the strangest affirmative adjective choices, and it is dripping with pathos. \n\n...But it has been a year since her loss to President Trump, the traditional period of mourning.Friends and allies swear she is more relaxed now. .On a recent long-form podcast, the likes of which she got so much heat for avoiding last year, Ms. Harris let fly a two-word phrase — rhyming with “bucket” — to describe her new ethos. . She is the first woman to serve as vice president, and., and she still defaults to acting as if every question is part of a deposition where answers can and will be used against her.\n\nUNLEASHED! LAWYERLY LANGUAGE REMAINS HER SAFE SPACE\n\nI guess that's how toney, lickspittle NYT reporters describe what we knuckle-draggers commonly called Kamala's 'word salad.'\n\nThey then thoughtfully provide an example of the former vice president's lawyerly language.\n\n...She has mostly been a bystander in the Democratic Party’s raging debate over its direction. Should Democrats veer to the left or center? More populism? More progressivism? Both? Neither? What exactly should the party stand for?\n\nGracious. That was deep.\n\nDeep but truly authentic Kamala word salad - yup.\n\nHarris is thrilled people are paying good money to line up and hear her word salads on this tour, and the Times points out only one other Democrat has had the drawing power in national tours that Harris enjoys - Bernie Sanders.\n\n She believes there should be a bust of her in Congress.\n\n...Ms. Harris has made clear she doesn’t “feel burdened” — yes, she still uses that phrase — by where she fits in the punditry pecking order or the polls or the cable chyrons. She is enjoying the freedom from what she calls the “transactional” constrictions of campaigning, of asking people for a vote.Her place in history is already secure, and she knows it.“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” she said in the interview. “\n\nHer sense of her own place in history is so secure that Harris even called the newly elected mayor of New York to advise him on how to fill his team and be an effective executive, having been so effective herself at every opportunity.\n\n.“,” she said of Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, praising the excitement he has generated from younger voters.\n\nThe NYT authors don't point out that pinning down what exactly Harris's 'ideology' is is difficult thanks to her utter vacuousness and vapidity.\n\nAgain, they redefine Harris's space-cadet-like delivery and vagueness as 'elusive.' Isn't that a much prettier word?\n\nDamn near makes a questionable intellect mysterious instead of laughable.\n\nIn public and in private, she has been exploring issues of trust, misinformation, social media, community and artificial intelligence. She is particularly obsessed with young people and their growing disillusionment, which she shares.“,” she told Stephen Colbert in her first interview about her book. “”\n\nI believe Kamala Harris owes a portion of the $7M she made selling her email list to the DNC to these two reporters for the tongue bath.\n\nIs the country ready for a run at Word Salad Redux? You'll note I'm not asking if we want one - we won't have much choice if Democrats don't have much choice.\n\nStu Burguiere, discussing the article with Megyn Kelly - who howls over the 'historic' figure conceit - contrasts Harris's style (lawyerly, don't forget) with Jasmine Crocker, who blurts out every word the second it pops into her head.\n\nHarris, he says, is trying to do the exact opposite, just 'trying to survive, because she's not quick enough on her feet to come up with a real answer.'\n\nFor the moment, Harris is playing coy Hillary Clinton word games, and having surrogates make sure they use the terms 'white boys.'\n\n...Black voters, particularly in the South, have swung the party’s last two open presidential nominating contests. Ms. Harris has made a point of traveling through the South on her book tour. Her stop in Birmingham, Ala., was so popular that the venue added a second event.“” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator who has been an informal Harris adviser, referring to the governors of Pennsylvania and California and to Mr. Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary. “She is so important to so many people.”At the Ryman, \n\nGavin Newsom's name does pop up towards the end of the article.\n\nA 'very talented' California rival\n\nThat has to sting a smidge as does the recounting of the Newsom anecdote from Harris' book, where she'd called to ask for his endorsement and got a 'Hiking. Will call back' text. She says she never heard from him again, even though Newsom did quickly endorse her.\n\nWhy so catty in the book, then - Newsom wanted to know, too. So he says he asked her.\n\n...Mr. Newsom has questioned why the episode was included, given that he endorsed her so quickly. He texted Ms. Harris to ask her this after her book came out, he recounted recently to a video game streamer.“Anyway,” Mr. Newsom said with a laugh, “that’s the relationship.”\n\nThe love letter to the Word Salad Queen ends as love letters do - with a swoon over Harris' heroics.\n\nThe authors recount Harris's visit to Tennessee to support young legislators there who were being censured for disrupting the session with their antics while encouraging protestors storming the Capitol.\n\n....Ms. Harris, however, has a correction to that timeline.\n\nCan't you hear that in your head in that nasal delivery of hers?\n\n600K copies of her book have been sold, and venues have been packed for her appearances. This has to be tickling the ambitious fantasies of her 'very talented' California rival, who, coincidentally, has announced the release of a no doubt riveting memoir of his own next year.\n\nWhat a novel approach.\n\nAnd who, somehow, is enjoying an inexplicable tick-up in popularity at the moment that defies reality on the ground.\n\n amid rumors he could run for the Democratic nomination in 2028.The governor’s willingness to battle the president has made his popularity soar, with a new poll finding that Newsom’s overall approval rating is now at 56%, a 10% jump since June. Among Democrats in California, his approval rating is 82%., fueling new speculation about a 2028 presidential run.\n\nAnd Gavin Newsom promises pathos, having been born the poor child of black sharecroppers...or something close.\n\n...“” Newsom said in the announcement.The book release comes as Newsom is seeing a bump in approval after his attacks on Trump on social media, his forceful pushback against immigration raids and his successful November campaign for Prop 50, which allowed redistricting in California to counter Republican redistricting in other states.\n\nJust another proof point @GavinNewsom had the best 2025 of the 2028ers.

Anything Harris was ever 'in charge of,' even as Attorney General, had other people doing the work for her (they never did find any trial transcripts where she was the lead attorney, I don't believe).

Jasmine Crockett on Tuesday for previously saying that Latinos who voted for President Donald Trump have “slave mentality.”\n\nCrockett said in a Vanity Fair profile in December 2024 that this group of Latinos have a “slave mentality” and must hate themselves since Trump wants to deport illegal immigrants. During an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Crockett denied saying they all have “slave mentality” and argued most of them likely do not support what Trump is doing.\n\n“‘The immigration thing has always been something that has perplexed me about this community … It almost reminds me of what people would talk about when they would talk about kind of like slave mentality and the hate that some slaves would have for themselves. It’s almost like a slave mentality that they have. Now about the time that that was published last year, around a million Latino voters in Texas were voting for Trump,'” Crockett told Vanity Fair. (RELATED: Jasmine Crockett’s Senate Campaign Going As Well As You’d Expect)\n\nAfter reading the quote, Tapper pointed out that a record-high number of Latinos voted for Trump.\n\n“Now about the time that that was published last year, around a million Latino voters in Texas were voting for Trump. Do they all have slave mentality?” Tapper asked. \n\n“No, and that’s not what that said at all, to be clear. It did not say that every Latino has that type of mentality,” Crockett said. “No, no, but slave, the ones that vote for people who believe in strong or Trump’s immigration policy. So, so I don’t believe that the people that voted for Trump believe in what they’re actually getting.” \n\nTrump achieved the highest share of the Latino vote ever recorded for a Republican nominee, winning approximately 46% to 48% in the 2024 election. He won the Latino male vote 54% to 44% against former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to an NBC News exit poll.\n\nCrockett launched her Senate campaign on Monday and claimed she can flip Texas blue. The congresswoman will attempt to unseat Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is running for reelection.\n\nThe senator-hopeful also stated on CNN that she does not need Trump voters to win the Senate seat.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The CBS Mornings co-host is now boarding CBS Evening News as the program's new anchor, the network announced on Wednesday, Dec. 10.\n\n Dokoupil, 44, will anchor his first broadcast on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 amid one of the first major lineup changes under editor-in-chief Bari Weiss. The TV journalist has co-hosted CBS Mornings alongside Gayle King and Nate Burleson since 2019 after joining CBS News in 2016.\n\n “After 20 years in journalism, traveling through all 50 states and talking with people in hundreds of far-flung American places, I realize why a country this big needs a show this ambitious,” Dokoupil said in a statement.\n\n He added, “The strength of our nation is that we benefit from fair reporting and the open discussion of all ideas. For more than 60 years, the Evening News has been a bedrock of that process. I’m honored to join a fearless team at this important moment, and with what I can promise is a commitment to trust and the plain truth.”\n\n CBS Mornings also shared the news on Wednesday, with Dokoupil telling King, 70, Burleson, 44, and Vladimir Duthiers that it’s “an amazing thing to say.” He added, “It’s been almost seven years that we’ve been doing this together and I am not joking that this has been the best job I have ever had in journalism. If things didn’t change around us, I would never change this.”\n\n “Until next year!” King quipped in response. She also noted that their co-host will remain on the program for the rest of the week.\n\n In her own statement shared by CBS News, Weiss, 41, called the new anchor \"the person to win\" back viewers' \"trust in the media,\" citing his \"old-school journalistic values.\" Saying that Dokoupil \"is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor,\" CBS News president Tom Cibrowski added that he was \"authentic, compassionate [and] unafraid.\"\n\n The hire makes Dokoupil the sixth anchor of the broadcast in the last decade, following Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor, Norah O’Donnell, John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who announced his CBS Morning News exit on Thursday, Dec. 4 less than a year after taking over with Dickerson, 57. Dickerson announced his exit from CBS in October after 16 years.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n It was also announced that Matt Gutman has been named CBS News chief correspondent, with the former ABC News journalist set to start on the same days as Dokoupil.\n\n Gutman, 48, will report for CBS Mornings and CBS Evening News, where he will serve as a fill-in anchor for the broadcast. Additionally, he will also serve as a lead correspondent for 48 Hours and is slated to contribute to 60 Minutes. \n\n The staffing switch-up comes amid several changes at CBS News following Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, CBS' parent company. The merger came after CBS News settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump, who accused 60 Minutes of deceptively editing former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign trail appearance on the show.\n\n Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to the president's future presidential library. Initially, the lawsuit sought $10 billion in damages, and led to concerns over the precedent Paramount would set for media companies by giving into Trump's demands.\n\n Also in October, Weiss, best known for running the opinion website The Free Press, was named editor in chief of CBS News, despite having no experience running a news organization the size of CBS.\n\n “Tony’s superpower is listening to people. We want to serve Americans in the best way possible by meeting them where they are every night — and we’ll do that with this cross-country kick-off tour,” CBS Evening News executive producer Kim Harvey said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n She added, “Tony knows what makes this country great and what challenges we face. I look forward to partnering with him to share America’s story every night.”\n\n During his tenure at CBS News, Dokoupil has interviewed the likes of JD Vance, Bill Gates, Harry Styles, Hillary Clinton and more.","summary":"Dokoupil will replace co-anchors Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson, who announced their departures earlier this year","url":"https://people.com/tony-dokoupil-named-new-anchor-of-cbs-evening-news-11865789","image":"https://people.com/thmb/fZM6Q1YqxLMadTO9MF-yZh3Z9kk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/tony-dokoupil-cbs-mornings-121025-f0c7d79df5ac421e92dfddb74061d387.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 15:20:10","author":"Brenton Blanchet,Dave Quinn","authors":["Brenton Blanchet","Dave Quinn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":386852780,"title":"Shocking update on student loan repayments weeks after Trump announced plans to cancel debt for millions","text":"Featured Image Credit: Mandel NGAN - Pool/Getty Images\nTopics: Donald Trump, Education, Joe Biden, US News, Money, Politics, Republicans\n\nCallum Jones\n\nChoose your content:\n\nan hour ago\n\nan hour ago\n\nPerson who called police on Bonnie Blue reveals why they did it as she now faces 15 years in prison\n\nBonnie Blue was raided by police after they got a tip\n\nan hour ago\n\nWhere to stream 95% rated drama series starring Knives Out actor as Wake Up Dead Man arrives in days\n\nViewers binged the series in a matter of hours\n\nan hour ago\n\nExpert warns that people should be wary of these 3 things if Trump's $2,000 tariff checks are actually approved\n\nThe president hopes that Americans will get the checks sometime next year\n\nan hour ago\n\nThe Rock's daughter 'hard launches' relationship with fellow wrestler in intimate social media post\n\nSimone Johnson admitted that she's fallen in love\n\nUniversity student president speaks out after being forced to resign over controversial comments about Barron Trump\n\nTrump blasts 'traitor' Marjorie Taylor Greene in scathing rant after explosive 60 Minutes interview\n\nTrump 'voids' Biden's last minute pardons after claim ex president made one crucial mistake when doing them\n\nKamala Harris blasts Trump administration after revealing surprising comment he made to her in private","summary":"![CDATA[The Trump administration claim Joe Biden 'sought to unlawfully shift student loan debt onto American taxpayers']]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-student-loan-update-884778-20251210","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltd1744612c23f4c0b/69398118ed85de817c7d34f0/trump-debt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 15:02:19","author":"Callum Jones","authors":["Callum Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":386875222,"title":"Too Good to Check: Did the NRSC Deke Dems Into Clearing the Field For Crockett?","text":"Let me start with a disclaimer: I do not for one second believe this rumor to be true. It's not that the strategy would be bad; it's that it's too good for the GOP to pull off. Think Todd Akin, only in California or Massachusetts. \n\nUnless Claire McCaskill has switched sides and now does strategy for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), color me skeptical about this report from NOTUS. Deeply skeptical:\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a poll in July with Crockett’s name included, which showed her as the leading Democrat in a hypothetical matchup.“When we saw the results, we were like, ‘OK, we got to disseminate this far and wide,’” a source familiar with the process told NOTUS. The fact that Crockett was included in the poll was no accident.In June news broke that Texas Democrats Colin Allred, James Talarico, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro met to discuss the 2026 election. Operatives at the NRSC realized that Crockett — whose political stock had been rising — wasn’t included in that meeting and also hadn’t been included in any credible poll. So they decided to change that.Following the NRSC’s polls, other surveys began to include Crockett and showed similar results: She was surging in the primary.\n\nAccording to their sources at the NRSC, the manipulation didn't end there. The NRSC then started \"seeding\" the poll results into \"progressive spaces,\" which not only raised Rep. Jasmine Crockett's profile but also apparently convinced Crockett herself that she could win the election. That snowballed into this week, when a candidate that might have competed well enough to make Republicans nervous after their own bruising primary – Colin Allred – decided to withdraw in Crockett's favor.\n\nOr so these NRSC sources claim. \n\nIs this true? Is it even possible? Well, McCaskill certainly proved it possible in 2012, but this situation is a little different. Akin was less of a national figure at the time than Crockett is now, which means that Crockett's radical nature is already well known. (Akin's issue was more a lack of preparation for the big step up to the scrutiny a Senate race produces.) Crockett had already become a popular leading figure among progressive activists. Perhaps the NRSC kicked a stone or two to start an avalanche, but some of the rocks had been shifting for the last couple of years. \n\nAlso, the panic suggested by NOTUS and other media outlets over the upcoming GOP primary fight may be overblown. Without a doubt, John Cornyn faces the fight of his life against Ken Paxton, a MAGA favorite. RCP has aggregated three polls in this race, and all three show a dead heat between the two, with former House Republican Wesley Hunt suddenly getting a significant amount of support, too. However, the primary will take place in March, which leaves the Texas GOP plenty of time to heal up any divisions that will open up over the next three months before the voting starts in the general election. \n\nDonald Trump beat Kamala Harris by 14 points last November. Ted Cruz beat Allred by nine points in 2022. The Senate race will not be a special election; Texans will be prepared to turn out and will still be decisively Republican, not suddenly blue. This isn't a case where a purple state could produce surprises, and the Lone Star State certainly isn't the Big Apple, even if Crockett seems confused by the difference:\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, pointed to Mamdani-Trump voters, AOC-Trump voters and Obama-Trump voters when confronted Tuesday on her difficult path to victory in the Texas Senate race.MS NOW host Chris Hayes asked Crockett about people who question her ability to win the \"8 to 10% of Republican voters necessary to win this race,\" who cited the voters who supported both President Donald Trump and Democrats like Zohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former President Barack Obama.Crocket, who launched her Texas Senate bid on Monday, disagreed with the notion that she needs to win over a percentage of Republican voters and said she hoped to energize her base in a way Democratic candidates have failed to do in the past.\"I don’t think anyone who is super in love with Trump would ever vote for me or any other Democrat. That is just the reality. I think what it is, is who is going to talk to people and make them understand that they will fight for them. That is why you have Mamdani-Trump voters. That is why you have AOC-Trump voters. That is why you had Obama-Trump voters,\" she told Hayes.\n\nEr ... AOC-Trump voters? Ocasio-Cortez won her NY-14 seat last year by 69.2/30.8. Kamala Harris won that district by a 65/33 split. If there were any AOC-Trump votes, you could probably cast those on your fingers and toes. The slight difference in percentage may be largely accounted for by voters who declined to mark their ballots in one election or the other. Even if one assumes that the difference is entirely attributable to voters who chose both AOC and Trump, though, that would be voters in a very, very radical-Left district. The notable point about those votes wouldn't be MAGAs who voted for AOC, but Democrats who couldn't stomach Harris. \n\nAnyway, I hope I'm wrong about the NRSC, and that they have truly learned to play McCaskill's game at Machiavellian levels. I'm more inclined to think they got lucky that Democrats decided to get stupid. Frankly, I'll take either explanation. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

Former county commissioner Eileen Higgins won Tuesday’s runoff election, a closely watched race that drew attention from national political figures, including President Donald Trump.\n\nUnofficial results from Miami-Dade County show Higgins winning 59% of the vote, according to The Washington Post. She defeated Emilio González, a former Miami city manager, who received nearly 41%.\n\nIn a victory statement, Higgins said: “Tonight, the people of Miami made history. Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city — one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people.” \n\nFederal backing\n\nThough Miami’s mayoral election is technically nonpartisan, it drew attention from big-name politicians.\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg offered support for Higgins. While Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis backed González, with the president saying he’s “fantastic” and calling the election an “important race.”\n\nSignificance of the race\n\nWith Higgins’ victory, she becomes not only the first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades, but she’s also the first woman mayor in the history of Miami and the first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s. \n\nHer victory represents a shift in South Florida politics. Democrats have seen a string of competitive showings this year, including close contests in traditionally Republican districts. Still, strategists from both parties cautioned against reading the Miami results as a sign that nearby congressional seats are likely to flip in 2026.\n\nPolitics in Miami\n\nMiami’s recent political trajectory has leaned increasingly Republican. In 2024, Kamala Harris narrowly defeated Trump in Miami, a steep drop from Joe Biden’s 19-point margin in 2020.\n\nRepublicans DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio won decisively in Miami-Dade in 2022, breaking a longtime Democratic stronghold.\n\nIn 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate in 36 years to win Miami-Dade County. The president is now planning to build his presidential library in Miami. \n\nHiggins’ victory interrupts that trend — at least at the local level — returning the mayor’s office to Democratic control for the first time since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe post Miami elects its first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/12/10/miami-elects-its-first-democratic-mayor-in-nearly-30-years/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25344035489895_Lynne_Sladky__The_Associated_Press_clean-daUl2i.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 14:14:40","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":386861028,"title":"Mark Kelly Says He’s “Been Through Harder Things” Than Pete Hegseth’s Attacks","text":"Raised in northern New Jersey, Kelly has for 17 years lived in Arizona, the state he now represents as a Democratic US senator. In between, Kelly was an astronaut who made four trips into space and a Navy pilot who flew 39 combat missions over Iraq. That military background has now put Kelly into Trump’s crosshairs. Last month, as the president gleefully cheered on the bombing of boats allegedly running drugs from Venezuela, Kelly appeared in a video to remind US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.\nTrump was furious. He called for the Democrats to be jailed and railed that the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\nThe idea for the message had originated with Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, and the video included four other members of Congress who served in the military or in US intelligence agencies. But Kelly has become the prime target for retribution because he retired as a Navy captain—and could be recalled to active duty and punished. Hegseth announced he was launching a probe into Kelly to determine whether Kelly had violated military law, with the results due December 10—even though in 2016, Hegseth publicly made essentially the same point about refusing illegal orders.\nThe 61-year-old Kelly is unfazed, even though he has been besieged by graphic death threats ever since Trump’s attack and has hired private security guards for his own protection. “He is not intimidating me, and he’s not going to,” Kelly says. “I have been through, you know, harder things than this.” Chief among them is the assassination attempt that led to Kelly running for office in the first place: In 2011 his wife, Arizona Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot in the back of the head during a constituent meeting, violence that erupted amid escalating political rhetoric.\n“I sat next to my wife’s hospital bed for months, without any idea of how it was gonna turn out,” Kelly says. “Most people don’t survive that kind of wound.” Giffords barely did. In 2020, he ran in, and won, a special election squeaker to fill the remainder of the late John McCain’s Senate term. Kelly was elected again, to a full term, in 2022.\nThe primary audience for the video, Kelly insists, is the enlisted men and women who are on the front lines of Trump’s belligerent agenda, and who could be vulnerable to prosecution for war crimes. “They’re going to be under tremendous pressure to do something they will later regret, that they might find was not lawful,” Kelly says. And while the action is in the Caribbean Sea right now, the senator is concerned it could shift into American cities. “[Trump] talks about sending the military to train on US citizens, and people think, ‘Oh, well, he’s not going to do it. It’s just Trump being Trump.’ That’s how we got here,” Kelly says. “We know who Donald Trump is, right? We knew who he was even when he was running for office the first time. This is a guy who talked about killing—killing—women and children. He said we should have the military kill the family members of terrorists. You know, you can't put that shit back in the donkey.”\nWhich is one reason the video statement by Kelly and his colleagues has resonance beyond any literal battlefields. For decades, conventional wisdom ceded national security, as a political issue, to the Republicans. But that’s been slowly changing. Recent, prominent examples include wins last month for Democrats Mikie Sherrill (a former Navy officer) and Abigail Spanberger (a former CIA officer) in gubernatorial races (in New Jersey and Virginia). Democrats are recruiting more veterans to run elsewhere as part of an appeal beyond the coastal elites. “Voters trust veterans,” says Matt Corridoni, a Democratic strategist who has worked with vet candidates. “They're not afraid to go out there and reclaim patriotism and reclaim the flag, and they do it with a level of authenticity and credibility that your standard politician doesn't have.”\nLast year, Kelly was one of three finalists—along with Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota governor Tim Walz—in Kamala Harris’s search for a running mate. “That would have been fun,” Kelly says now. “I think the election would probably have had the same outcome, unfortunately.” Currently, Kelly barely shows up in polling about the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination—but it’s still early. “I like that Kelly is out there and he’s not just taking it from the president,” says Rebecca Pearcey, who was a top strategist for Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 primary bid. “He’s fighting back when Democrats have lost some energy because it’s so exhausting.”\n“He’s got a weighty and appealing resume, and the field is going to be wide open,” another veteran Democratic presidential campaign strategist stays. “Why wouldn’t he take a shot?”\nWhen I tell Kelly that a friend suspects he’s already running—because she receives more fundraising emails from him than anyone else—the senator laughs. “I’m not the lead fundraiser. I hire people to figure that stuff out for me,” he says. “I’ve got a lot on my plate right now. Apparently tomorrow the Navy is supposed to say something about my court martial.” He lets out another, tighter laugh. “Trump is not gonna scare me,” Kelly says. “He's a wannabe authoritarian, and we've gotta make sure he doesn't get there.”","summary":"In an interview, the Arizona senator says the defense secretary “is not intimidating me, and he’s not going to”—though he’s less forthcoming about a potential 2028 presidential run.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/mark-kelly-pete-hegseth-investigation-interview","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/693976b9a348c67d922bd563/16:9/w_3360,h_1890,c_limit/2167175727","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 13:36:17","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":386844632,"title":"Harris says she remains confident in her legacy as &#8216;historical figure&#8217;","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president in 2024, said she has reached a point in her public life where she no longer feels pressured to secure her place in history.

Pope Leo would be good for selling magazines (new popes in the past have outperformed on that front). And Mamdani would certainly appease Time’s readership, which is profoundly liberal at this point. \n\nBut it’s also obvious that President Donald Trump should always be a top consideration every year as long as he’s president, given the award is about who has had the strongest impact on history or who represented the year most, according to Time’s own criteria. Given how impactful the first year of Trump’s second term has been, it is an easy case to make: He essentially closed the border, is carrying out mass deportations, ignited a tariff war resulting in better trade deals for the United States, and made his tax cuts permanent. Gas prices are at four-year lows, Iran’s nuclear capabilities have been decimated, and the peace deal in Gaza is holding. That’s a strong impact on history. \n\nAll of that said, the late Charlie Kirk is the best choice for this award posthumously. His assassination was the first major political assassination in this country since the 1960s. The Turning Point USA movement, which Kirk began at age 18, has resulted in millions of followers. And his death, leaving a wife and two very young children behind, has spurred more than 120,000 new Turning Point USA chapter requests across the country. \n\nBack to impact. Kirk has been the most googled name of the year, even surpassing Trump, who rightly won the award in 2024 for winning back a presidency few thought he could following the 2020 election. Per Fox News, “faith leaders report a 15% rise in church attendance as young people inspired by Charlie Kirk turn to Christianity.” Bible sales have also skyrocketed, with a reported 36% increase after Kirk’s death in September, when compared to the same time one year ago. “Get married. Have children. Build a legacy. Pass down your values. Pursue the eternal. Seek true joy,” Kirk often preached. And his followers appear to share the same values. Per a recent NBC News poll among those aged 18 to 29, young men who voted for Trump list having children as being most important to their personal definition of success. Also among the top 10 are being married, being spiritually grounded, making family and community proud, and using talents and resources to help others. \n\nHowever, among women who voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, having a fulfilling job/career is listed as most important at 51%, with having money to do things you want as second at 46%. You have to go all the way down to 9th on the list to find being grounded spiritually, and 11th to find being married as a top priority (just 6%), which is tied with having children. \n\nRecent census data backs up this sentiment from women on the Left, which shows that the number of children per family is falling to below two (1.9) for the first time. And a study released by Morgan Stanley shows that nearly half the female population aged 25 to 44 will be single and childless in this country by 2030. \n\n“Having children is more important than having a good career. … My kids matter more than how many social media followers I have,” Kirk told Fox’s Laura Ingraham earlier this year. But contrast that with what possible Democratic presidential nominee Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has said about having children, or in this case, not having children. \n\n“Our planet is going to hit disaster if we don’t turn this ship around, and so it’s basically like, there’s a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live video in 2019 while chopping food in her kitchen. “And it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question, you know, ‘Is it OK to still have children?’”`\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who has been engaged for more than three years and has no children, would go on to predict that “the world will end” by 2031 if trillions aren’t spent to address climate change. Given her massive social media following, it appears more than a few of her supporters are actually taking this ridiculous warning seriously. \n\nHarris, who also has no biological children of her own, latched onto this sentiment during her recent book tour. Young adults are “experiencing what they’ve coined ‘climate anxiety’, which is their fear that because of changes in extreme weather, the future of their lives is very much at stake,” she stated. \n\nIn a related story, her presidential campaign spent more than $12 million on private jets during its 107-day campaign last year. \n\nWithout family, as Kirk often stressed, society crumbles. You can’t pass along wisdom to a younger generation if that generation doesn’t exist. The joy of family is replaced by doom scrolling through social media to fill the hours. And the association between being single past the average marriage age and depression is very real, with the National Institutes of Health studies showing clear links to suicidal ideation and mood disorders. \n\nThe most important institution in society is the family. If we lose the family, we lose everything,” Kirk once declared. And more than his political beliefs or support of Trump, his preaching of family and faith will be his most lasting legacy and therefore should absolutely warrant Time’s attention, but it undoubtedly won’t due to the magazine’s unabashed liberal bent. \n\nOver the years, the magazine has made some truly ludicrous choices in this regard. In 1988, the choice was “The Endangered Earth.” \n\n“Now, more than ever, the world needs leaders who can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission, not a nationalistic or military campaign, but a universal crusade to save the planet,” Time said back then. Thirty-seven years later, Earth appears to be doing just fine. \n\nGreta Thunberg was also Time’s person of the year in 2019, in the same vein, at just 16 years old. \n\n“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth!” she said in 2019 to the United Nations General Assembly. “How dare you!” \n\nHow’s that mass extinction coming along, Greta? Six years later, she has ditched being a climate alarmist and instead is focusing on the “genocide” in Gaza. \n\nThe following year, Time broke its own rule of choosing a singular person or entity in selecting both Joe Biden and Harris to be politically correct. In past years, when selecting newly elected presidents from Kennedy to Nixon to Carter to Reagan to Papa Bush to Clinton to Bush 43 to Obama to Trump, never once was the vice president also included. Go figure. \n\nTime magazine is a shell of what it once was. Person of the year used to carry some serious weight, and perhaps it still does on the Left. \n\nOCT. 7TH COMMUNITIES: STILL MOURNING BUT BEGINNING TO REBUILD\n\nBut any objective person with no skin in the game would be hard-pressed to find an argument not to choose Kirk. \n\nBut this award is more about politics and business than anything else, much like the rest of legacy media these days.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

I inherited a total mess. Prices were at an all-time high when I came in.”\n\nHe also told Politico: “If you think of gasoline a gallon, they had it at $4.50, almost $5.00. You go to some of the states, you had it at $6.00. We hit, uh, three states two days ago, $1.99 a gallon.”\n\nPhiladelphia-based nonprofit Factcheck.org wrote in January this year that while inflation did rise under Biden, Trump did not, in fact, inherit the “worst inflation” in history.\n\nThe annualised inflation rate was below 3 percent during the six months before Trump took office in his second term.\n\nThe organisation explained the rise in inflation under Biden was partly down to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to Factcheck.org, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose from 5.4 percent to 9.1 percent in the 12-month period ending in June 2022. But this was far from the worst the US has experienced. That was in the aftermath of World War I, when inflation hit 23.7 percent in June 1920.\n\nIn March 1980, inflation hit 14.8 percent, marking one of the most severe spikes in consumer prices in modern US history.\n\nTrump’s statements about petrol prices are also slightly misleading.\n\nIn the US, the average price of petrol – called “gas” in the US – was $3.05 per gallon (3.8 litres) in November this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to online marketplace Choose Energy, the cost per gallon ranged from $2.41 in Oklahoma to $4.53 in California as of December 3.\n\nThe $1.99 price cited by Trump applies to isolated low-price stations in certain states and does not reflect a general statewide average.\n\nClaim: Ilhan Omar is in the US illegally\n\nDuring the Pennsylvania rally, Trump launched an attack on Ilhan Omar, the Democrat who has served as a Minnesota representative in Congress since 2019.\n\nWhile bemoaning immigration to the US by people from Somalia and other countries, he claimed that Omar is in the US illegally.\n\n“I love this Ilhan Omar, whatever the hell her name is. With her little turban. I love her. She comes in, does nothing but bitch. She’s always complaining. She comes from her country, where, I mean, it’s considered about the worst country in the world,” Trump said to a crowd of supporters, who roared with applause.\n\n“We gotta get her the hell out,” he said. “She married her brother in order to get in, right … she married her brother to get in, therefore she’s here illegally.”\n\nThe crowd of supporters at the rally started chanting “Send her back!”\n\nTrump also claimed that Somalia has no military, parliament or police. “They police themselves, they kill each other all the time.”\n\nFirst, Somalia does have a military, a parliament and a police force.\n\nWhile Omar was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in 1982, her family fled the Somali Civil War and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before seeking asylum in the US in 1995, when she was 12.\n\nOnce asylum is granted – as it was to Omar’s family – the US Refugee Admissions Program grants lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to refugees, who can then apply for citizenship five years later.\n\nOmar became eligible for citizenship five years after she entered the US, and finally became a citizen in 2000, when she was 17 years old.\n\nDoubts about Omar’s legal status in the US and claims that she married her brother have circulated among the US right wing since 2018, shortly before she was elected to Congress. In 2018, Omar dismissed these claims as “disgusting lies” in a statement to The Associated Press (AP). She provided AP with detailed marriage and divorce records.\n\nIlhan Omar first married Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi in 2002 in a Muslim faith ceremony, had two children, and later separated. In 2009, she married British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in a civil marriage, separating in 2011; she reunited with Hirsi in 2012, and after legally divorcing Elmi in 2017, remarried Hirsi legally in 2018.\n\nThere is no verifiable evidence to back up allegations that either Hirsi or Elmi is Omar’s brother. She has strongly denied these allegations.\n\nClaim: The Venezuela boat strikes save 25,000 American lives each time\n\nDuring Trump’s Politico interview, he repeated the claim that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro “sends in a lot of drugs” to the US.\n\nSince September, US military strikes on at least 21 Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed more than 80 people.\n\nIn September, a top US Navy commander ordered a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, despite almost completely destroying it in the first attack. According to witnesses, there were only two survivors clinging to debris in the water after the first strike, and both were killed in the second.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about that second strike, he said: “It looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don’t get involved in that. That’s up to them. Uh, the admiral that did is a highly respected man. And we save 25,000 people every time we knock out a boat.”\n\nDuring the rally in Pennsylvania, Trump again made the claim that for every US strike on alleged Venezuelan drug boats, “we save 25,000 American lives”.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided any evidence that strikes on Venezuelan boats each save 25,000 American lives by preventing drug trafficking into the US. Indeed, it has not provided evidence that any of the boats it has struck were carrying drugs or were affiliated with drug cartels, as it claims.\n\nFurthermore, there is little evidence that drugs are trafficked from Venezuela on a large scale. The 2023 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug Report said global cocaine production had hit a record 3,708 tonnes, up nearly one‑third from 2022, with most coca cultivation taking place in Colombia, followed by Peru and Bolivia.\n\nTrafficking routes into the US in 2023-2024 primarily passed through Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, not Venezuela, although it does serve as a minor transit corridor for Colombian cocaine moving into the eastern Caribbean.\n\nThe dominant US-bound maritime route remains through the eastern Pacific, then into Mexico and Central America, where most large seizures occur before drugs can pass overland into the US. The US Drug Enforcement Administration’s own 2024 report similarly identified Colombia as the source for about 84 percent of cocaine seized in the US, and made no mention of Venezuela.\n\nClaims about transgender people and Black people\n\nDuring the Pennsylvania rally, Trump claimed the Democrats want “transgender for every member in your family”.\n\nHe added: “If they’re not feeling well that night, let’s just change their sex.”\n\nTrump also said: “Black people love Trump.

In October, CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was putting itself up for sale. It previously said it was going to split into two companies — one for the studio and HBO, the other being the cable networks currently within the corporate umbrella. Before Netflix emerged last week as the victor of the bidding war, it had seemed that Paramount owner David Ellison was in the driver's seat, only to be off-roaded by the streaming giant on Friday with its nearly $83 billion offer. On Monday, Paramount launched a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable assets like CNN. \"I think there is a very small contingent who wants Paramount... most do not,\" one CNN staffer told Fox News Digital. PARAMOUNT LAUNCHES HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID OF WARNER BROS DISCOVERY, SAYS OFFER IS ‘SUPERIOR’ TO NETFLIX DEAL Leading up to the corporate drama that has unfolded in recent days, CNN's rank and file were not exactly leaping for joy about the prospects of Ellison becoming their new boss. \"I don’t think most like it because they fear him meddling,\" the CNN staffer said of Ellison. A second CNN staffer noted the \"grim\" mood within the newsroom regarding Ellison. \"They see CBS as a complete and utter s--- show, which it was before this to be honest,\" the CNN staffer told Fox News Digital, while conceding \"our organization is also in chaos and crisis.\" TRUMP WARNS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL COULD BE A PROBLEM, SAYS HE'LL BE ‘INVOLVED’ IN DECISION In August, Ellison took over Paramount as part of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The deal was plagued by politics as Paramount settled President Donald Trump's election interference lawsuit against the company over CBS News' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Liberal critics accused Paramount of \"bending the knee\" to Trump in order for his FCC to approve the merger. They also expressed outrage over CBS' cancellation of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" which will stop airing after May 2026. The network insisted it was purely a financial decision, though critics believe it was also tied to the FCC-approved merger. CBS News, the perpetual third place broadcaster behind ABC News and NBC News' weekday programming, has undergone some major changes in Ellison's first few months as its owner, from implementing a brutal round of layoffs, tapping Bari Weiss as the network's editor-in-chief, to pushing out \"CBS Evening News\" anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois. Weiss is reportedly eying \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil to take the chair. SENATE GEARS UP FOR 'INTENSE' ANTITRUST HEARING IN WAKE OF NETFLIX, WARNER BROS DEAL CNN staffers fear that the editorial reshaping of CBS News by Ellison and Weiss would impact their own newsroom if Paramount buys Warner Bros. Discovery. They also worry about a potential \"bloodbath\" among leadership if CBS News and CNN were to merge. \"They like editorial independence, and I think the reports of what CBS has gone through suggests that may not be the case where there to be a Paramount takeover,\" the first CNN staffer said. During a CNBC interview on Monday, Ellison was asked whether he would combine CNN and CBS News' newsgathering operations. He dodged the question, speaking instead about the broader goal he has for news, which is getting into the \"trust\" and \"truth business\" that \"speaks to the 70% of Americans in the middle,\" a sentiment previously echoed by Weiss. BARI WEISS REPORTEDLY 'STUNNED' '60 MINUTES' CREW BY ASKING WHY THE COUNTRY THINKS THEY'RE 'BIASED': REPORT However, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison had told Trump officials that he'd make sweeping changes to CNN if he became its owner, and that Trump has been vocal about wanting CNN to have new ownership that will make programming changes. \"I think everyone wants to be fair,\" the CNN staffer said. \"I don't think [CNN colleagues] see Ellison as trying to target the political middle. I think they think he is kowtowing to Trump.\" Trump himself has so far had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his reported coziness with Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison. Last week, he praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO Ted Sarandos a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share. On Monday, he refrained from saying he supported Paramount's bid despite it being partially financed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm Affinity Partners, something Trump told reporters he hadn't discussed with Kushner about. Meanwhile, Trump blasted Paramount over the \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., writing on Truth Social that the new ownership is \"NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.\" CNN has repeatedly been orphaned by corporate parents for years, from Time Warner in the 90s, to AOL in the early 2000s, to AT&T in 2018, leading to its 2022 spinoff of Warner Bros. Discovery, led by CEO David Zaslav. \"I remember when AT&T was seen as horrific. Looking back, it’s the best owner we’ve had in a decade,\" the second CNN staffer said. \"They left us alone. That’s all any news organization wants. They plowed money into us. And yeah, Zaslav dumped CNN+ on like the second day or whatever. But AT&T put in 600 million bucks.\" Not everyone at CNN is hitting the panic button on Ellison. The second staffer told Fox News Digital that they'll be \"open-minded\" if he takes over. The staffer also called Weiss \"very thoughtful and very confident,\" which could be a \"very good combo.\" \"I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised,\" they said. CBS SNAGS ABC REPORTER WHO APOLOGIZED FOR REMARKS ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK'S ALLEGED SHOOTER'S 'TOUCHING' MESSAGES A third CNN staffer suggested that Paramount buying the network would be the better outcome versus being spun off if Netflix buys Warner Bros. and being \"totally chopped to pieces and whittled to the bone private equity style.\" Regardless, the agony of CNN's unknown future is only fueling anxiety in the newsroom. \"Most people have no idea what will happen... The uncertainty is the worst of all,\" the first CNN staffer said. Representatives for CNN and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Gavin Newsom in an interview on “Pod Force One,” saying his “state leadership failures” were disqualifying for a 2028 presidential run — before suggesting that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was a far “more promising” candidate for Democrats.\n\nDhillon, a former California resident, told The Post’s Miranda Devine that Newsom, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, “isn’t untested, like [former President Barack] Obama was, in a way” but has “notable personal foibles and failures” when asked whether the governor had a shot at the US presidency.\n\nThe assistant AG for the Civil Rights Division also noted that a member of Newsom’s staff had claimed she was “involved in the firebombing of a judge’s house in South Carolina, which turned out to have been an accident.”\n\n“I think that there are other more promising, for the Democrat Party, younger politicians,” Dhillon said in Wednesday’s podcast episode. “I think AOC is one of those fictionally created-in-a-lab characters that may be a more promising one for them.”\n\n“I think that’s the bigger threat.

Our office never threatened her, in contrast to the Trump Administration’s vile rhetoric against sitting judges.”\n\n“In recent weeks and months, Trump officials have referred to judges as ‘terrorists’ and ‘legal insurrectionists,’” the rep said, noting she has reposted other offensive tweets including one calling him a “woke douche bag.”\n\nGardon added: “She and her associates own that dangerous, disgraceful, and un-American rhetoric, and she should apologize for that, too.”\n\nCircuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein’s home in Edisto Beach was engulfed in a fire on Oct. 5 that authorities have still not determined the cause of. Sources told FitsNews that month the judge, who ruled against the Trump administration’s request for state voter data but was overruled by the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nIn a post from her official account on X, Dhillon said her division “will not stand for a state court judge’s hasty nullification of our federal voting laws” and “will allow nothing to stand in the way of our mandate to maintain clear voter rolls.”\n\nGardon had posted on X in response to the judge’s home being lit on fire on Oct. 5: “A few weeks ago, one of Trump’s top DOJ officials publicly targeted this judge. Today, the judge’s home is on fire.”\n\nDhillon dished on her “Pod Force One” interview, “They blamed me and Stephen Miller for that, and you get death threats because of that?

Beto O’Rourke broke state fundraising records and sparked national attention with his campaign for a Texas Senate seat. The polls never had him as the favorite—FiveThirtyEight gave him a 23 percent chance by Election Day—but it was noteworthy that in Texas a Democrat was even close. Bolstered by the notoriously unlikable Ted Cruz and a national “blue wave,” O’Rourke lost by only 2.6 points. Not bad for an anti-gun Democrat in a seemingly deep-red state.\n\nIn hindsight, O’Rourke’s narrow loss was actually the cruelest thing he could’ve done to the Democratic Party. It created a misleading impression that a long-dreamed-of blue Texas was right around the corner. That idea was emboldened in 2020, after Joe Biden lost the state by just 5.5 points. It was a larger loss than O’Rourke’s had been, but it was arguably more impressive when you took into account the more Republican-friendly national environment.\n\nDemocrats’ hopes were high, and they held on to them even after taking a step back during the 2022 midterms. Then came Kamala Harris’ 2024 Texas wipeout, when she lost to Donald Trump by 13.7 points. It was a massive regression, and it felt familiar. For years, optimistic Democrats—braced by near misses—had promised a blue Texas over the horizon. And, once again, when the big moment arrived, the state apparently returned to a deep-red hue.\n\nNot only did this seemingly destroy any hope that Texas was trending blue, but a core part of the blue Texas theory—that Hispanic and Latino voters would carry Democrats across the finish line—had been debunked. Trump won 55 percent of Latino voters in the state, a stunning swing from his 41 percent share in 2020.\n\nThe blue Texas dream is widely scoffed at post-2024, with liberals themselves often the most skeptical of the idea. They’ll say they’ve been promised that the state will flip one too many times, so don’t you dare try to get their hopes up again. Conservatives, meanwhile, appear to see blue Texas as a total joke; whereas Cruz’s 2024 Senate campaign ads took the idea seriously, in 2025 the White House urged Texas legislators to redraw their state’s congressional map in an attempt to grab Republicans five additional seats. It’s a move that conveyed total confidence that Texas would remain in the GOP’s hands.\n\nAnd so it is with some trepidation that I come to argue that the blue Texas dream is not over. Not only that, but there’s a historical precedent for a state flipping from one party’s bastion to the other’s playground.\n\nLet’s begin with those electoral maps that Republicans redrew this summer, a move that took on additional salience last week after the Supreme Court upheld them for the upcoming election. It’s not clear that this power grab will actually yield the party the five new seats it’s hoping to snag—particularly if the national political environment continues to favor Democrats in 2026. As elections analyst Eli McKown-Dawson noted, two of those five districts aren’t actually safe red: Texas’ 28th District can easily fall in a blue-wave environment, and its 34th could fall too if the Hispanic vote shifts back to Democrats. Given Hispanic and Latino Texans’ status as swing voters and their already-observable leftward shift in the 2025 elections, this hardly seems like a safe bet for the GOP. And considering that the recent Tennessee special election showed a district moving 13 points to the left, these 2024 Texas margins just aren’t that impressive.\n\nBut when I talk about blue Texas, I’m talking about something more ambitious than a wave election that flips a few House seats.\n\nSome Not-So-Distant History\n\nRepublicans’ moves in Texas suggest an assumption that the state will remain deep red in perpetuity. But it wasn’t so long ago that the party believed it had a megastate in the bag, only to see it flip on them.\n\nRewind 31 years, and you’ll find a California that had leaned Republican for over a generation. Voters elected not a single Democratic presidential candidate from 1968 to 1988 and only one Democratic governor from 1966 to 1998. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, later famous for repeatedly winning reelection on autopilot, actually lost her first statewide race to a Republican in 1990. Much like O’Rourke’s 2018 defeat, Feinstein’s 3.5-point loss was described by the Oakland Tribune as an “impressive closing campaign” that put her “in the front ranks” in an upcoming 1992 primary for the Senate.\n\nThe California of 1990 isn’t a perfect comparison with modern Texas. For one thing, its pro-choice Republican governor, Pete Wilson, started off more moderate than politicians like Greg Abbott and Cruz did. Still, it’s hard not to look at the next gubernatorial election in 1994 and not see some parallels to 2024. 1994 was the year Wilson won reelection by a much larger margin than his first time around, and he did so by tacking notably to the right on immigration. After his victory, he described the race as a sweeping mandate, and other GOP figures in the state certainly agreed: “This is a glorious day to be a Republican,” Wilson’s attorney general told reporters. “We have made a change in America and California that’s going to last a long, long time.”\n\nBut a Democrat won the governor’s race four years later, and (give or take one Terminator) the party continued to win that seat for decades to come. Within one generation, Republicans had gone from the clear favorites in statewide elections to candidates barely taken seriously at all. This was not an instant switch but a culmination of a decadeslong trend, one that necessitated many steps forward and plenty of steps back. Colorado and Virginia would go through similar transformations in the 2000s, while Georgia and Arizona are on similar trajectories today. So why is it so hard to imagine Texas, a state that voted Republican by 23 points in 2004 and by only 5.5 points in 2020, going down the same path?\n\nWhat’s Holding Texas Democrats Back?\n\nThe easiest explanation for all the doomerism is that the changing national environment has created a misleading picture. 2018 was a bluer year nationwide than 2020, which was a bluer year than 2022, which was itself a bluer year than 2024; Democrats’ vote share in Texas declined during this period at least partially because their vote share was declining everywhere. It’s similar to the way Republicans’ California win in ’94 grows less impressive when you remember that as the year of a historic national red-wave midterm. National trends can cloud one’s takeaway from statewide elections; Wilson falsely interpreted his win as a sign that California was fully on board with his increasingly conservative, anti-immigrant platform, and that fundamental misread of his electorate paved the way for a Democrat to win big in 1998.\n\nThe other reason for the blue Texas skepticism is that the Democrats’ dominance in California was fueled by its burgeoning Hispanic population. The transition helped contribute to the “emerging Democratic majority” theory, the idea that an increasingly diverse America would usher in an inevitable age of Democratic dominance. The theory was half right: The country has indeed gotten more diverse. But at the same time, many of its minority groups have shifted right. If Hispanic and Latino voters were still casting ballots like they did in 2016 (their estimated 20-point swing from ’16 cost Democrats at least 400,000 votes in ’24), Texas could already be an undeniable swing state; instead, Hispanic voters swung hard for Trump and helped him carry the state with ease.\n\nBut while the evolution of the Hispanic vote is a complication in the blue Texas dream, it certainly doesn’t kill it. After all, that transition is similar to what happened with Irish and Italian voting blocs during the mid-20th century. As Vox correspondent Christian Paz put it before the 2024 election, “Hispanic and Latino Americans may simply be following the trends of previous waves of immigrant communities: assimilating, diffusing across the country, and becoming as ideologically and politically diverse as native-born and white Americans are.” Just as Irish and Italian Americans went from reliable Democrats to less-predictable swing voters, so too are Hispanic Americans today. The transition may be messier given the sheer variety of Hispanic voters (hailing from over a dozen different major countries), but the general trend seems clear.\n\nAnd a demographic that swings in one direction can swing back just as quickly in the other. Nearly all recent polling data shows that Hispanic and Latino voters are souring on Trump, and these numbers have been backed up at least partially in the 2025 election results. Especially in states like New Jersey and Virginia, Latino-heavy districts have shown a major reversion toward Democrats. And as party strategist Chuck Rocha noted in an August interview for the Texas Tribune, the president has shown a unique strength with Hispanic voters that might not be replicable for other Republicans, nor may it help them much in the 2026 midterms. In 2024 Ted Cruz performed 4 to 6 points worse than Trump in the most Hispanic-heavy districts throughout the state; whose coattails will Texas Sen. John Cornyn be able to ride in 2026?\n\nAnother common argument against blue Texas is the state’s apparent exodus of liberal voters combined with an influx of conservative voters. While there is a trend of political self-sorting in America that accelerated in the COVID era, the impact this has had on Texas appears overstated. Not only are far more people entering the state than leaving it, but the people entering (primarily young people of diverse backgrounds) are evidently motivated more by job opportunities and cost of living than by partisan politics. It’s also the blue and purple metro areas that are booming in Texas, not the red rural counties. Just as Hispanic residents have been shown to vote more liberal when they live in liberal districts, so too do most other Americans. As long as most people are moving into Texas suburbs and cities, self-sorting migration is likely not enough to reverse the state’s blueward trend on its own.\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor holding back a blue Texas is voter apathy in the state. As the Texas Blue Action website notes with great frustration, the state already has enough registered Democrats to flip most of its recent statewide election results, but many of those registered Democrats aren’t voting. This logic could easily be flipped around on the advocacy group (there are plenty of registered Republicans in the state who don’t vote either), but the general point stands: Voter turnout among Democrats tends to be lower than among Republicans in the state, further hurting Democrats’ chances. Texas has one of the lowest voter participation rates in the country, a fact that blue Texas skeptics constantly cite as proof that the state is unflippable.\n\nThe obvious counter is to ask why voter apathy is so high in the first place. It can’t be explained away by the state’s restrictive voter policies, as similarly restrictive states, such as Georgia and Florida, regularly see higher turnout. The difference is that those states are perceived as swing states and Texas isn’t. People are more likely to turn out in elections when they think their votes matter, but Texas voters feel as if theirs don’t. And although the state’s Republican voters get at least the satisfaction of being on the winning team, for its Democrats, voting can feel like an undignified, Sisyphean task. What’s the point in showing up if you think you’re just going to lose again and again?\n\nThis is why it’s so crucial for Democrats to not give up on Texas: A single win would deal a major blow to the perception that their statewide elections are a foregone conclusion. Much like how Georgia’s surprise 2020 flip led to a boost (relative to the nation) in voter turnout in 2024, a single win could energize Texas Dems’ get-out-the-vote efforts going forward. Both the 2026 state Senate race and gubernatorial race are too far out to say anything for certain, but the national blue-leaning midterm trend will make those contests Democrats’ best chance to win the state in over 30 years. Flipping Texas with the right candidate in a blue-wave midterm would hardly turn it into a blue state yet, but it would provide the much-needed proof that blue Texas isn’t a delusion.\n\nEven if Democrats fail to win statewide in 2026, it’s important that they take the possibility seriously and continue putting in the work to make it happen. Winning Texas’ Senate seat could be crucial to regaining control of the U.S. Senate, and turning Texas into a purple state would radically shift the presidential electoral map in Democrats’ favor. After the 2030 census, Texas is expected to gain four electoral votes, while the heavy-blue states may lose up to nine of them; this math is devastating for Democrats unless they manage to put Texas on the table.\n\nMost importantly, Democrats need to believe in and strive for a blue Texas because persistent groundwork is vital for the long-term flipping of a state. Just as Stacey Abrams’ doomed 2018 gubernatorial campaign still paved the way for Democrats’ triumph in Georgia two years later, so too could the Democrats’ campaigns in 2026. There’s a decent chance that things won’t work out as nicely for Texas, that flipping the state truly is a total nonstarter, as so many pundits insist. That doesn’t mean, however, that the party should give up on it after having gained so much ground. Blue Texas is not guaranteed, but it is at least possible, and that should be more than enough reason to keep up the fight.","summary":"Republicans believe that it will stay red forever.

She is the first woman ever elected as mayor in the city.\n\nShe won Tuesday’s run-off after leading the first round of voting on November 4 with 35 percent of the vote to Gonzalez’s 19 percent.\n\n“Tonight, the people of Miami made history,” Higgins said in a statement. “Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city.”\n\nHiggins’ victory adds to a run of recent Democratic wins, including races in New Jersey and Virginia, as the party looks towards the 2026 midterms. That trend continued with strong results in November’s off-year elections and a solid showing in this month’s special House race in Tennessee.\n\nWhile Miami’s mayor wields limited formal power, the role is highly symbolic, representing a city with a large Latino population at the centre of national immigration debates.\n\nHome to roughly half a million residents, Miami is Florida’s second-most populous city after Jacksonville. In recent election cycles, it has shifted towards Republicans, making a Democratic win stand out even more. Trump had won Miami-Dade County in the 2024 presidential election against her Democratic rival Kamala Harris.\n\nHispanic or Latino residents make up roughly 70 percent of Miami’s population. In Miami-Dade County overall, about 69–70 percent of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino – a demographic majority that significantly shapes the region’s cultural and political identity.\n\nWhat are some of the key issues of this campaign?\n\nImmigration was a key issue in Higgins’ campaign.\n\nIn Miami, she often talked about Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, saying she heard from residents who were worried about family members being detained. She described the election as a referendum on the president’s policies, which have caused concerns about due process.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have been arrested since Trump launched the crackdown on migrants in January.

Some will write off Trump's ruminations about changing the name to \" Tpublican\" or some other bastardized version as another of his egomaniacal rants to distract the media from learning about playboy Trump's earlier years with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nYet, few believed Trump would tear down the entire East Wing of the White House to create a Mar-a-Lago North. This is the American president who has plastered the Oval Office with gold, now converted to the Trump family cash register with real estate deals and crypto scams ringing up sales for the billionaire family. Most Americans would not expect a sitting president to approve a new dollar coin with his portrait on it, but it is in the planning stages. There seems no end to Trump disgracing the office of the presidency with his monumental ego and tacky taste.\n\nWith the latest Gallup poll showing Trump and his party in trouble, with only 36% of Americans approving of his job performance, fair-weather Republicans and independents who voted for Trump in 2024 because he wasn't Kamala Harris may reconsider their vote for Republicans in the future. There are already signs of dissent at the polls with the recent elections of Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nThe stakes are high for the Grand Old Party. Republicans are also in danger of losing control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections with the economy worsening daily while Trump becomes the first president refusing to release basic economic data on job losses and inflation. There are already signs from the Senate Republican majority that Trump's behavior can no longer be ignored. In response to Trump's efforts to convince Senate Republicans to kill the filibuster, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune stiffed Trump and said there weren't enough Senate Republicans willing to make it happen.\n\nIn another message to Trump that times are changing, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chair of the Armed Services Committee, joined with his Democratic counterpart to investigate allegations that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered there to be no survivors in U.S. strikes on boats off South America. The House Committee followed suit assuring bipartisan oversight in both chambers.\n\nTrump's feckless leadership of the Republican Party is reminiscent of Rip Van Winkle's experience. Rip woke up after a long 20-year sleep to find the world changed around him. Similarly, the Republican Party has awakened from the day Ronald Reagan admonished Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall to Trump's mismanaged and dangerous foreign policy. He is outfoxed by Chinese President Xi Jinping on tariffs at the expense of American farmers, and the war criminal Vladimir Putin plays Trump for a fool who yields in deference to the Russian president and his murderous assault on Ukraine.\n\nOnce the law-and-order party, Republicans are now led by a president who just pardoned a Honduran ex-president serving a 45-year term for receiving millions in bribes and partnering with narcotics traffickers. Trump also commuted the sentence of a private equity executive who just began a seven-year sentence for a $1.6 billion scheme that defrauded thousands of investors. But Trump had no problem calling for the execution of U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, a war hero, who reminded our military forces they did not have to follow orders that broke the law.\n\nThose who recently spoke at former Vice President Dick Cheney's funeral service offered a considerable contrast to Trump's brand of leadership. There is no doubt that Cheney leaves behind a career of disastrous foreign policy blunders, but he will also be remembered for endorsing Harris as the only alternative to Trump in 2024. His daughter, former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, read a letter Cheney wrote to his grandchildren, stating that \"bonds of party must always yield to the single bond we share as Americans.\"\n\nTo justify what had to be his most difficult political decision, he said, \"There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\" In the end, Cheney got it right, leaving his beloved Republican Party for his one vote against Trump in 2024.\n\nRepublicans in Congress may be waking up to the fact that the man Cheney called a threat to our republic will not be around forever. With an increasingly self-absorbed and unhinged president losing ground with some Republicans in Congress, it hardly seems the moment to attach any semblance of the Trump surname to their party. Now is the time to rebuild the Republican Party with Trump as a mere footnote of times gone bad.\n\nBob Kustra served two terms as Republican lieutenant governor of Illinois and 10 years as a state legislator.

Maura Healey.\n\nDown through the years, she’s made any number of bizarre, often contradictory statements. Let’s round up some of them, into a holiday version of Maura’s Greatest Hits, Vol. 1.\n\nWe begin with her currently newsworthy comments about natural-gas pipelines from 2022 and 2025.\n\nWhen was she lying, then or now? You be the judge.\n\nIn 2022, bragging on National Panhandler Radio: “Remember, I stopped two gas pipelines from coming into this state…. I also went to the Supreme Judicial Court to make sure that obsolete, soon-to-be-obsolete, pipeline infrastructure wasn’t gonna be built on the backs of our ratepayers.”\n\nIn 2025, asked about the above statement: “First of all, I didn’t do that.”\n\nThis year, she has yet another position on pipelines, blaming Donald Trump: “Get rid of the tariffs on aluminum and steel because the aluminum and steel that we need to build out our energy infrastructure here, to bring more energy in, now costs a lot more to build out.”\n\nIn 2024, asked about the rape of a disabled underage girl by an illegal-alien Haitian in one of her Healey hotels: “It is unfortunate that from time to time, things will happen.”\n\nHow to prevent even more rapes by those illegal aliens that she welcomed into Massachusetts: “Last spring I ordered the unprecedented step to have CORI criminal background checks conducted on all shelter residents across the entire system.”\n\nWhat happened with Maura’s unprecedented step: “I was recently informed by my team that did not happen at all sites and that is absolutely unacceptable.”\n\nIn April 2016, when women at a State House hearing complained about having to share restrooms with males, Healey responded, “To them, I say if you’ve got that much of a problem, ‘Hold it!’”\n\nIn June 2020, as roving bands of BLM thugs looted cities across the nation, Healey told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, “Yes, America is burning, but that’s how forests grow.”\n\nIn November 2023, on her appointment of Monica Tibbets-Nutt as the state’s secretary of transportation: “(She) is a proven leader who has done important work at MASS DOT over the past year… (She) is the right person to lead the hard-working team at MASS DOT.”\n\nIn October 2025, after the $900-million Plazagate scandal on the Mass Pike, Healey issued a very brief press release about her pal: “(She) has made the decision to step down from her positions.”\n\nIn 2024, after the overthrow of Dementia Joe Biden: “The future of our country is on the line. That’s why I’m thrilled to support Kamala Harris.”\n\nAnd on scandal-scarred MN Gov. Tim Walz: “He’s the real deal, you know. He’s the coach you want to play for. He’s the colleague you want to serve with. He’s the guy you want in the bunker. I mean, he’s just a really special person.”\n\nIn 2023, on criticism of her appointment of her jilted much older former live-in gal pal, Gabrielle Wolohojian, to the Supreme Judicial Court: “I don’t want the fact that she had a personal relationship with me to deprive the Commonwealth of a person who’s most qualified for the position.”\n\nAfter the arrest of her top aide, LaMar Cook, a career criminal who allegedly shipped eight pounds of cocaine to her office suite in Springfield: “That individual underwent a complete background check.”\n\nShe now refuses to release Cook’s “complete background check.”\n\nIn 2022, Maura endorsed corrupt Democrat Suffolk County sheriff Steve Tompkins for reelection, calling him “a strong partner in the push for a more equitable criminal justice system.”\n\nIn 2025, after Tompkins’ indictment on federal corruption charges, Healey declined to call for his resignation, saying, “I need to know more about this. I need to get more information.”\n\nIn September 2021, Maura endorsed crooked Suffolk County DA Rachael Rollins for US attorney, saying she “brings a valuable perspective and commitment to reforming a criminal justice system.”\n\nIn May 2023, Rollins was forced to resign after a string of corrupt acts. Healey had no comment.\n\nIn November 2024, asked on MSDNC if she would support Trump’s efforts to rid Massachusetts of its huge population of illegal-alien criminals, Healey replied, “Absolutely not.”\n\nIn May 2025, asked about Trump’s shutdown of the southern border, Healey said, “Some of what Trump has done makes a lot of sense.”\n\nStatement on the kind of “renewable” energy the state needs: “What does Massachusetts have? We have the Saudi Arabia of wind right off our shores. We’ve got some of it churning already.”\n\nAfter one of her beloved wind-turbine blades fell into Nantucket Sound in July 2024 and caused great pollution to churn up on local beaches: “Obviously something went wrong. There was a problem. We need to understand that.”\n\nIn April 2016, when then-AG Maura Healey’s office was running the investigation of corrupt drug-lab chemist Sonja Farak, her office’s probe itself became such a scandal that Healey filed a “Motion to Impound Grand Jury Materials and Report” on Farak’s crimes.\n\nThen Maura filed a second motion to “impound its request for its Motion for Order of Non-Dissemination of Information.”\n\nIn other words, it was a cover-up of a cover-up — think of it as a dress rehearsal for Maura’s more recent Lamar Cook cover-up.\n\nIn 2024, on the Supreme Court decision to allow school athletes to pray before kickoff: “The football field is for playing, not for forcing religion on children.”\n\nOn the COVID scam of 2020-21: “I certainly am grateful for my opportunity to wear a mask during COVID.”\n\nCan we quote you on that, Governor?\n\nBefore long, it will be time for Maura’s Greatest Hits, Vol. 2.\n\nUntil then, you’ll just have to, to coin a phrase, Hold it!\n\n(Order Howie’s new book, “Mass Corruption: Vol. 1, The Cops” at amazon.com or howiecarrshow.com/store.)","summary":"Down through the years, Gov.

In the interview, she defended the president’s working habits, saying her boss “works 24/7” and never sleeps. \n\n“When we travel, it’s a killer, because normal people do need to get sleep, but he doesn’t,” Wiles said. “It’s a very long day— meetings and some spontaneous conversations.

You localise the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” she explained. “We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters.” \n\nShe went on to note: “We saw a week ago Tuesday what happens when he’s not on the ballot and not active.

Trump is nowhere nearly as popular among Hispanics as he once was, because of simple pocketbook politics. Paxton will be toxic. All the Democrats have to do is nominate someone bland and inoffensively competent-seeming — a UT Austin tackling dummy would do — and find themselves with a prebaked 47 percent of the vote in the race, with room to grow. With an eye toward all the forces at play that are making a nationwide 2026 walloping of Republicans likely, I watched this race develop early in the year and wrote a two-word lament in my notes: “Roy Moore.”\n\nBut now there is hope — not the hope that Paxton will suddenly become a decent person, or even popular statewide, but hope that the Democrats can magically snatch defeat from the jaws of a potential Texas victory: by nominating Dallas-area Representative Jasmine Crockett for the seat.\n\nEd: I think Blehar underestimates Paxton's popularity here in Texas, where most if not all of the scandal stuff has been aired for at least one election cycle. He may be overestimating Cornyn's popularity too, especially after the gun-control bill. But he's not wrong about the disastrous impact Crockett will have on the Democrat ticket in Texas in the midterms. \n\n🚨 BREAKING: DHS arrests New Jersey twins, radical leftists Ricardo & Emilio Roman Flores, for violent threats against Assistant Sec.

Kirkpatrick said those convicted \"took advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to carry out a massive fraud scheme that stole money meant to feed children.\"\n\nBut state officials say the schemes aimed at diverting federal dollars meant for people who are poor, food insecure or disabled, actually started far sooner, months after Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz took office in 2019. In its early stages, members of the charitable group Feeding Our Future billed the state for some $3.4 million. \n\nBy 2021, however, that number ballooned. Before it was finally halted, Feeding Our Future had falsely claimed to have served 91 million meals, for which the group received nearly $250 million in federal funds, according to federal prosecutors. That money did not go to feed kids, federal officials said. Instead it was used to fund lavish lifestyles.\n\nEd: The Power Line writers have been reporting this for months, and more. It's good to see CBS and other media outlets finally starting to expose this fraud, but the DoJ has been prosecuting this for a long time, and the media couldn't be bothered to look into this when Walz was on the Democrat ticket. \n\nEd: This is the interview I did with Bill Glahn from Power Line and the Center of the American Experiment about the details of all the fraud being uncovered in Minnesota. I filled in for Drew yesterday.

Have we turned a corner?\n\nGraham Linehan: It’s difficult to say for certain. Sometimes I think that the world might be destroyed by embarrassment. By that I mean a lot of people are now realising they bet on the wrong horse, but simply cannot admit it – because if they admit it, they admit to all sorts of awful accompanying things, like putting children in danger, mutilating and sterilising gay people, putting rapists in women’s prisons and so on. The sheer embarrassment of that must be so extraordinary that I imagine people, who may have otherwise seen sense, have now backed themselves into a corner.\n\nI’m not sure that’s what the rest of the fight looks like. I think my arrest at Heathrow recently is a sign that the trans lobby is losing, and now they’re lashing out. I think we’re going to see a few more examples of this. A man in Switzerland just got 10 days in prison for saying that male and female skeletons are different. I am hopeful that it just gets to a stage where the whole thing finally dissipates, but you never know. These people are really digging their heels in, and it’s very hard to move them. All we can do is keep trying. The fact that they know they’re losing makes them all the more dangerous.\n\nEd: That's usually the end stage of all cults. That's what this is.

It seems unlikely that the state of Florida could have forced access to CAIR's financing and communications without it. It's a briar-patch strategy – although in CAIR's defense, they probably had no choice but to engage. \n\nCAIR falsely claims \"nor do we serve any foreign powers.\" Two weeks after 9/11, it linked on the main page of its website to the Holy Land Foundation, which was later convicted on sending $16 million to Hamas, under guise of helping the victims of the 9/11 attacks. https://t.co/633epaj2wp— America, Amen.

I just helped our farmers out because they're starting to do really well. But in order to try and negotiate, some countries played a little cute, and we just gave them right out of the billion, hundreds of billions that we've taken in, we gave the farmers a little help, $12 billion and they are so happy,” he said.\n\nThe $12 billion bailout is real — he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the program during a roundtable with farmers in the Cabinet Room on Monday. But Rollins herself told reporters later that day that the funds for the bailout will come from the Commodity Credit Corporation, an agency within the Department of Agriculture that finances farm safety net programs, often through borrowing as much as $30 billion from the treasury and private lenders.\n\nIn what was his first appearance since the summer at one of his signature campaign-style rallies, Trump continued on a rambling, off-teleprompter stemwinder of a speech that was intended to assuage concerns about what voters say is his failure to address any of the affordability or cost-of-living issues that led them to chose him over former Vice President Kamala Harris a year ago. \n\nOccasionally, Trump stuck to the script. He recited canned lines about an “amazing … transformation of our country” since his return to the White House 11 months ago and claimed “prices are way down” in part due to his administration’s green-lighting of oil exploration across the country.\n\nHe also claimed he has “no higher priority than making America affordable” while accusing Democrats of having “caused” the high prices that persist nearly a year into his second term in office. \n\n“They gave you the highest inflation in history, and we're … bringing those prices down rapidly, lower prices, bigger paychecks, you're getting lower prices. Bigger paychecks, we're getting inflation, we're crushing it, and you're getting much higher wages,” he said. \n\nTrump then boasted to the working-class, blue-collar crowd that the “only thing” that is “going up big” is “the stock market and your 401(k)” before downplaying voters’ concerns about prices that have continued to rise since his return to power as a “hoax” perpetuated by his Democratic Party opponents.\n\n“They always have a hoax — the new word is affordability,” he said. \n\n“Democrats talking about affordability is like Bonnie and Clyde preaching about public safety. And they are really the, truly the enemy of the working class when they do it.”\n\nIn between racist rants about Somalian immigrants and attacks on multiple Black members of Congress, Trump continued on, accusing his predecessor, former president Joe Biden and his allies in Congress of having “blown up our economy” and “sent prices soaring” while repeating previously-debunked claims about the price of Thanksgiving dinner — weeks after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n“They use the word affordability, and that's their only word. They say affordability, and everyone says, oh, that must mean Trump has high prices? No, our prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country,” he said. \n\nThroughout his speech, Trump sought to cast the entirety of blame for price increases across a range of sectors on Biden and a range of his appointees, including Federal Reserve Board of Governors Chair Jerome Powell and other Board of Governors members.\n\nAt one point, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent looking on, he baselessly suggested that all four Biden appointees to the central bank’s board were illegitimate because their commissions — the formal document appointing them to office after Senate confirmation — might have been signed by an autopen. \n\n“I hear that the auto pen may have signed those commissions, if they signed those commissions. Now maybe I'm wrong, but we're going to check,” he said.\n\nTrump’s remarks come as the Senate is preparing to vote on a Democratic proposal to extend pandemic-era subsidies for health insurance purchased on Affordable Care Act exchanges to stave off massive increases in insurance premiums that could leave families paying thousands more per year for coverage. \n\nDuring his first four years in office, he failed to convince Congress to repeal the landmark health care law and he never proposed a replacement for it despite promising to do so multiple times. \n\nHis GOP colleagues in Congress have not come up with a serious proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act either, in part because the ACA was based off what was once a Clinton-era proposal from the Heritage Foundation meant as an alternative to a government-run, single-payer health care system. \n\nBut Trump has refused to support extending the subsidies despite polling that shows Americans — even many who voted for him — supporting doing so overwhelmingly.\n\nInstead, he told rallygoers that he opposes extending the tax credits because they go to insurance companies and accused Democrats of being “bought and owned” by them while pushing the idea that the government could give direct payments to be used for purchasing health insurance from the same insurance companies.\n\n“I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people … I want to give nothing to the insurance companies … because they're sucking our country dry with a scam by the Democrats,” he said. \n\n“We want the money to go directly to the people. We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.” \n\nThe president’s return to the rallies that defined his political movement over the last 10 years also comes as Americans are feeling the pain from his tariff policies, which have resulted in price increases for almost all imported goods from nearly every U.S. trading partner. \n\nAlthough Trump frequently claims that tariffs are paid by foreign countries as if they are entry fees for the privilege of exporting goods to the United States, they are actually import taxes paid by American importers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. \n\nVoters are paying more for many imports than they did before he imposed the massive taxes on them by executive fiat under emergency powers that are currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court, but Trump offered a bizarre justification of the taxes by claiming they are needed to protect American steel manufacturing.\n\n“You need steel. You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils. That's under the China policy. You know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two ... they don't need that many. But you always need steel,” he said.\n\n“You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, you don't need 37 dolls so we're doing things right.”\n\nAnd although Trump claimed that his signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act would put more money in Pennsylvanians’ pockets because of the “no tax on tips” policies meant to benefit low-wage workers, polling shows Americans aren’t impressed by his record after nearly a year back in office.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, only 36 percent of voters approve of his performance as president, giving him the lowest rating of his second term. \n\nA separate Politico poll released this week showed 46 percent of respondents saying the cost of living in America is worse than they can remember at any point, including 37 percent of voters who pulled levers for Trump last year.\n\nNearly half of respondents also said they blame Trump — not Biden or Harris — for the economy’s current condition.","summary":"Trump’s return to campaign-style rallies comes after months of criticism over his focus on foreign trips and a futile pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-speech-rally-pa-affordability-b2881449.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/0/17/SEI277467811.jpg?crop=5640,3760,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cvqt3Nse-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-10 02:04:04","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":386650444,"title":"Jasmine Crockett launches Senate bid","text":"Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a progressive firebrand who currently represents Texas' 30th congressional district, launched a bid for the U.S. Senate on Monday -- setting up a contested primary against a rising Democratic star and jolting a political scene already scrambled by the Lone Star state's recent redrawing of its congressional map.\n\nCrockett, speaking at an event on Monday in Dallas, emphasized being confident in being able to win a statewide race in Texas as a Democrat and wanting to take on President Donald Trump as a U.S. Senator. \n\n\"There's a responsibility that lies with all of us, especially in this moment. There are a lot of people that said, 'You got to stay in the house. We need our voice. We need you there,'\" Crockett told the crowd. \n\n\"I understand, but what we need is for me to have a bigger voice. What we need is not only a voice, but we need to make sure that we are going to stop all the hell that is raining down on all of our people,\" Crockett said.\n\nCrockett did not mention her primary opponent, state Rep. James Talarico, by name. The state representative rose to national acclaim for his embrace of Christianity with Democratic politics and was outspoken this past summer when Democratic state legislators in Texas left the state to try to prevent a vote on the new congressional map.\n\nTalarico said he \"welcomes\" Crockett into the race. \n\n\"We're building a movement in Texas ... Our movement is rooted in unity over division -- so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race,\" Talarico said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhile talking about the uphill battle to win statewide on Monday, Crockett referenced a need for unity and that her run was focused on Texans, seemingly trying to preempt claims she was splitting the Democratic vote or going for her Senate run for the sake of her own ambition. \n\n\"Many people have asked, and all of us wonder, can we win this race in November? I'm here to say, yes, we can. I'm also here to say it's not if we can, but if we will, if we will get out and knock the doors ... will we come together as one? This isn't about me or them. It's about you and us,\" she said.\n\n\"This is not about ambition. It's not about my ambition. It's about yours, your hopes and your dreams, and a government that has your back,\" Crockett said.\n\nBut Crockett did not shy away from naming one of her possible general election opponents -- incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn, with whom she used to have a good relationship. Crockett framed Cornyn as \"business as usual\" and said that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCrockett and Cornyn have collaborated on legislation in the past, but during her remarks, Crockett criticized him for supporting Trump and framed him as \"business as usual\", saying that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCornyn, asked during an appearance on \"America Reports\" on Fox News on Tuesday to respond to some of Crockett’s comments about him, said that he thinks Crockett won’t be able to get more than the 42% of the vote that Vice President Kamala Harris got in the 2024 presidential race. \n\nShe had harsh words for President Donald Trump, telling supporters, \"I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring.\" \n\nAnother area she hit Trump on was his push to have Texas redraw its congressional map mid-decade to favor the GOP, which Republicans delivered on this past summer. Analysts say Republicans may be able to flip three to five seats in the new map.\n\nCrockett told supporters that the mid-decade redistricting in Texas that Trump had promoted drew her out of her home district, but was not enough to stop her. \n\n\"I'm here to tell you, Donald Trump, you won't get rid of me that easily. I'm not going away. I'm not giving up. I still believe in this country. I still believe that we are in the land of opportunity,\" she said. \n\nCrockett made her announcement on the last day to file for the 2026 primaries -- which have been jolted by the redistricting. Current Democratic members of Texas' congressional delegation had been making decisions over whether and where to run ahead of Monday's deadline.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, for instance, said Friday he will retire at the end of the 119th Congress; some other members are running in new districts.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who had been running for Senate, wrote Monday that what was expected to be \"a bruising Senate Democratic primary\" would divide the party ahead of the general election. He said he was now launching a bid for the newly redrawn 33rd congressional district instead -- drawing the ire of incumbent U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, who is also running there.\n\nJohnson wrote in a statement Monday, without naming Allred, \"This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans running for the Senate seat pounced on reports midday Monday that Crockett had filed to run as proof that the Democrats will not be able to field a candidate who can win statewide. \n\nThe GOP faces an acrimonious primary itself, as incumbent Sen. John Cornyn -- supported by the party establishment -- faces primary challenges from state Attorney General Ken Paxton, and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt. Cornyn, Paxton and Hunt have each alleged that they are the best choice for Texas and the strongest supporter of Trump in the race. \n\n\"AOC has a new ally in Congress. She found one from Texas. Jasmine Crockett stands with this squad,\" the campaign team for Cornyn wrote in a post on X on Monday. \n\nPaxton, meanwhile, used Crockett's entry as a chance to hit back at Cornyn, writing on X, \"I'm sure John Cornyn is deeply upset his 'dance partner' Crazy Crockett is running, but that won't stop him from trying to force the national GOP to light $100 million on fire to save his failing campaign. He's willing to risk the Senate Majority to protect his fragile ego.\"\n\nHunt wrote on X on Tuesday, \"Welcome to the show, Jasmine Crockett. The next Senator from Texas must be able to stand on their record, their resume, and their accomplishments. I'm ready to have that debate every single day.\"\n\nABC News' John Parkinson and Brittany Shepherd contributed to this report.","summary":"Rep.

Higgins, a former Miami-Dade County commissioner, earned 59% of the vote to 41% for Republican Emilio González, a businessman and former city manager who had been endorsed by President Donald Trump. González conceded Tuesday night, his campaign confirmed. While the Miami mayoral race is technically nonpartisan, the Republican-affiliated candidate has won every election since 2008, and an independent candidate won before then, locking Democrats out of the office since their last win in 1997. But while Miami-Dade has moved dramatically toward Republicans in the last few elections, former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly carried the city itself last year. Both candidates centered their campaigns on breaking from the previous mayoral administrations in Miami and addressing voters’ economic concerns, while pitching different solutions, but the race became nationalized in the final weeks. And it hinged on familiar themes that will play a big role in deciding the 2026 elections: affordability, Trump’s weakened political standing and how the president’s controversial deportation agenda is playing in a city with a significant Hispanic population. Higgins leaned on her role on the county commission to frame herself as focused on quality of life issues like affordable housing, infrastructure and streamlining city processes in a way she said would help save the city, and residents, money. “There are many approaches to affordability that local governments have in their own hands even though we aren’t in control of tariffs — which by the way is creating a huge affordability crisis,” she told NBC News the day before the election, in a reference to Trump’s broad tariff policy. She was also deeply critical of Trump — and González by proxy, given the president’s endorsement — over his deportation agenda, telling NBC News that Hispanic and Haitian voters have been telling her they are “afraid of their government.” Despite Higgins’ messaging, González didn’t run as a Trump acolyte. Instead, he argued he was the candidate focused on local issues like fighting overdevelopment, and he aligned himself with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ plan to end homestead property taxes to ease the cost of living. González deflected criticism of the president’s immigration policies by arguing that’s a national issue over which he has no say. The race received increased national attention in the final weeks, particularly after Democrats made gains, but still lost, in a Tennessee special election for a vacant congressional district earlier this month. The Democratic National Committee took an active interest in the mayoral race, sending organizational support to boost Higgins, and prominent Democrats with potential aspirations for higher office — Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel — sent their support too. Republicans zeroed in on the race as well, hoping to hold the seat and push back on a string of GOP candidates underperforming their 2024 marks in special House elections, the recent gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, and in other downballot races.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrat-wins-miamis-mayoral-race-first-time-almost-30-years-rcna248168","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251209-Eileen-Higgins-rs-e8546a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 01:14:33","author":"Ben Kamisar","authors":["Ben Kamisar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":386648804,"title":"Democrats Flip Miami Mayor&#039;s Office for First Time in Nearly 30 Years","text":"Miami has a new mayor, with former County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, a Democrat, beating Republican Emilio González, a former city manager endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe run-off election result upsets the status quo in the South Florida city, which had not elected a Democratic mayor in nearly three decades.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nFlorida has largely swung red in recent decades, but Miami has been seen as bluer, being home to many immigrant communities. That has changed in the past few years, with President Donald Trump seeing gains among those communities in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTuesday’s result could be seen as a warning sign for Trump going into the 2026 midterms.\n\nA sign points to a polling station setup on election day on December 09, 2025, in Miami, Florida.\n\nEileen Higgins Elected Mayor of Miami\n\nHiggins won the race Tuesday night, according to the Associated Press, after the two candidates beat 11 others on election day on November 4.\n\nIn the November 4 race, Higgins secured 36 percent of the vote, and González, who came in second, won 19 percent.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin in a released statement to Newsweek on Tuesday: “Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins’ win is a testament to what Democrats can accomplish when we organize and compete everywhere, including in Miami, where Democrats have now flipped a seat that was in Republicans’ hands for nearly 30 years. While her opponent was ready to rubber-stamp Donald Trump’s inflationary agenda, Higgins remained laser-focused on lowering costs and improving the lives of Miami families. Tonight’s result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs for working families across the country.”\n\nWhat Did the Polls Show? \n\nAhead of Tuesday’s vote, betting platform Polymarket had Higgins, who campaigned on providing affordable housing, with a 94 percent chance of winning the election while González, who worked as a director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under former President George W. Bush, had a 6 percent chance.\n\nAn APL Consulting poll of 307 voters found that Higgins had 34 percent of the vote and Gonzalez had 31 percent. This poll, conducted between November 21 and 24 on behalf of Mission Miami, a political committee backing Gonzalez’s campaign, had a margin of error of +/- 5.9 percentage points.\n\nAccording to an MDW Communications poll of 307 likely voters, 49.84 percent said they would vote for Higgins while 23.78 percent planned to vote for González. However, this poll was conducted between October 14 and 18, before the November 4 election. It was also commissioned by Higgins’ political committee. The margin of error was 6 percentage points.\n\nHow the Race Could Impact the 2026 Midterms\n\nAs with any election between general and midterm elections, both parties will be taking note of the result in Miami and adjusting plans accordingly.\n\nWith the midterms looming, Republicans will be looking to continue the momentum seen in 2024 and maintain a hold on both chambers in Congress, while Democrats will be looking for any signs they could upset that majority.\n\nMiami will likely remain a hotly contested area, with the city having been won by former Vice President Kamala Harris by one point in 2024, while Miami-Dade County flipped red for Trump.\n\nAs the second-largest city in Florida, and one which is extremely diverse, the party’s likely cannot write off the mayoral race as they might in other parts of the country, especially with Trump’s endorsement of Gonzalez.\n\nThis is a breaking news story that will be updated.","summary":"Higgins won the race Tuesday night, after the two candidates beat 11 others on election day on November 4.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/miami-mayor-election-results-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez-11182942","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250973044.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:51:31","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.05},{"id":386897882,"title":"Democrats Send A Decisive Message By Flipping Miami Mayor's Office","text":"Democrat Eileen Higgins is projected to win a runoff for the Miami mayor’s office, delivering yet another decisive rebuke of President Donald Trump. \n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Higgins, a county commissioner, had secured 59% of the vote and was poised to defeat Republican-backed Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager.\n\nWhile the race was technically nonpartisan, prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), had weighed in to back Higgins. At the same time, Republicans, including President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, had done the same for Gonzalez. \n\nHiggins’s win is a major boost for Democrats, given the gains that Trump made in Miami-Dade County during his 2024 run against former Vice President Kamala Harris. Last year, Trump won 55% of the county’s votes after winning just 46% in 2020. \n\nHiggins will also be the first Democrat — and first non-Hispanic person — to hold the city’s mayoral office in roughly 30 years. \n\nHer victory adds to other successes that Democrats have seen in places like Virginia and New Jersey in 2025, and further bolsters the party’s momentum going into next year’s midterms. \n\nIt also points to solid support for Democrats from Latino voters, who comprise 64% of the electorate in Miami-Dade County. That’s significant, given the inroads Trump had made with Latino voters in the region in 2024. \n\nHiggins’s campaign addressed both local issues, including affordable housing, and national ones, such as the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. \n\n“What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they’re not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they’re also sinful,” she told CBS News.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez-miami-mayor_n_6938a90ae4b0fb6244b0def5?origin=home-zone-d-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6938ba30190000ccbb7f3b6c.jpeg?cache=q3DuHoQ4em&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:51:24","author":"Li Zhou","authors":["Li Zhou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045}]}
