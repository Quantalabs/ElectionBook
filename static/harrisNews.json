Not even 48 hours after word got out a 43-foot-tall nude effigy of Donald Trump hung suspended from a construction crane, the indecent artwork was gone. But for most of Saturday and Sunday, a mile or two off Interstate 15, a few hundred yards from the always-bustling Love’s Travel Stop just north of Sin City, the statue had people stopping and staring. But the trickle of spectators — just 27.5 miles from the towering Trump International Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip — leering at the lewd likeness of the former president couldn’t rival the thousands of supporters Trump commands in person at political stops. Although it was hung well near a busy north-south highway connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake City and points north, the figure was not easily seen from the roadway. That’s probably a good thing since the uncensored effigy had the potential to stop traffic and even cause accidents. That’s because the statue was what some would call “anatomically correct,” displaying the unknown artist’s concept of the very public billionaire’s private parts. The Trump image here materialized as smaller but equally graphic effigies of the 45th president are springing up in cities across the country, from New York’s Union Square to Los Angeles, Cleveland, Seattle and San Francisco. It’s unknown if the different projects are unrelated or part of a sleazy series. But the Nevada version of Trump had a much more authentic-looking face than the closer-to-life-size naked Trumps an anarchist collective took credit for. TMZ reported the image is not supposed to be flattering. Citing sources “with direct knowledge” of the artwork’s creation, the online outlet said the piece is titled “Crooked and Obscene,” a reference to both the sculpture and its subject. There’s no visible identification of who placed the hanging artwork there, and public records indicate a trust registered in Las Vegas owns the eight-acre parcel where the crane is parked. The Post did not hear back from the Nevada Democratic Party for comment. The Nevada GOP slammed the pop-up as an “offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue.” “While Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, continue to prioritize shock value over substance. President Trump is the only candidate in this race standing up for working men and women across Nevada,” the party added. Onlookers gawped and took selfies as cars drove up, parked and spent a few minutes ogling the naked spectacle. “I think it’s a funny, comical gesture for the up-and-coming election,” Nathan Oubre, 32, a gas-industry worker, told The Post. “Normally, you don’t see things like this, but it just gives a sign of laughter to the world seeing a big, huge statue of Donald Trump naked.” Although he is “working in the gas industry, and I’m a big supporter of it,” the Louisiana native wouldn’t say which candidate will get his vote come November. “My biggest take on the election is vote for whatever you believe in,” Oubre said. Alex Lannin, a 53-year-old special-education teacher in Las Vegas, brought Spirit Airlines flight attendant Honey Hunter, 27, of Spokane, Wash., to view the piece. “I would say [it’s] very creative, like a piece of artwork, you know,” Hunter said. She said she was not a Trump supporter and wouldn’t vote for the mogul. Lannin, who also said he’s not a Trump supporter, said he was “a little worried about him getting a sunburn, but other than that, I love it.” Real-estate professional Clem Zeroli, 25, brought his girlfriend Tommi Alexander, 24, to pose together for a selfie at the site. But this pair wasn’t purely positive on the artwork. “It’s not very respectful,” Zeroli said, “but I think it’s kind of funny. Any publicity is good publicity.” Alexander, who works for her family’s Sin City swimming-pool business, said that while she felt compelled to see the piece in person, it won’t change her support for Trump this fall. “As a daughter of business owners, there’s many reasons for us to want him as our president, but we were doing much better under Trump,” she said. “We support a lot of employees, and our business has been doing very badly the past two years,” adding they’ve likely been the worst in the firm’s 30-year history. Fifteen-year-old Anthony Sears, a student at Las Vegas’ Shadow Ridge High School, isn’t old enough to vote but wanted to see a piece of art that’s “not something you see every day.” The high schooler said he “doesn’t really follow politics” and couldn’t say who he’d vote for this year if he could cast a ballot.","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Call it the pop-up that didn’t stay up.

Ohio’s U.S. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate, are scheduled to square off at CBS Broadcast Center in New York City at 9 p.m. Just like the debate already held between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — and the one before that between Trump and President Joe Biden — this debate will go forward without a studio audience. But unlike the Trump Harris debate, both candidates’ microphones will remain unmuted while the other is speaking. Harris’ campaign had requested live mics during her meeting with the 45th President, but Trump demurred and insisted on sticking to the rules that Biden laid out in the debate challenge he issued before he dropped out of the race. Moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan will have the ability to mute the microphones, according to their network, but it will be up to the candidates to fact check each other while maintaining decorum. The candidates are not expected to give opening statements and will argue for 90 minutes, with two four-minute breaks scheduled. Walz, as the candidate representing the incumbent party, is scheduled to speak first, according to CBS. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions — which the network says they will not receive in advance — and a minute for rebuttals. Neither will be allowed to interact with campaign staff during the debate or breaks, and are only permitted access to a notepad, a pen, and a bottle of water. The debate is scheduled to end with two-minute closing statements. After the debate was scheduled, CBS apparently flipped a coin which Vance called correctly. He elected to speak after Walz, meaning he will get the last word. Vance’s final thoughts may be the last time any voter sees these candidates or their running mates on a stage alongside their opponents. After the first presidential debate, CNN indicated it would be willing to host a second contest. Harris accepted, but Trump declined. Tuesday’s debate will be broadcast on CBS, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, NBC, PBS, and Telemundo and will be available on multiple streaming platforms.","summary":"Ohio’s U.S. Sen.

It’s a warm June evening and the place feels like the Platinum Room at Guitar Center, with the walls covered in blond wood and baroque blue wallpaper. It’s his own mini dad-rock mecca. There’s the “engagement guitar” his wife got him after he joked that if she was getting an engagement ring, he wanted another six-string. A phalanx of Gibson hollow bodies and Les Paul Juniors hangs proudly near a custom-made Collings with a paw print on the headstock and a fur-black finish. (It’s named Murray after the family dog, a schnauzer-poodle mix.) And the crown jewel: a lightly modified 1960 sunburst Stratocaster. There are dozens of guitar pedals, vintage tweed Fender amps scattered all over, and a few keyboards and synthesizers tucked under a center table. At least a dozen more guitars are hidden away in closets in the back of the room. Kanter, 51, is a longtime collector and music obsessive who spends his free time recording original songs, a hobby since high school. He studied electronic music while majoring in political science at SUNY Albany in the Nineties and calls himself “a child of New Wave music,” citing Depeche Mode and the Cure as his favorites. He’s also the Joe Biden-appointed assistant attorney general heading up the antitrust division of the Department of Justice. The next morning, Kanter will don a sharp suit and head to the Robert F. Kennedy Building in Washington, D.C., where his team of approximately two dozen attorneys is preparing for trial in one of the most significant antitrust cases in decades: a blockbuster lawsuit that could result in a breakup of the live-music behemoth Live Nation-Ticketmaster. The suit marks one of the first times the DOJ has sought to split up a major corporation since it brought a case against Microsoft in the late 1990s. The DOJ filed its lawsuit against Live Nation in May, alongside 30 attorneys general from red and blue states, accusing the company of operating as a monopoly. (Ten more states joined in August.) Kanter’s antitrust division has taken on giants like Apple and Google — winning a landmark case against the latter over its internet-search dominance — but he says nothing they’ve done has elicited a reaction among consumers and lawmakers alike quite like this. “When we talk to family farmers concerned about meat-packers and processors, we hear the same sort of urgency. Same with health care,” Kanter tells Rolling Stone. “But people love music, and a monopolist is getting in the way of their ability to access it and making their lives more expensive.” The complaint comes at what feels like a peak moment of fan frustration over the concert-going experience. While seeing the biggest artists live has been something of a splurge for decades (see the viral clip of Kurt Cobain reacting with disgust to learn Madonna was charging $50 a ticket in 1993), today it can cost as much as a month’s rent for the priciest tickets — and that’s if you even get through the byzantine purchase process.For the most in-demand shows, seasoned fans know what to expect: Cross your fingers days in advance, hoping to get a Ticketmaster verified fan code that merely gives you the right to wait in a hellish online queue. Assuming technical difficulties from the high traffic don’t kick you out of line or crash the site altogether (condolences if you tried and failed to buy Oasis tickets in August), by the time you reach the lobby, you have to brace for sticker shock. Statistically speaking, the average ticket price for the world’s 10 highest-grossing concerts has risen 26 percent over the past five years, according to research from the trade publication Pollstar. (A ticket to see Drake in 2023, for example, cost $260 on average, up from $116 in 2018.) Combined with the insult of dynamic pricing — the business tactic that can hike the ticket price hundreds of dollars based on demand — and the sense that much of your money is going to surcharges and hidden fees, the rising costs have driven fans mad. (Fees added, on average, another 27 percent to a purchase, according to a 2018 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.) Those who get shut out during the official sale and turn to the secondary ticket market fare no better. Today’s scalpers use bots to game the system and charge double the face value, or more. Prices were so high to catch the U.S. leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in 2023, it was actually more affordable for some American fans to pay for tickets, airfare, and hotel combined to see the pop star in Paris — where scalping is much more regulated — rather than stateside. The cheapest seats Rolling Stone could find on StubHub for Swift’s Oct. 18 show in Miami were nearly $4,000 a pair, including fees. (Ticketmaster isn’t listing resold tickets for Swift’s shows.) When Bruce Springsteen used dynamic pricing for his tour last year, he faced significant criticism from fans who felt he’d abandoned them and his working-class roots. Though his own team said most of the tickets for that tour were below $200, some cost thousands of dollars. The anger was palpable, with fan magazine Backstreets shutting down as publisher Chris Phillips wrote they were “disillusioned” with the ticketing practice. Even artists lament the current state of the market. Last year, Zach Bryan announced he’d play mainly non-Ticketmaster venues for his Burn, Burn, Burn Tour. By September, he’d ended that battle, electing to play Ticketmaster venues for his Quittin’ Time Tour. “All my homies still do hate Ticketmaster but hard to realize one guy can’t change the whole system,” Bryan wrote on X. “It is intentionally broken and I’ll continue to feel absolutely horrible about the cost of tickets in an unfair market.” Not all of these problems are attributable to Live Nation and Ticketmaster, of course. The concert giant has joined indie promoters in calling for lawmakers to more stringently regulate the resale market, and much of the live-music industry supports measures requiring ticket sellers to list fees upfront rather than hide them. The company will also be all too happy to tell you that artists are the ones who set ticket prices. But there’s still a sense that this arm of the music industry is utterly dysfunctional — and that the DOJ’s case could be one big step toward fixing it. “There’s a lot of fans who understand music [is] more than commerce,” says Kevin Erickson, director of the music advocacy nonprofit The Future of Music Coalition, which has publicly called for a Live Nation breakup. “While it relies on having a business infrastructure to be able to operate, it runs deeper than that. It has hugely important personal meaning to so many music fans. The brazen ways that unaccountable private power has taken over live music might be common in other parts of the economy, [but it] reflects that music is special.” “We’re an Exceedingly Modestly Profitable Company” By the time I’m in Kanter’s home studio, it’s been about a month since the Justice Department announced its lawsuit against Live Nation, the culmination of an 18-month investigation into the company’s dominance over the live-music business. The suit paints the concert giant as a mob-like organization, complete with powerful “pimp” and “hammer” enforcers to stifle competitors, exclusivity deals that suffocate other ticketing companies, and threats of withholding artists from venues that dare try their luck with another ticketing provider. Live Nation is unquestionably the most powerful entity in the live-music business. Valued at $25 billion, the company owns and operates hundreds of venues around the world, including a majority of the largest amphitheaters in the U.S. Its promotion business alone pulled in $4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, more than twice as much as its next largest competitor, AEG Presents, according to Pollstar. It’s one of the largest music-management companies, representing 380 artists last year. And thanks to its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster — the exclusive ticketing partner for most of the arenas and stadiums in the United States — it is the largest primary ticketing provider in the industry. It has a foot in the secondary market as well, allowing brokers and scalpers to sell tickets for shows on Ticketmaster’s website. (Live Nation maintains the resale marketplace is a small part of its business.) Despite the fact that the DOJ itself approved that merger nearly 15 years ago (with some strings), it now views it as detrimental to the industry. “We are not here today because Live Nation-Ticketmaster’s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference in May. “We are here because … that conduct is anticompetitive and illegal. We allege that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live-concert industry in the United States for far too long. It is time to break it up.” The DOJ says, in part, that Live Nation is so big it can lure artists into touring contracts with huge payouts that smaller competitors can’t afford. In turn, they say, tickets are becoming more and more expensive as fans absorb the costs of those contracts in fees. Live Nation has vehemently denied the department’s claims, asserting that it only sees a modest amount of the total fees Ticketmaster charges. (Live Nation says venues take two-thirds of ticket fees to cover operation costs for concerts.) Dan Wall, Live Nation’s executive vice president of corporate and regulatory affairs, says the DOJ’s suit “ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices,” such as high production costs, predatory scalping, and even musicians themselves. Speaking with Rolling Stone at Live Nation’s Beverly Hills headquarters, Wall emphasizes that it’s the artists who set ticket prices “fundamentally based on supply and demand.” He also maintains that the driving issue behind high ticket prices is scalpers who use sophisticated bots and dummy accounts to flood the primary market and secure tickets for the most in-demand shows, then gouge fans for those tickets on resale sites. A breakup of Live Nation, Wall says, won’t solve this problem. In a May post on its website rebutting the lawsuit, Live Nation presented data it says shows that its fee earnings and profit margins are far lower than comparable figures for service providers like Uber and tech giants like Meta. “The data conflicted too much with [the DOJ’s] preconception that Live Nation belongs in the ranks of the other ‘tech monopolists’ they have targeted,” Wall, who is also a lecturer on antitrust at University of California, Berkeley’s School of Law, wrote in the post. “At bottom, we are another casualty of this administration’s decision to turn over antitrust enforcement to a populist urge that simply rejects how antitrust law works.” “People love music, and a monopolist is getting in the way of their ability to access it and making their lives more expensive”Jonathan Kanter In Wall’s view, the live-music industry is functioning more or less as it should considering certain market realities. “There’s an ongoing natural experiment out in the world where there’s every combination you can think of — a different promoter, a different ticketing company, a Live Nation venue or non-Live Nation venue — and it doesn’t make any difference on the price of tickets,” Wall says. “J onathan Kanter is being extremely disingenuous in what he says to the American public about ticket prices.” Furthermore, Wall says, the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger made live music a sustainable business given that, separately, both concert promotion and ticketing are historically low-margin businesses. “People think we’re this filthy-rich monopolist when we’re an exceedingly modestly profitable company,” he says. “It’s a good business, but the monopoly narrative has to be reconciled with this…. The irony of all this is that the biggest barrier to taking on Ticketmaster is probably because Ticketmaster doesn’t engage in monopolist pricing the way monopolies are supposed to.” Not everyone is buying Wall’s argument. As one live-music industry insider, who requested anonymity over fear of retaliation from Live Nation, says: “They point the finger everywhere except the mirror.” Fairly or not, pissed-off Swifties certainly blamed the company for the chaotic Eras Tour sale in 2022, which saw long online queues, technical difficulties, and sky-high prices. “Ticketmaster is a multi BILLION dollar company. They knew the demand for these tickets. They need better systems. Fans get let down time after time,” one furious fan tweeted the day tickets went on sale. “‘We put the fans first,’ no you don’t. If you did, you would have this issue solved by now after YEARS of things like this happening.” The situation became a PR disaster that brought the ticketing marketplace back to the national consciousness, as dozens of Swifties filed a class-action lawsuit against Live Nation-Ticketmaster. Though the case was later dismissed, the public outcry did inspire a Senate judiciary committee hearing in which lawmakers scrutinized Live Nation for hours (while making one too many Swift-inspired puns). Asked what he thinks spurred the DOJ’s investigation, Wall cites not the Swifties but complaints from competitors like SeatGeek and AEG. He further states that AEG’s statements on the matter should be taken “with a bucket of salt,” adding, “They’re trying to get what they can out of the legal process.” “While we are flattered that Live Nation believes that AEG can bend the United States Department of Justice to its will, that’s not how the legal system works,” AEG said in a statement. “Yes, Live Nation’s monopolistic business practices hurt AEG. But that’s not what the DOJ’s lawsuit is about. It’s about fostering greater competition for the benefit of artists and fans.” SeatGeek declined to comment for this article. But back when the DOJ first announced the lawsuit, the company said it was “hopeful that the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit to break up the Live Nation-Ticketmaster monopoly will restore fair market competition to live entertainment.” Kanter and the DOJ decline to say if any specific incident spurred the investigation — though they assert that the Eras Tour fiasco did not play a role. Rather, they describe the probe and subsequent lawsuit as the culmination of “a steady stream of concerns coming from both industry and consumers” about Live Nation-Ticketmaster. “When I came in [as assistant attorney general], I asked [staff] about it, and the response I got was a very strong degree of concern that had accumulated over the course of many years,” Kanter says. “It was pushing on an open door.” “Until Recently, The Regulators … Haven’t Been Doing Their Jobs” Live Nation wasn’t always the dominant player in the promotion space. Until the late Nineties, a collection of regional promoters around the country, such as Bill Graham Presents in the Bay Area and Cellar Door Productions in Washington, D.C., had significant control over their respective markets. Then businessman Robert Sillerman started spending billions of dollars to acquire many of those smaller outfits and sold the resulting company to the radio conglomerate Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) in 2000. Clear Channel spun off that business in 2005, establishing the promotion firm now known as Live Nation. From that point on, promotion was a national game — and Live Nation was the de facto concert leader. The company and the live-music industry grew in lockstep through the aughts; as record sales plummeted due to rampant piracy in the digital age, artists turned to touring to make up the losses. By the time Live Nation announced its merger with Ticketmaster in 2009, it had about $4.1 billion in revenue. The internet had other ripple effects. It opened a huge opportunity for ticket resale and scalping, as services like StubHub and Vivid Seats made it easier for brokers, scalpers, and casual ticket holders to resell their tickets online. It’s also made it much easier for fans to voice their frustration with the system and coalesce around their cause. Prior to that, artists had the biggest megaphone in the fight against Ticketmaster. Pearl Jam railed against the company’s service-fee policy way back in 1994, well before the Live Nation merger. The band even went so far as to file an antitrust complaint with the Justice Department. Testifying to Congress, guitarist Stone Gossard called the relationship between promoters and venues “incestuous” and decried “the lack of any national competition for Ticketmaster that has created the situation we’re dealing with today.” (The department closed the investigation the following year with no action.) “If Pearl Jam couldn’t do it,” Rolling Stone wrote in 1995, “who can?” Thirty years later, the DOJ’s lawsuit could finally be a first step toward lower prices. Still, music-industry experts like Erickson say breaking up Live Nation and Ticketmaster isn’t enough. Regulation of the secondary market is crucial to fixing the system, too. “Rampant, unregulated, deceptive, and predatory behavior by secondary sellers [have] added new and innovative forms of dysfunction on top of the existing dysfunction,” Erickson says. “Until recently, the regulators, policymakers, and enforcers who could’ve done something haven’t been doing their jobs. “Live Nation-Ticketmaster is allowed to make the rules and reshape the industry in ways that degrade the experience for fans,” Erickson adds, “and leave artists and venues with fewer options.” Getting industry stakeholders like artists, venue owners, and promoters to be vocal on these issues, however, has been challenging for Kanter’s team. “I’ve been getting a lot of positive feedback at a personal level, but it’s really quiet, and that’s consistent with the trouble we had getting people to speak up,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti tells Kanter on a call in June. “People recognize there’s a problem here, but nobody really wants to stick their head up. But at things like kids’ birthday parties, where [I see] a lot of folks in the industry, I get a lot of grateful feedback.” A DOJ source tells Rolling Stone the department reached out to “A-listers across every genre” who had issues with Ticketmaster in recent years to discuss the lawsuit publicly, but were told it was “too hot for them to weigh in.” (Rolling Stone contacted the 10 highest-grossing touring artists of last year for this story; all either declined to comment or did not respond.) “We Take Our Work Seriously, But Not Ourselves” Under Kanter, the antitrust team has brought a verve not seen in the division in years. The bespectacled, Queens-born attorney has a gravitational pull in his office as a high-energy leader who seldom sits still and has created an irreverent culture in the office. (Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, once described the Kanter-led department to Rolling Stone as “not your grandpa’s DOJ.”) The team refers to its main conference room — where visitors and investigation targets alike meet with the antitrust heads — as “hot sauce,” both a Beyoncé reference and a hint that this is their “situation room.” A bottle of Cholula rests pointedly atop a fireplace mantle there. The room next door is called “mild,” complete with an unopened jar of Tostitos mild salsa. “We take our work seriously, but not ourselves,” says Kanter — and several deputy assistant attorney generals at the antitrust department agree. “Is this typical for how the antitrust department has looked in the past?” I ask John Elias, one of the antitrust division’s deputy assistant attorney generals who’s worked there for over 15 years. “No, definitely not,” he says. Early in his tenure, Kanter had a custom hourglass made, timed to exactly six minutes, a nod to the increments in which the most elite law firms charge for their time. “Their clients like it,” Kanter says. “The lawyers, not so much.” A decal adorning the back of his iPhone features a red circle with a slash over the letters “DB”: It stands for “No Douchebags.” Kanter’s own office is similarly colorful. A Muppet version of Kanter wearing a Mike Wazowski hat from Monsters, Inc. sits right outside the lobby, while a small stuffed version of Kanter’s dog Murray (the antitrust department’s unofficial mascot) rests below, alongside a board game that reads “Anti-Monopoly.” Monopoly imagery is a common theme throughout the office, with about a half-dozen artworks of the board game or its iconic mustachioed mascot, Mr. Monopoly, on display, including in Kanter’s personal restroom. The bookcase behind his desk has several Monopoly pictures and figurines, along with photos of Murray, Kanter’s children, and Fiona, the hippo born prematurely at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Gardens in 2017. On the top shelf is an unopened bottle of Yoo-hoo, a John Lennon figurine, and a Mets cap and bobblehead, all of which Kanter says are there “to remind me of my childhood.” Kanter started his career at the Federal Trade Commission in 1998, then went into private practice and represented companies like Microsoft and Yelp in their antitrust cases against fellow tech giant Google. Eventually, he grew disillusioned with the state of antitrust law, believing that the government had failed to protect its citizens from increasingly powerful tech juggernauts. “To me, the American dream is to own your own house and own your own business. That was the pathway to success,” Kanter says, sitting on a blue leather chair in his office. A Jerry Garcia Funko pop and Kanter’s Ukrainian-American grandfather’s certificate of naturalization sit on a coffee table nearby. “As I went through my career, I realized that what antitrust enforcement was supposed to help preserve — that opportunity — was not doing that, and, in fact, the system was an obstacle. “The power that big companies have can rival governments if not exceed them. That’s not freedom, that’s not opportunity,” he adds. “If you can’t build a business and succeed on your own merits … that’s not a market-based economy, that’s not capitalism. That’s exploitation.” “A Scalpel Rather Than a Sledgehammer” When Live Nation looked to merge with Ticketmaster in 2009, the company argued it was essential to stabilize two rocky businesses — ticketing and concert promotion. It also touted the merger as a lifeline to get artists paid at a time when their royalties were tanking. “The music-industry model that existed when I entered the business is irreparably broken,” Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino told a Senate hearing on the merger in 2009, also pointing toward the extreme growth of the scalping business. “In the old model, the record label supported the artist[s], record sales were the hub, and everything else — concerts, promotion, merchandising — flowed from that.… That model is as obsolete as an eight-track tape.” Rapino wasn’t wrong. Touring has become a much bigger moneymaker in an era where many artists complain of paltry royalty checks off of hundreds of thousands of streams. (One 2022 study from the American Economics Liberties Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank that has called for a Live Nation breakup, noted that touring makes up roughly 95 percent of a musician’s income.) For rising and mid-tier artists, touring expenses still make earning a living on the road difficult. Today, no one is writing bigger checks to touring artists than Live Nation. Competitors voiced their concerns quickly, arguing that Live Nation had already monopolized the promotion space more or less since its inception. But the DOJ allowed the merger anyway. Supposed safeguards were put into place, most notably a “consent decree” that said Live Nation couldn’t retaliate against other venues by withholding artists’ shows if they used another ticketing company. Christine Varney, the assistant attorney general who greenlit the merger, called the agreement “vigorous antitrust enforcement — only with a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer.” Varney added that the settlement “allowed us to secure a package of remedies that mitigated consumer harm while still allowing the parties to prove that together they could discount, innovate, or otherwise benefit the live-music industry and its fans.” Critics blasted the decision — and point to the current situation as evidence that their concerns were justified. David Balto, a longtime antitrust lawyer who worked at the DOJ in the Nineties, represented several of Live Nation’s competitors at the time. Balto fervently opposed the merger, testifying before a 2009 Senate Judiciary committee and meeting with the DOJ several times to warn about potential fallout for the industry. “There were clear competitive concerns, but this was a timid agency unwilling to test the limits of the law,” Balto says. “The paycheck of a staff attorney in the antitrust division says ‘trial attorney.’ Their job is to go to trial. Their job is not to interpret a consent decree and figure out how to regulate a market.” Nancy Prager, a lawyer who worked with antitrust attorneys in 2009 to block the merger, calls the anti-retaliation agreement “incredibly frustrating.” “The merger should never have been allowed to happen, and now, 14 years later, that error has been recognized,” Prager says. After speaking to the DOJ at the time, she says, she felt it was failing to properly consider all of the many businesses the combined company would oversee. “The Department of Justice failed in two ways. They really didn’t understand the industry they were working with,” she says. “And they didn’t understand the magnitude of the monopolies that were already in place. They just really missed it altogether.” “We are another casualty of this administration’s decision to turn over antitrust enforcement to a populist urge that simply rejects how antitrust law works.”Live Nation’s Dan Wall Balto and the live-music industry insider recall being summoned to the DOJ’s office soon after the merger confirmation. The insider remembers the Justice Department lawyers framing the consent decree as a key victory in stabilizing the market and staving off the industry’s concerns. “We all looked at each other in there just thinking, ‘This is bullshit,’” the insider says. The following few years weren’t any more comforting for Live Nation’s critics, who’ve only felt more strongly that the merger has warped the industry. The company faced a DOJ investigation in 2018 over retaliation allegations from several venues, settling the claims in 2020 and extending the consent decree to 2025. But retaliation allegations surface in the government’s new complaint as well. In the lawsuit, the DOJ points to one major venue ending a contract with SeatGeek to return to Ticketmaster, claiming Live Nation withheld shows at the venue. (Wall denies those claims, alleging that tech issues on SeatGeek’s platform led to the switch. The low number of retaliation claims the DOJ had cited since the consent decree started “has proven a very, very high degree of compliance, not of non-compliance,” he says.) Live Nation-Ticketmaster competitors say that even the potential for retaliation keeps venues from signing with other ticketers, which they say further proves the DOJ’s previous efforts at deterrence didn’t help. As one former ticketing executive who’d spoken with the DOJ during its investigation tells Rolling Stone, the company doesn’t need to spell out the pluses and minuses of going with Ticketmaster — in fact, they’re better off not being explicit, lest their business proposition be viewed as a threat. “Venues don’t have to be told [what would happen],” the former executive says. “Ticketmaster reps are probably told not to say [anything]. Many venues look at it as beneficial [to deal with them] knowing you’ll get more shows.” “There’s just no reason we should have had to settle for this,” says Erickson. “The only reason is that the people whose job it was [to regulate the industry] let themselves get blinded by this toxic faith in unregulated markets that ended up meaning the corporations have been making the rules.” “This Is Going to Be a Blip” Once an aggressive trust-busting force, the DOJ grew more conservative in the cases it pursued over the past 40 years, giving way to looser regulation and allowing the markets some autonomy. While the antitrust department is reportedly considering a breakup of Google, big swings like that are far from the norm. Throughout the 2000s, several current and former DOJ employees tell Rolling Stone, it was relatively unheard of for the antitrust division to challenge mergers at all. “You need[ed] clear and convincing evidence that a merger is going to produce bad results [like] higher prices, lower output, lower quality, and if you have any doubt about that, you’re better off not enforcing,” Bill Baer, the former assistant attorney general who took over just after the Live Nation merger, says over coffee in the cafeteria at the Brookings Institution, the public-policy nonprofit where he is now a visiting fellow. Another former DOJ lawyer familiar with the department’s 2018 Live Nation inquiry praised Varney for putting up any resistance to the merger at all. “She pushed for there to be relief at a time where these sorts of cases and challenges were not in vogue,” the executive, who requested anonymity, says. “People like to look back and be critical, but at the time, she was deemed aggressive for even pushing for the decree.” To Balto, Varney would’ve gone harder on Live Nation during those proceedings, but she was limited by a staff uncertain they could win. “The staff was like, ‘No we can’t do this, we’re going to lose,’” Balto adds. “But what’s the harm in losing?” Back then, regulators were optimistic that those consent decrees would protect the markets. However bullish Varney’s move was perceived to be at the time, today, all the antitrust attorneys Rolling Stone spoke with agree that the consent decree didn’t work as intended. “Live Nation subtly and increasingly not-so-subtly found ways to evade the commitments they’d made. That’s why my successor under Trump went after them,” Baer says. “Arguably, he should’ve sued for a breakup then because they already demonstrated you can’t trust them to honor their commitments.” “They cut off all the different vectors, and they all work together.”Jonathan Kanter Wall says he doesn’t expect the antitrust division’s hardened stance under Kanter to last when his tenure is done. “This is going to be a blip,” he says. “Antitrust has been one of the few areas of business regulation that has been marked by a fundamental bipartisan consensus on what the rules are and what the goals are. This group who’s in office right now is challenging that consensus, and when they’re gone, the consensus reestablishes itself.” (Asked about Wall’s claim, Kanter says that “the work that we’re doing is the current consensus.”) “There is a pattern here of wanting to bring big-impact monopoly cases against the companies that have platforms,” Wall continues. “There’s nothing in the four corners of this lawsuit that we couldn’t have potentially settled and compromised. Jonathan Kanter wanted nothing to do with settlement negotiations that were going to get in the way of filing this case.” In some ways, it feels like Kanter’s department is seeking to undo the very work his predecessors did over a decade ago when they allowed the merger to take place. Asked directly if he feels the DOJ made a mistake, Kanter is guarded. “You have to focus on what’s in front of you,” he says. “Our case isn’t about a merger; it’s about what happened after a merger.” Still, he says, “We take a clear-eyed look at the facts to determine if there’s a problem. And if there is a problem, we call it like we see it.” Does Kanter think anything short of an absolute Ticketmaster-Live Nation breakup will remedy the situation? “We were very clear in our lawsuit and in our statement around our lawsuit about what we think the proper remedy is,” he says. Meaning: A breakup is necessary. “We are not that direct in all of our cases.” “Abuse, Exploitation, and Self-Dealing” The DOJ’s investigation moved quickly. As Kanter and multiple other DOJ officials confirm, the team had already been several months into their investigation by the time the Eras Tour debacle unfolded in November 2022. Both he and his principal deputy assistant attorney general, Doha Mekki, say it had little impact on how they would handle the rest of their inquiry. “If you had seen what we’d already seen at that point, [the Eras Tour] did not strike me as any notable event in our investigation,” Mekki says. “Ticketmaster had its explanation for what happened. Obviously, there are times where demand outstrips supply. That’s just the way the market works. Our claim was about something different; [it was] about abuse, exploitation, and self-dealing.” Mekki is referencing Live Nation’s so-called “flywheel” model, a complex web of interconnected businesses under its control where the more profitable sectors, like ticketing and sponsorship from corporations and advertisers, subsidize its less profitable concert-promotion business. The DOJ asserts that that puts smaller competitors without multifaceted businesses at an unfair disadvantage. Wall calls that flywheel argument “all rhetoric.” He acknowledges that it’s much harder for competing companies to thrive without vertical integration — a strategy where companies have their hands in multiple aspects of a business, like, in Live Nation’s case, ticketing, promotion, and artist management — but adds that Live Nation’s largest competitors operate this way as well. “Everybody is vertically integrated in this industry, and that is because these pieces by themselves are not very profitable industries. You have to find the efficiencies of combining them to be a competitor.” The lawsuit says Live Nation has dominated the market through its exclusivity agreements with venues. Many venues happily sign the deal both for cash advances Ticketmaster will provide them and to avoid the headache of dealing with more than one ticketer at shows. But the DOJ alleges that the Ticketmaster exclusives are predatory. According to the department, the deals shut out competing ticketing companies for years as they wait for contracts to end so they can get in the ring. The DOJ also claims Live Nation colluded with the venue developer Oak View Group (OVG), which acted as a “pimp” and “hammer” enforcer to get more venues to use Ticketmaster. (Neither Oak View Group, co-founded by industry titan and former Ticketmaster chairman Irving Azoff, nor any of its executives are listed as defendants in the lawsuit. A rep for Oak View Group declined to comment.) The department filing includes emails between Live Nation CEO Rapino and another OVG co-founder in which Rapino reprimands OVG after the company put in an offer to promote an artist’s show, with Rapino claiming such an action would only cause the artist’s team to start asking for higher compensation. “What’s up?” Rapino wrote. “We have done his [touring] and vegas[.] Let’s make sure we don’t let [the artist agency] now start playing us off.” Further, the DOJ alleges that in at least one instance, Live Nation violated the 2010 consent decree by withholding shows from venues that use services other than Ticketmaster. “The longer the conduct goes on, and the more entrenched the company is, the more widespread the behavior,” Kanter says. By the fall of 2023, the DOJ believed it had enough evidence against Live Nation for a potential antitrust complaint. It just wasn’t sure how to present it in a lawsuit. Kanter says a flux capacitor helped officials reach their conclusion. In almost any other context, the device that helps Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time in Back to the Future is merely the stuff of science fiction: a Y-shaped light device attached in the back of a DeLorean. But at the DOJ, it’s real. Kind of. “Doc Brown says this is what makes time travel possible, but this is what makes monopolization cases possible,” Kanter says. In the antitrust division, “flux capacitor” means identifying changes that target the core of a monopoly rather than its symptoms. As I follow Kanter to several events in which he talks about antitrust in agriculture, artificial intelligence, or media, the philosophical through line is the same: A lack of competition in the marketplace will trickle down to the entire ecosystem around it, and stopping it requires more robust antitrust action. In the Live Nation case, the “flux capacitor” would mean targeting their “flywheel” and, as Kanter says, breaking up the company. “If you want the promoter, you have to use the ticketing. If you want access to the venue, you have to use the ticketing,” Kanter explains. “If you want access to the artist, you have to use the ticketing and the promoter. They cut off all the different vectors, and they all work together.” The flux-capacitor theory is so crucial to the DOJ’s work that Kanter keeps a printed-out image of the fictional device on his desk. To prove the point, he pulls two deputies into the office, one at a time, quizzing them quickly on what the flux capacitor is. Without missing a beat, both give virtually the same answer: more aggressive antitrust policy. This DOJ views monopolistic companies like an octopus, with many tentacles holding a vise grip over every aspect of a business it feeds on. Mekki and another executive within the antitrust division have octopus plush toys in their office to reinforce the metaphor. In an earlier era, they’d go after “the tentacles,” Kanter says. But, Mekki says, pointing at the octopus in the corner of her office, “If you cut off the tentacle, you’ve still got an octopus.” “They grow back,” Kanter interjects. “But if you go for the head … ” she says, not having to finish the sentence. There’s no certainty that the DOJ will prevail in its case, or that a divestment of Ticketmaster and Live Nation would drastically change the experience for consumers. Kanter and his team are also weeks away from an election that could find a new president cleaning house entirely. Such a move seems all but inevitable if Donald Trump wins, and it’s unclear if Kamala Harris would maintain the status quo with the Joe Biden appointee or install a new team. Still, Kanter and Mekki seem unperturbed, pointing to the bipartisan support this suit has drawn. “Ticketmaster is our attempt to say that in this industry … it’s not just about the venues. It’s not just about the promoter. It’s not just about workers. It all works together to basically take money from consumers, and often [take] away from artists, who the market should be rewarding,” Mekki says. “More of it gets sucked out in the middle, and it always comes up Live Nation.”","summary":"The Justice Department has accused the live-music behemoth of “abuse, exploitation, and self-dealing.” Live Nation says the DOJ is “being extremely disingenuous” about why the system is broken.

Harris, whose campaign plans were disrupted by the disaster, cut her trip short to return to Washington and monitor the federal response.President Joe Biden announced that he had communicated with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina following the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene on their states and expressed his intention to visit the state later in the week, likely on Wednesday or Thursday.

We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people – our strength – from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.” That the truth Reagan spoke is obvious makes it no less important to remember, especially these days, when Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are basing their attempt to return Trump to the White House on the hope that they can gin up hatred toward immigrants. Reagan wasn’t the first American president to emphasize that all of us, other than perhaps Native Americans, are the very people whom hate-peddlers hope to demonize. “Every American who ever lived, with the exception of one group, was either an immigrant himself or a descendant of immigrants,” wrote then-Senator John F. Kennedy in his 1958 essay “A Nation of Immigrants.” Trump’s campaign speeches are blustery, falsehood-filled and increasingly indecipherable affairs, but what is clear is that he hopes to capitalize on xenophobia. Bigotry toward immigrants has persisted here for nearly 200 years, and the pitch of those hoping to exploit it has always remained the same: “Look at them, they’re different, please hate them.” It’s always been ugly, and it’s always been dumb, since virtually all of us or our forebears have been subjected to this stuff. You don’t have to look to your right and your left to see immigrants or their descendants, as both Reagan and Kennedy pointed out. You need only look in the mirror. Trump’s intensified effort to get Americans to broadly hate the “other” comes, ironically enough, in the middle of Hispanic Heritage Month, but isn’t new for him. He has repeatedly referred to those coming here from elsewhere as “animals,” part of an “invasion” that “has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across the land.” This past weekend he accused those who enter the United States without proper documentation of wanting to “rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States.” Referring to immigrants generally, Trump repurposed the age-old demagoguery that those who came before us endured. “They can’t even speak English,” he ranted. “They don’t even know what country they’re in.” He harbors a particular animus toward Haitians, evidently. “We have hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Haiti,” Trump railed in 2021. “Many of these people will probably have AIDS and they’re coming into the country.” At his recent debate with Kamala Harris, Trump’s anti-Haitian bigotry was obscured only by his historic propensity to recite hooey. Referencing a wholly debunked rumor out of Springfield, Ohio, he claimed that Haitian residents lawfully living there “are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating – they’re eating – they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.” Trump has quadrupled-down on this, not so much a dog whistle as a bullhorn meant to stoke irrational hatred. Springfield’s mayor and Ohio’s governor, both Republicans, pronounced Trump’s claim false. Vance admitted the same. Even Trump acolyte Vivek Ramaswamy conceded gingerly “Having gone to Springfield, I don’t see that evidence.” But real damage is being done. Springfield has been hit with over 30 bomb threats. Colleges, elementary schools and government offices have been shut down, an entire community terrorized and terrified. We are not talking about border security here. Trump has already seen to it that a bipartisan bill aimed at improving that went nowhere in Congress. We’re talking about basic human decency, and whether, going forward, America will try to honor it.

At least 121 deaths in six states have been attributed to the storm — a toll that climbed Monday as a clearer picture emerged of the devastation it inflicted on an area stretching from Florida's Gulf Coast northward to the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia. More than 600 are missing. On her SiriusXM show Monday, Kelly wondered why Harris was hobnobbing with the stars instead of tending to those left behind. 'Last night, well into the devastation, the loss of life, men, women, children, pets, the entire devastation and destruction of communities, Kamala Harris attended an LA fundraiser,' she said. The stars in sight that evening included Stevie Wonder Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling Brown, Demi Lovato, Jessica Alba, Lily, Tomlin, Alanis Morissette, and Halle Bailey. Kelly remarked: 'The devastation was ongoing. How dare she!' Harris is cancelling her planned campaign stops for Monday in order to return to Washington D.C. for briefings on Hurricane Helene. She will leave Las Vegas in the morning and be in Washington for a briefing at FEMA on Monday afternoon, according to her campaign. She will also visit the devastated areas when it won't disrupt the emergency response efforts. Kelly was no kinder to Joe Biden, who has insisted he's taken charge in the wake of the disaster while claiming he won't visit until he can avoid being a distraction. 'He spent the weekend in Delaware at his beach house, but great I'm glad that now that it's Monday and we're between 11 and 4, he's actually taking it seriously. I'm sorry, but get off your beach and get to work… He says he wants to avoid being a distraction, and therefore expects to be there later this week,' she said. 'I'm just going to say it. I don't believe him. I don't believe he's worried about being a distraction that can be an issue with presidents. I believe he's tired. He didn't get off his a** until late in this crisis.' Donald Trump has ridiculed Harris for 'pretending' to work on Hurricane Helene disaster relief in a photo posted on her social media. An image posted on Harris's X account Sunday shows the VP aboard a plane with headphones while seemingly on a call while she studiously writes on paper in front of her. The post even mentioned how she was coordinating with North Carolina's governor to help the state's recovery efforts. However, Trump pointed out a glaring issue with the photo. 'You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social app, pointing out the headphone she's wearing isn't attached to her phone on the desk. 'Another fake and staged photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing.' However, the angle of the image does not provide a sight-line to the port in the VP's phone, raising the possibility that her headphones were in fact plugged in to the device. The earphone's cord falls straight down seemingly on the VP's lap and not onto the phone one the table before her, also meaning there could be a second phone involved in this latest scandal. The photo appearing to show Harris hard at work on the phone is captioned: 'I was just briefed by [FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell] on the latest developments about the ongoing impacts of Hurricane Helene. We also discussed our Administration's continued actions to support emergency response and recovery.' 'I also spoke with [Gov. Roy] Cooper about the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in North Carolina,' the post continued. 'Our Administration will continue to stay in constant contact with state and local officials to ensure communities have the support and resources they need.' Harris has yet to visit any of the states impacted by the tragic and deadly storm. Trump, on the other hand, went to Valdosta, Georgia, to tour damage done by Helene on Monday afternoon. He spoke to those impacted by the storm and helped distribute goods to those in attendance. The former president, in addition to ripping her for the 'staged' photo, slammed Harris for letting Americans drown. 'Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan,' Trump's post continued. 'They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.' Biden said he expects to visit the areas devastated by Hurricane Helene this week as he defended spending the weekend at his beach house when the storm hit. 'I've told the governor of North Carolina I'll go down and I expect to be down there by Wednesday or Thursday when it is clear for me,' he told reporters at the White House. 'I'm committed to traveling to impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now,' he noted. The president became defensive when asked how he was in command while spending the weekend at his Rehoboth Beach vacation home while the hurricane was devastating parts of the South. 'I was commanding, I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday, and the day before, as well. I commanded, it's called a telephone,' he said. He noted he spoke with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina, two of the states hardest hit by the storm. Roads and I-64, a major interstate, have been wiped out in parts of these areas, making it difficult to bring in necessary supplies. Local and federal officials, along with the National Guard, are racing to bring relief. More than 460,000 people are without power and more than 1,000 had taken refuge in 24 shelters. Search and rescue teams from 19 states and the US government have converged on North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said, adding that some roads could take months to repair. Damage estimates ranged from $15billion to more than $100billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend, as water systems, communications and critical transportation routes were affected. Property damage and lost economic output will become clearer as officials assess the destruction. Roughly 2.7 million customers throughout the South were without power on Sunday, a US Energy Department official said, down 40 per cent from Friday after unprecedented storm surges, ferocious winds and perilous conditions extended hundreds of miles inland.","summary":"Megyn Kelly trashed Kamala Harris for attending a fundraiser full of Hollywood elites instead of heading to the areas affected by Hurricane Helene.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13909095/Megyn-Kelly-blasts-Kamala-attending-star-studded-fundraiser-hurricane-disaster.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/30/23/90289831-0-image-m-15_1727737129908.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:41:42","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

At least 121 deaths in six states have been attributed to the storm — a toll that climbed Monday as a clearer picture emerged of the devastation it inflicted on an area stretching from Florida's Gulf Coast northward to the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia. More than 600 are missing. On her SiriusXM show Monday, Kelly wondered why Harris was hobnobbing with the stars instead of tending to those left behind. 'Last night, well into the devastation, the loss of life, men, women, children, pets, the entire devastation and destruction of communities, Kamala Harris attended an LA fundraiser,' she said. The stars in sight that evening included Stevie Wonder Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling Brown, Demi Lovato, Jessica Alba, Lily, Tomlin, Alanis Morissette, and Halle Bailey. Kelly remarked: 'The devastation was ongoing. How dare she!' Harris is cancelling her planned campaign stops for Monday in order to return to Washington D.C. for briefings on Hurricane Helene. She will leave Las Vegas in the morning and be in Washington for a briefing at FEMA on Monday afternoon, according to her campaign. She will also visit the devastated areas when it won't disrupt the emergency response efforts. Kelly was no kinder to Joe Biden, who has insisted he's taken charge in the wake of the disaster while claiming he won't visit until he can avoid being a distraction. 'He spent the weekend in Delaware at his beach house, but great I'm glad that now that it's Monday and we're between 11 and 4, he's actually taking it seriously. I'm sorry, but get off your beach and get to work… He says he wants to avoid being a distraction, and therefore expects to be there later this week,' she said. 'I'm just going to say it. I don't believe him. I don't believe he's worried about being a distraction that can be an issue with presidents. I believe he's tired. He didn't get off his a** until late in this crisis.' Donald Trump has ridiculed Harris for 'pretending' to work on Hurricane Helene disaster relief in a photo posted on her social media. An image posted on Harris's X account Sunday shows the VP aboard a plane with headphones while seemingly on a call while she studiously writes on paper in front of her. The post even mentioned how she was coordinating with North Carolina's governor to help the state's recovery efforts. However, Trump pointed out a glaring issue with the photo. 'You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!' Trump wrote on his Truth Social app, pointing out the headphone she's wearing isn't attached to her phone on the desk. 'Another fake and staged photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing.' However, the angle of the image does not provide a sight-line to the port in the VP's phone, raising the possibility that her headphones were in fact plugged in to the device. The earphone's cord falls straight down seemingly on the VP's lap and not onto the phone one the table before her, also meaning there could be a second phone involved in this latest scandal.

Overall, Silver's forecast on Monday found that Trump improved by 0.7 percentage points in Pennsylvania and 0.4 percentage points in Michigan over the past week.Harris still leads in both battleground states on average, although Silver noted that there is a clear gap between state polling and the vice president's overall lead across national polls. While Harris is up 3.2 points on Trump as of Monday, per Silver's tracking, she is only ahead by 1.2 points in Pennsylvania on average. Similarly, in Michigan, Harris is up by 1.8 points.Silver noted in Monday's edition of the Silver Bulletin that the gap is a sign that the Electoral College \"is still a big net disadvantage for Democrats.\" Nevertheless, Silver's model still favors Harris to win the necessary 270 electoral votes in November, giving her a 55.1 percent chance of victory this fall. In comparison, as of Monday, Trump was given a 44.7 percent chance of winning a second term in the White House.Harris also maintains a slight lead across national polls per FiveThirtyEight's tracking, which finds the vice president up 48.5 percent to 45.7 percent on average as of Monday afternoon. With less than 40 days until Election Day, the race is much too close to call a clear winner.The 2024 race is set up to be one of the closest presidential races in U.S. history, and experts are closely watching the contests in seven states in the final weeks, although as FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley wrote in a report on Monday, the results in November will likely eventually come down to a single \"tipping-point\" state: Pennsylvania.\"Looking at 538's forecast, the most likely tipping-point state across all scenarios for the 2024 election is Pennsylvania,\" Skelley wrote. \"In 18 out of 100 cases, the Keystone State provides the winning electoral votes for either Harris or Trump.\"Silver also predicts Pennsylvania has the highest chance—31 percent—of tipping the election.","summary":"Both Michigan and Pennsylvania shifted toward former President Trump over the past week, per Silver's election model.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-latest-projection-shows-key-swing-state-shifts-1961694","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2484143/nate-silver-key-swing-state-shifts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:36:42","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":257999414,"title":"Hundreds Missing in Mountain Towns as Historic Flooding and Destruction Follow Hurricane Helene | Capitol Report","text":"Sep-30-2024 We have the latest on the federal response to Hurricane Helene and how the death toll could be much higher than anticipated.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Hannah Mcdonald Published:00:24 BST, 1 October 2024 |Updated:00:30 BST, 1 October 2024 e-mail View comments Romeo Beckham took to the Paris Fashion Week catwalk for the Balenciaga show as he cemented his foray into fashion. It was revealed earlier this month that Romeo had reportedly left his Premier League football club, despite being offered a new contract by Brentford FC in June, to pursue a fashion career. The middle Beckham son, 22, looked stylish as he walked the show in a blue striped polo shirt and a pair of baggy jeans. He completed his ensemble with a pair huge silver moon boot shoes and visor-style sunglasses. Also in attendance for the show was Amelia Gray Hamlin, who looked chic in an oversized black trench coats and wide-leg pants. Her appearance came days after her and Romeo were spotted sneaking out of a London Fashion Week bash. After the show, Romeo enjoyed a dinner at Hotel Costes in the French capital - continuing to rep Balenciaga in a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms and an oversized hoodie. Romeo Beckham took to the Paris Fashion Week catwalk for the Balenciaga show on Monday as he cemented his foray into fashion The middle Beckham son, 22, looked stylish as he walked the show in a blue striped polo shirt and a pair of baggy jeans He also donned a black beanie hat and light purple trainers to complete his look. Fully committing to fashion, Romeo recently signed with top Paris fashion agency Safe Management. A promising football prospect in his youth, Romeo drifted away from the game after being released by Arsenal in 2015 and turned his attention towards a career in tennis. However, Romeo announced he intended on a return to football in 2020 before joining dad David's MLS franchise Inter Miami the following year. Romeo's first big break in the fashion world came when he was just 10-years-old as he took his first modelling assignment for Burberry. Following in his mother's footsteps from a young age, Romeo was undaunted on set as was described 'amazing, incredible and a little joy' who kept everyone entertained as he was 'bouncing around'. His passion for fashion was cemented from an early age as he accompanied Victoria on shoots and mingling amongst a host of top designers. A favourite of the brand, Romeo returned to film a Christmas advert with the designer two years later as he wore the classic Burberry trench along with a smart Burberry scarf and umbrella. After the show, Romeo enjoyed a dinner at Hotel Costes in the French capital - continuing to rep Balenciaga He sported a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms and an oversized hoodie Also in attendance for the show was Amelia Gray Hamlin, who looked chic in an oversized black trench coats and wide-leg pants Her appearance came days after her and Romeo were spotted sneaking out of a London Fashion Week bash Then at just 12-year-old Romeo made his debut in the GQ's best-dressed men list - 21 places above his father. In 2015 the child star was ranked at 25th in the prestigious best-dressed list, outshining his famous father who only managed 46th. Romeo added another string to his bow when he released his debut cover shoot with celebrated fashion bible L’Uomo Vogue back in 2021. Collaborating with fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the collection of shots captured Romeo modelling a mixture of designer and vintage clothing. Sporting platinum blonde locks, Romeo modelled a bespoke look created exclusively by stylist Louis Ghewy. In keeping with the shoot's notably casual theme, the teenager wears an oversized green cardigan and grey joggers, teamed with distinctive black leather boots from Italian fashion house Prada. Romeo unveiled his modelling campaign for GQ Korea back in 2022 when he featured on the cover of the magazine. The star, who was then 19, looked a natural on the black-and-white cover as he sported a denim waistcoat.

The stylist opted for thick white socks to be pulled up over Romeo's trouser leg, as he slipped into a pair of cream laced shoes. Romeo is also a regular in attendance at the British Fashion Awards after making his first joint red carpet appearance with his former girlfriend Mia Regan at the event back in 2021. Romeo displayed his modelling prowess as he posed for PUMA's launch of the 180 sneaker collection back in August 2023. The star rocked a double denim co-ord for the shoot consisting of a faded denim jacket and a pair of baggy faded denim jeans. Donning a plain white vest underneath Romeo showcased the brand's iconic white sneaker which featured panels of brown corduroy for a luxe feel.

Fully committing to fashion, Romeo recently signed with top Paris fashion agency Safe Management. A promising football prospect in his youth, Romeo drifted away from the game after being released by Arsenal in 2015 and turned his attention towards a career in tennis. However, Romeo announced he intended on a return to football in 2020 before joining dad David's MLS franchise Inter Miami the following year. Romeo's first big break in the fashion world came when he was just 10-years-old as he took his first modelling assignment for Burberry. Following in his mother's footsteps from a young age, Romeo was undaunted on set as was described 'amazing, incredible and a little joy' who kept everyone entertained as he was 'bouncing around'. His passion for fashion was cemented from an early age as he accompanied Victoria on shoots and mingling amongst a host of top designers. A favourite of the brand, Romeo returned to film a Christmas advert with the designer two years later as he wore the classic Burberry trench along with a smart Burberry scarf and umbrella.

In 2015 the child star was ranked at 25th in the prestigious best-dressed list, outshining his famous father who only managed 46th. Romeo added another string to his bow when he released his debut cover shoot with celebrated fashion bible L’Uomo Vogue back in 2021. Collaborating with fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the collection of shots captured Romeo modelling a mixture of designer and vintage clothing. Sporting platinum blonde locks, Romeo modelled a bespoke look created exclusively by stylist Louis Ghewy. In keeping with the shoot's notably casual theme, the teenager wears an oversized green cardigan and grey joggers, teamed with distinctive black leather boots from Italian fashion house Prada. Romeo unveiled his modelling campaign for GQ Korea back in 2022 when he featured on the cover of the magazine. The star, who was then 19, looked a natural on the black-and-white cover as he sported a denim waistcoat.

Romeo is also a regular in attendance at the British Fashion Awards after making his first joint red carpet appearance with his former girlfriend Mia Regan at the event back in 2021. Romeo displayed his modelling prowess as he posed for PUMA's launch of the 180 sneaker collection back in August 2023. The star rocked a double denim co-ord for the shoot consisting of a faded denim jacket and a pair of baggy faded denim jeans.

Brian Kemp was “having a hard time getting the president on the phone,” adding it’s “irresponsible” of Trump to imply “that we're not doing everything possible” to help the victims of Hurricane Helene, which ravaged southern states over the weekend. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks after meeting with North Carolina ... [+] Governor Roy Cooper, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall on the ongoing response to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in the Oval Office of the White House on September 30, 2024 in Washington, DC. The President has said he plans to travel to North Carolina on Wednesday as authorities face challenges delivering supplies to isolated, flood-ravaged areas in the Southeastern United States as the death toll from Hurricane Helene tops 100. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Trump told reporters Monday in Georgia “the federal government is not being very responsive” and alleged Kemp was having a hard time reaching Biden—despite Kemp previously saying he had spoken to Biden, who he said told him “if there’s [anything else] we need just to call him directly.” “I get so angry about it,” Biden said of Trump’s claims, adding “I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need.” The president went on to say: “He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are.” Trump has been slamming the government’s response to Helene, accused Biden of “sleeping” instead of responding to people in need and criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for not immediately traveling to damaged areas.

Surprising Fact Despite Trump’s criticism of Biden and Harris not getting to the disaster zones sooner, two former FEMA directors told Politico on Monday it’s often better to wait in situations like this, and The Washington Post also spoke to disaster experts who said it can be complicated to visit too soon after because of how presidential travel and logistics can disrupt response efforts. Key Background Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend as a Category 4 storm on Thursday before northward, bringing “historic and catastrophic flooding” to the southern Appalachians. The storm killed more than 130 people, according to the Associated Press, and the death toll is expected to continue rising. An estimated 2 million people were still without power on Monday afternoon, CNN reported, and hundreds of people across six southern states—Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee—were reportedly still unaccounted for.

A tragic final photo has emerged of grandparents sitting on the roof of their North Carolina home surrounding by raging floodwaters as they waited for rescuers to arrive Their daughter Meghan took this photo moments before the entire home collapsed killing the couple and their grandson Seven-year-old Micah was with his grandparents when he drowned. His mother, Megan Drye, was able to survive after she became wedged between something, stopping her drowning Tragically the pair, along with their grandson drowned after the roof eventually gave way no longer able to withstand the force of the torrent. Somehow Megan managed to survive after she became trapped between something and was able to keep her head above water. She was rescued one hour later and is now recovering in intensive care. Detailing the encounter on Facebook, sister Jessica shared her sadness at what had happened. 'I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through nor imagine the pain before us. Please lift my sister who lost her son up in prayers and my other sister and myself as we come together to somehow comfort her and get through each moment banded together.' The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. The destruction and desperation across North Carolina in particular appears to be unimaginable. A part of Asheville is pictured The North Carolina mountain town of Asheville has faced a massive amount of destruction following Hurricane Helene Flood damage caused by the storm that hit Asheville, North Carolina can be seen from above A flattened cargo container sat atop a bridge crossing a river with muddy brown water. Overturned pontoon boats and splintered wooden docks and tree trunks covered the surface of a picturesque lake tucked between the mountains. The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer died after being submerged inside his truck. Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation. Those Western North Carolina residents who survived Helene faced a 'post-apocalyptic' landscape on Monday, with hundreds of people still missing and residents struggling amid flooded roads and a lack of basic services. More than 128 deaths across a half-dozen states have been attributed to the powerful storm that slammed into Florida's Big Bend region late on Thursday before cutting a destructive path through Georgia and into the Carolinas. The federal government has declared a major disaster for 25 North Carolina counties, promising aid and reimbursement for local agencies A thick layer of mud blankets the entire area in Swannanoa, North Carolina Homes have been torn from foundations, thrown upside-down or split in half in Swannanoa The once-picturesque town now lies in ruins. Cars can be seen perched in tree limbs along the flooded Swannanoa River As many as 600 people remain missing, U.S. Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall said at the White House, though she noted that the numbers could vary as responders reach more locations. Either way, the death toll is likely to rise, officials said. Residents in devastated communities found themselves isolated by flooded roads and a lack of running water, power and cell phone service. In mountainous Buncombe County, which includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, 35 people have died The county was set to begin distributing food and water to residents later in the day. Some supplies had to be airlifted to the region with most major routes blocked by mudslides and flooding. 'They're running out of gas for ATVs that are helping the rescue, they're also running out of gas for the chainsaws,' said Colleen Burns, 58, whose house is near Burnsville, in neighboring Yancey County. 'We desperately need gas.' The brutal onslaught of Hurricane Helene has left the small mountain town of Swannanoa, North Carolina , in ruins - with locals describing the community as 'entirely erased' Volunteers stage water for people in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville A gas natural gas tank lies with other debris on a train bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Carrie Owenby looks at her phone as a neighbor with power dropped an extension cord for neighbors who have no power in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Volunteers stage water for citizens in the aftermath of Helene in Asheville A worker moves debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Debris is seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville People wait to get water at Mountain Valley Water in the aftermath of Helene in West Asheville Flood debris from Hurricane Helene floats by in Rutherford County, North Carolina Elsewhere in Yancey, the storm snapped century-old trees around the home of Taylor Shelton, 44. It took her husband two days with a chainsaw to cut a passage through the felled trees in their driveway and the nearby road so they could drive themselves and their three children out of the darkened house. With no phone service, they relied on a neighbor who works as an EMT and had a walkie-talkie to help them determine which back roads out of the mountains were passable. 'The devastation is unbelievable,' she said. They were attempting to drive back home on Monday to pick up their dog and two guinea pigs and leave out food for the cat and the chickens. Their car was loaded with coffee, donuts and diapers for their neighbors. 'It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,' she said. 'We saw houses that are just washed away.' She has still not been able to reach her husband's parents, who live in the nearby town of Burnsville, which was also badly hit. Lake Lure, around 20 miles southeast of Asheville, was covered with floating debris from homes and businesses washed away by mountain streams that surround the lake, a video posted on X by Charlotte City Councilman Tariq Bokhari showed. 'It's hard to describe - never seen anything like this, post-apocalyptic,' he wrote. 'It's so overwhelming. You don't even know how to fathom what recovery looks like, let alone where to start.' Some 1.8 million homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, according to Poweroutage.us. 'The lack of communication is concerning,' North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday in an interview with CNN. Rescue workers from the Pamlico County rescue team are shown working in the aftermath of Helene in the area of Chimney Rock, North Carolina Rescue workers from the Pamlico County rescue team are seen in Chimney Rock Many roads were virtually impassable blocked by fallen trees, rocks, mudslides and debris 'We know that there are people missing, and we know that there's going to be significant fatalities at the end of this and our prayers and our hearts go out to these families.' Cooper, who said he had not heard from his son and daughter in 72 hours, added that local officials and rescue workers were performing door-to-door welfare checks in many communities. In Buncombe, officials said they are conducting checks of 150 'priority' households that include elderly residents or residents with medical problems. The National Guard and emergency workers from 19 states have been deployed to help, along with Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel. Cooper said the rugged terrain in the mountains of western North Carolina makes it almost impossible to traverse with landslides and flooding.

President Joe Biden said he would visit North Carolina later this week and may ask Congress to return to Washington for a special session to pass supplemental aid funding. 'There's nothing like wondering, 'Is my husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father alive?'' Biden said at the White House. 'Many more will remain without electricity, water, food and communications, and whose homes and businesses are washed away in an instant. I want them to know we're not leaving until the job is done.' Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris cut short a campaign trip in Nevada on Monday to take part in briefings in Washington on the hurricane response and will visit the region when doing so won't impede response efforts, a White House official said.

Helene struck Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday night as a major Category 4 hurricane, triggering days of driving rain throughout the South and destroying homes that had stood for decades. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said on Monday that at least 25 people in his state had died, including a firefighter responding to emergency calls during the storm and a mother and her 1-month-old twins who were killed by a falling tree. Damage estimates ranged from $15 billion to more than $100 billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend.

Those Western North Carolina residents who survived Helene faced a 'post-apocalyptic' landscape on Monday, with hundreds of people still missing and residents struggling amid flooded roads and a lack of basic services. More than 128 deaths across a half-dozen states have been attributed to the powerful storm that slammed into Florida's Big Bend region late on Thursday before cutting a destructive path through Georgia and into the Carolinas. The federal government has declared a major disaster for 25 North Carolina counties, promising aid and reimbursement for local agencies A thick layer of mud blankets the entire area in Swannanoa, North Carolina Homes have been torn from foundations, thrown upside-down or split in half in Swannanoa The once-picturesque town now lies in ruins. Cars can be seen perched in tree limbs along the flooded Swannanoa River As many as 600 people remain missing, U.S. Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall said at the White House, though she noted that the numbers could vary as responders reach more locations. Either way, the death toll is likely to rise, officials said. Residents in devastated communities found themselves isolated by flooded roads and a lack of running water, power and cell phone service. In mountainous Buncombe County, which includes the popular tourist destination of Asheville, 35 people have died The county was set to begin distributing food and water to residents later in the day. Some supplies had to be airlifted to the region with most major routes blocked by mudslides and flooding. 'They're running out of gas for ATVs that are helping the rescue, they're also running out of gas for the chainsaws,' said Colleen Burns, 58, whose house is near Burnsville, in neighboring Yancey County. 'We desperately need gas.' The brutal onslaught of Hurricane Helene has left the small mountain town of Swannanoa, North Carolina , in ruins - with locals describing the community as 'entirely erased' Volunteers stage water for people in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville A gas natural gas tank lies with other debris on a train bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Carrie Owenby looks at her phone as a neighbor with power dropped an extension cord for neighbors who have no power in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Volunteers stage water for citizens in the aftermath of Helene in Asheville A worker moves debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Asheville Debris is seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, in Asheville People wait to get water at Mountain Valley Water in the aftermath of Helene in West Asheville Flood debris from Hurricane Helene floats by in Rutherford County, North Carolina Elsewhere in Yancey, the storm snapped century-old trees around the home of Taylor Shelton, 44. It took her husband two days with a chainsaw to cut a passage through the felled trees in their driveway and the nearby road so they could drive themselves and their three children out of the darkened house. With no phone service, they relied on a neighbor who works as an EMT and had a walkie-talkie to help them determine which back roads out of the mountains were passable. 'The devastation is unbelievable,' she said. They were attempting to drive back home on Monday to pick up their dog and two guinea pigs and leave out food for the cat and the chickens. Their car was loaded with coffee, donuts and diapers for their neighbors. 'It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,' she said. 'We saw houses that are just washed away.' She has still not been able to reach her husband's parents, who live in the nearby town of Burnsville, which was also badly hit. Lake Lure, around 20 miles southeast of Asheville, was covered with floating debris from homes and businesses washed away by mountain streams that surround the lake, a video posted on X by Charlotte City Councilman Tariq Bokhari showed. 'It's hard to describe - never seen anything like this, post-apocalyptic,' he wrote. 'It's so overwhelming. You don't even know how to fathom what recovery looks like, let alone where to start.' Some 1.8 million homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, according to Poweroutage.us. 'The lack of communication is concerning,' North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday in an interview with CNN. Rescue workers from the Pamlico County rescue team are shown working in the aftermath of Helene in the area of Chimney Rock, North Carolina Rescue workers from the Pamlico County rescue team are seen in Chimney Rock Many roads were virtually impassable blocked by fallen trees, rocks, mudslides and debris 'We know that there are people missing, and we know that there's going to be significant fatalities at the end of this and our prayers and our hearts go out to these families.' Cooper, who said he had not heard from his son and daughter in 72 hours, added that local officials and rescue workers were performing door-to-door welfare checks in many communities. In Buncombe, officials said they are conducting checks of 150 'priority' households that include elderly residents or residents with medical problems. The National Guard and emergency workers from 19 states have been deployed to help, along with Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel. Cooper said the rugged terrain in the mountains of western North Carolina makes it almost impossible to traverse with landslides and flooding.

President Joe Biden said he would visit North Carolina later this week and may ask Congress to return to Washington for a special session to pass supplemental aid funding. 'There's nothing like wondering, 'Is my husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father alive?'' Biden said at the White House. 'Many more will remain without electricity, water, food and communications, and whose homes and businesses are washed away in an instant. I want them to know we're not leaving until the job is done.' Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris cut short a campaign trip in Nevada on Monday to take part in briefings in Washington on the hurricane response and will visit the region when doing so won't impede response efforts, a White House official said.

Helene struck Florida's Gulf Coast on Thursday night as a major Category 4 hurricane, triggering days of driving rain throughout the South and destroying homes that had stood for decades. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said on Monday that at least 25 people in his state had died, including a firefighter responding to emergency calls during the storm and a mother and her 1-month-old twins who were killed by a falling tree. Damage estimates ranged from $15 billion to more than $100 billion, insurers and forecasters said over the weekend.

At least 100 people are confirmed dead across the Southeast, a number likely to rise as some 600 remain missing. Some 2 million homes and businesses still had no power as of Monday. Florida was able to give evacuation notices in advance, but towns in Appalachia were completely blindsided by flooding and landslides that decimated whole communities and washed out roads, leaving residents stranded and cut off from emergency crews. Who’s making the decisions back in Washington? Who can Americans look to for leadership after a record-breaking natural disaster? Certainly not President Biden: He gave lethargic, scripted remarks Monday, during which (again!) he claimed to “have a cold,” and then snapped at a reporter who asked why he was holed up in his vacation home in Delaware and not in Washington during the worst of the storm. “It’s called a telephone,” Biden barked. And of course his mental decline plainly continues, even if he’s rarely ever in the public eye. Last Wednesday, he welcomed world leaders “to Washington” while in Midtown Manhattan; Thursday, he called Kamala Harris his “boss” and GOP veep candidate Sen. JD Vance “Secretary Vance of Ohio.” Asked Sunday about Israel’s “strikes in Yemen,” he told reporters that he’s a strong supporter of “the collective bargaining effort” to avert a longshoreman’s strike of East Coast ports. Biden is not all there, so who is calling the shots? His chief of staff, or a larger cabal of White House aides? First Lady Jill Biden, who on Friday led “Joe’s” first Cabinet meeting in 11 months? Veep Kamala Harris, who should take over as president “if” Biden is incapacitated, has instead put her efforts into distancing herself from the Biden-Harris administration, lest voters recall that she’s not much of a “change” candidate after all. Yes, she took a break from campaigning Monday to return to Washington, made a show of being briefed by FEMA and even delivering some empty remarks. But it all comes off as rote, just like the photo her campaign posted of her posing “deep in thought” on Air Force Two, albeit with headphones that looked unplugged and taking “notes” on a blank sheet of paper. Don’t look for Harris to step up and take charge now: She doesn’t want real responsibility (worse yet) or accountability. It’s Biden’s assigned role to take the blame for any disaster-relief failures. The thousands of Americans now facing destitution and homelessness and grieving the loss of friends, family and neighbors deserve competent, visible, trustworthy leadership. Too bad the White House can’t offer any such thing until at least Jan. 20.","summary":"As communities across the Southeast reel from Hurricane Helene, America faces an unsettling question: Who, exactly, is in charge at the White House?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/opinion/after-hurricane-helene-whos-in-charge-at-the-white-house/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-rlx1uvo0l-1727735988011.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727721641&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:03:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":257999172,"title":"With 118 Dead From Hurricane Helene, Biden Defends US Government Response","text":"The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to 118 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. \"He's lying,\" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper \"and he told him he's lying. I don't know why he does it... that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible.\"At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.They also worked to restore water and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to \"bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things\" to those in need.\"The federal government is not being responsive,\" he told reporters. \"The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money,\" he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.\"We're not talking about politics now,\" he said later, wearing a bright red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.\"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time,\" Harris said following the briefing.\"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis.\"Responding to Trump's criticism that he was \"sleeping\" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working \"the whole time.\"When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.\"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes,\" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a \"250-mile wide tornado.\"Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were \"wiped off the map.\"\"This is an unprecedented storm,\" he told reporters. \"The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable.\"Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.","summary":"The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to 118 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/118-dead-hurricane-helene-biden-defends-us-government-response-1852023","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1860972/people-wait-line-gasoline-aftermath-hurricane-helene-september-29-2024-fletcher-north.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 23:03:13","author":"John Falchetto","authors":["John Falchetto"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":257998720,"title":"UK firms growing in the US as presidential election looms large","text":"Business activity between the UK and the US has ramped up this year, new data showed, as firms shrug off uncertainty ahead of the American presidential election.

We love my rallies, except when someone does the ‘bing, bong, bing, bing, bing’ right at me,\" Johnson said as Trump. \"You know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left.

TRUMP HITS ABC NEWS, ‘LIGHTWEIGHT’ DAVID MUIR, ACCUSES NETWORK OF VIOLATING DEBATE AGREEMENT WITH FACT-CHECKS ABC News has faced intense backlash for its hyperpartisan debate where Muir and co-moderator Linsey Davis repeatedly fact-checked Trump and asked him far more pointed questions than Vice President Kamala Harris, who faced zero hostility from the anchors. Last Thursday, Trump renewed his attacks on Muir and his network during a press conference. \"And during the debate, I mentioned that and David Muir, a real lightweight,\" Trump said. \"I had one against three, but I think we did great. But David Muir of ABC, fake news, when I said that crime is way up in our country, he corrected me, he corrected me and so much and it was right what I said. He didn't correct [Vice President Kamala Harris] one time, and what she said was wrong, absolutely wrong.

Why? Because they're bad people, and they're fake news,\" Trump said. \"So he did it many times to me during the debate. He violated the deal. That's the deal, because you can take anything and try and make up stories with it. We had a deal where that wouldn't happen. You could do whatever you wanted as soon as the debate was over, but he did it in total violation of what our agreement was.

NBC said Monday that 5.3 million people watched the premiere live, the best opening for the show since 2020, when Alec Baldwin reprised his role as then-President Donald Trump and Chris Rock hosted with musical guest Megan Thee Stallion. The sketch comedy show welcomed back several alums this weekend for its opening skit about this year's U.S. presidential race, with Maya Rudolph playing Kamala Harris and Dana Carvey playing President Joe Biden. The episode is the most-watched “SNL” ever on Peacock in its first weekend, NBC said. Jean Smart hosted the 50th season premiere and country sensation Jelly Roll was the musical guest. The opening sketch could be a preview of the season ahead, with alum Andy Samberg returning to play Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, and actor-comedian Jim Gaffigan playing Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Only Rudolph as Harris was expected, although “SNL” hadn't confirmed she would reprise the role. The first “SNL” episode aired Oct. 11, 1975, with Lorne Michaels at the helm, just as he is now. George Carlin hosted then and the show introduced its first cast of the so-called Not Ready for Prime Time Players: Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris. Comedian Nate Bargatze is hosting this weekend's “SNL,” with Coldplay appearing as the musical guest.

Nicholas Adams San Jose Trump would be bad for students with loans The rising cost of education at San Jose State University, and universities nationwide, could worsen if Donald Trump is elected president. Trump has consistently criticized President Joe Biden’s efforts to provide student debt relief, calling them “vile” and “not even legal.” At a recent rally in Wisconsin, Trump reiterated his plan to eliminate the Department of Education if reelected. This would significantly impact students, potentially increasing their debt burdens, which could take years to repay. It would also harm teachers, public defenders, first responders and others. Younger generations must recognize the potential consequences of Trump’s presidency, particularly with student loan debt in America. Ryan Vivian San Jose Patriotic Republicans should vote Democrat This letter is for the Republicans who know better and still support Donald Trump. Are you proud of a man so immature that he constantly calls out anyone who slights him with derogatory names characteristic of a third-grader? Are you proud of the tens of thousands of lies he has spewed out over the past eight years? Are you proud of his cognitive decline (Bagram is an airbase in Afghanistan not Alaska)? Are you proud of the fact that your support will be complicit in destroying our democracy and installing a fascist/authoritarian government if Trump wins in November? Voting for Kamala Harris doesn’t make you a Democrat but a patriot in the words of former Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Can you put the love of your country before party and personal interests? Do you have the courage to be a patriot? I hope so. Our democracy depends on it. Phillip Sienna San Jose A peaceful transition was never in doubt This presidential election will be my 14th. Even though I’ve voted both sides of the aisle, when my candidate of choice lost, there was no doubt in my mind, not a reasonable doubt, but no doubt, a peaceful transition of power would take place; that the country would be in the hands of a patriot, a person who, if not managing things to my personal liking, would protect and honor our Founding Father’s idea of how a democracy should and can work in the hands of caring civil servants. I did not worry about freedom of the press or how the winner might take action against his enemies, both real and imagined. Our elections, with very few exceptions, have always been about the economy, taxes, wars and immigration. Democracy has never been on the ballot.

Want to level up your entertainment career? Go here for more information. “SNL” kicked off its 50th season with the biggest premiere audience the NBC show has seen since 2020. The Season 5o premiere of “SNL,” which aired on Sept. 28, scored a viewership of 5.3 million on NBC, according to Nielsen live-plus-same-day viewing figures, outpacing viewership for “SNL” season premieres for Seasons 47-49. The episode als ranks as the most-watched “SNL” ever on Peacock in its first weekend on the streamer. Viewership for the Season 50 premiere was up 10.4% from the Season 49 of “SNL,” which debuted its first post-strike episode to an audience of 4.8 million viewers. “SNL” Season 46 premiered in 2020 to 7.77 million total viewers as it saw Jim Carrey play Joe Biden, Maya Rudolph play Kamala Harris and Alec Baldwin portray Donald Trump. Four years later, the cold open for Season 50 saw Rudolph return as Harris, while Dana Carvey played Biden, Jim Gaffigan played VP candidate Tim Walz, and Andy Samberg played Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. The “SNL” Season 50 debut was hosted by “Hacks” star Jean Smart, who recently won her sixth Emmy for her performance as Deborah Vance in “Hacks,” and featured Jelly Roll as the episode’s musical guest. “SNL” is set to return on Oct. 5 with Nate Bargatze hosting and Coldplay serving as the musical guest. Ariana Grande, Michael Keaton and John Mulaney have already been announced as hosts for subsequent episodes this fall, with already announced musical guests including Stevie Nicks, Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan. Bargatze hosted an episode of “SNL” last fall, which brought in 4.9 million viewers, which was, at the time, the most-watched new installment of the show since December 10, 2022, when “Only Murders in the Building” stars and “SNL ” alum Steve Martin and Martin Short hosted. “SNL” broadcasts at 11:30 p.m. ET/ 8:30 p.m. PT on NBC and streams live on Peacock. The NBC late night show will host a live primetime special for its 50th anniversary on Sunday, Feb. 16.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that the law violates Georgia’s Constitution, finding that “liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.” When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Thirteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where bans begin after about the first six weeks of pregnancy — often before women realize they’re pregnant. McBurney’s ruling would allow abortions through at least 20 weeks of pregnancy. Kara Murray, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said he would immediately appeal to the state supreme court. The state high court earlier reversed a separate ruling by McBurney that had struck down the law on different grounds and could put Monday’s ruling on hold pending an appeal. “We believe Georgia’s life act is fully constitutional,” Murray said. The bans have been felt deeply in the South because many people live hundreds of miles from states where abortion procedures can be obtained legally. If the Georgia ruling stands, it could open new avenues to access abortion not only in Georgia, but for people in nearby states. Georgia’s law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but it was initially blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. Kemp has in the past tried to soften its political impact by trying to focus on the health of mothers. Monday, he attacked the ruling. “Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,” Kemp said in a statement. “Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.” Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, called the ruling “ridiculous.” “This judge is an activist judge who is ignoring higher court rulings to do what he wants,” she said in an interview. “And I don’t think it’s going to stand.” Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, celebrated the ruling. “Since we’ve seen these direct attacks here in the South, in particular, on abortion access, we have been in a deep defensive posture for a really long time,” she said. “It feels like our work has not been in vain.” While carafem, an abortion provider in Atlanta, plans to expand its services as permitted over the next several weeks, co-founder Melissa Grant said she fears a reversal. “Staff and clients will be living with this possibility hanging over immediate change, and that can be devastating to people who are trying to plan their lives and try to take care of their health,” Grant said. Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of Feminist Women’s Health Center, another Atlanta abortion provider, said they “will not be turning patients away based on the presence or absence of fetal cardiac activity, and so for as long as we are able, we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to care for patients who need services from us.” Georgia’s law prohibited most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” was present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo’s cells that will eventually become the heart at around six weeks into a pregnancy. Before the law kicked in, there were more than 4,400 abortions each month in Georgia. That has dropped a monthly average of about 2,400 since the ban began in 2022 according to data from the Society of Family Planning. The ruling means the law in the state reverts to its prior status, allowing abortions until roughly 20 weeks into a pregnancy, McBurney wrote. The right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution includes the right to make personal healthcare decisions, he wrote. “When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene,” McBurney wrote. An “arbitrary six-week ban” on abortions “is inconsistent with these rights and the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman’s rights of liberty and privacy and society’s interest in protecting and caring for unborn infants,” the order says. Claire Bartlett, executive director of the Georgia Life Alliance, expressed confidence that the Georgia Supreme Court would again overturn McBurney, saying he wrongly attempted “to create a right to abortion out of whole cloth by finding that it resides in our Constitution.” “It’s just ironic that based on his decision on Georgia’s constitutional protection against a person being deprived of life, liberty or property, which is what the argument was, that he chose to focus on a woman’s right to liberty rather than the child’s right to life,” Bartlett said. In part because Georgia has no way for citizens to place initiatives on the ballot, there’s no referendum on abortion rights scheduled for Georgia’s election this year. But Democrats have focused on abortion as they appeal to women and suburbanites. On Sept. 20, Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta to cast Republican Donald Trump as a threat to women’s freedom and lives, warning Trump would limit abortion access even more if reelected. It’s also a key issue in state legislative races as Democrats try to cut into Republican majorities. Harris’ visit came after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they didn’t get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. Democrats argue such deaths were a predictable outcome of restrictive laws Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court’s decision more than two years ago. Associated Press writers Charlotte Kramon in Atlanta and Geoff Mulvihill in Philadelphia contributed reporting.","summary":"The judge ruled the law violates Georgia's Constitution, finding that “liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning ... the power of a woman to control her own body.\"","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10786994/georgia-6-week-abortion-ban-overturned/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240930160940-20240930160940-66fb0ce046d564edfb831a60jpeg_d3e245.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:54:01","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":257996506,"title":"Georgia judge overturns state’s six-week ban on abortions","text":"Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney declared that Georgia’s 2019 heartbeat bill was unconstitutional because “a review of our higher courts’ interpretations of ‘liberty’ demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body.” When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and gave control over abortion laws back to the states, a bill signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) went into effect. The legislation effectively prohibited the termination of pregnancies after a heartbeat is detected. Under McBurney’s ruling, women will be able to obtain an abortion until the point of viability, at roughly 20-24 weeks, or when the baby is able to survive outside the womb. McBurney said his decision would allow women to “reject state interference” with what he described as “healthcare choices.” “That power is not, however, unlimited,” he wrote in a 26-page ruling. “When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and only then — may society intervene.” Kemp slammed the ruling on Monday for overturning “the personal beliefs” of Georgia residents. “Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives have been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,” Garrison Douglas, a spokesman for the governor’s office told WABE. “Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities.” The superior court’s ruling will likely face an appeal from anti-abortion groups who have already blasted the “activist” judge’s decision. “Our team is reviewing this atrocious activist ruling that denies the humanity of unborn children with beating hearts & would legalize late-term abortions in Georgia,” Susan B.

From Florida to New York, voters across 10 states will consider abortion measures on their ballot this November. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump continue to spar over the issue with just 35 days until the election. During the pair’s first presidential debate earlier this month, Trump accused Harris of taking a “radical” stance on abortion and said her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), supported “abortion in the ninth month.” There is no evidence Walz has done this. Meanwhile, Harris has alleged Trump will sign a national ban on abortion into law if he wins a second term. The former president’s campaign has repeatedly indicated he would veto such a ban.","summary":"A Georgia judge overturned the state’s &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; abortion law, which prohibited the termination of most pregnancies after six weeks.

Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair. Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside.

Following the indictment, Justin's past close relationship with the rapper has come under scrutiny, with resurfaced videos showing a 15-year-old Bieber spending '48 hours with Diddy' and partying together. Bieber hasn't addressed the situation publicly, but fans have expressed concern about his noticeably 'thin' appearance. Now sources tell DailyMail.com that the singer feels he has no one to talk to about the Diddy revelations and is 'sailing these waters alone.' 'Justin feels like there is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand,' the insider explained. 'He was a kid.' The source added that the fallout comes amid his current struggles to try and be a good parent having not had the best example from his own father, Jeremy Bieber. 'Justin is stressed right now,' the insider continued. 'He has a baby boy and trying to be a good dad without having anything to reference what a good father is.' Speaking to the fragile singer's emotional state, the source added: 'He is sailing these waters alone and everyone fears that if Hailey shows any struggles with being a first time mom then this is going to be incredibly difficult for Justin. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside Kendall and Hailey have been close friends for years, often spotted enjoying vacations together and attending major fashion events side by side The two bonded over their shared modeling careers and high-profile families, frequently posting about their adventures on social media 'Diddy could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this.' Bieber announced the birth of his first child on August 23, and gave fans a glimpse of the baby's tiny foot and wife Hailey's hands. 'WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,' the proud dad penned in the caption. The former Victoria's Secret model also shared the post on her Instagram Story with the youngster's name and various emojis. It came just weeks before Combs was accused of inducing female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, sometimes days-long sexual performances referred to as 'Freak Offs.' According to the indictment, he would allegedly use force, threats and coercion to get the women to engage with male sex workers in the 'Freak Offs,' described as 'elaborate and produced sex performances' arranged and directed by Combs while he masturbated and often recorded them. The indictment further stated that some 'Freak Offs' would last for days, requiring Combs and victims to receive IV fluids to recover from the exertion and drug use. Diddy pleaded not guilty to charges against him and was denied bail, despite his legal team's request for him to be released for $50 million and kept electronically monitored. Whether hitting the runway or relaxing on tropical getaways, they remain inseparable, with Kendall even serving as a bridesmaid at Hailey's wedding to Justin The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs , choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad Hailey and Justin's romance began as a close friendship, which eventually blossomed into a full-blown relationship in 2016 After a brief split, they rekindled their love in 2018 and quickly became inseparable, getting engaged in the Bahamas just a few months later Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood The couple officially tied the knot in a private courthouse ceremony in New York that same year, followed by a lavish second wedding in South Carolina in 2019 Hailey and Justin welcomed their son Jack in August Kendall has kept her love life relatively private, though she has been linked to several high-profile figures, including NBA stars Ben Simmons and Devin Booker Hailey's father is actor Stephen Baldwin Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the 'Freak Offs' stemmed from the star's former on-again-off-again relationship with R&B singer Cassie, and were not coercive. Prosecutors said they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses, and are expecting the number to grow. Bieber was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs, and the singer most recently featured on the rapper's track Moment, which appeared on his 2023 album The Love Album: Off the Grid. Following the album's release last October, Bieber reflected on his first encounter with Combs. 'I remember going to my brother Diddy's office to pitch him a song I wrote for him when I was like 14,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Sadly the song was trash haha and it would be a hard no from him.' He continued: 'Fast forward to a few years ago Puff asked if I would freestyle something for his upcoming love album. Wild full circle moment, love you @diddy.' Bieber, 30, was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs (Pictured in 2010) An insider told DailyMail.com: 'There is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand. He was a kid' The source added: 'Diddy (seen in 2022) could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this' An insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber deeply regrets having collaborated with the disgraced mogul last year, and would never have done so had he known the allegations that have since come to light. They continued: 'He had a long break from Diddy when he believes most of this took place and he had distanced himself from him. 'He was featured on Diddy's most recent album, and had he known any of this, there is no way he would have done it.' In March, old clips of Bieber and Combs resurfaced shortly after Homeland Security raided the music mogul's properties in Miami and Los Angeles. One video saw Combs standing next to the young pop sensation, aged 15, while telling the camera: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. 'But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' The hip hop star added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. 'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next forty-eight hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' Creepy footage of Combs and Bieber first reemerged online after the rapper's properties were raided as part of the ongoing sex trafficking investigation earlier this year Bieber, wearing a black baseball cap and purple shirt smiles and looks up at Combs throughout the video, making small comments such as 'yeah' and 'full crazy.' The video was posted to social media and triggered an outpouring of criticism and concern. Another resurfaced clip saw the rapper grilling a 16-year-old Bieber on why he hadn't been speaking to him as much. 'What's up man, you good? Selling out arenas and everything?' Combs asked the youngster. 'Starting to act different, huh? You haven't been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out.' Bieber appeared anxious as he responded to his musical colleague. 'I mean you tried to get in contact with me throughout all my... and what not... but you never got my number,' he said. 'I'm going to tell you my number.' One clip showed a 16-year-old Bieber appearing anxious as he responded to Combs' questions Another insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber has been completely 'thrown' by the harrowing allegations and is grappling to make sense of them - especially given that he collaborated with Combs less than a year ago. The source said of the fragile singer: 'Bieber is so disturbed by the Diddy news and is unwilling to process it or discuss it so he has shut off. 'So many people who helped to make him who he is were very close to Diddy and it has completely thrown him. 'Justin hasn't been responding on this since the home raids. He's not going to.'

The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing. Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair. Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside. The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad. Hailey Bieber took a break from her new role as a mom , stepping out with her best friend Kendall Jenner in Hollywood on Sunday The 27-year-old model, who welcomed her son Jack Blues with husband Justin Bieber in August, appeared in high spirits as she and the 28-year-old reality star headed to a sushi restaurant for a relaxed outing Read More Shirtless Justin Bieber pictured in bizarre outfit for church - amid fears for his health Combs, 54, was arrested in New York last week on charges of coercion and abuse. Following the indictment, Justin's past close relationship with the rapper has come under scrutiny, with resurfaced videos showing a 15-year-old Bieber spending '48 hours with Diddy' and partying together. Bieber hasn't addressed the situation publicly, but fans have expressed concern about his noticeably 'thin' appearance. Now sources tell DailyMail.com that the singer feels he has no one to talk to about the Diddy revelations and is 'sailing these waters alone.' 'Justin feels like there is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand,' the insider explained. 'He was a kid.' The source added that the fallout comes amid his current struggles to try and be a good parent having not had the best example from his own father, Jeremy Bieber. 'Justin is stressed right now,' the insider continued. 'He has a baby boy and trying to be a good dad without having anything to reference what a good father is.' Speaking to the fragile singer's emotional state, the source added: 'He is sailing these waters alone and everyone fears that if Hailey shows any struggles with being a first time mom then this is going to be incredibly difficult for Justin. Kendall followed closely behind in a black trench coat, showing off her newly dyed platinum hair Both friends kept a low profile, sporting sunglasses as they made their way inside Kendall and Hailey have been close friends for years, often spotted enjoying vacations together and attending major fashion events side by side The two bonded over their shared modeling careers and high-profile families, frequently posting about their adventures on social media 'Diddy could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this.' Bieber announced the birth of his first child on August 23, and gave fans a glimpse of the baby's tiny foot and wife Hailey's hands. 'WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,' the proud dad penned in the caption. The former Victoria's Secret model also shared the post on her Instagram Story with the youngster's name and various emojis. It came just weeks before Combs was accused of inducing female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, sometimes days-long sexual performances referred to as 'Freak Offs.' According to the indictment, he would allegedly use force, threats and coercion to get the women to engage with male sex workers in the 'Freak Offs,' described as 'elaborate and produced sex performances' arranged and directed by Combs while he masturbated and often recorded them. The indictment further stated that some 'Freak Offs' would last for days, requiring Combs and victims to receive IV fluids to recover from the exertion and drug use. Diddy pleaded not guilty to charges against him and was denied bail, despite his legal team's request for him to be released for $50 million and kept electronically monitored. Whether hitting the runway or relaxing on tropical getaways, they remain inseparable, with Kendall even serving as a bridesmaid at Hailey's wedding to Justin The outing comes amid reports that Justin is determined to block out growing rumors about his connection with Sean 'Diddy' Combs , choosing instead to focus on his role as a first-time dad Hailey and Justin's romance began as a close friendship, which eventually blossomed into a full-blown relationship in 2016 After a brief split, they rekindled their love in 2018 and quickly became inseparable, getting engaged in the Bahamas just a few months later Dressed in a cozy gray cardigan, the beauty pulled her sandy blonde hair back into a sleek bun as she made her way into Sushi Park in West Hollywood The couple officially tied the knot in a private courthouse ceremony in New York that same year, followed by a lavish second wedding in South Carolina in 2019 Hailey and Justin welcomed their son Jack in August Kendall has kept her love life relatively private, though she has been linked to several high-profile figures, including NBA stars Ben Simmons and Devin Booker Hailey's father is actor Stephen Baldwin Combs' lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said the 'Freak Offs' stemmed from the star's former on-again-off-again relationship with R&B singer Cassie, and were not coercive. Prosecutors said they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses, and are expecting the number to grow. Bieber was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs, and the singer most recently featured on the rapper's track Moment, which appeared on his 2023 album The Love Album: Off the Grid. Following the album's release last October, Bieber reflected on his first encounter with Combs. 'I remember going to my brother Diddy's office to pitch him a song I wrote for him when I was like 14,' he wrote on Instagram. 'Sadly the song was trash haha and it would be a hard no from him.' He continued: 'Fast forward to a few years ago Puff asked if I would freestyle something for his upcoming love album. Wild full circle moment, love you @diddy.' Bieber, 30, was just a child when he forged a friendship with Combs (Pictured in 2010) An insider told DailyMail.com: 'There is no one that he can talk to that understands and, to be honest, he doesn't even fully understand. He was a kid' The source added: 'Diddy (seen in 2022) could not have happened at a worse time as he is trying to experience the joy of being a father with the pain of having to deal with all of this' An insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber deeply regrets having collaborated with the disgraced mogul last year, and would never have done so had he known the allegations that have since come to light. They continued: 'He had a long break from Diddy when he believes most of this took place and he had distanced himself from him. 'He was featured on Diddy's most recent album, and had he known any of this, there is no way he would have done it.' In March, old clips of Bieber and Combs resurfaced shortly after Homeland Security raided the music mogul's properties in Miami and Los Angeles. One video saw Combs standing next to the young pop sensation, aged 15, while telling the camera: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. 'But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' The hip hop star added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. 'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next forty-eight hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' Creepy footage of Combs and Bieber first reemerged online after the rapper's properties were raided as part of the ongoing sex trafficking investigation earlier this year Bieber, wearing a black baseball cap and purple shirt smiles and looks up at Combs throughout the video, making small comments such as 'yeah' and 'full crazy.' The video was posted to social media and triggered an outpouring of criticism and concern. Another resurfaced clip saw the rapper grilling a 16-year-old Bieber on why he hadn't been speaking to him as much. 'What's up man, you good? Selling out arenas and everything?' Combs asked the youngster. 'Starting to act different, huh? You haven't been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out.' Bieber appeared anxious as he responded to his musical colleague. 'I mean you tried to get in contact with me throughout all my... and what not... but you never got my number,' he said. 'I'm going to tell you my number.' One clip showed a 16-year-old Bieber appearing anxious as he responded to Combs' questions Another insider previously revealed to DailyMail.com that Bieber has been completely 'thrown' by the harrowing allegations and is grappling to make sense of them - especially given that he collaborated with Combs less than a year ago. The source said of the fragile singer: 'Bieber is so disturbed by the Diddy news and is unwilling to process it or discuss it so he has shut off. 'So many people who helped to make him who he is were very close to Diddy and it has completely thrown him. 'Justin hasn't been responding on this since the home raids. He's not going to.'

J.D. Vance, who’s shrugged off debate prep, should not underestimate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ahead of Tuesday night’s face-off, a fellow North Star State ex-lawmaker warns. And he should know — he had to become Walz when he played the gov in GOP gubernatorial debate practice. Tuesday night is the first and likely only time the vice-presidential hopefuls will wrangle before the election. Walz, 60, was key in framing the Democratic narrative around Donald Trump and Vance as “weird,” while Vance, 40, has attacked Kamala Harris’ running mate on stolen-valor claims. Marty Seifert, former Minnesota House minority leader and 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial candidate, has a unique perspective on Walz’s skills — he stood in for the Democrat in debate prep for his unsuccessful Republican challenger, Scott Jensen, two years ago. In a phone call with The Post, he predicted Walz is going to appeal to the average voter Tuesday night — and Vance will lose if he sticks with canned talking points. That might be just what the Republican plans to do, though. Vance has publicly brushed off debate prep, as The Post reported last week: “We have well-developed views on public policy, so we don’t have to prepare that much,” he said. Seifert urged Vance to stay away from personal attacks and focus on substance and, most important, the “average American.” “He needs to talk about middle America — the mainstream not the extreme,” he advised. “Vance has an opportunity if he knows how to use it.” One example: Minnesota had the largest surplus in state history, and under Walz’s leadership it was spent — and taxes were raised. Much of the state’s $17.5 billion surplus in 2023 was used for one-time funding of new and existing programs, including child tax credits, tax rebates and exemptions, free college tuition and green energy. “That’s not where the average person is. If you had a surplus I think you’d want moderation,” Seifert noted. Seifert thinks Walz’s handling of the George Floyd unrest in the Twin Cities is another weak point Vance could exploit, as the governor has been blamed for a delayed response to the rioting, something the “Hillbilly Elegy” author has pointed out before. Seifert joked he’s “probably the only guy in any state that has played Tim Walz,” and he’s not ashamed of it. To convincingly play a character, you better “study and appreciate them, and I certainly tried to do my part,” he said. The Republican said he respects Walz and has an amicable relationship with the former teacher. “He earned his way to where he is, worked hard and got himself up there” — and got a few breaks by being in the right place at the right time, Seifert added. “I’ve studied Tim Walz for years,” the former legislator said, noting some Minnesota Republicans couldn’t get past their dislike of Walz to see his talents. “They underestimate him every time he runs.” “I saw him at a parade when he unseated a 12-year congressman. He had 100 people walking with him, and he had a bullhorn talking about how we need to get out of the Iraq War,” Seifert remembered. “I just thought, ‘This guy is going to win.’ And I watched him ever since dispensing Republican after Republican.” Seifert’s warnings echo those of fellow Minnesota Republicans The Post spoke to when Harris made Walz her running mate. “He’s a good speaker, good debater. I wouldn’t take [him] lightly, that’s for sure,” Cal Brink, a retired Minnesota businessman. said in early August. “Bring some popcorn to the debate with J.D. Vance,” Jen DeJournett, president of Ballot Box Strategies in Minnesota, said then, predicting the vice-presidential debate would be much more interesting than the Trump-Harris matchup. Walz, who could boast a National Rifle Association endorsement as a congressman, reflected the more moderate stance of his southern Minnesota district while in Congress, Seifert said. In comparison, Walz’s time governing the state has been “more left with a few spots of moderation.” Siefert, whose legislative district was near Walz’s congressional district, said there’s a joke in southern Minnesota: “The only thing moderate about Walz is his haircut.” The former lawmaker thinks highlighting social issues is another losing debate strategy and emphasized Vance’s focus should be on the economy and the border. For the average American, Seifert reiterated: “At the end of the day their discretionary disposable income is how they judge the economy.” Vance’s counterpoint to Walz’s appeal to middle America should be simple, Seifert said: “It costs too much to live, the border is out of control, and we can do better, we have a plan.” The 538 polling average gives Vance a net unfavorability rating of +11.3, compared with a +3.7 net favorable for Walz.","summary":"Ohio Sen.

Vance, a 40-year-old Republican senator from Ohio, and the Democratic Minnesota governor, 60, have never debated at the vice-presidential level and have spent the past weeks preparing their policy points, approach and candor with their closest advisers in mock debates. The GOPer had Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) stand in for Walz in his mock debates, while the governor chose Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to play the role of Vance for him. Vance and Walz’s televised showdown will occur just over a month ahead of Election Day and is expected to be the final head-to-head politicking that viewers will see before they cast their vote for the top presidential tickets of Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Walz has said he is “nervous” to spar with his GOP foe, but Trump’s campaign heaped praise on the governor’s rhetorical experience — seemingly trying to set him up for extra failure if he does poorly and soften the blow for Vance if the Minnesota pol does well. “Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years,” Trump adviser Jason Miller told reporters Monday morning on a press call. “He’ll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night. He’s not going to be the wildly gesticulating something [of a] caricature we see at rallies pointing to Kamala Harrison dancing about on the stage. Walz is going to be buttoned up,” Miller said. But in a bit of mixed messaging, Vance told The Post last week that he doesn’t have to “prepare that much” to face off against Walz. Vance’s prep has largely taken place in Cincinnati, Ohio, and involved his wife Usha. It also included reviewing Walz’s previous debate tactics when he was running for other offices. As for Walz, those close to him likewise seemed to be trying to downplay expectations, telling the press that the governor just doesn’t have the verbal game to be totally carefree going into the debate. “He’s a strong person,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told CNN. “He’s just not a lawyer-debater type. It’s not like he was dreaming of debates when he was in first grade.” Some of Walz’s nerves come from him not wanting to let Harris down and make her think she should have picked a different VP candidate, campaign aides said, according to CNN. Vance is looking to expose Walz for his record as governor in Minnesota overseeing the COVID-19 lockdowns there and his response to the 2020 George Floyd riots. The Republican also will go directly after Harris’ record as San Francisco’s former district attorney and President Biden’s current vice president, Trump’s campaign said Monday. Miller predicted Walz will be aggressive and a “chameleon” but that Vance will be prepared and work around the Minnesotan’s “folky” demeanor. Walz is preparing to go straight into Trump and largely skip over Vance but also push the claim that the senator is tied to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025 while leaning into his own Minnesota appeal, CNN reported.","summary":"Ohio Sen.

And the International Longshoremen’s Association’s central demand is a total ban on automation involving cranes, gates and the loading and unloading of freight containers — leaving US ports stuck in the last century while the rest of the world moves on. Once again, a powerful union seeks to strangle innovation that would benefit everyone else: Robots can do most dock-cargo work better, faster and cheaper. West Coast longshoremen, represented by a different union that wasn’t as vehemently opposed to automation, won a 32% pay increase that averted a walkout last September. But West Coast ports can’t possibly pick up the slack of an East Coast shutdown, especially when global shipping is already crippled by Houthi attacks in the Red Sea that force countless vessels to spend extra weeks at sea, heading around Africa to reach Atlantic ports. The walkout by 85,000 ILA dockworkers would slam the US economy just before the November election, adding extra inflationary pressures and potentially leaving store shelves emptier in advance of Christmas shopping, while also delaying US exports, risking spoilage of agricultural ones. Which puts the Biden-Harris administration in a pickle: It likely can’t make the United States Maritime Alliance, which runs the ports, agree to never automate, while pay hikes to bribe the ILA out of its “no robots, ever” stance could be inflation-drivers in their own right. But will the self-declared “most pro-labor president ever” invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to stop the strike, as President George W. Bush did after 11 days in 2002? Heck, Biden’s pro-union boasts are a big reason the ILA’s willing to go out in the first place. Maybe he should send in his vice president to end the standoff: If joy and word salads don’t do the trick, surely the dockworkers will bend when Kamala Harris tells them she grew up middle-class?","summary":"East and Gulf Coast dockworkers are set to go on strike at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, shutting down 36 ports from Maine to Texas that handle about one-half of US ocean imports.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/opinion/longshoremens-strike-poses-a-fresh-threat-to-the-us-economy/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/tugboat-passes-shipping-containers-unloaded-90402086-e1727735115572.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:31:29","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08},{"id":257999288,"title":"Jim Cramer names the Wall Street bright spots from a tumultuous third quarter","text":"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday looked back at the past three months, picking out positives in a chaotic stretch for the market. \"For once, good news was actually good news and interesting,\" he said. \"The next time you start to feel horrible about the state of the world, remember that miracles can still happen — at least in the stock market's third quarter.\" First, Cramer discussed the leadup to the Federal Reserve's 50 basis-point rate cut, saying the economy managed neither a hard nor soft landing — instead, there was \"no landing at all.\" The economy continued to grow, Cramer said, while inflation declined and unemployment rose.

Under the previous rules, the U.S. could restrict asylum access when the number of migrants trying to enter the country between the official border crossings hit 2,500 per day. The daily numbers had to average below 1,500 per day for a week in order for the restrictions to be lifted. The version rolled out Monday says the daily numbers will have to be below 1,500 for nearly a month before the restrictions can be lifted. And the administration is now counting all children toward that number, whereas previously only migrant children from Mexico were counted. These changes, which go into effect on Tuesday, will make it much more difficult to lift the restrictions and allow people entering the country between the official border crossings eventually to apply for asylum in the U.S. But the restrictions implemented in June have never been lifted because the numbers of border encounters have never gotten low enough for long enough, raising the question of why the administration felt the need to make them even tougher now. The seven-day average has gotten down to about 1,800 migrant encounters per day, the Department of Homeland Security said. A senior administration official said Monday that the longer timeline was necessary to make sure that drops in immigration are sustained and not due to a one-time event. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters about the tighter restrictions before they were made public. Immigration advocates had harshly criticized the restrictions announced in June, saying the administration was slashing away at vital protections for people fleeing persecution. Many weighed in Monday, saying that by making the rules even tougher the administration was sending people back into danger and not living up to its humanitarian obligations. The American Immigration Lawyers Association said the new rule is effectively an asylum ban and that the exceptions aren't as substantive as the administration has made them out to be. The group said at the current rates of border crossings the asylum restrictions would be in place indefinitely. “It is imperative that our nation have safe, orderly, and efficient processes at the border that also ensure fair and humane treatment of asylum seekers. The consequences of denying asylum to someone who is being persecuted can literally be a matter of life or death,\" the organization's president, Kelli Stump, said in a statement Monday. The UN refugee agency said it had “profound concern” about the changes and that blocking asylum access violates international refugee law and “the humanitarian principles to which the United States has long been a leader.” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas pushed back on suggestions that the updated rules amounted to an asylum ban. He said there were exceptions built into the rule for people who qualify and pointed to other programs such as an online appointment app the U.S. has that allows people to come to the U.S. and seek asylum. “We have not cut off our asylum system,” the secretary said. The exceptions include victims of a severe form of trafficking, who would still be allowed to apply for asylum. The administration also allows people using its CBP One appointment system to apply for asylum, but those people must schedule an appointment on the app to come to an official border crossing point. The administration has encouraged migrants to use that app instead of crossing the border illegally. But demand far exceeds the 1,450 appointments available daily, and the administration has not indicated that it will increase the number of appointments. The administration has touted its asylum restrictions, saying they have led to serious drops in the number of migrants coming to the southern border. The Department of Homeland Security said Monday that since the changes were announced in June, the daily number of people encountered by Border Patrol between the legal border crossings has fallen over 50%. In a statement announcing the new rules, DHS called on Congress to do more to solve immigration problems. Border security and immigration are a key weakness for the Biden administration and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others from his party have hammered away at the high numbers of migrants who’ve come to the southern border under the Biden administration, saying the White House and Harris haven’t done enough to restrict migration and secure the border. Harris visited a border region of Arizona on Friday, her first visit as the Democratic nominee. She walked along the tall metal fence separating the U.S. from Mexico and called for a tightening of asylum rules while pushing for a better way to welcome immigrants legally. “I reject the false choice that suggests we must choose either between securing our border and creating a system that is orderly, safe and humane,” Harris said. “We can and we must do both.”","summary":"The Biden administration is making asylum restrictions at the southern border even tougher","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/washington-ap-biden-alejandro-mayorkas-donald-trump-b2621633.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/30/23/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Harris_11866.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:30:13","author":"Rebecca Santana","authors":["Rebecca Santana"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":257995106,"title":"Only thing New York Times likes about Kamala Harris is she isn’t Trump","text":"Talk about damning with faint praise. The New York Times editorial board endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Monday — but the real headline should have been “anybody but Donald Trump.” The Times editors spent 16 paragraphs talking about Trump, twice as many as discussed the candidate they were actually backing. Consider what Harris has gotten done in her career, according to the Times: the endorsement doesn’t refer to a single accomplishment. We’re told only the jobs she has held and that she “has a long record of fighting to protect women’s health and reproductive freedom.” Nothing she’s actually done is mentioned. Even the discussion of her foreign policy just says what the Times hopes Harris will do, then turns to bashing Trump. Contrast this to the paper’s 2020 endorsement of Biden, which never mentioned Trump’s name. That editorial listed laws Biden had authored, positions he had taken, and tasks he had handled as vice president. It praised his “unusually rich grasp of and experience in foreign policy.” Given how that worked out, what does it say that the Times can’t even put Harris on the same level with a straight face? In fact, this editorial lists more accomplishments for Trump than for Harris, including securing the border during the pandemic, breaking the stale Washington consensus on China, and a “focus on Covid vaccine development” that “paid off” — never mind that the Times claimed four years ago that we needed Biden to “return a respect for science and expertise to the government.” The best the Times can say of Harris is that she has shown “care, competence and an unwavering commitment to the Constitution.” Competence at what? We’re not told. Also, since when has Harris ever stood up for the Constitution? The Supreme Court smacked her down for violating the First Amendment rights of charities and public advocacy groups. She spent her first presidential campaign “running for queen,” as Times columnist David French said at the time, given her penchant for just declaring that presidents could do whatever they wanted by executive order — a pattern this administration has continued. In 2019, she literally laughed in Joe Biden’s face when he warned that her gun-grabbing plans were unconstitutional. She’s still touting a law-breaking plan to pack the Supreme Court by forcing three conservative justices off the bench. Harris “may not be the perfect candidate for every voter” who wants to see change, the Times admits. She “would continue” Joe Biden’s budget-busting climate policies, and the Times can’t think of an example of how her policies would be different from old Joe’s. She “at least offers hope for a compromise, long denied by Congress, to secure the borders,” but how? She was the “border czar” for the past four years, when the lack of border security was because the administration wouldn’t enforce the laws we have. We’re told that she aims to bring down prices, but not how. The longest section of the discussion of Harris is the Times’s admission that she’s doing “a disservice to the American people” by not giving more details about her plans or having “unscripted encounters in which she explains her vision and policies.” The editors note that this creates “a sense that she is being shielded from tough questions, as Mr. Biden has been.” Ya think?! It “could backfire by undermining her core argument” that she is “capable.” Perhaps voters might want a capable candidate. In the past, Democratic presidential candidates trudged dutifully to Manhattan to court the Times editors, even if that meant being upbraided to their faces, such as when an editor accused Pete Buttigieg in 2020 of helping fix bread prices. Harris hasn’t granted the Times an audience, but she’s not Trump, so who cares? The Times has to settle for putting words in Harris’s mouth because it is so busy foaming at its own about Trump. It describes his first term “a warning” of worse to come — admitting without saying so that it wasn’t actually the worst thing ever, as Times readers were told daily at the time. Maybe instead of playing the boy who cried wolf, the Times editors should have higher standards for their own candidate. Dan McLaughlin is a senior writer at National Review.

Aidan Bowles, aged 71, was discovered dead in his single-storey home in Indian Rocks Beach, Pinellas County. The Irish native chose to stay put despite a mandatory evacuation order being in place, which is enforced by local authorities to protect residents from the anticipated destruction and danger posed by hurricanes. In a heartfelt social media post, Aidan's son Sam shared his grief: \"I don't even know what to say, today I not only lost my dad, I lost my superman. This guy was the strongest and smartest person I've ever met in my life, he truly made an impact in his life on not just me but everyone he came into contact with. \"I'm truly lost without him, we were not only father and son but best friends, business partners, and my hero. Unfortunately, my father didn't make it through Hurricane Helene last night and passed away in his home early this morning.\" The ex-lawyer and proprietor of the Salt Public House, who spent his formative years in Ireland, was found by neighbour John Comer on Saturday morning. Mr Comer recounted the sombre discovery of Mr Bowles' body, pinned beneath a dresser and coated in mud, reports the Irish Mirror. The tragic end to Mr Bowles, who had been a lawyer in New York, is believed to have come through drowning. On the grim find, Mr Comer shared with The New York Times: \"It's not something you can get out of your mind easily.\" His neighbour reminisced how Mr Bowles enjoyed vacations at Indian Rocks Beach since the '80s and made the shift there permanently from Kentucky about 15 years back. Mr Cormer remarked: \"He absolutely loved Indian Rocks Beach.\" Reflecting on Mr Bowles' memory, who sadly lost his wife Sabrina in December 2022, he highlighted his neighbour's warmth towards patrons at his eatery, adding: \"One of the amazing traits about him was he would always sit down with people and talk to them when they came into his restaurant to eat.\" With the hurricane's death toll nearing 100 lives lost, there are concerns that this figure is set to climb in the days ahead. The Department of Foreign Affairs has put out a statement acknowledging their knowledge of Mr Bowles' case and is offering consular support, although they refrain from discussing particulars about individual cases. The number of missing people is soaring into the hundreds, while the trail of devastation from the storm covers an expanse exceeding 800 kilometres throughout America, as revealed by officials. The US government's Federal Emergency Management Agency is leading the rescue and clean-up efforts, with over 3,200 personnel on the ground searching for survivors or those injured. They are also frantically trying to deliver water and other supplies to isolated, flood-hit areas across the south east of the US in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Mobile phone towers have been knocked out across the region, leaving hundreds of people unable to contact their loved ones. Additionally, a staggering 2.7 million Americans were left without power last night. Some estimates put the damage caused by the storm at a whopping $100bn. President Joe Biden has promised to visit the affected communities. Mr Biden described the storm's impact as \"stunning\" and announced on X that he plans to visit the area this week, provided it does not interfere with rescue or recovery operations. The President told reporters: \"It's tragic. You saw the photographs.\" The White House also announced that Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the storm-damaged areas \"as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.\" Vice President Harris spoke about the devastation caused by Helene, stating, \"I know everyone here sends their thoughts and prayer for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane. We will stand with these communities for as long as it takes and make sure they are able to rebuild.\" Tragically, deaths were also reported in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.","summary":"Aidan Bowles, 71, was found dead inside his one-storey cottage in Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County, Florida, after the area was subjected to a mandatory evacuation order","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/heartbroken-son-man-killed-hurricane-33789409","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33789408.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_aidanb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:19:11","author":"Danny de Vaal","authors":["Danny de Vaal"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.054},{"id":257995024,"title":"Harris talks racial identity, marijuana on basketball podcast","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris addressed Donald Trump’s comments on her racial identity, the value she places on mental health, and her support for legalizing marijuana with former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes on a podcast that aired on Monday.

These ports handle over half of U.S. container imports, moving everything from auto parts and electronics to food and furniture.At the center of the dispute between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) are two key issues: stronger protections against automation and higher wages.Even if the port workers' strike lasts only a few days or up to a week, experts consulted by Newsweek say it could have serious consequences for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race against former President Donald Trump.A strike also puts President Joe Biden's pro-labor stance in the spotlight at a critical time.The East and Gulf Coast ports handle a majority of U.S. container imports, including essential goods like auto parts, appliances, electronics and food. If the strike is resolved quickly, its economic impact may be contained, according to experts. However, a prolonged strike could cause major disruptions, leading to shortages in key sectors and driving up prices that would be felt on a lag that happens to correspond almost exactly with the final leg of the race.\"If this is settled in a couple of days, the impact will be minimal,\" said Peter S. Goodman, supply chain expert and author of How the World Ran Out of Everything. \"But if it drags on for weeks, then you have a potentially very significant problem.\" He explained that beyond finished goods, the strike could delay components that are essential for the U.S. manufacturing sector, be it cars, chemicals or construction materials.The price of bulky goods like furniture is particularly sensitive to shipping disruptions. \"Big, bulky items like furniture are hit harder because fewer items fit in a container, driving up the per-item cost,\" said Ryan Petersen, CEO of the tech-centered logistics company Flexport. However, he says, the full impact may take longer to be felt.In contrast, fresh produce, such as bananas from Central and South America, would face more immediate risks due to spoilage during transit delays.\"Fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those coming through these ports, will be impacted quickly,\" noted Margaret Kidd, a supply chain professor at the University of Houston, adding that 75 percent of the nation's imported bananas arrive through East and Gulf Coast ports.Americans could also face higher prices and delays as retailers experience a supply squeeze — a phenomenon familiar for anyone who tried to buy a couch on the internet during the pandemic.\"If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, creating a ripple effect that could last into 2025 and cause chaos in the industry,\" said Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management firm Pro3PL.The potential strike underscores the vulnerabilities that linger in the U.S. supply chain, despite changes made to shore up supply lines and logistics after the worst of the pandemic.Retailers have tried to prepare by front-loading inventory ahead of the holiday shopping season.\"Many retailers have already taken steps to mitigate the potential impact of a strike by bringing in products earlier or shifting shipments to the West Coast,\" Jonathan Gold, Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the National Retail Federation (NRF), told Newsweek. \"But even a minor disruption would have a negative impact, causing delays at a critical time for both retailers and consumers.\"\"One lesson we learned from COVID is the importance of better visibility and planning in the supply chain,\" Flexport's Petersen said. \"Companies need better tools to track shipments and plan for disruptions.\"Biden's DilemmaThe coming strike by ILA workers will be the union's first since 1977. Its timing, just weeks before the election, presents a political dilemma for President Biden.The administration has the power to intervene under the Taft-Hartley Act, imposing an 80-day cooling-off period that would delay the strike conveniently until after Election Day. However, such a move carries political risks, especially for Vice President Harris.Biden has crafted himself into the most pro-labor president in decades, and intervening could anger the dockworkers and other unions, a crucial part of his political base that Donald Trump is also making a play for.\"Biden has positioned himself as friendly to labor, and using powers like the Taft-Hartley Act to end the strike could anger organized labor,\" Goodman explained. However, a prolonged strike that disrupts supply chains and fuels a spike in inflation before Nov. 5 could prove to be even more politically dangerous.The strike comes at a time when inflation, although nearly back to its Fed target of 2 percent, remains a major concern for voters. Prolonged disruptions at ports could raise prices for key goods heading into the busiest shopping season of the year, just in time to remind voters of one of things they disliked most about the last four years.\"Trump could benefit, claiming he would handle things better, while Harris, as the incumbent administration's candidate, could face backlash over inflation and supply chain issues,\" Kidd said.\"If the strike drags on, we'll definitely see short-term inflation, and consumers will feel it.\"","summary":"A prolonged strike at U.S. ports could trigger an inflation revival at the worst possible time for Harris.

Here's what to watch for","text":"The men who want to be America's vice-president are preparing for their first, and probably only, televised campaign debate. It's another important moment in the US election race, which polls suggest is still an incredibly close contest. Tim Walz and JD Vance are both relatively low-profile politicians who haven't spent much time on the national stage – so a lot of voters don't know too much about them. The debate is being hosted by CBS News at the network's broadcast centre in New York City. Who are the candidates for vice-president? On the Democrats side, Kamala Harris's running mate is Tim Walz, a former high school teacher and American football coach. Walz, 60, was first elected to the national Congress in 2006, representing a rural district in Minnesota. He quit Congress in 2019 to become the state's governor. For the Republicans, Donald Trump's vice-presidential nominee is JD Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy, a best-selling memoir about life in poverty-stricken rural Ohio. Vance, 40, was elected to the US Senate in 2022, after serving in the US Marine Corps and working as a venture capitalist. What time is the vice-presidential debate? The debate will start at 9pm Tuesday, local time, which is 11am Wednesday, AEST. How can I watch the vice-presidential debate? In Australia, you can watch the debate on the ABC News Channel. We'll also be live blogging the debate here on the ABC News website. American host broadcaster CBS will also stream the debate on its website and YouTube channel. What are the rules for the vice-presidential debate? The rules, agreed to by both campaigns, are similar to the previous presidential debates. The debate will run for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks of 4 minutes.CBS journalists Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan will ask the questions and moderate the debate.After being asked a question, the candidate will get 2 minutes to answer, and their opponent will then get 2 minutes to respond. Each candidate will then get a minute for further rebuttals. At the moderators' discretion, the candidates may get an extra minute each to continue the discussion.Candidates will not be told questions or topics in advance.There will be no audience.No props are allowed.No pre-written notes are allowed, but candidates will be given a pen and paper. Something that proved controversial in the previous presidential debates was the decision to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. In this debate, CBS says it \"reserves the right\" to mute microphones, but they could remain hot throughout. So there could be more back-and-forth discussion, or messy interjection, in this debate than the presidential ones. Six things to look out for: 'Midwest dad' vibes Both Walz and Vance were chosen to be VP candidates, at least in part, to appeal to certain voting demographics. Both men have talked up their backstories of rising up from humble beginnings, and leaned into \"Midwest dad\" personas. Their respective campaigns hope they will resonate in middle America, far from Harris's progressive home state of California and Trump's worlds of Manhattan real estate and Florida luxury resort life. But each will paint the other as extremist. Vance has called Walz \"one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government at any level\". Walz is known for critiquing Vance and Trump as \"weird\" and \"creepy as hell\". Questions about Walz's military history Both Vance and Walz have served in the military, but neither in combat. Vance served four years in the US Marine Corps, which included about six months in Iraq in 2005 as a military journalist. Walz served 24 years in the National Guard — part of the US Army reserve — but he retired in May 2005. This was three months after he'd applied to run for Congress, and two months after his artillery unit was told it might be deployed to Iraq. This has become one of the things Vance most commonly attacks Walz on. He has described Walz's decision to retire just before possible deployment as \"shameful\". He's also criticised Walz over a 2018 video, which was shared by the Harris campaign, showing Walz saying he'd carried weapons \"in war\". The Harris campaign later said Walz \"misspoke\" when he said he carried weapons in war. Vance has accused Walz of \"stolen valour\". Vance's views on Project 2025 A key plank of the Democratic Party strategy has been linking Trump and Vance to the controversial Project 2025. Put together by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the \"presidential transition project\" contains contentious policies like banning abortion, eliminating climate change programs and disbanding the Department of Education. It also proposes stacking the civil service with loyalists and expanding the president's power. While some of Trump's allies and former staff helped write the plan, Trump has insisted he has \"nothing to do with it\". But Vance is close with the Heritage Foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, and even wrote the foreword for his upcoming book, noting that \"in the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon\". Those claims about cats The most talked about moment from the most recent debate, between Trump and Harris, was Trump's claim that Haitian migrants were \"eating the pets\" in the town of Springfield, Ohio. Loading... City and state officials, including Ohio's Republican governor, maintain there's no evidence of this. Shortly after the debate, Vance conceded it may be untrue — but he defended the claim anyway, even encouraging social media users to share pet memes. Vance told CNN he'd been \"trying to talk about the problems in Springfield for months\", and \"if I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do\". It's not the only pet-related claim that Vance has been forced to defend. His 2021 comments about the Democratic Party being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" attracted a tonne of backlash, including from Taylor Swift, who embraced the label when she endorsed the Harris-Walz ticked after the last debate. Vance has argued he was being sarcastic, and was trying to make a point about the Democratic Party being \"anti-family and anti-child\". Walz's response to riots in Minnesota Vance regularly attacks Walz over his record in Minnesota, including how he handled riots in its largest city, Minneapolis, in 2020. The riots, after George Floyd's murder in 2020, caused $US500 million ($723 million) in property damage. Critics say Walz should have activated the National Guard sooner. Vance said Walz \"allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis\". Trump, who was then president, praised Walz at the time. Recording from a phone call shows Trump told a group of governors: \"I fully agree with the way he [Walz] handled it the last couple of days.\" Trump's campaign says Trump only praised the governor after he called in the National Guard. Another approach to fact-checking During the two presidential debates, we saw two different approaches to fact-checking the candidates. In the first, between Trump and President Joe Biden, CNN's moderators did not fact-check the candidates in real-time. But the network's official fact-checkers later found Trump made 30 false claims – far more than Biden. In the second debate, between Trump and Harris, ABC's moderators did fact-check live.

Speaking to the press outside the heavily damaged brick facade of a warehouse, Trump opined, “Nobody thought this would be happening, especially now it’s so late in the season for the hurricanes.” Hurricane season typically runs from early June through late November, meaning that there are still two months to go. What’s more, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center not only knew of Helene’s coming, but accurately predicted its path and impact days before it hit. Since making landfall in Florida on Thursday night as a Category 4 hurricane, Helene has ravaged the Southeastern United States. At least 128 deaths had been reported across six states by Monday, according to the Associated Press, with millions of people left stranded without power and dozens of towns completely submerged under floodwaters. Thousands more remain missing, with state officials warning that the death toll is expected to rise. The Trump campaign announced over the weekend that he’d be heading south to be briefed on the situation there and tour some of the damage. At least 17 of the 25 deaths reported so far in Georgia occurred in Valdosta. “Hurricane Helene turned out to be a big one,” Trump said at the press conference. “Like, just about the biggest that anyone has seen. I spoke with all of the relief people, all of the people that do this for a living and... they said they’ve never seen one this bad.” A day earlier, Trump had bashed Vice President Kamala Harris for failing to change her plans like he had, saying at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania that she “ought to be down in the area” affected by the hurricane. “She ought to be down in the area where she should be,” he complained. “That’s what she’s getting paid for, right? That’s what she’s getting paid for.” The Democratic presidential nominee scrapped several campaign events on Monday to return to Washington, D.C. and attend a Federal Emergency Management Agency briefing, her campaign said. She and President Joe Biden are expected to visit hurricane-damaged parts of the state “as soon as it will not disrupt emergency response operations,” according to Politico. Trump’s visit comes after he attracted controversy during a rally stop in Michigan on Friday, when he directed a seemingly thoughtless comment to those impacted by the storm. “We’re with you all the way, and if we were there, we’d be helping you,” he said, “and you’ll be OK.” The Harris campaign reposted a clip of the remark to X, noting that “Dozens of deaths have already been reported.” His supporters and allies argued in turn that his words had been taken out of context, and that Trump was merely consoling the storm’s victims. Critics have savaged Trump for his response to previous natural disasters, calling him insensitive and callous for episodes like an incident in 2017 that saw him casually toss rolls of paper towels into a cheering crowd in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria. “You don’t throw them. You hand them,” celebrity chef José Andrés, who was involved in relief efforts in Puerto Rico, told The Washington Post a year later. “You look the people in the eye and tell them, ‘We’re here for you, and we’ll do our best to provide relief for you and your family.’” In 2019, it was reported that the then-president had repeatedly suggested to to senior Homeland Security and national security officials that they explore using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes. “Why don’t we nuke them?” Trump asked at one hurricane briefing, according to Axios. “They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can’t we do that?” Just days after Axios’ report, Trump made a stray—and false—assertion on social media that Hurricane Dorian was expected to hit Alabama, prompting panicked residents to call into the confused local weather bureau. Instead of issuing a correction, Trump doubled down on his declaration, showing reporters a weather map showing the path of the hurricane that had seemingly been altered with black Sharpie to include Alabama in the “cone of uncertainty.” The National Weather Service had to move quickly to dispel what became known as “Sharpiegate,” clarifying that “Alabama will NOT see any impacts” from the storm. Trump has also repeatedly cast doubt on climate change, which scientists have linked to the worsening impact of hurricanes like Helene. As recently as Sunday’s rally, the former president referred to climate change as “one of the great scams of all time,” according to The Independent. “No, but think about this,” Trump said. “They never talk about the environment anymore. You know why? It’s one of the greatest scams of all time. People aren’t buying it any more.”","summary":"Michael M.

I have a lot of supplies ready for them, but access and communication is now restricted, and we want to make sure that Local Emergency Management is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me. I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas. MAGA!” Later, he outrageously claimed, “Biden and Harris…have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.” Not surprisingly, Trump did not provide any evidence for any of these reports, which the New Republic notes “don’t seem to have any factual basis,” and that “Much of North Carolina votes Republican, so it would be near impossible for any relief efforts to occur that would neglect conservatives.” Additionally, the state’s Democratic governor has deployed the National Guard and Joe Biden pledged “every available resource, as fast as possible, to your communities, to rescue, recover, and to begin rebuilding.” Last week, the president declared an emergency in North Carolina and, per the White House, “ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Hurricane Helene beginning on September 25, 2024, and continuing.” Trump was tied with Kamala Harris in North Carolina, according to a CNN poll conducted earlier this month, so it’s not at all surprising that he would use a horrific natural disaster to try and score political points. Also not surprising: that he hasn’t mentioned that, during his time in office, he trashed local officials in blue states hit by hurricanes and wildfires, and, according to a former official, wanted to cut off federal aid from California because state residents didn’t support him.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that \"liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.\" When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Fourteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where the bans kick in after about the first six weeks of pregnancy -- which is often before women realize they're pregnant. The impact of bans has been felt deeply in the South because many people have to travel hundreds of miles to states where abortion procedures can be obtained legally. The Georgia ruling, if it stands, could open up new avenues to access abortion not only for residents of the state, but for people in nearby states who currently face long trips to places like North Carolina or Illinois. Georgia's law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but it was initially blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. Kemp has in the past tried to soften its political impact by trying to focus on the health of mothers. Monday, he attacked the ruling. \"Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,\" Kemp said in a statement. \"Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.\" The law prohibited most abortions once a \"detectable human heartbeat\" was present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart around six weeks into a pregnancy. Before the law kicked in, there were more than 4,400 abortions each month in Georgia. That has dropped to about 2,400 a month on average since the ban took effect in 2022 according to data compiled for the Society of Family Planning. McBurney wrote that his ruling means the law in the state returns to what it was before the law was passed in 2019, allowing abortions until roughly 20 weeks into a pregnancy. \"When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene,\" McBurney wrote. An \"arbitrary six-week ban\" on abortions \"is inconsistent with these rights and the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights of liberty and privacy and society's interest in protecting and caring for unborn infants,\" the order says. In part because Georgia has no way for citizens to place initiatives on the ballot, there's no referendum on abortion rights scheduled for Georgia's November election this year. But that hasn't stopped Democrats from trying to keep abortion on center stage as an issue in Georgia, as they try to appeal to women voters and suburbanites. On Sept. 20, Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta to cast Republican Donald Trump as a threat to women's freedom and lives, warning Trump would limit abortion access even more if reelected. It's also a key issue in state legislative races as Democrats try to cut into Republican majorities, particularly in the state House. Harris came to Atlanta on Sept. 20 after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. Democrats argue such deaths were a predictable outcome of laws that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court's decision more than two years ago, but the Sept. 20 speech was her first focused squarely on the issue since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat complications she experienced after taking abortion pills. Reported by ProPublica, the case is the first publicly reported instance of a woman dying because her care was delayed due to a state abortion law. The news organization also reported on the death of Candi Miller, a woman with lupus, diabetes and hypertension who took abortion pills she ordered online. An autopsy found fetal tissue that hadn't been expelled and a lethal combination of painkillers, ProPublica reported. The state's maternal mortality review committee found that Miller's death was not caused by the abortion medication, and like Thurman's, was preventable. ____ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Philadelphia contributed reporting.","summary":"Republican Gov.

According to San Antonio Express-News, he alleged that Trump tampered with a border security plan that was supported by both parties in Congress to maintain the high rate of illegal immigration. “When Donald Trump comes to Texas, stands next to officers in uniform just like mine, he’s not there to help us. Don’t think that, not for a second. He is a self-serving man,” Salazar said. “Just like when he killed the border bill, he just made our jobs harder.” As per KSAT, Salazar praised Harris' border management and stated she has been battling border crimes for years. “She’s gone down to Mexico and worked to stop the traffickers. When the traffickers didn’t stop, she put them in jail,” Salazar said. “Down in my neck of the woods, we call that, ‘Fooling around and finding out.’” He further claimed that Harris's legal enforcement and protection philosophy is shared by other sheriff deputies stationed along the US-Mexico border. “We fight like hell to protect our border,” Salazar said. “When we fight, we win.” However, netizens had mixed reactions to his controversial comments. \"Sherriff Salazar ended his career with that speech. Bexar County voters will remember,\" a Trump supporter wrote. Another netizen asked, \"And what did Harris do to help? She let in millions of dangerous criminals.\" \"I have to say that again, MAGA cultists are the easiest to manipulate and the dumbest people on earth. You have to be incredibly stupid to not see who Trump really is. There is no other explanation,\" another opined. In a similar vein, one praised, \"Finally a police officer who has a brain,\" while another slammed, \"Some sheriffs are just politicians with shiny badges. The people of Texas know the truth. Remember, the Democrats see every illegal as a Democrat in the future.\" A comment also read, \"Salazar is horrible at law enforcement and only cares about his political career. He needs to be voted out and soon!!\" Meanwhile, one user pointed out, \"It’s illegal to give political speeches in uniform.\" \"All of you have a very short memory, Trump had the borders closed until Harris took over and opened it up,\" a MAGA fan lauded the Trump administration. Mediaite previously reported that in July 2022, Salazar had criticized the Biden administration for the imploding migrant crisis. He expressed his 'anger' about the same and claimed he had not heard back from the White House. The Texas sheriff had sent three letters pleading with the Biden administration to take more direct action and to send a representative to visit the state and hold meetings with sheriffs. He also denounced Governor Greg Abbott (R) for using the immigration situation as a 'campaign stunt.' Salazar wrote, \"I’m asking for the president or a member of his administration that can make decisions to come down and talk to not just me, but at least 12 other Texas sheriffs from major counties in the state of Texas that are dealing with this issue firsthand. I would like to see somebody from Washington come down here, get boots on the ground, get eyes on the issue at hand.\" When MSNBC host Jose Diaz-Balart allowed Salazar to give a direct address, the sheriff said, \"Mr. President, we need your help. With all due respect, the perception here, what I have seen in talking to other law enforcement leaders in my precious state of Texas...is that there’s been a complete absence from Washington, D.C.\" “I mentioned being angry at the president in my letter. I’m angry. I was angry when I wrote it. I’m still angry today,” Salazar concluded. “Pardon me if talking to you I get more angry. It makes me bristle with anger that 50 people died in my community and I couldn’t do anything to stop it. It’s frustrating.”","summary":"The sheriff alleged that Trump tampered with a border security plan to maintain a high rate of illegal immigration for his campaign arguments.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/sheriff-says-trump-stands-next-to-officers-for-photos-but-never-helps-netizens-have-strong-feelings","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/717957/uploads/4602a570-7f04-11ef-977a-0d1bdd8d3a56_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-30 22:00:33","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.314}]}
