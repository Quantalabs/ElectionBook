My family’s been through a lot, but I do not want to leave a broken country to my kids, or anyone else’s,” said the governor.\n\n“So what I think is most important for a candidate for 2028 is a candidate that can heal this country, that can bring people back together. So when I sit down, I’m going to think about whether I’m that candidate, or whether someone else is that candidate,” he continued.\n\nBeshear’s appeal as a national candidate for the party is obvious, given his popularity as a Democratic governor in a state with two Republican senators and a record of going red in presidential races. His ability to win over moderate Democratic voters and independents especially is something the party is eager to reclaim after Kamala Harris’s devastating defeat in 2024.\n\nBeshear’s second term as governor term will also end in December of 2027, making the timing of a presidential run achievable while also completing the entirety of his four years in office.\n\nStaffers at the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) may be breathing a second sigh of relief on Sunday after his interview, given that a competitive Republican primary is already broiling over who will replace the retiring Senator Mitch McConnell, formerly leader of the GOP Senate caucus. The lack of an incumbent in the seat gives Beshear a clear opening were he to run, especially given his proven ability to win independent and even Republican support in his past races. He also maintains a high approval rating, and is one of the most popular governors nationwide.\n\nHe has no interest in serving in the Senate, however, a spokesman said in February. \n\nBeshear also maintains one other key advantage were he to run in a Democratic primary: he is not tainted by association to the Biden administration or either the former president or Harris’s successive doomed presidential campaigns. Beshear did hit the campaign trail to support Harris over the summer of 2024, but his distance from the White House frees him from the stink of the controversy surrounding Biden’s physical and mental decline over the course of his presidency.\n\nHarris herself is widely reported to be eyeing a run for governor of California, but at the same time continues to avoid the press. She has not sat down for an interview with a national news outlet since the election, and has only delivered public remarks once this year in April.\n\nAs well as Harris, Beshear’s potential rivals for the 2028 nomination include ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, known for being one of the Biden administration’s most skilled communicators, as well as California’s current governor: Gavin Newsom, who has been a figure of leadership in his party in the second “Resistance” era.\n\nThe Kentucky governor will take over chairmanship of the Democratic Governors Association next year, putting him in charge of a key campaign arm for the party and giving him a chance to make important political alliances should he consider a future bid for office.","summary":"“If you’d asked me this question a couple years ago, I would have said no,” the Kentucky governor said.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/andy-beshear-2028-democrat-kentucky-b2783660.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/06/21/07/beshear_cnnsotu_725.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4wKkErLg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-06 22:14:11","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.062},{"id":338902306,"title":"Gov.

I mean the United States.”\n\n“I know America is the whole continent. I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants,” the president’s AI-generated voice adds in the opening song for the Puerto Rican rapper’s new album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” released earlier this year.\n\n“This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans–” the voice continues, before the men shake their heads, turn off the radio, and walk away — cutting off the presumably AI-generated Trump mid-sentence.\n\nNotably, Bad Bunny failed to differentiate illegal aliens and legal immigrants, as many left-wing activists do when commenting on migration issues.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Bad Bunny endorsed President Trump’s opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, while the public was pretending not to know that Tony Hinchcliffe is an insult comedian.\n\nLeftists clutched their pearls after Hinchcliffe made jokes about Puerto Rico at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally last October.\n\nLast month, Bad Bunny attacked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling them “motherfuckers” in a video after witnessing what appears to be agents detaining people on a street in Puerto Rico.\n\n“Look, those motherfuckers are in these cars, RAV-4s,” the “Monaco” rapper said in the clip. “They’re here in Pontezuela. Sons of bitches, instead of leaving the people alone and working there.”\n\nNotably, President Trump, who campaigned heavily on stopping illegal immigration, won the 2024 election in a landslide victory that included securing not only the Electoral College, but the popular vote and every swing state in the nation as well, thus, receiving a mandate from the American people to enact his agenda.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Anthony Scaramucci worked with the US president during his first term in the White House but his stint as White House communications director lasted only 11 days before he was fired. Since then, he has been critical of Trump, voicing his support for Joe Biden and for Kamala Harris in the 2020 and 2024 elections respectively. Now the financier has claimed Trump complained to him that he couldn't watch X-rated films because computers at the White House blocked them. It isn't the first time this claim has emerged as back in 2018 Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski alleged a source told her the US president was frustrated with life in the White House as he couldn't watch porn. She made the comments while appearing on MSNBC Live with Stephanie Ruhle seven years ago, to talk to Stormy Daniels ' attorney Michael Avenatti. The former adult actress claimed she had sex with Trump while he was married in 2006, just months after the birth of his youngest son, Barron. Their alleged affair was at the centre of Trump's hush-money trial in New York, during which he became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes. A jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to Ms Daniels who said the two had sex. When Ms Daniels made the allegations, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Ms Daniels didn't have credibility and didn't deserve \"respect\" because she was a sex worker. \"I respect women - beautiful women and women with value - but a woman who sells her body for sexual exploitation I don't respect,\" said Giuliani. \"Someone who sells his or her body for money has no good name.\" In response, a lawyer for Ms Daniels, who sued Trump for defamation - but lost the case - called Giuliani \"an absolute pig\". The comments were the topic of discussion on MSNBC in June 2018 and Ms Brzezinski called out the \"hypocrisy\" while mentioning the allegations about Trump complaining about computers blocking porn. She said: \"The hypocrisy is astounding. Because I know someone who spoke to Donald Trump recently about life in the White House, and Donald Trump's biggest complaint was that he's not allowed to watch porn in the White House. So there you go, there's a little bit of news for you. He's upset, he's upset that he can't watch porn in the White House.\" The claims, now repeated by Scaramucci, emerged after Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" passed this week. Supporters of the bill, predominantly Republicans, are championing the tax reductions as a bulwark against tax increases for families and a catalyst for economic expansion. They assert their commitment to recalibrating welfare programmes such as SNAP, Medicare, and Medicaid to better serve their original target groups – expectant mothers, the disabled, and children – while simultaneously eliminating what they describe as rampant inefficiencies and corruption. The bill's passage marked a significant achievement for the president and it is set to become a defining feature of Trump's second administration while it is testament to his strength, with Republicans holding majority control over both the House and the Senate, as well as the Executive Branch. Even the Supreme Court majority leans conservative. The bill essentially overturns Democratic policies from Trump's predecessors. It fundamentally rejects the agendas of the previous two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden . It chips away at the Medicaid expansion of Obama's Affordable Care Act and rolls back Biden's climate strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act.","summary":"Anthony Scaramucci, who was Donald Trump's director of communications for 11 days in 2017, claimed the US president complained he couldn't watch porn in the White House","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-moaned-white-house-35509871","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35507984.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_US-POLITICS-TRUMP-DEPARTURE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 15:07:10","author":"Chiara Fiorillo","authors":["Chiara Fiorillo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":338839264,"title":"Christian, 'tradpop' music making 'a comeback' as conservative ideals become more popular, report says","text":"Faith-based and \"traditional\" pop hits are surging on the music charts this year, as noted in a recent report.

Act like it… Have some class,” she said.\n\nKelly then speculated on Theron’s sexuality, going so far as to suggest she’s exaggerating her interest in men.\n\n“I kind of call bullsh-t because I believe that Charlize Theron probably prefers women. That’s my belief. Okay, I’m entitled to my opinion, and there’s no reason to get into the details as to why I believe it, but I believe it,” she said.\n\n“And I don’t think that she’s telling the truth about the 26-year-old.”\n\nTheron has previously addressed rumors about her sexuality. Back in 2017 on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, she was asked if she’d ever “dipped in the lady pond.”\n\n“When I was young, yes,” she responded. “I mean, it’s just so not a big deal. I’m so old school — I really like dudes.”\n\nWhile she’s explored her identity in the past, Theron has made it clear she identifies as heterosexual and has publicly supported bisexual visibility.\n\nStill, Kelly wasn’t done. She also took issue with Theron’s language during the podcast.\n\n“I love a good F-bomb… But every sentence? An F-bomb? ‘F in this, F in that, F in God,’ what is that? This is like an affectation where she’s trying to act like, again, young, cool girl, ‘I get it, and I don’t need a man,’” Kelly said.\n\nAnd speaking of men, Kelly found Theron’s comments about single motherhood equally “off-putting.”\n\n“She’s got two children. They don’t need a father? She’s super proud of the fact that there’s no father in the picture? Great. Good for you,” Kelly said. “It’s a very strange thing to see one of our best-known actresses sit down like that, with the crossed legs, with this sex podcaster, talking about their orgasms and who they f’ed. It’s just really off-putting.”\n\nThe heated remarks come on the heels of another headline-grabbing moment for Theron — this time about the wedding of the year.\n\nWhile hosting the fifth annual Block Party for the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, she poked fun at not being invited to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s ultra-luxe Venice wedding, where celebs like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, and Sydney Sweeney were among the glittering guest list.\n\n“I think we might be the only people who did not get an invite to the Bezos wedding,” Theron joked, according to The Blast.\n\n“But that’s okay because they suck and we’re cool.”","summary":"The podcaster and former Fox News host didn't hold back.","url":"https://decider.com/2025/07/06/megyn-kelly-charlize-theron-sex/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2212933332.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 12:35:46","author":"Michael Haskoor,mliss1578","authors":["Michael Haskoor","mliss1578"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":338809226,"title":"Latest line: A good week for Buffy Wicks, a bad week for Floyd Mitchell","text":"Buffy Wicks\n\nEast Bay assemblywoman wins big as Gov.

James Comer, Chair of the Oversight Committee, has called upon most of Biden’s key aides to appear for questioning at the Capitol, resorting to issuing subpoenas for those unwilling to attend voluntarily.\n\nAnd there could be more interviews to come. \n\nComer sent letters to more aides last week, saying information was needed ‘as part of our aggressive investigation into the cover-up of [Biden’s] cognitive decline.’\n\nAmong the Biden aides who received them were press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, White House counsel office spokesperson Ian Sams, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates and chief of staff Jeff Zients.\n\nThe Daily Mail breaks down the aides in Biden’s inner circle who are under the most scrutiny: \n\nDr. Kevin O’Connor on July 9\n\nDr. O’Connor is at the center of the coverup claims and was the first subpoenaed by House Republicans to answer questions about Biden’s declining health.\n\nHe was Biden’s personal physician, traveling with him and signing off on his yearly physicals, giving the then-president a clean bill of health. But O’Connor notably didn’t subject Biden to routine cognitive tests. \n\nO’Connor, a retired US Army colonel, began his White House service in 2006 under the George W Bush administration as part of the White House Medical Unit (WHMU). \n\nIn 2009, O’Connor was named physician to then-Vice President Biden. He was named as Biden’s physician when he became president in 2021.\n\nQuestions about Biden’s cognitive state have been raised after the publication of ‘Original Sin,’ a book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson that detailed an alleged cover-up among aides about the former president’s capabilities. \n\nAdditionally, after Biden announced that he had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, further questions were raised about why it was not caught while he was in office.\n\nO’Connor, after his yearly physicals of Biden, would release a letter describing his findings on Biden’s health, declaring him fit to serve as president – including in the months before his disastrous presidential debate with Donald Trump.\n\nAhead of the June 2024 debate – which was followed by Biden’s decision to step down as the Democratic presidential nominee – O’Connor signed off on Biden’s health, writing he ‘continues to be fit for duty.’\n\nAshley Williams on July 11\n\nWilliams was Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations and had daily contact with Biden. Her duties included overseeing the president’s personal schedule, private engagements, and day-to-day affairs. \n\nShe is a longtime Biden staffer, going back to his time as vice presidency. At that time, she worked for Jill Biden as her senior assistant, earning the trust of the then-second lady.\n\nWilliams worked on the 2020 campaign, was in the Biden White House during his term and stayed with Biden to work in his post-presidency office.\n\nShe, along with Deputy Chief of Staff Annie Tomasini, ran Oval Office operations – no one was able to see President Biden without going through them first.\n\nWilliams, along with Tomasini and Jill Biden’s senior aide Anthony Bernal, were accused of forming a ‘protective bubble’ around President Biden.\n\n‘Annie, Ashley and Anthony create a protective bubble around POTUS. He’s staffed so closely that he’s lost all independence. POTUS relies on staff to nudge him with reminders of who he’s meeting, including former staffers and advisers who Biden should easily remember without a reminder from Annie,’ a Biden aide told Axios.\n\nAnthony Bernal on July 16\n\nBernal, the longtime Biden aide nicknamed Jill’s ‘work husband,’ was slapped with a subpoena by Republicans after he missed his June 26 appearance date before the Oversight Committee.\n\nChairman Comer demanded his presence on July 16.\n\nBernal has worked for the Bidens since Joe Biden served as vice president. \n\nIn that time, he bonded with Jill Biden. The duo became close after splitting champagne and french fries on election night in 2008, Politico reported. \n\nHe worked for the First Lady in the East Wing during her husband’s presidency, where his title of ‘advisor to the first lady’ did not reflect his outsized influence over the Bidens and White House operations.\n\n‘No one spent more time, whether it was in the motorcade, on the plane, in the private residence at the White House, Camp David, and at both houses in Delaware, nobody spent more personal time around them and their family and the Biden family than Anthony,’ Democratic strategist and Jill Biden’s former press secretary Michael LaRosa previously told Fox News. \n\nDuring Biden’s administration, Bernal had walk-in privileges for the Oval Office and the residence, the upper floors of the White House where the Bidens lived. Very few aides have access to the residence, with those privileges typically reserved for only the most-trusted.\n\nAccording to a 2021 Politico report, Bernal allegedly had a ‘mean streak,’ according to anonymous staffers and campaign aids who claimed he was ‘berating’ and ‘toxic.’ Though, they conceded his loyalty to Jill Biden is unmatched. \n\nAnnie Tomasini on July 18\n\nIn the Biden White House, it was said Bernal ran the East Wing and Tomasini ran the West Wing.\n\nThe two were the aides personally closest to the Bidens. \n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, when the Bidens campaigned from their Wilmington, Delaware, home at the height of the COVID pandemic, Tomasini and Bernal were the only staffers allowed inside.\n\nBoth are considered to be ‘family’ by the first couple and had unfettered access to them.\n\nAs deputy chief of staff, Tomasini ran Biden’s schedule and much of his life. She was always seen at the president’s side, whether it was at an event or riding next to him in the Beast.\n\nShe also worked for the former president when he was a senator and, later, the vice president during the Obama administration. \n\nRon Klain on July 24 \n\nKlain was Biden’s first chief of staff. His government service dates back to the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations and he had been in Biden’s orbit since the 1980s during the former president’s Senate days.\n\nHe served as Biden’s chief when Biden was vice president and kicked off his presidency started, but Klain left the Biden White House after two years. \n\nDespite leaving government service, he had an up close view of Biden in the final years of his presidency.\n\nHe was among the aides who helped prepare Biden for the disastrous debate with Trump that resulted in Biden exiting the presidential race. \n\nKlain worked outside the White House at the time but ran ‘debate camp’ at Camp David and later said Biden looked tired during the prep sessions. \n\nThough, he clarified his remarks, later telling Politico that the then-president had been ‘isolated from domestic politics’ in order to be ‘solely focused on foreign affairs.’\n\nSteve Ricchetti on July 30th \n\nRicchetti has been a key person in Biden’s life since joining his vice-presidential staff in 2012.\n\nHe was one of four aides with Biden as the then-president, sick with COVID, sat at his Rehoboth Beach house mulling wither to drop out of the 2024 presidential campaign. The others were Mike Donilon, Tomasini and Bernal.\n\nAnd Ricchetti, along with Donilon, was accused of coddling the president, keeping his sinking poll numbers and Democratic concerns about his health away from him. \n\nRicchetti also has deep ties to Capitol Hill and was the person Biden dispatched to the Capitol to help pass legislation and keep lawmakers in line.\n\nHe was also seen as a type of ‘mob boss.’ After George Clooney wrote an op-ed for The New York Times calling for Biden to exit the presidential race, Ricchetti is said to have threatened to ‘shut Clooney down.’\n\nBut his connection with Biden was personal too.\n\nRicchetti was Biden’s chief aide in 2013 when Biden’s oldest son, Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and all four of Ricchetti’s children eventually took jobs in the Biden administration.\n\nMike Donilon on July 31st \n\nDonilon was the chief strategist of Biden’s 2024 campaign and came under fire when authors Tapper and Thompson revealed in their book ‘Original Sin’ that he took the job for a cool $4 million.\n\nHe was a ‘true believer’ who was deeply trusted by Biden. He was seen as Biden’s ‘alter-ego,’ who could channel the president’s voice. \n\n‘The president valued Mike Donilon’s advice so much that aides would later joke that if he wanted, he could get Biden to start a war,’ Thompson and Tapper wrote. \n\nAnd Donilon was flippant with those who expressed concern about Biden’s age, telling them: ‘He’s going to get elected again with people thinking he’s too old.’ \n\nBut some accused him of having a blind spot to Biden’s health issues, noting Donilon’s future was tied to the president’s. \n\nBruce Reed on August 5th \n\nKnown as Biden’s ‘AI whisperer,’ Reed ran the Biden administration’s policy planning. A centrist, Reed had infuriated liberals with his willingness to compromise with Republicans on their key issues. \n\nHe, Donilon and Ricchetti were dubbed the ‘politburo,’ and Reed was a regular at Camp David, helping prepare Biden for big moments like the annual State of the Union address.\n\nReed brought his family into the administration: his daughter worked as Biden’s day scheduler. \n\nReed has a long career in government service. He was chief of staff when Biden was vice president and he worked for President Clinton.\n\nAnita Dunn on August 7th \n\nDunn, who was the communications director, took the hit for failing to prepare Biden for his debate with Trump.\n\nShe was the one who pushed to have an historically early debate with the Republican nominee, which crushed Biden’s dreams of a second term. Though, she disputed at the time that it was ‘catastrophic’ for his election outlook, per Politico.\n\nMarried to attorney Bob Bauer, who is Biden’s personal lawyer, the duo is seen as the ultimate political power couple. \n\nBut Dunn and Bauer only became close to Biden in 2015, when he was mulling whether or not to make a presidential bid. Biden didn’t run in 2016 but, when he threw his hat in the ring four years later, Dunn was an adviser on the campaign. \n\nShe left the White House in July 2024 to work for a super-PAC promoting Kamala Harris’ presidential bid.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA number of Joe Biden&#8217;s advisers are expected to face questions from&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Pressure Mounts on Biden&#8217;s Influencers to Reveal Their Role in His Presidency first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/pressure-mounts-on-bidens-influencers-to-reveal-their-role-in-his-presidency/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bidens-puppet-masters-being-forced-to-dish-on-his-presidency.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 10:15:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":338765880,"title":"Expect CBS News to undergo a major overhaul under Skydance boss David Ellison","text":"If it were, say, just a decade ago, cachet and power would be conferred on Skydance founder and CEO David Ellison, the soon-to-be chief of Paramount and its once-holy grail of TV news, CBS.\n\nToo bad it’s not 10 years ago.\n\nThe names Edward R. Murrow, Mike Wallace and Walter Cronkite — the people who built CBS News into the paragon of TV journalism — might come up in casual conversations among old-timers like yours truly, reminiscing about how network news once controlled the -political and social agenda.\n\nOr maybe they would surface in a journalism class after CBS’s current management last week settled a weird lawsuit, filed by President Trump, in order to keep in the good graces of the White House and get the Skydance-Paramount merger through his FCC regulators.\n\nBut I can guarantee that the 42-year-old Ellison — the son of mega-billionaire Larry Ellison of Oracle fame, who is a MAGA supporter of the president — isn’t thinking about the CBS News legacy as he prepares to complete his $8 billion combo.\n\nIn fact, from what I hear, continuing in the grand tradition of Murrow, Wallace and Cronkite is not at the top of Ellison’s mind because, for one, it ain’t so grand any longer, and two (maybe most important), he knows it’s a lousy business.\n\nIt’s not worth the trouble that it generates. We don’t even know if it’s profitable since Paramount doesn’t disclose the news division’s P&L statements. Plus, its product has moved so far to the left that it angers more than half the country.\n\nFull disclosure: I don’t know David Ellison personally but people I trust do, and they tell me he’s substantive, much more than a lucky sperm kid that being Larry’s son confers. His independent studio Skydance has produced such recent blockbusters as “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning.”\n\nHe doesn’t get his news from -TikTok — far from it.\n\nFor the time being, he wants to keep the news division but also move away from its progressive leanings. (A person close to him says look for investments in “truth-based” news.) He does appreciate the CBS News legacy that he is about to buy — as long as the numbers are working and he believes they aren’t, I am told.\n\nSports as crown jewel\n\nAnd that’s where things could get scary for the news division.\n\nEllison, I am told, equates CBS with football more than he does with Cronkite. If he’s looking to grow stuff, he and his point man in running the new company, former NBCU chief Jeff Shell, are looking at CBS Sports as the tip of the spear.\n\nEverything else is about to get the mother of all efficiency reviews, my sources say.\n\nLayoffs are likely, as are smaller salaries and squeezed budgets.\n\nIn Ellison’s worldview, CBS News’ legacy has cachet but when an anchor like Tony Dokoupil gets upbraided by management — as he did last year — for questioning the work of far left author Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Coates’ rationalization of the Oct. 7 massacre, something needs to change.\n\nIt’s been a long road from the time Ellison first bid on Paramount, the fading media empire created by dealmaker Sumner Redstone and left to his daughter, Shari. About two years ago David saw a distressed property he could buy on the cheap, decimated more than most of big media by cord-cutting and the vicissitudes of the business, but with prominent legacy properties and a major studio.\n\nInitially, Shari was a reluctant seller. She soon came to understand that Paramount’s fortunes weren’t getting better and her own fortune was evaporating fast. Ellison has the money (his dad’s and a partner in private equity firm RedBird Capital) to make the new company work, and help her preserve a semblance of her dad’s fortune.\n\nWith Shari out of the way, Ellison then had to deal with the incoming Trump administration. The president and his dad are famously pals, Larry being a long-time political supporter. But friendship only goes so far in assuaging Trump’s hatred for many elements of the mainstream media, and CBS is at the top of his hate list.\n\nConservatives have for years complained about the increasing bias of CBS that went beyond the adversarial nature of Murrow, etc.\n\nTrump was the first to do something about it.\n\nWith the deal facing a regulatory review, his Federal Communications Commission opened an investigation into bias at CBS since it operates over public airwaves (as opposed to cable), examining whether its news meets “public interest” guidelines, and throttled the deal.\n\nTrump also personally sued the network over a “60 Minutes” interview with his 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, saying the new magazine deceptively edited her infamous word-salad answers. OK, maybe it did. But Trump won the election so where are the “damages”?\n\nRegulatory OK coming\n\nYet, as everyone who has been following my reporting knows, the lawsuit was inextricably tied to getting the deal done and Shari paid.\n\nNow that it has been settled — for $16 million plus the expectation of much more in public service ads for pro-Trump causes — word is the regulatory nod is coming in a few weeks.\n\nWhen that happens, Shari pockets about $2 billion, which sounds like a lot until you realize she was probably worth more than $40 billion when she inherited the property.\n\nParamount and CBS will then be Ellison’s problem.\n\nIf I were in the news division, I would be afraid, very afraid.","summary":"If it were, say, just a decade ago, cachet and power would be conferred on Skydance founder and CEO David Ellison, the soon-to-be chief of Paramount and its once-holy grail of TV news, CBS.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/06/business/expect-cbs-news-to-undergo-a-major-overhaul-under-skydance-boss-david-ellison/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-whzre02x6-1751756924107.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1751742554&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 09:30:09","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":338764478,"title":"Elon Musk says he is launching new political party","text":"Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after dramatically falling out with US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe billionaire announced on his social media platform X that he had set up the America Party, billing it as a challenge to the Republican and Democratic two-party system.\n\nHowever, it is unclear if the party has been formally registered with US election authorities. Musk, who was born outside of the US and is thus ineligible to run for the US presidency, does not say who will lead it.\n\nHe first raised the prospect of forming a party during his public feud with Trump, which saw him leave his role in the administration and engage in a vicious public spat with his former ally.\n\nDuring that row, Musk posted a poll on X asking users if there should be a new political party in the US.\n\nReferencing that poll in his post on Saturday, Musk wrote: \"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"\n\nAs of Saturday, the Federal Electoral Commission had not published documents indicating the party had been formally registered.\n\nWhile there have been high-profile players outside the traditional two-party system in US politics, it is difficult for them to gain strong enough nationwide popularity to pose a real threat.\n\nIn the presidential election last year, candidates from the likes of Libertarian Party, the Green Party and the People's Party all tried in vain to stop Trump or his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, from winning.\n\nMusk was until recently a core supporter of Trump, dancing alongside him during election rallies last year and bringing his four-year-old son to meet Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nHe was also Trump's key financial backer: Musk spent $250m (£187m) to help him regain office.\n\nAfter the election, he was appointed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which was tasked with identifying swingeing cuts in the federal budget.\n\nHis fallout with Trump began when he left the administration in May and publicly criticised Trump's tax and spending plans.\n\nThe legislation - which Trump has called his \"big, beautiful bill\" - was narrowly passed by Congress and signed into law by the president this week.\n\nThe massive law includes huge spending commitments and tax cuts, and is estimated to add more than $3tn to the US deficit over the next decade.\n\nCrucially for Musk, who owns electric-vehicle giant Tesla, Trump's bill does not focus on green transition or subsidies for products like Teslas.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far,\" Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, this week. \"Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.\"\n\nTrump threatened to have Doge look into subsidies in favour of Musk's companies, alluding also to the billionaire's other businesses.\n\nMusk also owns SpaceX, which launches rockets for the US government, and Starlink, which provides satellite service for US and European defence forces.","summary":"Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after dramatically falling out with US President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/elon-musk-says-he-is-launching-new-political-party/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-363.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 09:09:11","author":"Bbc 09am,Kenneth Darko","authors":["Bbc 09am","Kenneth Darko"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.08},{"id":338757650,"title":"‘I want my vote back’: Trump-voting family stunned after Canadian mother detained over immigration status","text":"The family of a Canadian national who supported Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations of immigrants say they are feeling betrayed after federal agents recently detained the woman in California while she interviewed for permanent US residency – and began working to expel her from the country.\n\n“We feel totally blindsided,” Cynthia Olivera’s husband – US citizen and self-identified Trump voter Francisco Olivera – told the California news station KGTV. “I want my vote back.”\n\nCynthia Olivera, a 45-year-old mother of three US-born children, thus joined a growing list of examples contradicting the Trump administration’s claims that the immigration crackdown it has spearheaded since the president’s return to the Oval Office in January has prioritized targeting dangerous criminals.\n\nBeing in the US without legal status is generally a civil infraction rather than a criminal violation. Nonetheless, despite its claim that the immigration crackdown is mainly meant to rid the US of violent criminals, the White House has maintained that anyone in the US who lacks legal status is a criminal subject to deportation\n\nOlivera was unwittingly thrust under the weight of those policies after Trump spent his successful 2024 presidential campaign promising to pursue them, earning her husband’s vote along the way, according to what he told KGTV. She was just 10 when her parents brought her to the US from Toronto without permission, she said to the station.\n\nBy 1999, US immigration officials at the Buffalo border crossing had determined Olivera was living in the country without legal status and obtained an expedited order to deport her. But she was able to return to the US by driving to San Diego from Mexico within a few months.\n\n“They didn’t ask me for my citizenship – they didn’t do nothing,” Olivera would later say to KGTV. “They just waved me in.”\n\nShe recounted spending the next 25 years working in Los Angeles, paying taxes and providing for her family. KGVT reported that its investigative team scoured California and federal court databases, but the unit found no criminal charges under Cynthia Oliver’s name.\n\nIn 2024, toward the end of his presidency, Joe Biden’s administration granted her a permit allowing her to work legally in the US. She had also been navigating the process to obtain legal permanent US residency – colloquially referred to as a green card – for years.\n\nNonetheless, instead of supporting the candidate Biden endorsed to succeed him, then vice-president Kamala Harris, Olivera’s husband supported Trump in November’s White House election. He told KGTV that Trump’s promises to deport criminals en masse appealed to both him and Cynthia. And, echoing other mixed immigration status families who have had members affected by Trump’s policies, the Oliveras did not believe she would be hurt by her lack of legal US residency.\n\nThey learned she would in fact be affected by her immigration status when she went for a green card interview in Chatsworth, California, on 13 June. She was detained there by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, according to a change.org petition pleading for compassion on behalf of Cynthia.\n\nOlivera has since been transferred to an Ice detention center in El Paso, Texas, to await being deported.\n\nSpeaking to KGTV over a video call from the El Paso facility, Olivera suggested her treatment was undeserved.\n\n“The US is my country,” Olivera remarked to the station in an interview published on 3 July. “That’s where I met my husband. That’s where I went to high school, junior high, elementary [school]. That’s where I had my kids.”\n\nBut the Trump administration had little sympathy for Olivera, despite her husband’s support of the president, with a spokesperson saying in a statement that Cynthia was “an illegal alien from Canada”.\n\nOlivera had been “previously deported and chose to ignore our law and again illegally entered the country”, said the spokesperson’s statement, as reported by Newsweek. The statement noted that re-entering the US without permission after being deported is a felony, and it said Olivera would remain in Ice’s custody “pending removal to Canada”.\n\nCanada’s government commented to KGTV that it was aware of Olivera’s detention but could not intervene on her behalf because “every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders”.\n\nFrancisco Olivera, for his part, summed up his and his wife’s disillusion by saying: “My wife … up until [a couple of weeks] ago, was a strong believer in what was going to happen the next four years.”\n\nCynthia Olivera, meanwhile, said she has told officials she and her husband are willing to pay for her to fly to Canada, where she plans to stay in Mississauga with a cousin. Yet there had been no immediate indication when she may be able to travel to Canada.\n\nAs she fought back tears, Olivera said to KGTV: “The only crime I committed is to love this country and to work hard and to provide for my kids.”","summary":"Family of Cynthia Olivera reconsiders support for president after Ice detained her at green card interview\n\nThe family of a Canadian national who supported Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations of immigrants say they are feeling betrayed after federal agents recently detained the woman in California while she interviewed for permanent US residency – and began working to expel her from the country.\n\n“We feel totally blindsided,” Cynthia Olivera’s husband – US citizen and self-identified Trump voter Francisco Olivera – told the California news station KGTV. “I want my vote back.”\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-voting-family-canadian-mother-detained-immigration-status","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ea3707a0e3c3a92c1307b223ef0e0af610362c3/0_0_2860_2288/master/2860.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 09:00:35","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":338760868,"title":"'I'm the director of the Cavern Club and Adele's gig there blew my mind!'

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:09:09 BST, 6 July 2025 |Updated:09:20 BST, 6 July 2025 \n\nIt is one of the most iconic music venues in the world.\nYet while The Cavern Club may be best known as The Beatles' 'home', the live music bar has hosted a range of legendary stars - including Adele, The Fonz and Jimi Hendrix. \nInitially a jazz club when it opened in 1957, the venue is now fast approaching its 70th anniversary and despite it being five decades since The Beatles' last show, their legacy still lives on. \nHowever, they aren't the only huge stars to have put their mark on the iconic Liverpudlian venue. \nThe club's director Jon Keats revealed his wildest celebrity run-ins over the years as he chatted with Jodie Kidd and Merlin Griffiths on the latest episode of their new podcast Three Landlords Walk Into A Bar.\nDuring the chat, Jon revealed that before reaching the dizzy heights of her stratospheric fame, Adele chose the Cavern for the album launch of her second record 21. \n\nWhile The Cavern Club may be best known as The Beatles' 'home' (pictured in 1962) the live music bar has hosted a range of legendary stars - including Adele, The Fonz and Jimi Hendrix\n\nBefore the dizzy heights of her stratospheric fame Adele chose the Cavern for the album launch of her second record 21 back in 2011 \n\nThe club's director Jon Keats (left) spilled the secrets of his wildest celebrity run-ins as he chatted with Jodie Kidd and Merlin Griffiths on their podcast Three Landlords Walk Into A Bar\nAfter gaining chart success after the release of 19, the singer was already on the map when Smooth Radio called Jon and asked if they would be interested in hosting the intimate gig. \n'She launched 21 at the Cavern. I remember taking that call and it was through Smooth Radio and asked if we would be interested in hosting this intimate gig - just 120 people in the room,' explained Jon. \n'She did four tracks from 21 and three from 19, with just a piano and a guitar. We’d never heard the songs obviously, but you just knew. Head blown. She was lovely as well, she really was lovely.’\nAnother day that stuck in Jon's mind was when his childhood here strolled into the Cavern for a casual pint. \n'I'm in the office booking the music when we get a call. Bill, one of the owners, answers it and goes, \"Yeah, yeah, okay, we’ll do it.\" \n'He puts the phone down and I ask, \"What was that about?\". He says, \"Oh, typical... apparently the Fonz just walked into the Cavern.\" \n'I get in there - and there he was. The Fonz. He was my childhood hero. When I was 10, I thought I was the Fonz.' \nHenry Winkler, who was often best known as the Fonz or Fonzie due to his role in the sitcom Happy Days, was in the city doing Panto over the festive period. \n'He was renting an apartment just around the corner from the Cavern, huge Beatles fan. He’d come in quite a lot - usually for a half and all the staff got to know him quite well.' \n\nInitially a jazz club when it opened in 1957, the venue is now approaching its 70th anniversary and despite it being five decades since The Beatles' last show, their legacy still lives on\n\nOne day that sticks in Jon's mind above them all is the time his childhood here strolled into the Cavern for a casual pint (Henry Winkler, who was often known as The Fonz pictured in 1984)\n\nIt is thought that Jimi Hendrix graced the stage, but the owners have never been able to confirm it for definite (Jimi pictured in 1967)\n\nJon added: 'We’ve also had current big names doing album launches. Libertines played recently, Circa Waves, Paolo Nutini (pictured), Wunderhorse, Scouting for Girls'\nJon was also keen to discuss the club's most legendary performers. \n'When you talk about the Cavern and you’ve got to talk about The Beatles,' he mused. \nHe continued: 'We wouldn’t be here without them - they put the Cavern on the map because everyone wanted to play there after that, and it’s still the same now. \n'The Beatles played here 292 times. But the Cavern’s story isn’t just about The Beatles. As owners and custodians, it’s our job to tell the whole story.'\n'Their last gig was August '63 the Stones played in November '23, again because the Beatles had played it.' \nYet there is one star that even Jon is 100% sure performed at the iconic venue despite swirling rumours. \nIt is thought that Jimi Hendrix graced the stage, but the owners have never been able to confirm it for definite. \nJon explained: 'There was a rumour that Jimi Hendrix played the Cavern. It's one of those 'did he didn't he?' We say he didn't because we have never been able to prove it.\n'There is talk that he was playing the Empire theatre and then he came down and had a row with his girlfriend in the car park. So there is all these stories.' \n\nThe Cavern Club calls itself the 'most famous club in the world,' but aside from their iconic Beatles nights which they still hold every Saturday they are still proving ground for big names and new acts alike (pictured Anne-Marie) \n\nAfter performing two sold out nights for his album launch, Sam Ryder returned to the Cavern Club for the week Eurovision was held in Liverpool back in 2024 for three back to back shows \n\nArctic Monkeys pictured after their name was added to the Wall of Fame in the club \n\nThe Happy Mondays are another hit UK band to have played the venue \nThe Cavern Club calls itself the 'most famous club in the world,' but aside from their iconic Beatles nights which they still hold every Saturday they are still proving ground for big names and new acts alike.\n'You might go in one night and see a Brazilian samba band, and the next night me a local school or college doing it’s end of year showcase so its young musicians,' added Jon.\n'But we’ve also had current big names doing album launches. Libertines played recently, Circa Waves, Paolo Nutini, Wunderhorse, Scouting for Girls.' \nAnother star who is becoming a household name there is Eurovision star Sam Ryder. \nAfter performing two sold out nights for his album launch, he then returned for the week Eurovision was held in Liverpool back in 2024. \n'He did three shows back to back the week of Eurovision when he came to Liverpool. He is such a hard worker, he deserves every bit of success he really does. \nJon joked: 'He can hit the notes but he can't poor a pint that lad.'\n\nJimi HendrixAdeleJodie KiddMerlin Griffiths\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'I'm the director of the Cavern Club and Adele's gig there blew my mind!'

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK \n Published:09:08 BST, 6 July 2025 |Updated:09:08 BST, 6 July 2025 \n\nLegendary R&B boyband Damage have revealed the shocking racism they faced in the Nineties and how a lack of support with their mental health led them to forge new careers beyond the spotlight.\nIn an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the group - now in their 40s - explained they were forced to dress and act a certain way in order to avoid being perceived as 'dangerous', and had to fight for press coverage after being told 'black faces don't sell magazines'. \nOriginally formed by Jade Jones, Andrez Harriott, Rahsaan J. Bromfield, Noel Simpson, and Coreé Richards, Damage burst onto the scene with their groundbreaking debut album Forever in 1995.\nCoreé left the band in 2001, shortly after the release of their second album, Since You've Been Gone.\nToday, Damage are recognised as one of the UK's most influential R&B groups, having sold over four million records worldwide - but their path to success was anything but easy. \nJade, who is married to fellow pop star Emma Bunton, explained: 'Being five black guys in a band, there was an image that had to be portrayed, you know, for it to be palatable for, for the pop market.'\n\n R&B boyband Damage have revealed the shocking racism they faced in the Nineties (pictured: Jade Jones, Noel Simpson, Andrez Harriott, Rahsaan J Bromfield and Coreé Richards)\n\nIn an interview with MailOnline, the group - now in their 40s - explained they were forced to dress and act a certain way in order to avoid being perceived as 'dangerous'\nHe continued: 'We only got put on the cover of Smash Hits through fighting [for it]. We were told we weren't allowed to be on the cover before because black faces didn't sell magazines in the 90s.\n'Therefore, for them to make it more palatable for everybody, we had to do a shoot, which was definitely not our style at the time, but it was something we had to swallow.\n'There a picture of us with pastel coloured suits on, with flowers and roses all around us.\n'Boyband Five were out at the time and they were able to dress and act however they wanted. We had to act a certain way.\n'Not saying that we were bad boys. We never were, but we could never portray ourselves or even have an inkling of any aggression about us or any attitude, otherwise we just get shut down.'\nMailOnline has contacted Smash Hits for comment. \nNoel added: 'We could never ever be portrayed as the bad boys of pop. Our stuff would have been cancelled straight away.'\nSharing his thoughts, Andrez said: 'There were bands like Five, NSYNC which all come down the lineage of people like New Kids on the Block, which come down the lineage of the Jackson 5, etc.\n'All those bands, they could take American clothing, American language, use American music producers, and create R&B songs.'\n\nJade revealed: 'We only got put on the cover of Smash Hits through fighting [for it]. We were told we weren't allowed to be on the cover before because black faces didn't sell magazines'\nHe continued: 'And when Damage would do something like a cover of an Earth, Wind and Fire song, which should have been a massive hit, radio struggled to play it.\n'There is a really restrictive, dominant, paradigm that black males have to fit into.\n'And there is unconsciously and consciously an idea that we are dangerous, and for us as young black males, we have to provide a counter narrative to that nonsense just to be us.\n'I remember our record label, we went to Aquascutum to get jackets in central London and the English gentleman image was really kind of being portrayed through us because we have limited bandwidth.\n'We couldn't come out in baggy jeans and hoodies, or everyone would be terrified.\n'It's really different now, but at that time we had to provide a counter narrative to this idea that five black guys in a space is dangerous.'\nMental health struggles were also a significant part of each member's journey, a challenge that wasn't openly discussed during their rise to fame.\nReflecting on a turning point while on tour in Southeast Asia, Rahsaan explained: 'At that point we were just like a hard no, we need to stop doing what what we're doing right now.\n\nAndrez claimed: 'It's really different now, but at that time we had to provide a counter narrative to this idea that five black guys in a space is dangerous' \n\nMental health struggles have been a significant part of each member's journey, a challenge that wasn't openly discussed during their rise to fame\n'Up until that point, we didn't realise that we had the power to do that. \n'We were just part of the machine, that kept those cogs going and It was really something therapeutic for us to be able to do that.'\nAndrez shared: 'You know, when we were coming up as a band, mental health was not discussed in any space, whether it was creative industries or private business or statutory spaces, you know, the welfare of individuals wasn't really considered. \n'For us, the impact of being so young, getting up really early for television shows, this constant hamster wheel of trying to get the records out, etc. I don't think we'd have reflected on the impact of that until many years later. \n'The hardest time would have been when we first separated and you have to really find yourself within society. We did this since we were 12, 13, 14 years old. \n'We had to go out and do job interviews and work in organisations and, you know, find ourselves in the world.\n'It wasn't necessarily the impact of the band, it was more so the closing when we ended and then when we came back together.'\n\nExplaining how their tight bond helped them through their hardship, Jade explained: 'I think even when we were younger, I think we, we always had a real family connection'\nNoel said: 'You get into a band and you're really young, you don't think it's ever gonna end. \n'The free clothes, the taxis everywhere, the trainers, all the amazing stuff, the red carpets and all that, and you never think it's gonna end. \n'You know, when it does come all crashing down and for me personally, I had to go and like sign on, which was an eye opening experience for me when when we first when we first split.'\nExplaining how their tight bond helped them through their hardship, Jade explained: 'I think even when we were younger, I think we, we always had a real family connection between all of us. \n'So therefore we were always there, everyone was always allowed space and you could always tell if somebody wasn't feeling too good. \n'So we kind of helped pick each other up a lot and that was throughout performances and everything. \n'I think that's just our synergy that we have together that allowed us to kind of have that safe space between each other.' \nDamage initially split in 2002 after releasing their album Live & Liberated. They then had a brief reunion in 2010 before officially splitting up.\n\nDamage initially split in 2002 after releasing their album Live & Liberated. They then had a brief reunion in 2010 before officially splitting up \n\n Legendary nineties R&B boyband announces biggest UK tour - with tickets set to go on sale this week \nEach member of Damage has gone on to forge a career outside the spotlight - paths that, in many ways, reflect the personal growth and life lessons they took from their time in the band.\nRahsaan now serves as a deputy head at an alternative provision (AP) school, supporting young people who don't thrive in mainstream education. \nNoel works with the charity Carers Choices, offering vital support to those looking after loved ones. \nJade discovered a passion for food and became a professional chef, while also dabbling in property. \nAndrez spent over a decade working with children in the justice system through the local authority, eventually launching his own organisation. \nHe's now an organisational consultant, working within the NHS.\n\nThe group have revealed they are coming back to the UK in December 2025 at O2 Shepherds Bush Empire stage. Limited tickets remain for fans still hoping to attend.\n\nDamage are now gearing up for their biggest headline show in over a decade as they prepare to celebrate 30 years since their debut.\nThe iconic R&B group will return to the stage on December 5, 2025, with a special anniversary show at London's O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire.\nSpeaking about the highly anticipated show, the group said on Instagram: 'Our fans have shown us so much love, and we can't wait to hit the O2 Shepherds Bush Empire stage next December for our biggest headline show in 10 years, celebrating 30 years together.\n'It's going to be epic!

Will Maine voters?","text":"As the top Senate appropriator, Sen. Susan Collins was expected to be a key player in negotiations this summer over the sweeping tax and spending bill proposed by President Donald Trump.\n\nBut as the final vote drew near on Tuesday, Collins was not the one being pressured by Senate leadership to support Trump’s “Big Beautiful Budget.” It was her fellow moderate Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was put through the meat grinder and ultimately voted in support of the bill, even though she admittedly doesn’t like it, after receiving concessions to lessen the impact on her home state.\n\nCritics say that it was all part of the plan, speculating that Senate Majority Leader John Thune – and so far, Trump – gave Collins a free pass, allowing her to vote against a bill that polling suggests is deeply unpopular ahead of the 2026 midterms, when she will face voters. Murkowski, meanwhile, doesn’t face reelection until 2029.\n\nTrump is not one to suffer disloyalty lightly. After Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., eviscerated the bill in a floor speech, Trump attacked him online and threatened to primary him. Tillis voted against the bill and announced he would not seek reelection.\n\nCollins is the only congressional Republican from New England and the only Republican senator up for reelection in a state won by Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. She is widely viewed as one of the few Republicans who can hold a statewide seat in Maine.\n\nDemocrats believe Collins is vulnerable and the race is expected to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in outside spending. And national Democrats are trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, who strongly opposed the bill and put her concerns in writing to the entire delegation.\n\nCritics say that leadership knew they had the votes to pass the bill without Collins. Had they needed her, Collins would have been the only member of Maine’s delegation to support the bill and would have presented a clear contrast for Mills, should she choose to run.\n\nIn an interview with the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram on Wednesday, Collins pushed back against any suggestion that the Senate vote was orchestrated to give her a free pass.\n\n“That is absolutely ludicrous,” Collins said, blaming “partisan Democrats” for spreading a “crazy untruth.”\n\n“No one knew what her ultimate decision was going to be,” Collins said of Murkowski.\n\nCollins held her cards close to her chest before the vote, refusing to say publicly which way she might vote but expressing concern about drastic cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, among other provisions.\n\nCollins won praise from Maine’s hospitals for her “no” vote, for speaking out about the impact of Medicaid cuts and for trying to cushion the impact of taking health coverage away from an estimated 40,000 people in Maine. Those provisions in the bill are expected to push hospitals into greater financial distress but, unlike tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy, won’t take effect until after the 2026 election.\n\nBut political observers say Collins may not be able to avoid the blame for any negative consequences, given her party affiliation.\n\n“The problem is, she is part of a team that pushed forward a measure that will be very unpopular,” said Dan Shea, political science professor at at Colby College in Waterville. “It’s her colleagues, it’s her caucus, that pushed through this bill. And there may be a good bit of guilt by association.”\n\nCOLLINS LACKS TRUMP’S EAR\n\nA recent poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that 58% of respondents in Maine didn’t want the bill to pass, including 94% of Democrats and 72% of independents. Less than a third wanted it to pass, which was similar with most other national polls. The online survey of 846 people was conducted from June 19-23 and has a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points.\n\n“She’s independent, but she’s also in lockstep with her Republican colleagues in a lot of moves, including leadership,” Shea said. “Her first vote if she’s reelected will be for a Republican majority leader, probably John Thune. This is the same leadership that pushed through this measure.”\n\nCollins wasn’t a vociferous outspoken critic of the bill, as was independent Sen. Angus King, though she expressed concerns about the Medicaid cuts. She declined repeated interviews with the Press Herald leading up the bill’s passage, saying she wanted to see the final text first, which was not available until the last minute.\n\nShe proposed an amendment that would have allowed tax cuts for people making more than $25 million to expire, while doubling an emergency fund for rural hospitals to $50 million, which is still believed to be far short of what will be needed to maintain services and prevent closures. Her amendment was voted down, but the additional funding was included in the final bill, without the tax increase.\n\nThe Maine Hospital Association heaped praise on Collins in a written statement Wednesday.\n\n“We want to particularly thank Senator Collins for her efforts on behalf of Maine hospitals,” the association said in a written statement. “It is very difficult to take a stance contrary to one’s party caucus. However, as she has done many times, when Senator Collins feels Maine will be hurt, she fights for Maine. And we can not thank her enough. The lone mitigation measure for hospitals in the reconciliation package, the relief fund, was the direct result of Senator Collins’ efforts.”\n\nBut Mark Brewer, chair of political science at the University of Maine in Orono, said Collins may have a hard time convincing voters that, as appropriations chair and a senior Republican senator with power and influence in the chamber, she did not play a pivotal role in shaping the bill.\n\n“You would think as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee – and also a key swing vote – she would have been in a powerful position to shape this kind of legislation,” Brewer said. “But one thing we have learned about Trump so far in his second term is that those old positions of power may not matter as much as they used to.”\n\nOnly those who are close to Trump can influence his thinking, Brewer said. “In that sense, Collins didn’t have a whole lot of influence in shaping this bill. Certainly not what you would expect from a Senate appropriations chair in previous administrations, for sure,” he said.\n\nCollins is not in Trump’s inner circle, though she did travel to Mar-a-Lago in February to discuss the budget. She has not supported any of his three campaigns for president and voted to convict him after the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the Capitol.\n\nTrump publicly criticized Collins after The New York Times reported in 2022 that she and Sen. Mitch McConnell were recruiting “anti-Trump candidates.” Trump called Collins “absolutely atrocious” and said he could have ousted her from her Senate seat.\n\nA month later, Trump called Collins “wacky” for leading efforts to make it harder for members of Congress to challenge election results and make it clear that the vice president only has a ceremonial role in counting electoral votes. The changes were made after Trump pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nBut she has also provided support at key moments, casting the deciding vote in Trump’s first term to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, which later overturned nationwide abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. And she has supported some of his more controversial cabinet appointments in his second term, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Russell Vought.\n\nCollins told the Press Herald on Wednesday that she informed the White House “weeks ago” that the bill would need to undergo significant changes to win her support. Even then, Collins was not at the center of the action as the vote drew near.\n\nIn addition to Murkowski, Thune reportedly held late talks with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who ultimately voted against the bill because it included a $5 trillion increase in the national debt ceiling. It’s unclear if Collins had similar meetings with the majority leader in the final hours.\n\nOPPONENTS POUNCE\n\nAlthough she voted against the bill, opponents are working overtime to tie her to Trump and the bill’s passage, primarily by highlighting her procedural vote last weekend to advance the bill for a final debate and vote.\n\nJordan Wood, a Bristol Democrat who is mounting the most aggressive challenge to Collins, said Maine’s senior senator should have used the procedural vote to try to stop the bill, so lawmakers could start over. He described her as the decisive vote to advance the bill, even though her “no” vote on the motion would only have led to a 50-50 tie and Vice President JD Vance was prepared to cast a deciding vote in favor.\n\n“That (procedural vote) was her opportunity to organize an opposition to make sure that, given how devastating this bill will be for our state, she could stand up and stop it if she wanted to and if she had the courage to and she didn’t,” Wood said. “People in Maine have seen this before where she is given permission because she’s not the decisive vote to vote against it. That’s what we saw again.”\n\nA famous Maine critic of Collins had a similar take.\n\n“As always, Susan Collins counted votes and decided she could vote no and the bill would still pass, thus saving her golden seat in the Senate,” author Stephen King said in a social media post. “She and Murkowski seem to have a pact — whose turn is it to vote no this time?”\n\nPhillip Rench, an engineer from Waterboro who is running as an independent, also criticized Collins, questioning her influence.\n\n“Even though she voted against this bill, she is still responsible for it,” Rench said in a written statement. “She failed to secure adequate funding for rural hospitals and now Mainers on Medicaid will face uncertainty and loss of coverage. To make matters worse, 3-4 Trillion Dollars will be added to the already 37 Trillion National Debt, of which our children will be paying interest on for the rest of their lives.”\n\nWHAT REPUBLICANS THINK\n\nIt’s unclear how her vote will play with Republican voters, and more importantly Trump supporters, who make up an increasingly large percentage of Republicans. Collins has been greeted with mixed reactions at state party conventions, which have increasingly focused on supporting Trump.\n\nCarmen Calabrese, a Kennebunkport resident who has announced that he’s challenging Collins for the Republican nomination, is running as a steadfast Trump supporter and urged passage of Trump’s budget bill, saying it’s “a winner for Maine” and urging Collins to “show some backbone.”\n\nCalabrese blasted Collins in a news release after she voted against the bill.\n\n“What’s the sense in sending a Republican Collins to DC when she votes with the Democrats?” Calabrese said in a written statement. “She has sold us out once again to the liberal media. She cares more about getting a headline than saving tipped workers money or giving relief to seniors. This obstructionist has to go.”\n\nDespite their history and his attacks on other Republican opponents, Trump has not taken to social media to criticize Collins.\n\nSome say that speaks volumes, especially since Trump immediately threatened to primary Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, after he eviscerated the bill in a floor speech. Tillis voted against the bill and announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nAs of late last week, Trump had not posted anything about Collins.\n\nThat could be a reflection of Trump listening to his advisers and considering the midterms. Generally, the party that controls the White House loses seats in Congress during a midterm election, and that could be especially true with Trump, whose supporters generally turn out for him but not others.\n\n“(Trump) knew Tillis was vulnerable,” Brewer said. “Maybe his advisers thought, ‘We could find another Republican that can run competitively in North Carolina, but maybe we can’t find another Republican who can do what Susan Collins can do in Maine.'”","summary":"The Republican senator's maneuvering on Trump's tax and spending cuts bill shows she's walking a tightrope ahead of her 2026 reelection bid.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/07/06/donald-trump-gave-susan-collins-a-pass-for-now-will-maine-voters/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/41889993_20250417_pnsy_4.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 08:00:57","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":338917068,"title":"Elon Musk yashinze ishyaka rya Politiki","text":"Umuherwe Elon Musk yatangarije ku rubuga rwe rwa X ko yamaze gushinga ishyaka yise American Party, rije gushyira iherezo ku buhangange bw’amashyaka ya Ba-Repubulikani n’Aba-Demokarate.\n\nElon Musk, udafite uburenganzira bwo kuyobora Amerika kubera ko yavukiye hanze yayo, ntiyatangaje niba ishyaka rye ryamaze kwandikwa ku mugaragaro n’inzego zishinzwe amatora, ndetse n’uzariyobora.\n\nYatangije igitekerezo cyo gushinga ishyaka nyuma y’amakimbirane yagiranye na Perezida Donald Trump, wamukuye mu nshingano yari yaramuhaye mu butegetsi bwe.\n\nMu gihe cy’amakimbirane akomeye hagati ye na Trump, Musk yashyize kuri X igisa n’ubushakashatsi (poll) abaza abakoresha uru rubuga niba hagomba kubaho ishyaka rishya rya politiki muri Amerika.\n\nMusk yanditse kuri X ko ubwo bushakashatsi bwagaragaje ko Abanyamerika benshi bakeneye ishyaka rishya ryo gutsinsura Abademokarate n’Abarepubulikani basimburana ku butegetsi.\n\nYagize ati: “Iyo bigeze ku gusenya igihugu cyacu binyujijwe mu kunyereza no kwiba, tubayeho mu buryo bwa politiki bw’ishyaka rimwe rukumbi, si demokarasi.”\n\nYakomeje agira ati:” Uyu munsi, American Party ryashinzwe kugira ngo ribasubize ubwigenge bwanyu.”\n\nKugeza kuri iki Cyumweru, Komisiyo Ishinzwe Amatora ya Leta Zunze Ubumwe za Amerika ntirashyira ahagaragara inyandiko zemeza ko iryo shyaka ryanditswe ku mugaragaro.\n\nAmateka yerekana ko atari ibintu byoroshye guhangana n’ishyaka y’Abarepubulikani cyangwa Abademokarate, kuko ababigerageza batsindwa rugikubita.\n\nMu matora ya perezida y’umwaka ushize, abakandida b’amashyaka nka Libertarian Party, Green Party na People’s Party bose bagerageje guhagarika Trump cyangwa Kamala Harris, ariko bibata k’uw’amazi.\n\nMuri ayo matora, Elon Musk yari umwe mu bashyigikiye cyane Trump, aho yagaragaraga amubyinira iruhande mu bikorwa byo kwiyamamaza.\n\nMusk yari umuterankunga ukomeye wa Trump mu matora, aho yashoyemo miliyoni 250 z’amadolari kugira ngo amufashe kongera gusubira ku butegetsi.\n\nNDEKEZI JOHNSON / UMUSEKE.RW","summary":"Umuherwe Elon Musk yatangarije ku rubuga rwe rwa X ko yamaze gushinga ishyaka yise American Party, rije gushyira iherezo ku buhangange bw’amashyaka ya Ba-Repubulikani n’Aba-Demokarate.

James Comer has summoned most of the Biden's inner circle to the Capitol for a grilling, using his subpoena power on those who refused to come voluntarily.\n\nAnd there could be more interviews to come. \n\nComer sent letters to more aides last week, saying information was needed 'as part of our aggressive investigation into the cover-up of [Biden's] cognitive decline.'\n\nAmong the Biden aides who received them were press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, White House counsel office spokesperson Ian Sams, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates and chief of staff Jeff Zients.\n\nThe Daily Mail breaks down the aides in Biden's inner circle who are under the most scrutiny: \n\nDr. Kevin O'Connor on July 9\n\nDr. O'Connor is at the center of the coverup claims and was the first subpoenaed by House Republicans to answer questions about Biden's declining health.\n\nHe was Biden's personal physician, traveling with him and signing off on his yearly physicals, giving the then-president a clean bill of health. But O'Connor notably didn't subject Biden to routine cognitive tests. \n\nO'Connor, a retired US Army colonel, began his White House service in 2006 under the George W Bush administration as part of the White House Medical Unit (WHMU). \n\nIn 2009, O'Connor was named physician to then-Vice President Biden. He was named as Biden's physician when he became president in 2021.\n\nQuestions about Biden's cognitive state have been raised after the publication of 'Original Sin,' a book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson that detailed an alleged cover-up among aides about the former president's capabilities. \n\nAdditionally, after Biden announced that he had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, further questions were raised about why it was not caught while he was in office.\n\nO'Connor, after his yearly physicals of Biden, would release a letter describing his findings on Biden's health, declaring him fit to serve as president - including in the months before his disastrous presidential debate with Donald Trump.\n\nAhead of the June 2024 debate - which was followed by Biden's decision to step down as the Democratic presidential nominee - O'Connor signed off on Biden's health, writing he 'continues to be fit for duty.'\n\nAshley Williams on July 11\n\nWilliams was Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations and had daily contact with Biden. Her duties included overseeing the president's personal schedule, private engagements, and day-to-day affairs. \n\nShe is a longtime Biden staffer, going back to his time as vice presidency. At that time, she worked for Jill Biden as her senior assistant, earning the trust of the then-second lady.\n\nWilliams worked on the 2020 campaign, was in the Biden White House during his term and stayed with Biden to work in his post-presidency office.\n\nShe, along with Deputy Chief of Staff Annie Tomasini, ran Oval Office operations - no one was able to see President Biden without going through them first.\n\nWilliams, along with Tomasini and Jill Biden's senior aide Anthony Bernal, were accused of forming a 'protective bubble' around President Biden.\n\n'Annie, Ashley and Anthony create a protective bubble around POTUS. He's staffed so closely that he's lost all independence. POTUS relies on staff to nudge him with reminders of who he's meeting, including former staffers and advisers who Biden should easily remember without a reminder from Annie,' a Biden aide told Axios.\n\nAnthony Bernal on July 16\n\nBernal, the longtime Biden aide nicknamed Jill's 'work husband,' was slapped with a subpoena by Republicans after he missed his June 26 appearance date before the Oversight Committee.\n\nChairman Comer demanded his presence on July 16.\n\nBernal has worked for the Bidens since Joe Biden served as vice president. \n\nIn that time, he bonded with Jill Biden. The duo became close after splitting champagne and french fries on election night in 2008, Politico reported. \n\nHe worked for the First Lady in the East Wing during her husband's presidency, where his title of 'advisor to the first lady' did not reflect his outsized influence over the Bidens and White House operations.\n\n'No one spent more time, whether it was in the motorcade, on the plane, in the private residence at the White House, Camp David, and at both houses in Delaware, nobody spent more personal time around them and their family and the Biden family than Anthony,' Democratic strategist and Jill Biden's former press secretary Michael LaRosa previously told Fox News. \n\nDuring Biden's administration, Bernal had walk-in privileges for the Oval Office and the residence, the upper floors of the White House where the Bidens lived. Very few aides have access to the residence, with those privileges typically reserved for only the most-trusted.\n\nAccording to a 2021 Politico report, Bernal allegedly had a 'mean streak,' according to anonymous staffers and campaign aids who claimed he was 'berating' and 'toxic.' Though, they conceded his loyalty to Jill Biden is unmatched. \n\nAnnie Tomasini on July 18\n\nIn the Biden White House, it was said Bernal ran the East Wing and Tomasini ran the West Wing.\n\nThe two were the aides personally closest to the Bidens. \n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, when the Bidens campaigned from their Wilmington, Delaware, home at the height of the COVID pandemic, Tomasini and Bernal were the only staffers allowed inside.\n\nBoth are considered to be 'family' by the first couple and had unfettered access to them.\n\nAs deputy chief of staff, Tomasini ran Biden's schedule and much of his life. She was always seen at the president's side, whether it was at an event or riding next to him in the Beast.\n\nShe also worked for the former president when he was a senator and, later, the vice president during the Obama administration. \n\nRon Klain on July 24 \n\nKlain was Biden's first chief of staff. His government service dates back to the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations and he had been in Biden's orbit since the 1980s during the former president's Senate days.\n\nHe served as Biden's chief when Biden was vice president and kicked off his presidency started, but Klain left the Biden White House after two years. \n\nDespite leaving government service, he had an up close view of Biden in the final years of his presidency.\n\nHe was among the aides who helped prepare Biden for the disastrous debate with Trump that resulted in Biden exiting the presidential race. \n\nKlain worked outside the White House at the time but ran 'debate camp' at Camp David and later said Biden looked tired during the prep sessions. \n\nThough, he clarified his remarks, later telling Politico that the then-president had been 'isolated from domestic politics' in order to be 'solely focused on foreign affairs.'\n\nSteve Ricchetti on July 30th \n\nRicchetti has been a key person in Biden's life since joining his vice-presidential staff in 2012.\n\nHe was one of four aides with Biden as the then-president, sick with COVID, sat at his Rehoboth Beach house mulling wither to drop out of the 2024 presidential campaign. The others were Mike Donilon, Tomasini and Bernal.\n\nAnd Ricchetti, along with Donilon, was accused of coddling the president, keeping his sinking poll numbers and Democratic concerns about his health away from him. \n\nRicchetti also has deep ties to Capitol Hill and was the person Biden dispatched to the Capitol to help pass legislation and keep lawmakers in line.\n\nHe was also seen as a type of 'mob boss.' After George Clooney wrote an op-ed for The New York Times calling for Biden to exit the presidential race, Ricchetti is said to have threatened to 'shut Clooney down.'\n\nBut his connection with Biden was personal too.\n\nRicchetti was Biden's chief aide in 2013 when Biden's oldest son, Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and all four of Ricchetti's children eventually took jobs in the Biden administration.\n\nMike Donilon on July 31st \n\nDonilon was the chief strategist of Biden's 2024 campaign and came under fire when authors Tapper and Thompson revealed in their book 'Original Sin' that he took the job for a cool $4 million.\n\nHe was a 'true believer' who was deeply trusted by Biden. He was seen as Biden's 'alter-ego,' who could channel the president's voice. \n\n'The president valued Mike Donilon's advice so much that aides would later joke that if he wanted, he could get Biden to start a war,' Thompson and Tapper wrote. \n\nAnd Donilon was flippant with those who expressed concern about Biden's age, telling them: 'He's going to get elected again with people thinking he's too old.' \n\nBut some accused him of having a blind spot to Biden's health issues, noting Donilon's future was tied to the president's. \n\nBruce Reed on August 5th \n\nKnown as Biden's 'AI whisperer,' Reed ran the Biden administration's policy planning. A centrist, Reed had infuriated liberals with his willingness to compromise with Republicans on their key issues. \n\nHe, Donilon and Ricchetti were dubbed the 'politburo,' and Reed was a regular at Camp David, helping prepare Biden for big moments like the annual State of the Union address.\n\nReed brought his family into the administration: his daughter worked as Biden's day scheduler. \n\nReed has a long career in government service. He was chief of staff when Biden was vice president and he worked for President Clinton.\n\nAnita Dunn on August 7th \n\nDunn, who was the communications director, took the hit for failing to prepare Biden for his debate with Trump.\n\nShe was the one who pushed to have an historically early debate with the Republican nominee, which crushed Biden's dreams of a second term. Though, she disputed at the time that it was 'catastrophic' for his election outlook, per Politico.\n\nMarried to attorney Bob Bauer, who is Biden's personal lawyer, the duo is seen as the ultimate political power couple. \n\nBut Dunn and Bauer only became close to Biden in 2015, when he was mulling whether or not to make a presidential bid. Biden didn't run in 2016 but, when he threw his hat in the ring four years later, Dunn was an adviser on the campaign. \n\nShe left the White House in July 2024 to work for a super-PAC promoting Kamala Harris' presidential bid.","summary":"Several advisers to Joe Biden will be quizzed by Republicans on Capitol Hill this month as part of the GOP's examination of a coverup of the former president's mental health.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14869793/joe-biden-puppet-masters-investigation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/04/21/99984793-0-image-a-12_1751662446857.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 05:14:34","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.154},{"id":338800136,"title":"Biden says European presidents want him to return","text":"(MENAFN) Former US President Joe Biden claims that several European leaders have been privately encouraging him to return to international affairs, despite his retirement from public office. Speaking at the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) conference in San Diego, the 82-year-old said he’s received multiple calls from foreign leaders urging him to get involved, though he declined to name them.Biden said he has refrained from stepping back into the spotlight, acknowledging that “things are different now.” While no longer directly involved in NATO matters, he admitted he still offers advice and remains in contact with US lawmakers from both parties. “I’ve been dealing with a lot of Democrat and Republican colleagues calling me… wanting to talk and bounce things off of me,” Biden noted, attributing his continued engagement to a deep personal commitment to his past work.The former president also voiced disappointment over the reversal of several of his administration’s policies under Donald Trump’s leadership, without mentioning Trump by name. He expressed concern about the rapid pace of change: “Many of the things I worked so damn hard [on]... are changing so rapidly.”Currently, Biden is focused on completing a memoir about his presidency, working intensively on a 500-page book with a publisher. He dropped out of the 2024 presidential race amid mounting criticism over his age and a poor debate performance, officially endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Trump.In 2025, Biden disclosed he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, but he continues to make public appearances and remains hopeful about his recovery.","summary":"(MENAFN) Former US President Joe Biden claims that several European leaders have been privately encouraging him to return to international affairs, despite his retirement from public office. ...","url":"https://menafn.com/1109764908/Biden-says-European-presidents-want-him-to-return","image":"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/Menafn_News_Images\\local_politics_1177_menafn.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 05:06:30","author":"Date,MENAFN","authors":["Date","MENAFN"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jo","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":338659262,"title":"How the hell did we get here?","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nIt’s been a tumultuous 6 months with Donald Trump inhabiting the presidency, with a weakened federal government now incapable of addressing monumental problems like climate change, pandemics, education, basic security and safety, and even forecasting the weather.\n\nAs the United States reaches its 249th year of existence, it’s in a very precarious position. So how did we get here?\n\nElon Musk’s propaganda machine\n\nThe 2024 election made it clear why Elon Musk leveraged billions of dollars to purchase Twitter, which he has since rebranded as X. The wealthiest man in the world turned the site into a propaganda machine, amplifying conspiracy theories and bigotry.\n\nWhen he threw his support behind Trump, the site went all in on amplifying his campaign while escalating lies and falsehoods about Democrats, particularly President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, liberals and progressives mounted a mass exodus to Bluesky. Conservatives responded with anger—because they vitally need to troll liberals, which they prefer over speaking with each other.\n\nAttack on diversity\n\nTrump is a racist and the biggest promoter of the “birther” conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. In his first term, he praised Nazis as “very fine people.” And now in his second term, there’s just more of the same.\n\nBut instead of merely throwing around rhetoric where “woke” is a substitute for the N-word, Trump is using his power to roll back the very notion of diversity. He’s used executive action and internal government policy to purge diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and has even taken to simply erasing the achievement of Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAt the same time, he’s fulfilled—in part, at least—his campaign pledges to the most virulent racists by affirming his support for the pro-slavery Confederacy. Trump and his lieutenants like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are relitigating the Civil War and coming down firmly on the side that viewed Black people as property.\n\nMusk’s government sledgehammer\n\nBy empowering Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency to infiltrate multiple government agencies, Trump advanced the longstanding right-wing mission to undermine effective government. Musk and his team of destructive operatives—like “Big Balls”—have tried to take down government agencies that millions of people rely on.\n\nThere has been significant resistance and a string of courtroom losses for Trump. But thanks to DOGE, the government’s ability to do things like send out Social Security payments and monitor hurricanes has been compromised.\n\nTrust in the government was already in trouble, but Trump and Musk made it worse—all in the name of “small” government, even if that means that people have to die.\n\nScared men and predators\n\nAt the Pentagon, former Fox News host Hegseth continues to be the living embodiment of the toxic masculinity that he represented on the right-wing network. The only problem is that it’s manifested in the mismanagement of the most powerful military in recorded history.\n\nWith Trump’s blessing, Hegseth pounds the table on so-called “warrior” ethos while gossiping on group chats about missile strikes and making a mess of international diplomacy.\n\nSimultaneously, the Trump administration has continued its outreach to the toxic right-wing manosphere by reportedly advocating for the release of influencer Andrew Tate, a misogynist who has been accused of rape in multiple countries. In other words, he’s the perfect hero for the Trump administration.\n\nNever stop pushing conspiracies\n\nTrump is a conspiracy theorist. For decades, he’s offered up half-baked, debunked theories on a litany of topics—like when he said that climate change was a Chinese “hoax”. Even though he and the GOP are in charge, the Trump team still insists that the “deep state” is out to get them.\n\nThe conspiracies are even worse this time around because they’re being fueled by Musk. He and Trump bandied about the notion that gold at Fort Knox had been stolen, even though Trump’s last Treasury secretary did a weird photo shoot there just a few years ago.\n\nThere is no such thing as “white genocide,” but Trump spent days harping on it, throwing a rhetorical bone to white supremacists who have pushed the conspiracy.\n\nThey love abusing and bombing people\n\nConservatism has a long-standing love affair with abusive behavior. The line goes back to figures like President George W. Bush, who promoted torture as U.S. policy with the euphemism “enhanced interrogation” at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\nNow Trump has brought it back to the forefront by abducting and detaining immigrants, crowing about detention camps, and having his subordinates like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stage photo shoots in front of packed jail cells.\n\nThe Republican tradition of gleefully bombing people has resurfaced with Trump’s decision to inject the nation into the conflict between Iran and Israel. Like Bush, Trump is now complaining about the media accurately covering his questionable declarations of success in his bombings.\n\nKilling the economy\n\nTrump inherited an economy from Biden that was on the mend, following years of Trump’s mismanagement during COVID-19. Instead of just taking credit for it, like he did with Obama’s economic recovery in 2017, Trump has gone on the attack.\n\nHe unilaterally imposed tariffs that have already contributed to a fiscal slowdown and sticker shock. Businesses have had their hiring impacted while countries around the world are anticipating the shockwaves of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe last few Republican presidents—Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bush, and Trump—have all presided over economic pullbacks that were cleaned up by Democratic presidents. \n\nTrump and his team, who spent years complaining about prices under Biden, have now said that cost increases are good for the economy, lest they offend Trump.\n\nWar on immigrants\n\nTrump hates immigrants. He launched his initial bid for the presidency based on bald-faced lies about Mexican immigrants being rapists and has pursued a policy of cruelty ever since. In his first term, he separated immigrant families. Now, he’s abducting immigrants and even forcing military occupation on American cities.\n\nThe desire to demonize immigrants or people sympathetic to immigration—a tradition that has been forever intertwined with U.S. history—is evident in all of Trump’s actions. \n\nBut now that the public has seen that Trump and the GOP overstated the threat of “immigrant criminals,” he’s losing ground on what past polls found were his strongest issues.\n\nThe United States is in a bad place, but that didn’t happen overnight. The right plotted and planned for the Trump-powered onslaught, even though he pretended that he was not connected to initiatives like Project 2025.\n\nIf the country recovers, it will take a very long time. Trump has an entire system behind him, from the Republican Party to propaganda machines like X and Fox News.\n\nThey can be defeated, but the fight will have to be sustained.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been a tumultuous 6 months with Donald Trump inhabiting the presidency, with a weakened federal government now incapable of addressing monumental problems like climate change, pandemics, education, basic security and safety, and even forecasting the weather.\n\n\n\nAs the United States reaches its 249th year of existence, it’s in a very precarious position.

Kennedy Jr., who posted another photo from the White House balcony showing the first couple a few feet away, as per a report by The NY Post.Others objected to her holiday statement's menacing tone.Another X user teasingly said, “Whose elbow is that at the right[?]” A third netizen advised her to \"just enjoy the day,\" while another added, \"Among other reasons, this is why you're not President.\"ALSO READ: Trump underwater in every key swing state, and now he’s slipping in Texas too A fourth remarked, using the vice president's favorite motto, \"America is unburdened by what has been.\"“Feeling grateful we didn’t end up with a President who posts ‘things are gonna get worse’ on the 4th of July,” Kiersten Pels, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, added.According to Mark Simone, presenter of 710 WOR radio, Kamala has established a new record for the worst Fourth of July message ever.Others, however, felt that her use of the word \"fight\" hinted to her future political aspirations.Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project and a Trump supporter, made fun of Kamala by saying, \"Don't stop fighting.\" “And please run again in 2028.”“Don’t stop fighting, Kamala,” mocked Article III Project founder and Trump ally Mike Davis.

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.\n\nAfter the sentence about abolishing and replacing the government, O’Donnell delivers a brief commentary.\n\n“Come on, America,” she pleads. “Keep going.”\n\n“Happy Fourth of July. This is a sad day in American history,” she concludes, clearly referring to President Trump’s signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on the White House lawn.

But a new poll reveals what voters believe ultimately cost her the election.\n\nAn exclusive survey conducted by J.L. Partners for DailyMail.com asked over 1,000 voters to describe, in a few words, why they think Harris lost to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe poll, carried out between November 29 and December 1, found the economy dominated responses across the board - citing inflation, rising prices, and financial anxiety as top reasons for Trump's win.\n\nBut among Harris's own supporters, one word came up more than any other: woman.\n\nMany blamed her defeat on sexism, claiming the country still isn't ready to elect a female president, a sentiment that mirrors Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss. \n\nSome Harris voters also pointed to racism, Trump's 'lies,' and even blamed the American electorate itself, calling voters 'stupid'.\n\nOthers noted the challenge Harris faced with limited time. After Biden bowed out of the race in July, Harris had just 107 days to mount a national campaign.\n\nBiden's name also appeared frequently in the responses, suggesting lingering frustrations with the outgoing president weighed on Harris's chances.\n\nWhen it came to Trump voters, their answers were more varied. Some pointed to his experience, policies, and strength on the economy. \n\nWords like 'tired,' 'inflation,' and 'woman' appeared - but far less frequently than among Harris supporters.\n\nMore cutting responses included 'incompetent' and 'idiot,' as some Trump backers took direct aim at Harris's leadership ability and qualifications.","summary":"Kamala Harris was criticized over the somber tone of her post, as well as its thinly veiled dig at former running mate Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14878339/kamala-harris-slammed-fourth-july-post-brutal-swipe-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/19/100039113-0-image-a-29_1751739952537.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 19:04:47","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":338630928,"title":"RFK Jr. Cleans House: New Team to Reevaluate COVID-19 Vaccines, Conflict-of-Interest Rules","text":"Following the dismissal of 17 members from a federal vaccine advisory committee in early June, big changes are on the horizon at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with a federal health policy expert about the impact of those changes. Robert Moffit, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Health and Welfare Policy, discussed the removal of members from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and President Donald Trump’s health policy agenda.\n\nMoffit, editor of the book “Modernizing Medicare,” expects a reevaluation of COVID-19 vaccines, an increase in vaccine testing, and a thorough examination of the conflict-of-interest rules regarding vaccine and medical device approval.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nPhilip Roberts: What is the purpose of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices?\n\nRobert Moffit: To make recommendations for the vaccine schedule for CDC, and for them in turn to make recommendations to states and local public health officials about what vaccines are appropriate and what vaccines are not. That’s what CDC is supposed to do.\n\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did exactly the right thing by firing all the Biden appointees. After all, they represented the policy agenda of the previous administration and, in several instances, they were politically engaged as financial supporters of the Democratic Party. It is profoundly naïve to believe that Biden’s appointees were merely disinterested scientists with no financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the candidate of the Biden-Harris administration, was defeated at the polls. Elections have consequences, and Americans voted for change. It is critically important for the new president and his team to have their own people in place. In the case of the Biden administration, his appointees presided over vaccine policies that were profoundly flawed, especially the illegal and unprecedented COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nKennedy has taken the right course of action by getting rid of the previous administration appointees and putting in his own.\n\nRoberts: Can you explain what happened with the removal of ACIP members?\n\nMoffit: Again, the Biden administration’s policies were repudiated at the polls. In a democratic society, the government is expected to represent the will of the people. It is democratic imperative that the newly elected president, and his appointees, such as Secretary Kennedy, can carry the policy changes that they promised the American people.\n\nSo, Kennedy has put in a new team to pursue a new set of policies, specifically with regard to the COVID-19 vaccine schedule.\n\nFollowing the unhappy experience of the pandemic, the COVID-19 vaccine policies became the central issue. We have had accumulating data on adverse events from these COVID vaccines, especially serious heart inflammation among young men. There must be a more comprehensive evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the COVID vaccines, and that is what Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Marty Makary, the new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promised.\n\nRoberts: Was this removal expected?\n\nMoffit: It should have been. When you change administrations, you’re changing personnel.\n\nAnd as the great Ed Feulner, the former president of The Heritage Foundation, has said, “Personnel is policy.”\n\nIn recommending a vaccine, there must, of course, be rigorous scientific analysis before any recommendation, focused not only on its safety and effectiveness, but also its medical necessity or appropriateness for different cohorts of the population. Moreover, when it comes to the best course of action on behalf of a large and diverse public, there are policy questions. So, yes, a change in policy requires a change in personnel.\n\nAnd speaking of political implications, it is curious that the Biden administration appointed a disproportionate number of the ACIP in 2024, the last year of the Biden administration. As Kennedy pointed out, if he did not act, he would have been prevented from appointing a majority of the members of this advisory committee until 2028.\n\nNo doubt, the Biden team had every intention of locking in their previous agenda, regardless of the outcome of the 2024 election. The appointment of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was never somehow “above” politics.\n\nThe Biden administration’s appointment agenda in 2024, an attempted stacking of the committee, was obviously and narrowly political.\n\nRoberts: How will the removal of these members affect public health recommendations and policies?\n\nMoffit: I think we’re going to see a fresh approach to the COVID vaccine. Beyond that, I’m not so sure.\n\nI don’t think we’re going to see some kind of revolutionary change that would shred the current vaccine schedule. I do think, however, we’re going to see more and more in-depth, random, controlled trials of vaccines and reevaluations of vaccines.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making sure that your previous determinations are correct or checking your assumptions. That is always a good thing.\n\nThere is nothing wrong, in other words, with collecting more and more detailed data based on the most rigorous scientific evaluations.\n\nSecretary Kennedy, when he testified before the Senate at his confirmation, had promised that he was going to rely upon the highest quality of scientific investigation. There’s nothing that I’ve seen so far that indicates he’s deviating from that.\n\nThe big question is, “What should we do with COVID vaccines?” What we’ve seen so far, I think, is a perfectly rational approach based on what we know today.\n\nThere are radical disparities between healthy young people and older Americans, especially those with underlying health conditions, in terms of their vulnerability to the coronavirus virus and their reaction to the vaccines. The radical disparities in the risks of the coronavirus and the benefits of the COVID vaccines must be taken into account. That’s simply common sense.\n\nTo illustrate: Between 2020 and roughly April 2025, there were over 2.2 million Americans whose deaths were attributable by the CDC to the COVID pandemic. Out of that large number, for example, persons aged 18 to 29 suffered 639 deaths, or 0.05% of the total.\n\nAmong those aged 12 to 17, there were just 394 deaths, or 0.03% of all COVID-19 deaths registered by the CDC. The data also showed that mortality among children was heavily concentrated among those who were immunocompromised or otherwise unhealthy.\n\nIn short, among young healthy children, the threat of the coronavirus was very, very low.\n\nA lot of young people would get the virus and didn’t even know they had it, because the virus was often asymptomatic. Maybe they have some sniffles for a short while, perhaps a sore throat, but their recovery was quick and the infection was otherwise uneventful.\n\nAt the age of 65, the data shows that there is a dramatic difference in risk. When you’re looking at people at the age of 65 and older—especially if they have an underlying condition and most people at that age do—the COVID vaccines are not only appropriate, but they are an extremely good idea.\n\nThe risk-benefit calculation is very different for older Americans, and the danger of severe illness, hospitalization and death among the older population is much greater. That’s what the raw data tells us.\n\nRoberts: Why are the new ACIP members significant?\n\nMoffit: My understanding is that they are all people with reputable scientific backgrounds. Not surprisingly, a couple of them are very, very highly critical of the COVID vaccine or its administration in the general population.\n\nThe one that comes to mind is Dr. Robert Malone, who was partially, at least, responsible for the development of the mRNA technology, which is the novel feature of the COVID vaccines.\n\nI don’t expect that we’re going to have any kind of dramatic surprises. I don’t think, in other words, the committee is going to turn into some sort of irresponsible anti-vaccine caucus.\n\nThey’re going to base their recommendations on “evidence-based” medicine and perhaps impose tougher standards for recommendations than previous Committee members did in the past. And that would also be a very good thing also.\n\nWhat will be interesting to see is how the FDA—which gives approval as a regulatory body to these vaccines—works with the new ACIP. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine recently, Dr. Makary of the FDA has already indicated that his team wants to see more random, controlled trials for safety and effectiveness for COVID vaccine boosters for people under the age of 64.\n\nWe shouldn’t stick with the status quo view virtually everybody should be provided the COVID vaccine, and it would be wise to focus its administration on the over-65 population.\n\nThis would also bring our public health vaccine recommendations more in line with our friends and allies in Europe.\n\nThere’s another issue, though, that the new ACIP will likely address. We have so many vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule. It’s a huge number: about 25 injections for children before they reach 2 years of age. Are they all medically necessary and appropriate? I hope the new committee members address that number, as well as reexamine the appropriate spacing of vaccine administration to safeguard children’s health.\n\nKennedy raised another issue that must also be more extensively explored—this whole problem of financial conflicts-of-interest between people who are participating in the approval of medical devices, vaccines and medications, and their financial interest in those approvals.\n\nThis is an old problem, and it relates both to the FDA as well as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nBack in June 2000, the Committee on Government Reform issued a staff report on the CDC advisory committees.\n\nAccording to one key committee finding: “The CDC routinely grants waivers from conflict-of-interest rules to every member of its advisory committee. … Members of the CDC’s advisory committee often fill out incomplete financial disclosure statements and are not required to provide the missing information by CDC ethics officials.”\n\nSecretary Kennedy is absolutely correct to launch a very intense review of the current conflict-of-interest rules governing the approval of vaccines and other medical devices. \n\nIn protecting the public from conflicts-of-interest in a profoundly sensitive area of their personal health and well-being, he’s pursuing the right policy.","summary":"Following the dismissal of 17 members from a federal vaccine advisory committee in early June, big changes are on the horizon at the Centers for...

We haven’t been researched, we haven’t been considered. And it still affects the way a lot of male lawmakers, a lot of male politicians, a lot of male religious leaders think about the issue of choice as if it’s just about the fetus, the baby. \n\nBut women’s reproductive health is about our life. It’s about this whole complicated reproductive system that the least of what it does is produce life. It’s a very important thing that it does, but you only produce life if the machine that’s producing it — if you want to whittle us down to a machine — is functioning in a healthy, streamlined kind of way.\n\nBut there is no discussion or apparent connection between the two.\n\nMichelle Obama says the ability to create life is the least significant function of a woman’s reproductive system.\nShe claims men can’t truly understand what women endure because female biology has barely been studied.\n“The least of what it does is produce life.” pic.twitter.com/eCpQ5Fn3aP\n— Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) June 29, 2025\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nObama’s remarks didn’t go over well with a lot of people, as she seemed to be downplaying the importance of motherhood and the miraculous gift of fertility.\n\nPresenting abortion as a mere “choice” reveals that Obama knows she isn’t referring to some sort of “emergency” situation where a woman’s life is in danger but to an elective procedure. In fact, she sees killing a child as a valid decision for a woman to make, even though that woman’s reproductive system — the “machine” — was working the way a healthy human reproductive system is expected to work.\n\nThe “connection” Obama is missing is the result of treating women’s fertility as if it’s a disease to be eradicated instead of something to be valued. This has led to a famine of real treatments for women who are experiencing infertility.\n\nObama’s remarks did seem to disparage actual reproduction as the “least” valuable function of the female reproductive system (which makes little sense, given that it’s called the “reproductive system”), but some media pointed out that Obama was also broadly addressing the fact that “women’s health” has been reduced to the mere issue of abortion, while real women’s healthcare is much more broad. And if this is what Michelle Obama meant to say, even pro-lifers might agree with her on that point.\n\nMany pro-life women are weary of seeing “women’s health” continually used as a euphemism for “the ‘right’ to abort a child.”\n\nTake the time to read the comments on Instagram or Facebook posts regarding topics like birth control, ectopic pregnancies, or perimenopause… and what you find is a collective of women commiserating about how they have felt unheard, dismissed, and abandoned by the medical community — their symptoms brushed off as “anxiety” (here’s a prescription for that) or “depression” (and another prescription for that) or simply “too much stress” (here are some less-than-workable suggestions regarding stress reduction).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and frustrating to read the numerous stories of women who are truly suffering because their concerns have been diminished (by a largely male cohort of physicians) for decades.\n\nObama’s guest, Dr. Sharon Malone, pointed out that it was not until 1993 that it was mandated that women be included in clinical trials. “Most of what we know about medications, most of what we know about medical devices… the research has been done on men and extrapolated to women,” Malone said. “Because the thought was, women are complicated. They’ve got all these hormone things going on; that’ll mess up our research… So 1993 was the first time women were included.”\n\nShe also stated that in the grand scheme of things, a very small percentage of funding is put toward research that is focused on women and their health.\n\nUnfortunately, when asked “what keeps [her] up at night” regarding women’s health, Malone’s first mention was abortion, and she perpetuated the , widespread media narratives that pro-life laws are 1) causing harm to women who are miscarrying or having pregnancy issues, and 2) keeping OBGYNs from practicing in pro-life states.\n\nCommentary:\n\nObama and Malone could do women everywhere a favor by changing their thinking:\n\nStop acting as if deliberate killing is healthcare.\nStop acting as if women can’t receive real healthcare in emergencies unless they allow their babies to be dismembered inside them.\nDemand more from doctors so they learn how to practice healing instead of harming.\nDemand that doctors practice medicine as if the lives of both mother and child matter.\n\nHere are some ideas for how to get women’s health to be taken seriously:\n\nIf women’s health is to be taken seriously, it should never involve the direct and intentional killing of a woman’s offspring in the womb. Expecting to remain unscathed in all ways — physically, mentally, spiritually — after killing one’s own child is entirely unrealistic. We are connected to our children, born or preborn.\nIf women’s health is to be taken seriously, we must respect women’s ability to carry and bear children instead of treating it as a burden or a curse.\nIf women’s health is to be taken seriously, we must not simply “use” women’s bodies as surrogates, acting as if they really are little more than “machines,” to borrow from Obama’s terminology — when in reality, we are far more than biological machines who form very real bonds that are rarely severed without consequence.\nIf women’s health is to be taken seriously, we must look for ways to heal the root causes of infertility, endometriosis, and other issues — instead of using hormonal contraceptives or IVF as if they are “cures” for complex issues. They are not.\nIf women’s health is to be taken seriously, it must encompass lifetime care. We spend about 35-40 years of our lives in the “reproductive” zone and the rest of our lives outside it.\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by Live Action News.]","summary":"'So many men have no idea about what women go through, right?

Partners poll. \n\nIt is the same figure recorded on June 6 - before Israel launched its initial strikes - and again on June 18, just days before the U.S. entered the conflict. His disapproval rating also held steady at 53 percent.\n\nHowever, roughly a third of voters said their opinion of Trump had soured in recent weeks, with many citing fears of a broader conflict with Iran, concerns over his 'dictatorial behavior' for bypassing Congress, or frustration over what they saw as ego-driven decisions.\n\nAnother 30 percent said their view of the president had improved - crediting him for showing strength, keeping his promises, and taking swift action to defend U.S. interests abroad.\n\nThe poll, conducted June 24–25 among 1,025 registered voters, came just after Trump helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following a barrage of intercepted Iranian missiles. It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate shock poll shows most voters are turning against Trump’s so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill' - his massive tax-and-spending package that now heads to his desk after clearing both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe sprawling Republican-led bill promises $1,000 ‘Trump Accounts’ for newborns, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, injects billions into the border wall, and bans states from regulating AI for the next decade. It also imposes new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nWhile Trump and GOP leaders have hailed it as 'the largest tax cut in history,' most voters remain unconvinced.\n\nJust 28 percent support the bill, while 36 percent oppose it, according to a new Daily Mail/J.L. Partners poll - giving it a negative net rating of -8. Support plummets outside of Trump’s base: Republicans back it by +36, but independents oppose it by -14 and Democrats by a staggering -41.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt by 2034 while slashing taxes by $3.75 trillion.\n\nEven some Republicans are uneasy. Sen. Ron Johnson threatened to block it over deficit fears, while Sen. Josh Hawley objected to Medicaid cuts.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll also found that 47 percent of Americans believe the bill will hurt the middle class - further signaling trouble for Trump’s economic agenda ahead of November.","summary":"President Trump is facing growing backlash from a surprising demographic, with a new poll showing his approval has plunged to one of its lowest points yet.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14878095/trump-approval-rating-savaged-key-group-poll.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/17/99204931-0-Trump_has_told_lawmakers_that_he_wants_the_Senate_to_pass_the_bi-a-11_1751731303827.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 16:56:29","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":338794070,"title":"Joe Biden’s Energy Dept. dumped $42 billion in taxpayer cash in final hours","text":"In its last two working days, the Biden administration’s Energy Department signed off on nearly $42 billion for green energy projects – a sum that exceeded the total amount its Loan Programs Office (LPO) had put out in the past decade.\n\nThe frenzied activity on Jan. 16 and 17, 2025, capped a spending binge that saw the LPO approve at least $93 billion in current and future disbursements after Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election in November, according to documents provided by the department to RealClearInvestigations. It appears that Biden officials were rushing to deploy billions in approved funding in anticipation that the incoming Trump administration would seek to redirect uncommitted money away from clean energy projects.\n\nThe agreements were made despite a warning from the department’s inspector general, urging the loan office to suspend operations in December over concerns that post-election loans could present conflicts of interest.\n\nIn just a few months, some of the deals have already become dicey, leading to fears that the Biden administration has created multiple Solyndras, the green energy company that went bankrupt after the Obama administration gave it $570 million. These deals include:\n\nSunnova, a rooftop solar outfit that thus far had $382 million of its $3.3 billion loan guaranteed, filed for bankruptcy this month. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\nLi-Cycle, a battery recycling facility, had a $445 million loan approved in November, but since then, the company was put up for sale and has filed for bankruptcy. The Energy Department said no money has been disbursed on that deal. Li-Cycle did not respond to a request for comment.\nA $705 million loan was approved on Jan. 17 for Zum Energy, an electric school bus company in California, and its “Project Marigold.” At $350,000 and more, electric school buses currently cost more than twice as much as their diesel counterparts. So far, Zum has received $21.7 million from the government, according to usaspending.gov. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\nA $9.63 billion Blue Oval SK loan on Jan. 16 was the second largest post-election deal, topped only by a $15 billion loan the next day to Pacific Gas & Electric, with most of that for renewables. The Blue Oval project in Kentucky – a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and a South Korean entity – has been dealing with numerous workplace complaints, and construction of a second EV battery manufacturing plant there has been delayed. More than $7 billion has been obligated on that deal, according to the Energy Department. Blue Oval did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe money and the hasty way in which it was earmarked have drawn the attention of the Trump administration. “It is extremely concerning how many dozens of billions of dollars were rushed out the door without proper due diligence in the final days of the Biden administration,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement to RCI. “DOE is undertaking a thorough review of financial assistance that identifies waste of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe enormous sums came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which injected $400 billion into the LPO, a previously sleepy Energy Department branch originally intended to spur nuclear energy projects. That total represented more than 10 times the amount the LPO had ever committed in any fiscal year of its existence. Prior to the post-election blowout, the office’s biggest fiscal year was 2024, when it committed $34.8 billion, records show.\n\nEven with the rush to push billions out the door in its last months, close to $300 billion of the Inflation Reduction Act money remains uncommitted by the LPO. Trump administration officials have already nixed some smaller deals. Secretary Wright recently urged Congress to keep the money in place as the LPO now aims to use it to further the Trump administration’s energy policy, particularly with nuclear projects.\n\nThat unprecedented gusher of cash from the LPO echoes the efforts of the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency to push $20 billion out the door before it left office. As RCI has previously reported, the EPA – which had never been a consequential grant-making operation – was tasked with awarding $27 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funding through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar For All programs. It did so in less than six months in 2024, including an unorthodox arrangement in which Biden officials parked some $20 billion outside the Treasury’s control. That money was earmarked for a handful of nonprofits, some of which had skimpy assets and were linked with politically connected directors.\n\nThe LPO’s post-election bonanza was put together in even less time. The Energy Department deals, however, involve mostly for-profit enterprises, which raises questions about whether the Biden administration was propping up companies that would not have survived in the private marketplace. Should any of the companies hit it big in the future, shareholders could get rich, while taxpayers will receive only the interest on the loan.\n\n“The loan office should not be in the virtual venture business,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics. “But in a few cases, it could make sense to serve as a catalyst or backstop for viable and important projects from a national security or policy perspective.”\n\nRCI spoke with several Trump administration officials who declined to comment on the record, given the extensive ongoing review of both the LPO’s post-election arrangements and other Energy Department projects linked to Biden’s climate agenda.\n\n“They wanted to get the billions to companies that probably wouldn’t exist unless they could get money from the government,” one current official said. “The business plans, such as they were, were ‘how do we secure capital from the government?’”\n\nDuring Biden’s tenure, the office was run by Jigar Shah, who on June 17 was named to the board of directors of the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy. Bloomberg News reported last month that Shah “helped select roughly 400 companies with development plans to receive grants and loans upwards of $100 million each.” In response to the Trump administration’s pushback on green subsidies, Bloomberg reported that Shah is working to help some of the companies he bankrolled shift operations to Europe.\n\nThe Center relies chiefly on government contracts instead of donations, and it saw that revenue jump from $274.1 million in 2023 to more than $500 million in 2024, according to tax records. The center did not respond to a request to speak with Shah.\n\nThus far, no entity has received the entire amount of the deals the Biden administration struck since last November, according to the Energy Department and usaspending.gov. In a handful of cases, companies have come to the current administration and opted out of the deals.\n\nStill, millions of taxpayer dollars have already been distributed, in some instances, to deals the department listed as “conditional commitments.” Wright has said there are “reasons to be worried and suspicious” about the post-election binge, and vowed some of the deals will be scrubbed.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration made subtle changes to the LPO’s regulations, cutting strings and stipulations that traditionally attach to loans. Consequently, the office cut deals after the election on terms more favorable to the recipient than the taxpayer, and in several cases, making a “conditional commitment” the same as a loan, according to Trump officials. The changes also moved money that a later administration could have cut into “obligated” silos, making the deals harder to cancel, according to the current Energy Department.\n\n“Essentially, they had the Loan Program Office operating like a graveyard energy venture capital fund,” one Trump official told RCI. “This was all tied to the religious fervor for any green energy project in the prior administration, and the goal was not to get the government repaid but to advance the ‘green new deal.’”\n\nThe $93 billion under review represents a separate “green bank” from smaller Biden administration deals that the Energy Department has already canceled. Last month, the Government Accounting Office said the department was not on track to “issue loans and guarantees before billions of dollars of new funding expires.”\n\nAs part of the review, Wright issued policy guidelines in May that he said offer more protection to taxpayers. The department may now require significantly more information from loan recipients and applicants, such as “a project’s financial health, a project’s technological and engineering viability, market conditions, compliance with award terms and conditions and compliance with legal requirements, including those related to national security.”\n\nThe department declined to provide the terms of specific deals, again citing the ongoing review. Trump administration officials claim the business plans for many of these deals were threadbare, that term sheets were essentially tossed out, and the entire process could be described, in the words of a Biden EPA official in December, as “throwing gold bars” off the Titanic “as an insurance policy against Trump winning.”\n\nDespite these dubious outcomes and the alleged removal of taxpayer protections that accompanied the deals, Trump administration officials said they remain committed to the LPO. The office has a valuable role to play in fulfilling energy policy goals, which include nuclear projects, strengthening the nation’s power grid, and limiting the U.S. reliance on Chinese supply chains for key minerals and elements.\n\n“It’s as if you went away and the kids threw a rager in the house,” one official told RCI. “You may need some new furniture and the like, but it’s still a really nice home. The Office can be a critical resource for the manufacturing base of this country, and our goal is not to end the LPO but to improve it.”\n\nThe Trump administration could face some of the same financial issues if it rejiggers the LPO along lines that support its energy policy goals, particularly within the nuclear industry. Projects there have been marred by unprofitable plants and massive cost overruns and delays in construction, making federal loans to the section inherently risky.\n\nProminent voices – and investors – like Bill Gates have also encouraged the government to back new sources of energy and minerals. Geothermal projects are one such field, and there appears to be bipartisan support in Washington for capital that will shore up U.S. energy independence. On Jan. 15, the Biden administration approved a $1.2 billion “conditional commitment” with a subsidiary of EnergySource Minerals LLC (ESM), which hopes to extract lithium from geothermal brine.\n\nA deal with Pioneer Ltd. appears to match some of the professed goals of the Trump administration, but it has also been plagued by financial setbacks since Biden’s LPO approved it in its final days. The company’s deal grew from an original $700 million “conditional commitment” in 2023, to the $996 million approved on Jan. 17, 2025.”\n\nThe Rhyolite Ridge project is a mining and manufacturing center in Nevada to produce lithium and boron. Those elements have implications for defense and national security in addition to energy, according to ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich.\n\n“Ioneer believes government policy should encourage projects if we want critical minerals developed domestically,” Yeftich said. “Time is the key risk for development as China continues to provide financial support to its critical minerals industry and dump critical minerals into the market thereby depressing the price.”\n\nYeftich noted Rhyolite Ridge has secured $200 million in private capital, but in February, its chief private equity partner broke ties with the project. Finance professionals familiar with big deals told RCI that such a rupture so close in timing to the loan would likely deep-six the arrangement, but Trump officials said Biden’s LPO stripped such boilerplate language from many of the post-election deals.\n\nSecretary Wright told RCI that these maneuvers suggested the previous administration was more interested in disbursing funds than protecting taxpayers. “Any reputable business would have a process in place for evaluating spending and investments before money goes out the door, and the American people deserve no less from their federal government.”\n\nCorrection: This article erroneously reported the amount of money Rhyolite Ridge has secured from private capital, and the timeline of its federal loan. The former figure is $200 million, and the timeline was across two years.","summary":"'It appears that officials were rushing to deploy billions in approved funding in anticipation that the incoming Trump administration would seek to redirect uncommitted money away from clean energy projects'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/joe-bidens-energy-dept-dumped-42-billion-taxpayer/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/money-cash-inflation-Unsplash-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 16:52:53","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.467},{"id":338721730,"title":"Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour Crashes 4th of July in Washington, D.C.: 7 Best Moments","text":"Skip to main content\n\nBeyoncé wears a cowboy hat, a burgundy faux fur fluff coat on one shoulder and a blue denim shirt during the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2026 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 24, 2025 in Paris, France.\n\nEdward Berthelot/Getty Images\n\nBetween a surprise appearance from Jay-Z in Paris, Blue Ivy’s routinely show-stealing “Déjà Vu” dance breaks, and an impromptu mid-air “tippin’ on 44s” moment in Houston, Beyoncé‘s record-smashing Cowboy Carter Tour has been filled with viral moments. Nonetheless, Queen Bey pulled out all the stops for her July 4 show at Maryland’s Northwest Stadium, just outside of Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.\n\nBeyoncé’s Flying Car Has ‘Technical Mishap,’ Tilting Mid-Air at Cowboy Carter Stop…\n\nIn its Grammy-winning exploration and illumination of the oft-obfuscated Black roots of American country music (and early rock ‘n’ roll), Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter LP found the music icon squaring her personal catharsis (the album was largely made in response to her negative experience at the 2016 CMA Awards) with a look at how the recording industry mirrors the exploitation and discardment of Black minds and lives in America at large.\n\nOn Independence Day, Beyoncé entered the stage with her rousing Cowboy Carter opener, “Ameriican Requiem”; introduced by backup dancers doused in blue, the 35-time Grammy-winner’s vocals reverberated across the stadium. The song, something of a funeral march for an antiquated version of America, set a resiliently optimistic tone for the rest of the night. Between performing the entire Cowboy Carter LP, weaving in classic hits from across her nearly 30-year-strong catalog and incorporating recent hits from Black Southern stars like GloRilla (“TGIF”) and BigXthaPlug (“The Biggest”), Beyoncé crafted a sacred space for Black Americans (and those belonging to the country’s most mistreated groups) to host their own emotionally complex acknowledgement of the nation’s birthday.\n\nHere are the seven best moments of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour on July 4 in Washington, D.C.\n\n“My House” 25 Minutes Away From the White House\n\n“My House,” the house-rap track Beyoncé dropped to commemorate Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé hitting theaters, was always destined to be an explosive live performance. From its raucous horns to its frenetic chants, the track was an instant fan favorite for a reason. On July 4, however, there was a certain gravity felt across the stadium when Beyoncé chanted, “Get the f— up out my house!”\n\nAfter all, Northwest Stadium is just a 25-minute drive from the White House, where the sitting president signed a devastating new bill mere hours earlier. In a country that’s getting increasingly explicit about who it feels belongs, “My House” offered the crowd a moment to flip the narrative and find an outlet for their rage.\n\nBeyoncé Opens Show with New American Flag Coat\n\nFashion has long been a key component of Beyoncé’s stage show — especially after the Renaissance World Tour’s silver theme took over the globe in 2023 — and the Cowboy Carter Tour is no different. Throughout her latest stadium trek, she has debuted a plethora of Western-themed outfits, some of which also nod to the aesthetic of Renaissance, the first LP in her still-unfurling album trilogy.\n\nTo open her July 4 show in Washington, D.C., Beyoncé opted for an eye-popping fur coat printed with the design of the American flag over a figure-hugging gray and silver-blue leotard emblazoned with stars. If the coat was a nod to the Cowboy Carter aesthetic, then the leotard nodded to Renaissance — the vibrant Black foundation that America relentlessly attempts to stifle and erase.\n\nQueen Bey Goes Full Hendrix\n\nEver since she kicked off the tour in Los Angeles (April 28), Beyoncé’s otherworldly transition from a vocal interpretation of Jimi Hendrix’s 1969 Woodstock rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” into her own “Freedom” (which soundtracked Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign) has been an interesting point of discussion. While some didn’t understand the choice and others felt it was in poor taste, Beyoncé’s intentions couldn’t have been clearer as she delivered a dirgeful version of America’s anthem on its birthday. Preceded by her own “Ameriican Requiem” and succeeded by her cries of “Freedom, freedom, where are you?”, the opening act of the Cowboy Carter Tour felt especially poignant on July 4.\n\nBeyoncé Spots Her Cousin? Sorry, Her Husband\n\nAbout 15 years ago, Anthony Cosby (hyphen Knowles!) became a BeyHive legend ever since he hilariously proclaimed to be both Beyoncé’s cousin and husband during her I Am.. World Tour. Cosby has popped up at Bey’s tour ever since, including the July 4 Cowboy Carter show, where Beyoncé shouted him out, saying, “C’mon Anthony! I see you, cousin… husband!”\n\nAlready a Grammy winner and box office-topping voice actress in her own right, Blue Ivy Carter needs no introduction. Her Cowboy Carter Tour solos have quickly become the show’s most buzzed-about moments, and not much changed in Maryland on July 4. As Honey Balenciaga closed out her part of the rodeo-ballroom section, tens of thousands of phones rose en masse as Blue Ivy emerged from the stage lift, hitting a nasty slow motion turn into her catwalk and “Déjà Vu” dance break — all while donning a new custom costume, of course!\n\nBeyoncé Lincoln Enters the Building\n\nThe “Attack of the 400 Foot Cowboy” interlude is one of the better breaks in Beyoncé’s three-hour Cowboy Carter set, thanks to both her globe-trotting, slapstick humor and BigXthaPlug’s wavy “The Biggest.” In the interlude, a 400-foot-tall version of Beyoncé struts around the world and treats various world landmarks — from the Statue of Liberty to the Eiffel Tower — as playthings. Of course, when the Lincoln Memorial winked at her in response to her hat tip, the crowd went absolutely nuts.\n\nNotably, Beyoncé’s exclusive T-shirt for her D.C. stop features a picture of her posing in place of Lincoln on the memorial. Looks like we’re one step closer to that Beyoncé-Oh, Mary! crossover.\n\nNew ‘Alliigator Tears’ Outfit Deepens Song’s Message\n\nOne of the more overlooked songs on Cowboy Carter, “Alliigator Tears” remains one of the album’s strongest tracks over a year after its release. The song explores the toll it takes to transform yourself to fit demands you’ll never meet, set by people who’ll never truly see past their own insincerity and manipulation — and Beyoncé drove that message home with her new costume.\n\nDonning a sparkly, red grown with a thigh-high slit laced with blue frings and white stars, Beyoncé, once again, looked to the American flag to inform her outfit. During this section (which also included gorgeous renditions of “Protector,” “Just for Fun” and “Flamenco”), the costume emphasized the way “Alliigator Tears” illustrates the larger dynamic between Black people and the American project. When she sings, “You say changе religion/ Now, I spend Sundays with you/ Somethin’ ’bout those tears of yours/ How does it feel to be adored,” she’s directly calling out the U.S. for its constantly-shifting goalposts. Whether it’s an effective line of questioning is another conversation, but it certainly packed an emotional punch.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

ABC’s (now fired) senior national correspondent Terry Moran insulted presidential advisor Stephen Miller, as he labeled him a “world-class hater” who was the “brains behind Trumpism.” \n\nThis past month also saw former MSNBC host Joy Reid claim that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was rounding up “brown people” to put into his “concentration camp.” \n\nThe likes of Lawrence O’Donnell spun the L.A. protest as calm with the MSNBC host insisting there was no “violent mob” and they were all “peaceful.” \n\nCelebrities went loony as well. ABC’s The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg asserted that being black in America was worse than living in Iran today. Actor Mark Ruffalo vented that “King” Donald Trump was “trampling on our rights.”\n\nThe following are the most obnoxious outbursts from journalists and celebrities from the past month: \n\nAmerica Needs to Be Sanctioned, “We Are the Bad Guys” \n\n“Our country needs to be sanctioned, we are the bad guys on the world stage. We are a menace to not only free people everywhere, but we are a menace to peaceful people everywhere.….We have to be stopped through the same kind of means that we have that our country and others have used to rebuke a North Korea or a China or name a rogue state, we are the rogue state, and other countries need to start treating us like that.”— The Nation justice correspondent Elie Mystal on The Joy Reid Show podcast, June 28.\n\n“World-Class Hater” Stephen Miller is the “Brains Behind Trumpism”\n\n“The thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism. Yes, he is one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates them into policy. But that’s not what’s interesting about Miller. It’s not brains. It’s bile. Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He’s a world-class hater. You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.”— June 8 X.com post by then-ABC senior national correspondent Terry Moran. Moran was later fired by ABC News. \n\nRon DeSantis Is Rounding Up “Brown People” To Put In His “Concentration Camp”\n\n“We tried to forget about him, but Ron DeSantis is still governor of Florida. He took the Comfy Couch hosts on a tour of the concentration camp that he’s building in Florida in order to round up people, brown people, and throw them in a camp because he doesn’t want them in Florida.”— Former MSNBC host Joy Reid on The Joy Reid Show podcast, June 28. \n\nEnd of USAID Could Lead to “14 Million Deaths”\n\n“Secretary of State Marco Rubio is hailing the end of USAID, the nation’s largest foreign aid agency, even as a new analysis finds that its closure could contribute to some 14 million deaths in the next five years.”— Anchor Boris Sanchez on CNN News Central, July 1. \n\nRepublicans Are Afraid That “Being Human” Will Get Them on Wrong Side of Trump\n\n“There’s been silence, crickets, because they’re [Republicans] afraid of doing the right thing, of being human, will get them on the wrong side of the President of the United States. Folks should be very concerned about that.”— Washington Post associate editor/PBS contributor Jonathan Capehart on PBS’ News Hour, June 20. \n\n“No Mandate” For Trump’s “Proto-Fascism”\n\n“You had on the one hand, the military parade that wasn’t, there was no goose stepping, none of that. And then you had 5 million people in demonstrations around the country against what President Trump is doing. What it brought to mind to me was a number that, that Joe Scarborough mentioned earlier, 1.5%. That was the margin between the 77 million votes that Donald Trump got and the 75 million that Kamala Harris got.

Gavin Newsom (12%).\n\nNow, these numbers should be viewed through the context of how difficult it can be for voters to decide who they will support when primaries begin in two and a half years.\n\nHowever, polls are an effective way to take a snapshot of the electorate’s mood at a given time, and the data from Emerson has three overarching takeaways.\n\nFirst, the race to for the 2028 Democratic nomination is wide open. \n\nDespite their deep bench of household names, no Democrat has managed to separate themselves from the pack. \n\nButtigieg’s 3-point lead is well within the survey’s 5-point margin of error, and a plurality (23%) of respondents said they were undecided. \n\nIt is also worth noting that Buttigieg received zero votes from Black voters – the backbone of the Democratic Party – in the Emerson poll.\n\nThe second takeaway is that, with Rep. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7%) tied for 4th place, the poll indicates a desire for fresh faces – which Harris is not. \n\nIt also reflects the rising influence of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, joining the surprise victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s Democratic primary and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ relatively successful presidential campaigns. \n\nThe growing power of this wing opens up avenues for a number of younger Democrats which further muddy the waters and make it hard for any one candidate to cement themselves as the party’s standard bearer before 2028.\n\nFinally, the third main takeaway is what this poll says about Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and their diverging political fortunes. \n\nGiven Harris’ name recognition, experience, and how close she came to winning in 2024, one may have expected her to be leading early polling, which usually reflect name recognition more than anything else.\n\nSimilarly, Newsom’s recent moves to the center on key issues and his hosting of right-wing influencers on his podcast had been considered harmful to his position in a primary. \n\nAnd yet, Newsom is virtually tied with Harris in the Emerson poll, while at the same time, seeing an improvement in his overall numbers here at home. \n\nIn early June, UC Irvine polling showed that less than 4-in-10 (36%) of California voters approved of the job Newsom is doing as governor. \n\nWhen UC Irvine released a follow up poll on July 2nd, it showed Newsom with a 56% favorability rating. While not an exact comparison, it does show that whatever doubts about his job performance, he remains personally favorable.\n\nConversely, for Harris, recent weeks have seen the release of multiple reports detailing her “enthusiasm problem.”\n\nAs one Politico report noted, “many Democratic donors aren’t enthusiastic” about Harris’ potential return to the political arena. \n\nOne major donor told the outlet that, “they fear her reemergence as a candidate would re-open still-fresh wounds from her defeat in 2024.” \n\nAnother pointed out that “Kamala just reminds you we are in this complete shit storm” referring to Harris’ coverup of former President Biden’s cognitive decline while in office. \n\nIn that same vein, Harris’ 2024 campaign was largely run on opposition to Trump, rather than her own platform. She articulated few of her own ideas for the economy, immigration, or foreign policy, so its understandable if voters are still wondering what she stands for or what policies she would pursue.\n\nTaken together, Harris’ worse than expected polling and waning enthusiasm for her to run again for president may actually propel her to seek another office – California Governor. \n\nTo be sure, that possibility has been well-discussed, but Harris’ refusal to either declare or refute her potential candidacy has been speculated to be about keeping her options open for another shot at the White House. \n\nWere Harris to run for governor, its widely assumed that she would have a sizable advantage, with virtually all polls suggesting that she would likely win.\n\nThat being said, the same issues that she has in national polling are showing up in state polling, albeit less clearly.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned UC Irvine poll, in a binary choice for governor between Harris and an unnamed Republican, just 41% of California voters chose Harris, compared to 29% backing the Republican. \n\nThree-in-10 California voters said they were unsure (16%) or would not vote (14%).\n\nIf Harris decides that Sacramento is the better option than seeking the Oval Office, Newsom likely stands to benefit the most of all candidates Emerson tested. \n\nButtigieg is popular, although his national profile is considerably smaller than Newsom’s, as is his fundraising ability, something Newsom has proven himself quite adept at. \n\nAnd while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro – tied with AOC at 7% – is a popular governor of a swing state, his appeal to an increasingly far-left primary base may hurt him, as it did when Harris skipped over nominating him as her running mate last year.\n\nUltimately, between now and 2028, these polls are all but guaranteed to see considerable movement, especially if Harris effectively takes herself out of the race by running for governor. \n\nMoreover, it is entirely possible that someone not included in this poll emerges, much in the same way former President Obama did in 2007-2008.\n\nNonetheless, at this point, the data is telling. Harris is significantly more vulnerable than a former VP should be, while Newsom may be stronger than appeared.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Harris and Newsom diverge as polling shows Democrats race is wide open","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/05/harris-and-newsom-diverge-as-polling-shows-democrats-race-is-wide-open/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sut-z-oe-benefits-3.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 16:33:52","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":338593506,"title":"Kamala Harris Skewered On Social Media Over Somber July 4 Post With Photo That Crops Out Joe Biden","text":"Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers.

His 2024 gains with young voters are slipping fast, signaling a sharp shift in youth political sentiment.\n\nDonald Trump's Approval Rating Crashes With Gen Z Amid Growing Discontent- President Donald Trump is facing a major drop in support from one of the most influential and fastest-growing voter blocs—Generation Z. According to multiple new polls, Trump’s approval rating among young Americans has taken a serious hit in June, marking a steep decline from the inroads he made with them during the 2024 election. In the latest YouGov/Yahoo News poll conducted from June 26 to June 30 with 1,597 adults, Trump’s net approval rating among Gen Z voters fell sharply—from -23 points in May to -41 points in June. His overall approval rating in this group now stands at just 27%, with a margin of error of ±3.2%. Why is Donald Trump losing support among Gen Z voters? Experts believe the drop reflects more than party politics. Lucas Walsh, a political behavior professor at Monash University, explained to Newsweek that Gen Z voters are more focused on specific issues than party loyalty. He said, “These younger voters often care less about red and blue party lines and more about issues, particularly progressive ones, and issues affecting the bottom line of their day-to-day lives.” In the 2024 presidential election, Trump surprised many by narrowing the usual Democratic lead among 18–29-year-olds. According to AP VoteCast, this group supported Kamala Harris over Trump by a slim 51% to 47%, a far smaller gap than in 2020, when Joe Biden beat Trump among Gen Z voters 61% to 36%. What do the latest Trump approval polls show? Recent surveys confirm a broader decline in Trump’s approval among Gen Z. In a Quantus Insights poll conducted between June 30 and July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, only 35% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s job performance, while 58% disapproved. Just a month earlier, Trump held a 46% approval and 51% disapproval rating with this group.Live Events Another study by ActiVote, conducted between June 1 and June 30 with 523 adults, found similar results. In June, just 32% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s performance, while 62% disapproved—a major shift from May, when support and disapproval were nearly even at 47% vs 48%. Is Gen Z losing faith in Trump's economic and inflation policies? The decline isn’t limited to general approval—it runs deep into key issues like the economy and inflation. At the start of June, 33% of Gen Z voters approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, compared to 54% disapproval. By the end of the month, approval had dropped to 32%, and disapproval rose to 60%. On inflation, a top concern for young people, the numbers were even more alarming. Trump’s approval in this area fell from 32% approve / 57% disapprove in early June to just 23% approve / 69% disapprove by month’s end. How has Trump’s immigration stance impacted Gen Z approval? Immigration, another key issue where Trump has maintained a strong public stance, also appears to be costing him Gen Z support. In early June, he had 40% approval and 52% disapproval among younger voters on immigration. By the end of the month, that dropped to 30% approval and 65% disapproval—a 15-point swing. This downward shift reflects increasing discomfort among young voters with Trump’s approach on divisive topics, as many in Gen Z lean more toward inclusive and humanitarian perspectives on immigration policy. Is dissatisfaction with Trump translating into democratic gains? Interestingly, the growing frustration with President Trump does not seem to be benefiting Democrats significantly. The Quantus poll found that 43% of Gen Z voters feel neither party represents American values—a sign that many young Americans feel politically alienated, not just from Trump, but from the entire political system. Meanwhile, the broader mood among Gen Z is shifting toward pessimism. According to YouGov/Yahoo, only 21% of Gen Z voters now believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction, down from 27% in May. Those who feel the country is on the wrong track jumped from 53% to 66% within a month. What does this mean for Trump heading into 2025? President Trump’s sharp drop in support among Gen Z voters could pose a serious challenge for his administration and reelection strategy. Although he gained ground in the 2024 election with younger voters, recent data suggests that those gains are quickly fading. Whether it’s the economy, inflation, immigration, or his post-election policy shifts, young voters appear increasingly disillusioned with Trump’s leadership. As Lucas Walsh pointed out, “Economic hardship and uncertainty typically affect younger people disproportionately during downturns,” making Gen Z especially sensitive to issues like job security, rent, student loans, and affordability—issues where many feel Trump is falling short. For now, Trump’s approval rating among Gen Z is in free fall. Unless major changes occur, this could have long-term implications for both his presidency and the Republican Party’s ability to engage with future generations.FAQs: Q1: Why is Donald Trump’s Gen Z approval rating falling? Because Gen Z is frustrated with his handling of issues like inflation, the economy, and immigration. Q2: Did Donald Trump gain Gen Z support in the 2024 election? Yes, but recent polls show that support is now quickly slipping away.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ondonald trump approval rating 2025donald trump approval ratingtrump gen z support dropgen z disapproves trumptrump youth voter polltrump approval inflation economytrump immigration rating fallgen z political trendstrump 2024 election gen z\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

With Gen Z feeling politically homeless and pessimistic about the country’s direction, this decline could hurt Trump's long-term influence and the GOP's future voter base.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/from-bad-to-worse-trumps-approval-rating-crashes-among-gen-z-after-swing-state-blowback/articleshow/122269390.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-122269436,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-30012,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 15:47:06","author":"Gen Z","authors":["Gen Z"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":338584438,"title":"Jason Kelce slammed for 'tone deaf' Fourth of July post after 'big, beautiful bill' signing","text":"Jason Kelce was just like plenty of Americans on the Fourth of July, taking in some of the best fireworks.

Gavin Newsom (12%).\n\nNow, these numbers should be viewed through the context of how difficult it can be for voters to decide who they will support when primaries begin in two and a half years.\n\nHowever, polls are an effective way to take a snapshot of the electorate’s mood at a given time, and the data from Emerson has three overarching takeaways.\n\nFirst, the race to for the 2028 Democratic nomination is wide open. \n\nDespite their deep bench of household names, no Democrat has managed to separate themselves from the pack. \n\nButtigieg’s 3-point lead is well within the survey’s 5-point margin of error, and a plurality (23%) of respondents said they were undecided. \n\nIt is also worth noting that Buttigieg received zero votes from Black voters – the backbone of the Democratic Party – in the Emerson poll.\n\nThe second takeaway is that, with Rep. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7%) tied for 4th place, the poll indicates a desire for fresh faces – which Harris is not. \n\nIt also reflects the rising influence of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, joining the surprise victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s Democratic primary and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ relatively successful presidential campaigns. \n\nThe growing power of this wing opens up avenues for a number of younger Democrats which further muddy the waters and make it hard for any one candidate to cement themselves as the party’s standard bearer before 2028.\n\nFinally, the third main takeaway is what this poll says about Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and their diverging political fortunes. \n\nGiven Harris’ name recognition, experience, and how close she came to winning in 2024, one may have expected her to be leading early polling, which usually reflect name recognition more than anything else.\n\nSimilarly, Newsom’s recent moves to the center on key issues and his hosting of right-wing influencers on his podcast had been considered harmful to his position in a primary. \n\nAnd yet, Newsom is virtually tied with Harris in the Emerson poll, while at the same time, seeing an improvement in his overall numbers here at home. \n\nIn early June, UC Irvine polling showed that less than 4-in-10 (36%) of California voters approved of the job Newsom is doing as governor. \n\nWhen UC Irvine released a follow up poll on July 2nd, it showed Newsom with a 56% favorability rating. While not an exact comparison, it does show that whatever doubts about his job performance, he remains personally favorable.\n\nConversely, for Harris, recent weeks have seen the release of multiple reports detailing her “enthusiasm problem.”\n\nAs one Politico report noted, “many Democratic donors aren’t enthusiastic” about Harris’ potential return to the political arena. \n\nOne major donor told the outlet that, “they fear her reemergence as a candidate would re-open still-fresh wounds from her defeat in 2024.” \n\nAnother pointed out that “Kamala just reminds you we are in this complete shit storm” referring to Harris’ coverup of former President Biden’s cognitive decline while in office. \n\nIn that same vein, Harris’ 2024 campaign was largely run on opposition to Trump, rather than her own platform. She articulated few of her own ideas for the economy, immigration, or foreign policy, so its understandable if voters are still wondering what she stands for or what policies she would pursue.\n\nTaken together, Harris’ worse than expected polling and waning enthusiasm for her to run again for president may actually propel her to seek another office – California Governor. \n\nTo be sure, that possibility has been well-discussed, but Harris’ refusal to either declare or refute her potential candidacy has been speculated to be about keeping her options open for another shot at the White House. \n\nWere Harris to run for governor, its widely assumed that she would have a sizable advantage, with virtually all polls suggesting that she would likely win.\n\nThat being said, the same issues that she has in national polling are showing up in state polling, albeit less clearly.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned UC Irvine poll, in a binary choice for governor between Harris and an unnamed Republican, just 41% of California voters chose Harris, compared to 29% backing the Republican. \n\nThree-in-10 California voters said they were unsure (16%) or would not vote (14%).\n\nIf Harris decides that Sacramento is the better option than seeking the Oval Office, Newsom likely stands to benefit the most of all candidates Emerson tested. \n\nButtigieg is popular, although his national profile is considerably smaller than Newsom’s, as is his fundraising ability, something Newsom has proven himself quite adept at. \n\nAnd while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro – tied with AOC at 7% – is a popular governor of a swing state, his appeal to an increasingly far-left primary base may hurt him, as it did when Harris skipped over nominating him as her running mate last year.\n\nUltimately, between now and 2028, these polls are all but guaranteed to see considerable movement, especially if Harris effectively takes herself out of the race by running for governor. \n\nMoreover, it is entirely possible that someone not included in this poll emerges, much in the same way former President Obama did in 2007-2008.\n\nNonetheless, at this point, the data is telling. Harris is significantly more vulnerable than a former VP should be, while Newsom may be stronger than appeared.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Harris is significantly more vulnerable than a former VP should be, while Newsom may be stronger than appeared.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/07/05/harris-and-newsom-diverge-as-polling-shows-democrats-race-is-wide-open/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sut-z-oe-benefits-3.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 15:00:04","author":"Douglas Schoen,Gqlshare","authors":["Douglas Schoen","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":338684938,"title":"Kamala Harris Sparks MAGA Meltdown With Fourth of July Post","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris sent MAGA into a frenzy with her simple Fourth of July message.\n\n“I am taking a moment to reflect,” the ex-vice president wrote Friday on X alongside a photo of herself and her husband, Doug Emhoff. “Things are hard right now.

And the reason cuts deep: immigration raids.\n\nRogan, who endorsed Trump just hours before the 2024 presidential election, now says he was misled by the man he helped boost into office. The podcaster and UFC commentator, known for giving a platform to anti-cancel culture figures and free speech advocates, is now accusing Trump of betraying the very values he campaigned on.\n\n“We were told there would be…,” Rogan began during a July 2 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, before trailing off and recalibrating. “There’s two things that are insane. One is the targeting of migrant workers, not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers, just construction workers showing up at construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?”\n\nHis guest, Amjad Masad, the Palestinian founder and CEO of the coding platform Replit, agreed. The two were discussing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants, especially in the context of escalating tensions over Gaza and political speech on U.S. campuses.\n\nMasad brought up recent reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeting Palestinian students and immigrants on flimsy pretenses. “Did you see the video of the Turkish student at Tufts University who wrote an essay?” he asked.\n\nRogan responded, incredulous: “It was just critical of Israel, right? And that’s enough to get you kicked out of the country?”\n\nThe two were referencing growing concern that lawful political speech, especially criticism of Israel, is increasingly being used as grounds for visa cancellations and deportations under Trump’s revived immigration policy.\n\nRogan’s Endorsement and Regret\n\nBack on November 4, 2024, Rogan endorsed Trump on social media, just before the election. It was a powerful signal to his massive base of male followers.\n\n“The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn’t for him we’d be fucked,” Rogan wrote at the time. “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way. For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.”\n\nThe post racked up more than 50 million views. But less than a year later, Rogan seems to be reconsidering.\n\n The great and powerful @elonmusk.If it wasn't for him we'd be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.Enjoy the podcast pic.twitter.com/LdBxZFVsLN — Joe Rogan (@joerogan) November 5, 2024\n\nWhile he made clear he would never vote for Kamala Harris, Rogan now feels duped. The immigration policy he thought would focus on violent criminals has instead become a broader crackdown on immigrant communities, including legal residents, students, and workers.\n\nFrom America First to Raids and Fear\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, but insisted the focus would be on criminals and gang members. His rallies featured mugshots of alleged MS-13 members and claims that his plan would “clean up the streets.”\n\nBut now that he’s back in the White House, reality looks different. According to recent court filings and ICE data, many of the people being arrested or deported have no criminal records at all.\n\nThat discrepancy is what’s pushing Rogan to speak out. He’s built his brand around authenticity and free speech. Trump’s current approach, he suggests, smells more like authoritarianism than policy.\n\n“Fascism is the response almost always to communism,” Rogan said on the same podcast, quoting ANthony Rispo, a student of psychology and neuroscience at Columbia University. “What we experience in this country is this continual overcorrection. Overcorrection to the left, then overcorrection to the right, to counter that.”\n\nIn other words, Rogan is wondering if Trump’s policies are an overcorrection too far, and if they resemble fascism more than freedom.\n\n Thanks @joerogan for shouting me out on @joeroganhq !! pic.twitter.com/gTV7MRgRWq — Anthony Rispo (@anthony_rispo) July 3, 2025\n\nMusk, DOGE, and the Fracture of the Bro Alliance\n\nRogan’s disillusionment mirrors that of Elon Musk, another former Trump ally. Musk, who headed the now-infamous Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has become one of Trump’s fiercest critics since Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a legislation that slashed EV subsidies, immigration protections, and environmental incentives.\n\nMusk is now threatening to start a third political party. And while Trump can afford to ignore the Tesla CEO’s rebellion, he can’t easily brush off Joe Rogan. Why? Because they share the same audience: disaffected men, anti-establishment voters, young libertarians, and people tired of traditional politics.\n\nIf that group is forced to choose between Trump and Rogan, the outcome could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections and future political landscapes.","summary":"The podcast king, once a prominent supporter of Donald Trump, denounced the president’s aggressive deportation tactics on his wildly popular podcast.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogan-feels-trump-betrayed-him-on-immigration-2000624426","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Joe-Rogan-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 13:45:09","author":"Luc Olinga","authors":["Luc Olinga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.177},{"id":338782198,"title":"After Trump-Paramount Settlement, PBS Puts On Stelter to Cry 'Ransom or Even a Bribe'","text":"PBS News Hour\n\n7:38:55 p.m. (ET)\n\nAmna Nawaz: Paramount has agreed to pay Donald Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his former presidential opponent Kamala Harris. \"60 Minutes\" airs on CBS, which Paramount owns.\n\nMr. Trump alleged that the interview, which aired one month before the 2024 election, was selectively edited to improve how then-Vice President Harris sounded. CBS denied that.\n\nToday, the head of CBS, George Cheeks, defended the settlement at Paramount's annual shareholder meeting, saying — quote — \"The settlement offers a negotiated resolution to allow companies to focus on their core objectives, rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.\"\n\nParamount said the funds will go to President Trump's library, not to him personally. CBS did not have to issue an apology as part of the deal.\n\nFor more on this, I'm joined by Brian Stelter. He's the chief media analyst for CNN, and he writes the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter.\n\nBrian, welcome back to the \"News Hour.\"\n\nBrian Stelter, CNN Chief Media Correspondent: Thanks so much.\n\nAmna Nawaz: So, Brian, this is not the first major media company to settle with President Trump. You have been following this, though. Did anything in this settlement or its terms surprise you?\n\nBrian Stelter: Well, CBS did not actually do anything wrong here. CBS engaged in standard television news editing practices, but its parent company paid the price anyway, with some people likening this to a ransom or even a bribe.\n\nThe terms are not surprising because, as you said, Paramount's not the first company to do this. Disney's ABC in some ways wrote the playbook that Paramount is now relying on, because, last December, when Trump was still president-elect, ABC settled with Trump out of court to the tune of $16 million.\n\nSo, here we are again with $16 million heading toward Trump's presidential library. The big difference in this case is that Paramount is trying to get a merger approved by the Trump administration. And that is why the word bribe has come up, with Democratic senators wondering if this was a bribe to try to get the Trump administration to approve the deal.\n\nParamount says no, Trump's FCC says no, but a lot of outside analysts believe that is the case.\n\nAmna Nawaz: Brian, I want to underscore this point you're making, that it is standard journalistic practice to edit interviews for length, for clarity, for a number of editorial reasons. Is it clear that Paramount would have lost this suit if they'd continued to fight?\n\nBrian Stelter: To the contrary, Paramount likely would have prevailed.\n\nBut Trump filed this lawsuit before winning reelection in a court in Texas that in some ways was very favorable to him. I have spoken with numerous legal experts who said that CBS had a very strong First Amendment case, but there were ways this could have gone sideways for CBS, given the jurisdiction of the case and given the uncertainty of going up against a presidential litigant.\n\nI mean, this is a very unusual situation. I know in 2025, this seems normal now, but, up until this year, this is incredibly abnormal to have a sitting president suing a television network, trying to strike a settlement deal, maybe asking for an apology, which CBS refused to provide.\n\nThis is a situation where I think we're all getting accustomed to how transactional this president can be. And now we will see what happens. Will the Trump administration approve Paramount's deal with Skydance? Will there be other terms or conditions attached to that merger approval? That's the great unknown.\n\nAmna Nawaz: Well, as the lawsuit was unfolding, and there were reports about mediation between Paramount head Shari Redstone and Trump's team, there were also accusations from CBS journalists that Paramount leadership was meddling in their coverage of President Trump.\n\nWe saw longtime \"60 Minutes\" producer Bill Owens leave under pressure in April. We saw the head of CBS News, Wendy McMahon, leave in May. What are you hearing from inside CBS News, from inside \"60 Minutes\" about this other news?\n\nBrian Stelter: A mixture of outrage and anger about the settlement, but also a sense of resignation because this was in the works for months. Some people thought the dollar amount would actually be higher than it ultimately was, and also among some staffers today a sense of relief that this chapter is over.\n\nYes, corporate priorities trumped journalistic principles in this case. But for all the criticism of Paramount and boss Shari Redstone, \"60 Minutes\" did broadcast all the stories it wanted to broadcast last spring. You know, the stories were not cut. So what we are seeing is this tug-of-war that's taking place.\n\nThe journalists at CBS wanted their company to fight, to defend them, to go to court if they had to, in order to defend the reputation of CBS. The parent company decided to fold by settling.\n\nAmna Nawaz: So, Brian, what's the bigger impact here?\n\nI mean, I want to put to you part of a statement from Jodie Ginsberg, who's the head of the Committee to Protect Journalists. She said CBS caved to groundless threats here. She also said that this signals that: \"The current administration, as well as any future administrations, can interfere with or influence editorial decisions.\"\n\nYou had ABC News settle. You have now had CBS settle. Is there a larger concern about press freedom here?\n\nBrian Stelter:There is, because the public needs and wants independent impartial journalism.\n\nAnd for the most part, that's what Americans are getting. Despite all of Trump's threats, despite his lawsuits and despite his other attempts to crack down on a free press, the news is getting out. And Americans by and large are still well informed about what's going on with this administration.\n\nBut the reason why legal experts I spoke with today and press freedom advocates today have been using words like authoritarianism is because they're worried about the democratic backsliding that this might represent. If a president can sue a media outlet and tie it up in knots legally in court, if a president can convince a media outlet to pay tens of millions of dollars in settlements in order to avoid a protracted dispute, that is an unsettling path forward for the American news media.\n\nAmna Nawaz: Brian Stelter, chief media analyst for CNN and the man behind the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter, great to speak with you.

The bill’s passage comes on the heels of other significant victories for his administration, including a Supreme Court ruling in his favor and successful strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. \"President Trump has delivered more wins for the American people in two weeks than most Presidents do in four years,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Thursday statement to Fox News Digital. \"This has been the most historic two weeks of any Administration in history. Thanks to President Trump, America is back and is the hottest country in the world!\" The tax and domestic policy bill arrived on his desk after the House passed the final version of the measure Thursday – meeting Trump’s self-imposed Fourth of July deadline to get the measure over the finish line. The bill includes key provisions that would permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay. The measure also raises the debt limit by $5 trillion – a provision that has faced scrutiny from figures such as SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Furthermore, the bill rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, and allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump’s mass deportation initiative to weed out illegal immigrants from the U.S. The measure also institutes Medicaid reforms, including new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for Medicaid recipients, and expands work requirements for those on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Here are some other recent events that have gone in the Trump administration’s favor: US strikes on Iran The U.S. launched strikes June 21 targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities, which involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Following the strikes, Trump said in an address to the nation that the mission left the nuclear sites \"completely and totally obliterated,\" and Caine said that initial battle damage assessments suggested \"all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\" Still, Caine acknowledged that a final assessment would \"take some time.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKES ON NEW BATTLE SHUTTING DOWN INITIAL IRAN STRIKE ASSESSMENTS But days later, a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency, published by CNN and the New York Times, cast doubt on those claims, saying that the strikes had only set back Iran’s nuclear program by several months. However, the Pentagon said Wednesday that internal intelligence assessments indicate the strikes set back Iran’s nuclear program by one or two years. \"We have degraded their program by one to two years, at least intel assessments inside the Department (of Defense) assess that,\" Defense Department spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters Wednesday. Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions The Supreme Court ruled, 6–3, to block the lower courts from issuing universal injunctions on June 27. Multiple executive orders Trump has signed during his second administration have been tied up in the courts as a result of nationwide injunctions, including his ban on birthright citizenship. TRUMP CELEBRATES SUPREME COURT LIMITS ON ‘COLOSSAL ABUSE OF POWER’ BY FEDERAL JUDGES The Supreme Court’s ruling means that lower courts are only permitted to issue broad injunctions in limited cases, which Trump said would prevent a \"colossal abuse of power.\" \"I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we've seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers,\" Trump said on June 27. Paramount Global agrees to settlement CBS News’ parent company, Paramount Global, Tuesday agreed to a $16 million settlement with Trump, stemming from a lawsuit Trump filed against CBS in October 2024 related to a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his opponent in the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS BLASTS TRUMP’S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER In the lawsuit, Trump alleged that CBS deceptively edited the interview with Harris when asked about why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. While the segment aired one answer from Harris during a primetime special on the network, a less polished answer had previously appeared in a preview clip of the interview. The money from the settlement will not go to Trump himself, but rather, toward his future presidential library and to cover the plaintiffs' fees and costs. CBS said it worked with a mediator to reach the settlement agreement and that Paramount will not issue an apology.","summary":"The &quot;big, beautiful&quot; bill’s passage comes on the heels of other significant victories for his administration, including a Supreme Court ruling in his favor and successful strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rides-major-wave-momentum-going-july-fourth-after-iran-bbb-supreme-court-lawsuit-victories","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/capitol-trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 13:00:08","author":"Diana Stancy","authors":["Diana Stancy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.008},{"id":338544184,"title":"BROADCAST BIAS: Media elites put their profession over patriotism","text":"When I was a member of the White House press corps, it was easily observable that reporters felt they could not say the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" with other Americans at the White House. That, somehow, compromised their neutrality. This inaction suggested that American reporters shouldn’t show appreciation for their country enshrining freedom of the press. That’s a lack of gratitude, not just a lack of patriotism. For the broadcast media, the feeling that they weren’t rooting for America was first underlined in their opposition to the Vietnam War. This was crystallized with CBS anchor Walter Cronkite declaring from Saigon in 1968 that America was going to lose, \"that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors.\" Cronkite had been over-praised as the essence of objectivity, but politicians feared his persuasive power. Media power to sway the country was more satisfying than patriotism. Journalism is poised against patriotism. Journalists disdain patriotism as \"my country right or wrong,\" and they always want to be right. They associate patriotism with warmongers pushing for endless wars. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES In March 1989, the media’s controversial ingratitude toward America was spotlighted by a PBS show called \"Ethics In America.\" Professor Charles Ogletree created a scenario where America was fighting a fictional country called North Kosan. The enemy was going to assault American troops. He asked: does a reporter have a \"higher duty as an American citizen\" to warn the troops? Without hesitation, CBS journalist Mike Wallace said no. \"No, you don't have higher duty ... you're a reporter.\" ABC anchor Peter Jennings first said he would notify them, then changed his mind: \"I think he's right too. I chickened out.\" In an April 1990 primetime special, Jennings clearly signaled America was not a benign force in the world. \"The United States is deeply involved in Cambodia again. Cambodia is on the edge of hell again.\" September 11, 2001, may have united the country for a few weeks, but not on ABC. Six days after thousands of Americans died, ABC \"Politically Incorrect\" host Bill Maher argued that the terrorists who drove planes into buildings were more courageous than American pilots: \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away, that’s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, not cowardly.\" EX-ABC JOURNALIST FIRED FOR CALLING TRUMP A 'WORLD-CLASS HATER' SAYS IT'S NOT A REPORTER'S JOB TO BE OBJECTIVE Two weeks later, \"CBS Evening News\" producer Dick Meyer wrote a commentary on CBSNews.com on the discomfort with the American flag. \"Our 10-year-old daughter asked her mother if we could put a flag on our car. My wife reluctantly agreed, but hasn’t procured the flag yet. ... My wife essentially shares our daughter’s feelings. But for her, the symbol of the flag was appropriated in her youth by counter-protesters who used it to deny the patriotism of the war’s opponents. Flag-waving feels aggressive to her.\" Burning the flag isn’t aggressive. Waving it is.

The flag’s been hijacked and turned into a logo – the trademark of a monopoly on patriotism. ... When I see flags sprouting on official lapels, I think of the time in China when I saw Mao’s Little Red Book on every official’s desk, omnipresent and unread.\" Four years later, Moyers was still at it on his PBS show, now called \"Moyers & Company.\" This time, he ripped the pledge: \"The next time you say the ‘Pledge of Allegiance.’ ... Remember, it's a lie, a whopper of a lie. We coax it from the mouths of babes for the same reason our politicians wear their flag pins on their lapels. It makes the hypocrisy go down easier.\" BROADCAST BIAS: MEDIA COVERAGE OF NPR LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP HIDES WHAT PUBLIC MEDIA REALLY IS Also in 2007, the ABC News program \"The View\" featured Rosie O’Donnell suggesting we were the terrorists: \"I just want to say something: 655,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. Who are the terrorists?...If you were in Iraq, and the other country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The View\" was still at this in 2021, when Olympian athlete Gwen Berry turned away and covered her head while they played the national anthem at the delayed Olympic trials. Whoopi Goldberg came to her defense: \"In the upcoming days, we’ll play you the American anthem and let you see what you think of it. Because there’s some stuff in there that makes it a little bit tough to take.\" America is a free country, and journalists are free to denigrate it. Journalists are free to assert that their precious profession places them above putrid pledges of allegiance. But they shouldn’t be mystified when Americans decide they don’t trust networks that sound suspicious of the national unity that patriotism can bring.

Any day Joe Biden is appearing on the public stage, reminding Americans of his failures, is a good day for the White House.”\n\nA spokesperson for Biden’s office did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nThis isn’t the first time Biden has spoken about Trump since leaving the White House. The Washington Examiner lists seven times the former president rebuked Trump or made rare remarks about his administration.\n\n1. Biden’s first post-White House interview with the BBC\n\nIn early May, the BBC released its exclusive interview with Biden after his presidency, in which he criticized Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine to give up part of its territory to Russia.\n\n“It is modern-day appeasement,” Biden said as he criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I just don’t understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he’s going to take significant portions of land that aren’t his, and that’s going to satisfy him. I don’t quite understand.”\n\nBiden did not appear impressed with Trump’s efforts to redefine the White House in his first 100 days. “I don’t see anything that’s triumphant,” Biden said. \n\n2. Biden goes on The View \n\nThe same week as the BBC interview, Biden conducted his first live interview with an American outlet since leaving the White House with the hosts of The View.\n\nBiden largely defended his presidency from unrelenting criticisms that he and his allies had covered up his mental decline while serving as president. \n\nBiden, again, took another shot at Trump’s first 100 days in office. “He’s had the worst 100 days any president ever had,” Biden said about his successor.\n\nAlthough Biden claimed he could have defeated Trump if he had not suspended his 2024 campaign, the former president conceded that he bears responsibility for Trump’s win. “I was in charge, and he won. So, you know, I take responsibility,” he said.\n\nWhen Joy Behar, an anti-Trump critic and co-host on The View, asked Biden why Trump has repeatedly blamed him for problems the U.S. faces, Biden responded, “I beat him.”\n\n3. After cancer diagnosis, Biden stays hopeful \n\nAfter Biden’s shocking announcement that he had an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones, he attended his grandson, Robert Hunter Biden II’s, high school graduation in Salisbury, Connecticut.\n\nThe former president told travelers at the Bradley International Airport in Connecticut that he was “feeling great” and “doing fine” ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. \n\nThe cancer revelation prompted Trump and Congress to launch multiple investigations into Biden aides over his use of the autopen to conduct presidential actions. \n\n4. Biden defends record while in Delaware \n\nIn late May, Biden defended his decision to seek reelection and his mental acuity amid the rising swell of concern after the cancer diagnosis. \n\n“You can see that I’m mentally incompetent and I can’t walk, and I can beat the hell out of both of them!” Biden cheekily told reporters following the publication of a new book from journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleging a White House cover-up of his health.\n\nBiden claimed he would “beat” prostate cancer.\n\n“The expectation is we’re going to be able to beat this. It’s not in any organ. My bones are strong. So feeling good,” Biden said while speaking at a Memorial Day service in New Castle, Delaware. \n\n5. Biden takes aim at Trump during Juneteenth \n\nDuring an event commemorating Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery that Biden signed into law in 2021, in Galveston, Texas, Biden attacked Trump’s efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\n“I played a role in changing the names of all the military camps that have slave names,” Biden said. “What are we doing now? Restating those names. Folks, the darkness can hide much but erase nothing.” \n\nTrump didn’t hold a Juneteenth celebration or sign a proclamation to mark the holiday. \n\n6. Biden attends the funeral of a slain Minnesota lawmaker \n\nIn late June, Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined mourners at the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed by a man posing as a police officer. Law enforcement called their June 14 deaths an assassination. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also wounded by the attacker.\n\n“Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history. I get to remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I have ever known,” said Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s former running mate, during his eulogy. \n\nNeither Biden nor Harris spoke, but both were seated with Walz.\n\nDays before the funeral, the former president also joined mourners as Hortman, her husband, and her dog lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda.\n\nNeither Trump nor Vice President JD Vance attended the funerals. \n\n7. Biden takes shot at ‘big, beautiful bill’\n\nAt Wednesday’s Society for Human Resource Management convention, Biden lamented Trump’s efforts to reverse the gains from Biden’s tenure.\n\n“Many of the things I worked so damn hard, that I thought I changed in the country, are changing so rapidly,” Biden said in a keynote speech. \n\nThe former president did not mention Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which passed through the House after gaining approval in the Senate. The legislation would reverse the Medicaid expansions enacted during Biden’s term.\n\nBut as soon as it passed the House on Thursday, Biden’s X account posted a statement calling the bill “reckless” and “cruel.”\n\nTrump signed the legislation into law on Friday, coinciding with the Fourth of July deadline lawmakers had set.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden is slowly stepping back into the spotlight since his White House exit in January to defend his legacy in the face of GOP investigations.

But they are still resisting","text":"Monica Wilson was so devastated by the result of the 2024 presidential election, she couldn’t even move the day after. She had cast her ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris but became disillusioned when she learned a plurality of Americans ultimately chose Donald Trump. \n\n“I actually was one of those Black women that said, ‘To hell with it. You do what you want. It’s your issue. You created it,’” Wilson, who serves as a Parma, Ohio, city councilwoman, recalled in a phone interview. \n\nWilson wasn’t alone in her anger. Black voters carried the Democratic vote in 2024, voting for Harris at 83%, split between 89% of Black women and 75% of Black men, according to a 2025 Pew Research Center report. When Harris lost to Trump, members of those majorities declared that they would not participate in any and all anti-Trump protests. But just under six months into Trump’s presidency, that declaration hasn’t exactly translated to inaction.\n\nIn Wilson’s case, that meant having a “change of heart” just three months in. \n\n“Somewhere around March or so, I said I need to start participating because this is my life, and it is the life of my legacies — my nieces and nephews — and it’s my country,” said Wilson, who added that attending the nationwide “Hands Off” protest in early April made her come out of her post-election slump. \n\nHarris’ ascension to the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket last summer reenergized die-hard Black Democrats in ways unseen since former President Barack Obama’s 2008 bid, with fundraising calls raking in millions of dollars for Harris’ fledgling campaign in the weeks immediately after then–President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. That momentum, coupled with the hope that the country would put its first Black and South Asian woman in the Oval Office, reinvigorated Black voters in a moment when it felt like the nation’s future again hung in the balance — and that made Harris’ loss that much more crushing a betrayal. \n\nIn the days post-election, social media was flooded with statements from Black users, particularly Black women, that they would be sitting out of protests and marches against the Trump administration. They’d done their part by turning out to vote and organizing for democracy, many said, and it would be on everyone else to dig themselves out of the inevitable social, economic and political hole Trump 2.0 would bring.\n\n“I want people to understand how angry Black women are, and quite honestly, Black men,” Wilson said, voicing frustration over the narrative that Black men shifted toward Trump. (Pew’s post-election data indicates that Trump’s support among Black voters nearly doubled between 2024 and 2020, going from 8% to 15%).\n\n“We have been out here, for the 20th and 19th centuries, leading the protest to get America to live and fulfill its promise, and we just got the wind knocked out of us this last election,” she added. “The majority have, if not more, responsibility to fight back because they brought this down upon us. They voted for this man, and they created the institutions of racism, they have cultivated the institution of prejudices and inequality, and they have to take responsibility for that.”\n\nThat commitment to sitting out — abstaining from anti-Trump demonstrations in favor of staying home — was apparent in the “Hands Off” protests against the administration. Reports noted that crowds were largely made up of older white people, pointing to photos from the actions across the country as evidence. That was in contrast with the diverse, Black-led protests that erupted in 2020 and galvanized thousands of Americans against police brutality and anti-Black racism.\n\nBrandon Jessup, deputy director of data analytics and movement technology at State Voices, has witnessed that disillusionment among Black Americans firsthand. While door-knocking and doing outreach for the nonpartisan civic engagement network, State Voices organizers have faced a higher level of scrutiny from Black communities, he said in a phone interview.\n\nMany are still interested in taking to the streets, as with the “No Kings” demonstrations in June. But many others, Jessup said, are skeptical of how they can continue to voice their opposition to the current administration when it’s upending their lives; they’re bearing the brunt of Trump’s executive actions and legislation targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, Medicaid and other social services as well as navigating the disappointment of decades of fighting to only obtain marginal reform.\n\n“Incremental change — that’s almost water torture, especially when our communities desire radical change, not extreme change,” Jessup told Salon. “What we’re getting from this current administration is extremism. We wanted radical change. We wanted a change that made sure that we took care of all, not less.”\n\nStacy Davis Gates, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, told Salon that she sees many Black women still grappling with that “rejection,” both in terms of Harris’ candidacy and the fact that some members of their communities voted for Trump “even at the peril of their own family.” Still, Davis Gates argued, it’s not clear that Black people could abstain even if they wanted to. \n\n“One of the things that popular discourse often misses is that being Black is a political strategy within itself,” she told Salon. “From the time that we wake up to the time that we go to sleep, in the way that we have to navigate society at our jobs, in our schools, in our neighborhood, even a trip to the grocery store … I don’t think we ever truly sit out of any protest.” \n\nMarcus Anthony Hunter, professor of sociology and African American Studies at UCLA, echoed that sentiment. Black people, he added, also must weigh the risk of engaging in demonstrations and the potential for violent encounters with law enforcement against their safety and livelihoods.\n\n“There’s a calculation that is worth considering, and it sometimes means people throw that out the window and just jump out there,” said Hunter, who coined the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag in 2012 before it ballooned into a movement. “But just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not caring, and that they don’t care and that they’re not doing things that raise the alarms in their communities in ways that might be less seen or less visible, but are still very much present.”\n\nSuch is the case for Meredith Turner, a Cuyahoga County councilwoman and 2024 Ohio delegate at the Democratic National Convention. She previously told Salon that, following Harris’ loss, she would not be participating in any protests or marches against the then-incoming president for the foreseeable future. Months later, she said she remains steadfast in that commitment. \n\n“I feel like the coalition that I belong to — we’re tired. We’re tired. It’s OK for us to sit back and watch others strategize and take action,” Turner said. She added that she’s “very comfortable” with Trump supporters and Americans who didn’t vote “having to deal with the consequences of their decisions.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nBut choosing to sit out doesn’t mean disengaging from the fight for democracy altogether. Turner said she’s focused on lobbying for change at the state and local levels, advocating for her constituents and participating in letter-writing campaigns appealing to state and federal Ohio officials to challenge cuts to the safety net.\n\n“I may not be marching in the street, but I’m fully engaged where I believe I can make the most impact,” Turner said. \n\nMeanwhile, she said she and others are turning inward to their communities to partner with local organizations, brainstorm ways to fill the gaps, cultivate Black leadership and prioritize Black joy. \n\n“We are dealing with this in a totally different way,” Turner said. “We are having cookouts. We got our boots on the ground. We’re line dancing. We’re going about our daily life. We’re having cotillions. We’re having graduation parties. We’re trying to get the next generation engaged because we just may not be able to do anything right now.”\n\nBlack Americans’ resistance to Trump’s policies has also taken the form of boycotts and investing more in Black-owned and pro-DEI businesses. A handful of Black-led groups, spearheaded by Atlanta-based Pastor Jamal Bryant, launched a boycott of Target after the retailer announced in January that it would be sunsetting a program it started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 aimed at helping Black employees develop their careers, boost Black-owned businesses and improve Black shoppers’ experiences. The change followed Trump’s issuance of an executive order targeting DEI in the federal government and encouraging rollbacks in the private sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco’s renewed commitment to DEI in the face of Trump’s policies led Rev. Al Sharpton to orchestrate a buy-in at the Washington state wholesaler with more than 100 members of the National Action Network. \n\nWhile it’s unclear the exact impact the boycott has had, so far this year Target’s foot traffic has slowed, stock prices have plunged and net quarterly sales have decreased compared to 2024 numbers. At the same time, Black and Hispanic households appeared to be pulling back visits at a disproportionately high rate in the weeks following Target’s DEI rollback, according to a March Numerator report. In contrast, the report said, Costco “attracted many of these same consumers” and saw a 7.7 million increase in visits over a four-week period that ended Feb. 9. \n\nYusuf Johnson counted himself among those new Costco visitors this year, going so far as to purchase a membership and tell his store’s staff his reasons for doing so. While the Florida-based IT project manager said he was never one for participating in demonstrations, in part, due to the danger of police encounters that Black men face, he has always tried to resist through spreading knowledge in blogs, social media posts and more recently, creating YouTube videos. \n\n“I think if you’re not going to be on the streets, you should be ridiculously vocal,” Johnson said, arguing that actions without explanations are “not good enough.” He also said he worries that online calls to “sit out” will lead to more people disengaging from resistance and politics altogether in favor of placing the onus squarely on white Americans. Maybe abstaining while calling on white people to get involved can work, he added. “But if it turns into people just simply shutting down from any form of gaining knowledge, … [of] current events, then I think it’s going to be damaging to us.” \n\nJohnson’s longtime friend, Angelina Hamilton Steiner, on the other hand, occupies something of a middle ground. The founder of Madison Court Community Coalition, a grassroots youth engagement organization in Lakewood, Ohio, told Salon she understands and respects Black Americans’ decision to pull back from the frontlines of activism, having come out of the election feeling “dejected” herself. Still, she said, she knew she had to do something. \n\n“I am still wanting to keep fighting. I’m not wanting to give up hope because, for me, this is just as much my country as it is their country,” she said.\n\nHer solution has been to focus on the local level and work to alleviate the manifestations of federal policies on everyday people. She applied to be appointed to the vacant seat on the Lakewood, Ohio, city council and was selected to fill the role in January. She’s also taken part in a few Cleveland-area protests, though she said she’s engaging in demonstrations at a much slower pace than she had before the election.\n\nHow to approach resistance going forward, she said, is a decision that every Black American needs to make for themselves, regardless of what others think. \n\n“I think this is on the white collective to get out there and save your country and be at these protests and put your bodies out there on the front line,” Hamilton Steiner added. “Our bodies have been on the frontline since this country was founded and have founded this country.”","summary":"Black Americans’ call to sit out of Trump protests and marches post-election hasn’t exactly translated to inaction","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/07/05/no-black-people-may-not-be-joining-all-of-your-protests-but-they-are-still-resisting/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/07/juneteenth-celebration-juneteenth-celeb-1258801527-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 10:30:16","author":"Tatyana Tandanpolie","authors":["Tatyana Tandanpolie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.533},{"id":338499120,"title":"Donald Trump's Approval Rating Collapses With Gen Z","text":"President Donald Trump is facing a sharp backlash from young voters, with new polling showing his approval rating among Generation Z has dropped to one of its lowest points yet.The latest YouGov/Yahoo poll, conducted between June 26-30 among 1,597 adults, shows that among Gen Z voters, his net rating has deteriorated sharply, falling from -23 points in May to -41 points in June.Net ratings do have a tendency to swing much more than a simple approval rating. Still, the president's approval rating in June is low, at 27 percent. The margin of error is at plus or minus 3.2 percent.Lucas Walsh, a youth political behavior expert and professor at Monash University, told Newsweek that Trump's falling support among Gen Z voters may reflect how young people \"respond to issues rather than party allegiances.\"Why It MattersIn the 2024 election, Trump made surprising inroads with young voters, narrowing the Democrats' traditional lead among Gen Z—a group that has typically leaned left in recent cycles. According to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent. By comparison, in 2020, Joe Biden carried the same age group by a much wider margin, winning 61 percent to Trump's 36 percent.What To KnowOther polls also show a clear deterioration in support for Trump among the youngest voters, reinforcing signs that his modest gains with Gen Z in 2024 may be slipping away just months later. The latest Quantus Insights poll, conducted between June 30 and July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, found that just 35 percent of Gen Z voters now approve of Trump's job performance, while 58 percent disapprove—a sharp drop compared to the previous month. In June, the same poll showed him with 46 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval among young voters.The latest ActiVote poll, conducted between June 1 and June 30 among 523 adults, shows a similar trend. In June, 32 percent of Gen Z respondents approved of Trump's performance, compared to 62 percent who disapproved—a dramatic slide from May, when approval and disapproval were nearly evenly split at 47 percent and 48 percent, respectively. These numbers suggest that whatever modest inroads Trump made with younger voters in 2024 may be eroding as Gen Z voters grow frustrated with his agenda and messaging.The broader mood among young voters appears to be souring, too. The YouGov/Yahoo data reveals that Gen Z is becoming more pessimistic about the country's direction overall. In May, 27 percent of Gen Z voters said the U.S. was headed in the right direction, while 53 percent said it was on the wrong track. By June, that optimism had dropped sharply: only 21 percent said the country was headed in the right direction, compared to 66 percent who believed it was off course.This discontent does not appear to be translating into strong support for Democrats. The Quantus poll suggests that young voters are feeling politically homeless, with 43 percent of Gen Z voters saying that neither party represents American values.A YouGov/Economist poll from last week suggests discontent with Trump among young people may be tied to his performance on key issues such as the economy and immigration.Among Gen Z voters overall, Trump's approval fell from 34 percent approve / 58 percent disapprove at the start of June to 28 percent approve / 66 percent disapprove by the end of the month.On the economy, the decline was more modest but still negative: approval slipped from 33 percent approve / 54 percent disapprove in early June to 32 percent approve / 60 percent disapprove by month's end. The numbers were even starker on inflation—a top issue for young voters—with Trump's approval dropping from 32 percent approve / 57 percent disapprove at the start of June to just 23 percent approve / 69 percent disapprove by the end of the month.On immigration, another issue where Trump's messaging has been central, Gen Z voters' support also eroded. His net rating went from 40 percent approve / 52 percent disapprove at the beginning of June to 30 percent approve / 65 percent disapprove by the end of the month.Walsh said that while many young voters backed Trump in 2024, his \"dizzying array of announcements across contentious issues\" since then could be pushing them away.
