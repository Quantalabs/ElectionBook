Darrell Issa, a San Diego Republican, after California’s redistricting measure turned his reliably red district into a slightly blue one that will be a key swing race in next year’s midterm elections. Rep. Mike Levin, a San Clemente Democrat, can breathe easier, as Proposition 50 carves out new boundaries that make his swing district more safely Democratic. The new voting map reflects California’s bid to offset Texas’ effort to secure control of the House by adding five Republican seats in November. California voters approved the redistricting plan proposed in Proposition 50 by nearly 20 points in a special election this month. Both redistricting efforts are embroiled in litigation. On Tuesday a federal court blocked Texas from using its new maps, finding that they would harm Black and Latino voters in that state. Last week the U.S. Department of Justice sued to overturn California’s maps, arguing that they unlawfully considered Latino voters in the new districts. If California’s redistricting plan withstands that challenge, the new voting map could help Democrats flip the lone Republican seat in San Diego. The 48th Congressional District, represented by Issa, will switch from a 12-point Republican advantage to a 4-point Democratic lead, based on voter registration. The more favorable odds have drawn a wide field of challengers, including Issa’s former opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, who lost to Issa in a previous version of the district in 2020, San Diego City Council Member Marni von Wilpert, and several contenders from the Coachella Valley. The passage of the redistricting measure triggered a statewide game of musical chairs, setting in motion the chairs as well as the players. The current 48th District covers conservative East County San Diego communities. The new district moves west and north, losing much of that backcountry and adding the North County San Diego cities of Escondido, San Marcos and Vista. It also includes ultra-liberal Palm Springs in Riverside County, where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 4 to 1. Those new lines absorb part of the current 41st District in Riverside County, represented by longstanding Republican Rep. Ken Calvert. His current district will move entirely to Los Angeles and Orange County, so Calvert plans to run in the new 40th District in Riverside and Orange County against fellow Republican Rep. Young Kim. Meanwhile, three Coachella Valley Democrats who were among eight challengers against Calvert for his Riverside County district have now jumped into the race against Issa. Attorney Anuj Dixit, school board member Abel Chavez and entrepreneur Brandon Riker all switched gears to campaign for the new 48th District. Another Palm Springs candidate, Marc Iannarino, a Navy veteran and bartender, threw his hat in the ring. Political observers note that the Coachella Valley candidates come from a smaller and more liberal portion of the new district. “These are three candidates who really know Palm Springs, but they’ve got to reach out to moderate, purplish voters and to know who San Diego voters are,” said Dan Rottenstreich, campaign manager for von Wilpert. “This is not a deep blue seat,” Rottenstreich said. “This is going to be among the top five heavily contested races in the country.” Von Wilpert and Campa-Najjar, the two highest profile contenders, each argue they’re the best candidate to navigate the slim partisan advantage. Both have prominent endorsements. Former Sen. Barbara Boxer, numerous state and local leaders and the Democratic women’s political action committee Emily’s List are supporting von Wilpert. A slate of congress members including San Diego Reps. Mike Levin, Scott Peters and Sara Jacobs have weighed in for Campa-Najjar. All the challengers face a well-established incumbent for a district that — despite its partisan shift — will still be a toss-up. Von Wilpert, a former prosecutor in the San Diego city attorney’s office, won her City Council seat in 2020, running against a Republican opponent in a conservative-leaning district, Rottenstreich said. “With these new lines, CA-48 becomes one of the most competitive races in America, and a must-win seat to flip the House,” von Wilpert said in a statement on election day. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s proven I can win tough elections, flip red seats blue, and deliver results for working families.” Campa-Najjar, a Navy officer and former Obama campaign official, argues that his experience running against Issa in 2020 positions him to win Democratic and independent votes in the new district. “I see it as a rematch between me and Darrell Issa, with 10 other candidates,” he said. “I’m not running against them. I have great respect for them, but only one of us will win.” Although he lost in 2020, Campa-Najjar said he gained a foothold in the conservative district, getting more votes than expected in the majority Republican district. Issa has served in Congress for more than 20 years in different districts. He originally held the 49th District — now represented by Levin — from 2001 through 2019, and retired when that district became competitive. In 2020, he won his current seat, holding it for the next two terms after it was redrawn during statewide redistricting in 2021. Issa declined to answer questions from CalMatters, but in a statement he called Proposition 50 an “unprecedented purely partisan campaign that pitted neighbor against neighbor and divided the state as never before.” Despite that, Issa said he plans to run again: “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California — regardless of their party or where they live.” The general election will reflect voters' opinions about President Trump; historically the president’s party usually loses ground in the midterms. Issa, a close Trump ally who has supported the president’s policies and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, will have to lean into that record, Kousser said. “He has to embrace him with his base and make the case to the middle that the Trump presidency has been good for their district,” he said. The crowded field of Democrats could thwart some candidates in the primary, Kousser said. But it will likely benefit the party in the general election next November, forcing challengers to campaign early and gain traction with voters. “Whoever emerges as the Democratic candidate is going to be battle-tested in that district,” he said. The redistricting measure also shored up vulnerable Democratic seats, including Levin’s 49th District. It shifts south, adding coastal San Diego communities of La Jolla and Torrey Pines. Now 65% of the current district is in San Diego County; in the new district that climbs to 81%, Levin said. With that come more Democratic voters, and even more left-leaning voters. The current district has a 2% margin of Democratic voter registration, which jumps to 4% under the new lines. But the Democratic advantage jumps to 12% when you compare the number of votes for former Vice President Kamala Harris vs. Trump in last year’s election. That positions Levin more securely in his reelection race. He faces Republican San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond, along with two other Republicans and a nonpartisan candidate. “The southern shift of that district makes it more blue in terms of the democratic registrations, and the political leanings of the independents,” said Paul Mitchell, the political data expert who drew California’s new voting lines. “So that district for him is a big improvement.” Sullivan Brennan writes for CalMatters.","summary":"Eleven Democrats are vying to unseat Rep.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-29/after-prop-50-san-diego-may-lose-its-only-republican-in-congress-as-democrats-target-issa","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0741101/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4896x3264+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F14%2F6c809bf50ce95fe05e3303b8b089%2Fimg-sd-2948100-la-pol","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 22:31:05","author":"Deborah Sullivan Brennan","authors":["Deborah Sullivan Brennan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":383478944,"title":"Trump, Thank God","text":"This year, I’m thanking God for Donald Trump.

Buzz electric van. \n\nBut in America, where the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado pickups have maintained sales dominance for decades, VW doesn't make a single truck for the consumer market. \n\nScout is supposed to change that. \n\nVolkswagen bought the rights to revive the iconic Scout brand in 2021, and the first models — the Traveler SUV and Terra pickup — are expected to hit driveways in late 2027. \n\nOriginally built by International Harvester, the mid-century Scout was a boxy, go-anywhere truck that looked like early Ford Broncos and Chevy Blazers. \n\nIt faded out in the 1980s, but VW is bringing it back, with a unique twist to the engine, in hopes of finally getting a foothold in America's truck-obsessed market. \n\nAnd this month, VW showed off the final prototype, and one throwback detail instantly stood out. \n\nThe front row has a three-seat bench. It looks like the kind of bench that used to be standard in classic American trucks, with room for a driver and two adults. \n\nPickup trucks, which used to have bench seats with largely flat floors, have turned to more captain's chairs and easily-accessible cupholders\n\nScout has two seating arrangements in its pickup: two captain's chairs or a three-seater bench (pictured above)\n\nTim Walz, Kamala Harris' pick for second in command during the 2024 election, owns a Scout. He gave car tips from his YouTube while fixing the truck during the campaign \n\nOver the past decade, giant consoles, knobby gear selectors, and captain's chairs pushed the classic seating option out of trucks. \n\nPickups that maintained the bench often forced mid-seat riders to straddle floor-mounted cupholders. \n\nScout thinks it cracked the space problem. \n\nBy using the truck's battery setup to keep the floor perfectly flat, VW managed to fit an optional bench in the front and a flat floor in the second row, seating six in total.\n\nAnd that retro touch seems to be hitting a nerve.\n\nScout CEO Scott Keogh says he's received more than 130,000 non-binding reservations so far — each costing $100. \n\nAnd nearly eight out of 10 of those potential buyers aren't asking for full EVs. \n\nThey want extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs: trucks that drive on electricity but use a gas engine as an onboard generator to recharge the battery on long trips.\n\nScout is planning two versions of the truck: a dedicated EV and a battery-powered truck with a gas generator on board\n\nThe Scout brand was popular in the 1960s as an alternative to Jeep, Chevy, and Ford\n\nBLACK FRIDAY SALE\n\nLucrative jobs you can walk into today with NO experience and NO degree - and some pay over $100,000\n\n'The market clearly has spoken, without a doubt, and they like the EREV technology, full stop,' Keogh told Bloomberg, noting the system gives the truck enough juice for 500 miles and increases towing capacity. 'This is EV without the drama.'\n\nThat preference is part of a global trend. \n\nChinese automakers are already selling EREVs at a massive scale, European sales are climbing, and US buyers have cooled on pure EVs since losing access to the $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nAnd that political shift is reshaping Scout itself.\n\nThe brand that VW originally pitched as a pure electric revival is now being repositioned as a mostly hybrid lineup. \n\nKeogh told Bloomberg the company isn't dropping the roughly $60,000 starting price to compensate for the missing tax credit and doesn't think it needs to.\n\nThe pivot also reflects the broader EV slowdown. Ford is reportedly weighing whether to kill the F-150 Lightning, Tesla's Cybertruck has struggled to convert hype into mass sales, and Dodge nixed its electric truck plans altogether.\n\nScout's CEO is confident in his company's approach to combine a gas generator with a battery engine: 'They like the EREV technology, full stop'\n\nScout is planning on rolling out its first two vehicles from its South Carolina plant in 2027 \n\nIndependent automotive analysts said automakers made a mistake when rolling out pickup trucks as their first all-electric vehicles, because batteries still struggle with common truck activities like rugged terrain, towing, and inclement weather. \n\nKeogh also said he's open to killing the Terra if sales don't pick up.\n\nEven so, VW is betting big. \n\nA new $2 billion factory in South Carolina will build the SUV and pickup, with room to potentially assemble Audi models on the same platform. \n\nScout is targeting the heart of the US profit pool — truck and SUV segments that make up roughly 40 percent of industry earnings — and leaning heavily into the idea of an American-made truck built for American buyers.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nVolkswagen launches pickup with popular feature that's been ripped from trucks for a decade\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Americans are excited about the feature coming back, with more than 130,000 non-binding reservations made so far.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/cars/article-15329139/volkswagen-scout-pickup-bench-seat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/26/20/104219309-0-image-a-23_1764189744815.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/07/3837730750279731089/1024x576_MP4_3837730750279731089.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-29 19:38:55","author":"Ben Shimkus,Editor","authors":["Ben Shimkus","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.046},{"id":383454468,"title":"'Damn Him!': Rosie O'Donnell Claims Her Autistic Child Blames Trump For 'Forcing' Them To Move to Ireland","text":"Rosie O'Donnell has claimed that her autistic child is furious at Donald Trump, blaming him for 'forcing' their family to leave the United States. Speaking on CNN's Jim Acosta Show, the actress and comedian said her youngest child Clay, who is non‑binary, slammed their hand on the table and shouted: 'Damn him. Damn Trump.'O'Donnell explained that her child believed Trump had 'made us move in order for our own safety' and was now 'destroying the country'. The 63‑year‑old former talk show host relocated to Ireland in January 2025, days before Trump's inauguration, describing the move as a 'self‑imposed exile' after his landslide victory over Kamala Harris.Family Impact and Celebrity ExileO'Donnell told the CNN host that she did not 'want to give' her defiance of Trump to her child, adding: 'I did 22 years. I don't really need to do [it] anymore, and I don't want my kid to be so affected by it.' She acknowledged that her child's autism made their reaction more intense, but also said they 'recognise what's going on'.Her decision to leave the US reflects a broader trend of celebrities relocating abroad in response to political shifts. She has described life in Ireland as 'pretty wonderful', praising the kindness and warmth of locals, while also admitting she misses aspects of the US.Online BacklashThe comments quickly went viral, drawing widespread criticism on social media. One user wrote: 'Rosie can't even take responsibility for her own decision to move to Ireland. Her therapist deserves hazard pay.' Another said: 'Trump didn't make them move anywhere. Rosie O'Donnell needs to get checked out for the blatant case of TDS she has,' a reference to the acronym for 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'.Others accused her of projecting political anger onto her child, with one remarking: 'She needs to take responsibility for her parental decisions. She has free will and she used it to uproot her family in a fit of pique.'Longstanding Feud With TrumpO'Donnell's remarks are the latest chapter in her long feud with Trump, which dates back nearly two decades. She has often been singled out by him in speeches and social media posts, claiming that he 'sort of uses me as a punchline whenever he feels the need'.In September, Trump threatened to revoke her US citizenship, writing on Truth Social: 'She is not a Great American and is, in my opinion, incapable of being so.' He later escalated by calling her 'a Threat to Humanity' and suggesting she should 'remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her'.The feud has also spilt into diplomatic moments. During a meeting with Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin in Washington, Trump joked: 'Did you know you have Rosie O'Donnell? You're better off not knowing.' O'Donnell later said she was troubled by the remark, arguing that it disrespected Ireland's leader.A Personal Feud in the Political ArenaO'Donnell's claim resonates because it combines personal family struggles with political polarisation. Her child's anger, expressed in the phrase 'Damn him!', has become a viral soundbite, fuelling debate about whether celebrities should frame political decisions as forced exile.The backlash underscores how celebrity political statements can spark intense reactions, especially when they involve children. Social media users accused O'Donnell of projecting her political anger onto her family, while others mocked her decision to relocate abroad.The controversy has kept her long-running feud with Mr Trump firmly in the spotlight. Her latest comments, tied to her child's frustration, have reignited that feud and ensured her move abroad remains a trending topic in both US and Irish media, highlighting the impact of political decisions on families.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/damn-him-rosie-odonnell-claims-her-autistic-child-blames-trump-forcing-them-move-ireland-1758969","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1736987/rosie-odonell.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5b7c8c14ad5a012e098a1f76f49aa133","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 19:04:06","author":"Bernadette B.

On Friday, Rep. Bohacek posted the following on Facebook:\n\nMany of you have asked my position on redistricting. I have been an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of my second daughter. Those of you that don’t know me or my family might not know that my daughter has Down Syndrome.

But as new schemes targeting the state’s generous safety net programs came to light, state and federal officials began to grapple with a jarring reality.\n\nOver the last five years, law enforcement officials say, fraud took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora as scores of individuals made small fortunes by setting up companies that billed state agencies for millions of dollars’ worth of social services that were never provided.\n\nFederal prosecutors say 59 people have been convicted in those schemes so far and that more than $1 billion in taxpayers’ money has been stolen in three plots they are investigating.\n\nOutrage has swelled among Minnesotans, and fraud has turned into a potent political issue in a competitive campaign season. Gov. Tim Walz and fellow Democrats are being asked to explain how so much money was stolen on their watch, providing Republicans, who hope to take back the governor’s office in 2026, with a powerful line of attack.\n\nMany Somali Americans in Minnesota say the fraud has damaged the reputation of their entire community, around 80,000 people.\n\nDebate over the fraud has opened new rifts between the state’s Somali community and other Minnesotans, and has left some Somali Americans saying they are unfairly facing a new layer of suspicion against all of them, rather than the small group accused of fraud. Critics of the Walz administration say the fraud persisted partly because state officials were fearful of alienating the Somali community in Minnesota. Walz, who has instituted new fraud prevention safeguards, defended his administration’s actions.\n\nThe episode has raised broader questions for some residents about the sustainability of Minnesota’s Scandinavian-modeled system of robust safety net programs bankrolled by high taxes. That system helped create an environment that drew immigrants to the state over many decades, including tens of thousands of Somali refugees after their country descended into civil war in the 1990s.\n\n“No one will support these programs if they continue to be riddled with fraud,” Joseph H. Thompson, the federal prosecutor who has overseen the fraud cases, said in an interview.\n\nThe first public sign of a major problem in the state’s social services system came in 2022, when federal prosecutors began charging defendants in connection to a program aimed at feeding hungry children. The prosecutors focused on a Minneapolis nonprofit organization called Feeding Our Future, which became a partner to dozens of local businesses that enrolled as feeding sites.\n\nState agencies reimbursed the group and its partners for invoices claiming to have fed tens of thousands of children. In reality, federal prosecutors said, most of the meals were nonexistent, and business owners spent the funds on luxury cars, houses and even real estate projects abroad.\n\nBehind the scenes, as federal investigators sifted through bank records and interviewed witnesses, they said they realized the meals fraud was not an isolated incident. In September, prosecutors charged nine people in two new plots tied to public funds meant for those in need.\n\nIn one case, hundreds of providers were reimbursed for assistance they claimed to have provided to people at risk for homelessness, though federal authorities said services weren’t provided.\n\nThe program’s annual cost ballooned to more than $104 million last year, authorities said, from a budgeted projection of $2.6 million when it began in 2020. Two of eight people charged in the scenario have pleaded guilty; six others have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\n\nIn another program, aimed to provide therapy for autistic children, prosecutors said providers recruited children in Minneapolis’ Somali community, falsely certifying them as qualifying for autism treatment and paying their parents kickbacks for their cooperation.\n\nProsecutors have so far charged one provider, Asha Farhan Hassan, 29, with wire fraud. They say she and business partners stole $14 million.\n\nHassan is of Somali ancestry, as are all but eight of the 86 people charged in the meals, housing and autism therapy fraud cases, according to prosecutors. A vast majority are American citizens, by birth or naturalization.\n\nA report by Minnesota’s nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Auditor about the lapses that enabled the meals fraud later found the threat of litigation and of negative press affected how state officials used their regulatory power.\n\nKayseh Magan, a Somali American who formerly worked as a fraud investigator for the Minnesota attorney general’s office, said elected officials in the state were reluctant to take more assertive action in response to allegations in the Somali community.\n\n“There is a perception that forcefully tackling this issue might cause political backlash among the Somali community, which is a core voting bloc” for Democrats, Magan said.\n\nThompson said he believed race sensitivities had played a major role in the rise of fraud. As pandemic assistance was disbursed, the state was also reeling from the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, he said.\n\n“This was a huge part of the problem,” Thompson said during an interview. “Allegations of racism can be a reputation or career killer.”\n\nWalz, Minnesota’s second-term governor, who gained national attention last year as Kamala Harris’ running mate in a White House bid, said claims of racism did not hinder his administration’s response to fraud.\n\nWalz has said his administration may have erred on the side of generosity during the pandemic as the state pushed out large sums of money quickly, seeking to keep Minnesotans housed, fed and healthy.\n\n“The programs are set up to move the money to people,” Walz said in an interview. “The programs are set up to improve people’s lives, and in many cases, the criminals find the loopholes.”\n\nWalz, who is seeking a third term next year, has created a new task force to pursue fraud cases; made it easier for state agencies to share information with one another; and announced plans for new technology, including artificial intelligence tools, to spot suspicious billing practices.\n\n“The message here in Minnesota,” Walz said, “is if you commit a crime, if you commit fraud against public dollars, you are going to go to prison.”\n\nSomali residents’ experiences have been challenging at times, as many in the community contended with poverty, unemployment and language barriers. Few episodes have left fissures as deep as the fraud scandal.\n\nAhmed Samatar, a professor at Macalester College who is a leading expert in Somali studies, said a reckoning over the fraud and its consequences for Minnesota was overdue. Samatar said Somali refugees who came to the United States after their country’s civil war were raised in a culture in which stealing from the country’s dysfunctional and corrupt government was widespread. Minnesota, he said, proved susceptible to rampant fraud because it is “so tolerant, so open and so geared toward keeping an eye on the weak.”\n\nBut some Somali Americans who have nothing to do with social service agencies said they had come to feel under siege amid all the fraud allegations and political accusations.\n\n“The actions of a small group have made it easier for people already inclined to reject us to double down,” said Abdi Mohamed, a filmmaker in Minneapolis. “The broader Somali community — hardworking, family-oriented, deeply committed to Minnesota — is left carrying that burden.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The fraud scandal that rattled Minnesota was staggering in its scale and brazenness.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/11/29/how-fraud-swamped-minnesotas-social-services-system-on-tim-walzs-watch-2/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-file-2193.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 18:34:01","author":"Ernesto Londoño","authors":["Ernesto Londoño"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":383372994,"title":"Trump's billionaire obsession backfires as Americans turn LEFT to rescue them from affordability crisis","text":"As the holidays roll in, Americans are feeling less jolly about the man in the White House who they see as spending more time cozying up to billionaires than dealing with an inflation crunch that's draining family budgets.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump brags about locking down trillions in new investments from booming tech corporations, most Americans are experiencing sticker shock at the grocery store. Trump's deal-making is less of their concern. \n\nInflation and the cost of living are the leading sources of dissatisfaction for Trump’s administration, according to the latest Daily Mail/J.L./Partners online poll of roughly 1,250 US registered voters.\n\nThose twin issues, along with healthcare, are threatening to unravel Trump's second term as it head into its second year. \n\n'Affordability will be the buzzword of the 2026 election cycle,' 917 Strategies founder and former GOP House aide Sarah Selip told the Daily Mail. \n\nInversely, respondents were least concerned with cryptocurrency, small business regulations, artificial intelligence and energy policy - all of which the president has spent significant time and effort on.\n\nThe reticence over the lack of cash comes as the interests of blue-collar and white-collar workers have largely been replaced with those of tuxedo-wearing titans who get invited to White House soirees.\n\nSince September, the president has had at least four executive actions related to AI; he has also attended at least three tuxedo-laden dinner parties with executives like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook and world leaders such as Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman and the UK’s King Charles.\n\nBut voters don’t care about AI, crypto, small business regulations or infrastructure, the Daily Mail/JL Partners survey found. Those initiatives rank as the four lowest priorities among survey respondents.\n\n‘Voters are frustrated,' Brittany Martinez, executive director of the right-leaning political firm Principles First, told the Daily Mail. 'While the administration touts billion-dollar announcements and high-profile corporate deals, most Americans are focused on far more basic needs: whether they can afford groceries, gas, and a good life.'\n\nHowever, the White House was quick to blame the previous Democratic administration for consumer pricing woes.\n\n'After four years of economic calamity under Biden, American families will continue to feel economic relief in the months ahead as the positive effects of massive tax cuts, deregulation, and energy dominance continue to materialize,' White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Daily Mail. \n\nThe Daily Mail/J.L. Partners survey also found several other critical signals that may spell concern for Republicans with a year until the midterms.\n\nTrump matched his worst disapproval rating so far, 55 percent, as Vice President JD Vance and the rest of the Cabinet all saw declines in favorability.\n\n'Through a combination of the shutdown, and one year on from the election, voters seem to have turned around and asked: ‘am I better off than I was a year ago?’. The answer for many – going by this poll – is no, or even that things have got worse,' J..L. Partners founder James Johnson told the Daily Mail. \n\nMeanwhile, the approval rating for the Democratic Party and its top 2028 champions, like California Governor Gavin Newsom, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former VP Kamala Harris, has ticked up.\n\nAll three of the aforementioned liberals would, at least at this moment, beat Vance or Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a hypothetical 2028 head-to-head matchup, the poll data showed.\n\n‘When families feel squeezed and Washington seems disconnected from their day-to-day reality, they naturally start exploring alternatives,' Martinez said. 'The growing openness to progressive candidates in this poll is beyond ideology — it’s about urgency.'\n\nIf the GOP takes its eyes off the proverbial affordability ball, it could strike out during the midterms. Democrats only need to flip three seats in the House and four in the Senate to take control of Congress. \n\n‘American families across the political spectrum are experiencing a growing sense of economic hopelessness,’ Republican strategist Tristan Shakespeare told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘When the average household can no longer afford groceries, housing, healthcare, and other basic essentials without falling further behind, it’s inevitable that people start searching for alternatives. Many feel abandoned by a system that claims to prioritize the broad public but consistently fails to deliver.’\n\nAnd that, he says, is leading to a rise in dissident political figures on the left and right.\n\n‘This disillusionment is fueling demands for systemic change—manifesting as calls for National Socialism from figures like Nick Fuentes on the right and Democratic Socialism from leaders like Zohran Mamdani on the left.’\n\nThe president’s 2024 campaign focused heavily on driving down prices that ticked up under former President Joe Biden, but so far, consumers have yet to register the savings. The poll found that Democrats are more trusted on cost-of-living policies than Republicans.\n\n‘He made massive, huge promises that everything was going to get better and that everything was Joe Biden's everything was Joe Biden's fault, that over the course of the last year, people have watched him spend more time on vanity projects and enriching himself than actually delivering for the American people,' said Democratic strategist Mike Nellis. \n\nWhile the White House adds a new massive ballroom to host larger parties for its tuxedo-wearing allies, at a cost estimated to be around $300 million, voters remain frustrated with everyday prices.\n\nThe White House did not return the Daily Mail's request for comment.","summary":"Americans are feeling less jolly about the man in the White House, who, as inflation bites at their gift budgets, has been cozying up with billionaires while Democrats scream affordability.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15335111/trump-billionaire-backfire-americans-democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/28/19/104276755-0-image-a-31_1764359527974.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 13:06:35","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":383383074,"title":"'Hypnotized by ... state-run media': Charlie Sheen reveals to Megyn Kelly his political shift after doing his own research","text":"Charlie Sheen, who has historically been known for having more than a mild case of Trump derangement syndrome, recently opened up about changing his political views after taking a long look at the media he consumed. \n\nThe famous actor joined Megyn Kelly in an interview published last Friday to discuss his turn away from the left and his embrace of the right. \n\n'I'm going to do my own research like I've done with everything my entire life.

Just some of the stuff I'd bought into and some of the stuff I was worshipping and some of the people I was hating because I was told I was supposed to hate them.\" \n\nThough Sheen voted for Kamala Harris in 2024, he said it was a vote he wishes he could \"have back\" following his shift to the right. \n\nLike Blaze News?

Home prices have risen more than 50% since the pandemic. About a third of American households now spend more than 30% of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time homebuyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record.\n\nThe core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I’ve seen estimates ranging from 2 million to 5 million. It’s a shortage decades in the making — and one we’re nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.\n\nEvery White House since President Barack Obama’s administration has recognized the need to build more homes but the results, under both Democrats and Republicans, have been anemic. Housing is a hard problem to solve from the Oval Office. Zoning and building rules are set at the state and local levels. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve. In 2024, Kamala Harris promised to build 3 million new homes and released a plan that no housing expert I spoke to thought could come anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\n“ The thing that I think we learned is that federal housing policy is stuck in a really weak equilibrium,” said Jared Bernstein, who led President Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. “There is just far too little asked of cities and states. They won’t do much to push back on the barriers that are blocking affordable housing.”\n\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wants to change that. He’s among the authors of a new housing plan that tries to deliver the next administration a set of solutions nearer to the scale of the problem.\n\nFederal incentives\n\nAt the core of the center’s plan is an idea it calls “Rent Relief for Reform.” I don’t love the name, but I like the idea: Places with a housing shortage — and that’s a lot of them — get a choice. Build the housing and the federal government will give all the renters in the city up to $1,000 off their rent — or don’t build the housing and lose access to certain federal grants.\n\nThe Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank, recently proposed a similar idea. In that version, cities and other places that hit ambitious housing targets would qualify for a federal rebate that would give every household — so both homeowners and renters — a check equal to the average increase in rent over the last year. In other words, build enough housing and the federal government will give the people who live near that housing money.\n\nBoth those ideas are trying to solve the hard problem at the heart of housing politics: It’s the people who already have homes who have a voice in local politics and planning. They often like their neighborhood the way it is. They don’t want more traffic or new neighbors or the hassle of nearby construction. What’s in it for them?\n\n“You can put this kind of crassly as you’re incentivizing renters to show up at local elections and push their elected officials to do things that are renter-friendly, which I don’t hate as a strategy,” said Jenny Schuetz, who leads housing policy at Arnold Ventures. “If most renters showed up in the primaries and demanded that their mayor and City Council actually do good things, we could have some pretty different outcomes. But mostly renters don’t show up — particularly in the primary — and so you get these homeowner-dominated coalitions in cities that make it hard to build.”\n\nModular housing\n\nThe other big idea in the Center for American Progress plan is to change the way we build housing in America. “If you go back to 1910, somebody showed up with a toolbox and a hammer to build a house,” Bernstein said. “And if you go to 2025, it’s the same damn thing. This is the one sector where productivity has been literally falling for five decades while everything else has been going up.”\n\nThe comparison that often gets made here is to manufacturing. Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector — how much you could produce with the same number of workers — rose by more than 900%. That’s a big part of why everything from tables to televisions is cheaper today than decades ago. But over the same period, productivity in the construction sector has fallen. That’s not the only reason housing is so expensive today, but it’s part of it.\n\nBut you can manufacture housing — constructing homes in an off-site factory much the way we construct cars and then shipping them for final assembly. This is technology pioneered in the United States when George Romney, Mitt Romney’s father, served as secretary of housing and urban development during the Nixon administration. But the United States never figured out the rules nor the financing to make an industry out of it. Instead, it’s taken hold elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, more than 40% of new homes — and more than 80% of single-family homes — are fabricated off-site.\n\nThe Center for American Progress’s plan proposes a slew of projects to take this industry America invented and make it one where America is a leader. They want the government to seed a major research program to fund innovation in housing construction. They want to have the federal government leverage its purchasing power to become an initial buyer for modular housing — one idea here would be to have the Department of Defense upgrade its military base housing using modular construction. They want to modernize building codes to make modular easier — removing, for instance, an outdated federal requirement to attach a permanent steel chassis to all modular construction — and updating federal insurance and financing rules to make sure modular production qualifies.\n\nUnaffordable housing\n\nYou could imagine states and cities acting even before the federal government does. “New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production,” says Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s housing plan. “But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit.”\n\nLeft unsaid in his plan is that publicly subsidized, affordable housing has become monstrously expensive to construct because the public money triggers rules and process and reviews and negotiations that market-rate housing doesn’t contend with. A Rand study found that, per square foot, affordable housing cost more than 1.5 times as much to build in California as market-rate housing; a Washington Post investigation revealed an affordable housing development in D.C. where the units cost $800,000 each to build, even as the same developer was building market-rate units for $350,000 next door. One reason we don’t build enough affordable housing is we’ve made affordable housing unaffordable to build.\n\nMamdani proposed investing $100 billion to build 200,000 “publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes” over the next decade. That works out to $500,000 per unit — if all goes well. What if New York City became a test case for how modular construction could allow public housing, ordered and built at massive scale, in unionized factories, to become cheaper and faster to build than market-rate housing? If it was only $350,000 per unit, that would mean building almost 300,000 units for the same cost.\n\nOne problem the modular housing industry has faced is the absence of steady demand to keep the factories running and work out the kinks of construction. A place like New York City that wanted to build public housing at scale, over a long period of time, could create that steady demand and use it to seed an industry — New York could become America’s leader in modular construction.\n\nPerhaps that’s fanciful. But our thinking on housing — both public and private — has been far too small for far too long. We’ve accepted shocking cost increases paired with stagnating productivity. We’ve made it impossible for tens of millions of families to build the lives they want in the cities they’d ideally choose. At this point, making it possible to build more housing just isn’t enough. We need to change how we build housing. I don’t know if modular housing is really the answer. But it’s worth trying.\n\nEzra Klein is a New York Times columnist.","summary":"Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector rose by more than 900% while it fell for homebuilding.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/29/klein-heres-how-bad-the-u-s-housing-crisis-is-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/OCR-L-PALOMA-0910-JG-02-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 11:15:01","author":"Ezra Klein","authors":["Ezra Klein"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":383273778,"title":"White House Launches “Media Offender of the Week” Section on Its Website","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 28, 2025 9:31pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nDonald Trump\n\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nGoogle Preferred\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nSend an Email\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nThe White House on Friday debuted a new section on its website dedicated to what it’s dubbing the “Media Offender of the Week.”\n\nThe page features the heading “Misleading. Biased. Exposed.” followed by a list of outlets and reporters who made the list. CBS News, The Boston Globe and The Independent were the first news outlets cited on the new web page.\n\nThe site claimed that the news organizations were cited for reporting that “misrepresents and exaggerates President Trump’s calls for Democrat accountability.” Specifically, the White House is accusing the outlets for misrepresenting “Trump’s call for members of Congress to be held accountable for inciting sedition by saying that he called for their ‘execution.'” \n\nRelated Stories\n\nRyan Lizza Claims Olivia Nuzzi Would Share \"Opposition Research\" With Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nFox News Promotes Bill Melugin to Congressional Correspondent\n\nThe coverage in question centered on a video in which Sen. Mark Kelly and five other members of Congress told troops they can disobey illegal orders and reminded them they had sworn to uphold the Constitution.\n\nIn response, Trump posted on Truth Social that was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.” He added: “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” He also posted that their comments were “punishable by DEATH!” and declared: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n\nThe new White House page claims that the truth is as follows: “The Democrats and Fake News Media subversively implied that President Trump had issued illegal orders to service members. Every order President Trump has issued has been lawful. It is dangerous for sitting Members of Congress to incite insubordination in the United States’ military, and President Trump called for them to be held accountable.”\n\nIt went on to add two key points: \n\n“Democrats released a video calling for service members to disobey their chain of command, and in turn, implied President Trump had issued illegal orders.”\n\n“President Trump has never issued an illegal order. The Fake News knew that, but ran with the story anyway.”\n\nThe page also features an “Offender Hall of Shame” that includes The Washington Post, CBS News (again), CNN and MSNBC (recently rebranded as MS NOW), citing their coverage of various events. In its coverage of the new webpage, The Washington Post quoted an internal spokesperson who said: “The Washington Post is proud of its accurate, rigorous journalism.” The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to CBS News for comment.\n\nThe page also names several “repeat offenders” who “don’t just get it wrong – they do it over and over again.” This section includes the likes of Axios, The New York Times, KTLA Los Angeles, People, Politico, The Los Angeles Times, The Daily Beast, The Hill, BBC, ABC News, USA Today and more. There’s also a section where readers can select one of those outlets from a drop-down menu to see the specific “offense” of which they are being accused.\n\nInterestingly, the admonishment of CBS News comes just a few weeks after Trump praised the company’s new leadership — CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss and Paramount CEO David Ellison — in a 60 Minutes interview. In the interview, he alluded to his recent lawsuit against Paramount Global over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The lawsuit resulted in Paramount Global settling in a $16 million payout. Part of the settlement agreement included stipulations for Paramount to release 60 Minutes transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates post-air.\n\n“And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” Trump said in the interview. “And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not — you have a great — I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great, from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening.… I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nGuy Pearce Apologizes After Reportedly Sharing Antisemitic Posts on Social Media \n\nFuzzy Zoeller, Golf Champion Haunted by Racist Joke About Tiger Woods, Dies at 74\n\nRobert F.

Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 8 into law, which requires every Texas sheriff’s office with a jail to sign a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Sheriff’s offices must sign into the agreement by Dec. 1, 2026, under the bill. \n\nFive law enforcement agencies in North Texas have joined the program. Statewide, at least 169 agencies have signed such agreements. \n\nHere is a list of North Texas agencies who have 287(g) agreements. \n\nDenton County sheriff’s office \n\nThe Denton County sheriff’s office entered into the agreement with ICE on July 29. \n\nDenton County joined the jail enforcement model, allowing selected officers to investigate, interview and detain individuals who are at the jail after being charged with a crime. \n\nDenton County Sheriff Tracy Murphree spoke in front Denton County Commissioner’s Court on Feb. 11 as commissioners considered whether they should approve an agreement. \n\nMurphree said he attempted to join the 287(g) program a few years ago. However, after President Joe Biden was elected in 2020, his administration stopped approving agencies from partnering with the federal government. \n\nShortly after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election, Murphree said he was approached to ask if the sheriff’s office would like to join the program. Without the agreement, Murphree said, a sheriff’s deputy would have to call an ICE employee if someone who is arrested for a local crime is also an undocumented immigrant. \n\n“My folks will be able to put that detainer on them because they’ll have access to them immediately when they come in because they’ll have access to all those records,” Murphree told commissioners. \n\nEllis County sheriff’s office \n\nThe sheriff’s office joined the jail enforcement model on April 16. \n\nWhile a candidate for sheriff in 2020, Brad Norman told a local media outlet he would sign a 287(g) agreement in order to help find undocumented migrants. \n\n“I do not support illegal immigration,” Norman told The Waxahachie Sun. “If you came into this country illegally and you have broken the law, you should be removed.” \n\nNorman acknowledged that enforcing federal immigration laws was the primary responsibility of the federal government, he believed the Sheriff’s Office could “be part of the regional solution to a National problem without undue burden to the taxpayers” by checking an individual’s immigration status when they are booked into the jail. \n\nNorman did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. \n\nKeller Police Department \n\nOne of the few police departments in Texas to have a 287(g) agreement, Keller police joined the program following unanimous approval from the City Council in August. \n\nKeller Mayor Armin Mizani, who is running for the Texas House, wrote in a July 17 letter that public safety in Keller was not “up for negotiation.” \n\nThe City Council approved the jail enforcement agreement on Aug. 5. Multiple residents at the meeting spoke in opposition to the agreement. The program is only enforced at the Keller Regional Detention Center, a holding facility for Keller and other surrounding cities. \n\nAfter the City Council approved the program, the Police Department released a statement saying its employees were committed to “enforcing the rule of law” and they would need to make minor adjustments. \n\n“Opting into this program will mean minor adjustments to the responsibilities of our detention officers, but our department’s priorities and philosophies will remain unchanged,” the statement said. \n\nRockwall County sheriff’s office\n\nRockwall County sheriff’s office first joined the 287(g) program in June 2020 — toward the end of Trump’s first term. They agreed to implement the jail enforcement model. \n\nOnce Trump took office for his second term, the sheriff’s office joined the warrant service officer model and task enforcement model. \n\nThe warrant officer model is also only enforced at jails and limits local officers to serving immigration warrants to prisoners. Officers cannot investigate an individual’s immigration status.\n\nThe third model the sheriff’s office joined was the task force model. That model was ended in 2012 by the Obama administration. A 2011 Justice Department investigation into the Maricopa County sheriff’s office, in Arizona, found that the department had engaged in “unconstitutional policing” by unfairly targeting Latinos. \n\nThe task force model authorizes assigned patrol officers to question and arrest individuals suspected of violating immigration laws. ICE is responsible for training the officers.\n\nReached for comment, Rockwall County Sheriff Terry Garrett said in an email that all three models “provide tools useful at various levels of an investigation.” \n\nTarrant County sheriff’s office\n\nTarrant County also joined the program during the first Trump administration. \n\nTarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn was among the sheriffs who testified in front of the Texas Senate State Affairs Committee earlier this year when lawmakers were considering SB 8. \n\n“The jail model does make our communities safer,” Waybourn said. “It does get another set of eyes on things to make sure people don’t slip through the cracks and that it is targeting criminals. It has worked out very well for us.”","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2025/11/25/here-are-the-north-texas-law-enforcement-agencies-that-have-agreements-with-ice/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/WMPEFSE4SFBCTEE4ZHUB22D7JA.jpg?auth=e34f83d9961135e929c456883aa4768850c529c71e0dd1282607d1381d465503&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 03:03:26","author":"Aarón Torres","authors":["Aarón Torres"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":383254330,"title":"Katy Perry Gets $2 Million After Suing Dying 85-Year-Old Veteran Over Real Estate Dispute","text":"Pop superstar Katy Perry has won $2 million in a protracted property battle by filing a lawsuit against 85-year-old Army veteran Carl Westcott, who is now bedridden with Huntington's disease and receiving hospice care.\n\nPerry's legal action, detailed in court filings reviewed by the New York Post, sought more than $8 million in damages from Westcott, including $3.25 million for lost rental income during the litigation, $2.2 million for property renovations and $3 million in attorney fees. The dispute centers on an eight-bedroom estate in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, where Perry and her then-boyfriend, actor Orlando Bloom, acquired the property in July 2020 for $15 million.\n\nPerry and Bloom penned a personal note to Westcott imploring him to accept their bid.\n\n\"We're expecting a baby next month and think this home is the perfect place to welcome her,\" the couple wrote, according to court documents. Days after signing, Westcott, then 81 and recovering from back surgery on pain medication, attempted to rescind the deal, claiming diminished mental capacity. Westcott's condition has deteriorated sharply since, with the neurodegenerative Huntington's disease eroding his cognitive functions and confining him to bed.\n\nHis son, Court Westcott, blamed the stress of the litigation for accelerating his father's decline, saying the case has \"devastated his health and spirit.” However, a Santa Barbara County Superior Court judge rejected that argument in 2023, ruling that Westcott failed to substantiate his incapacity.\n\nPerry's legal team further alleged that Westcott had entertained a competing offer from Maria Shriver, the former wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nRuling in her favor, LA County Superior Court Judge Joseph Lipner awarded Perry $2.8 million for lost rental value and $260,000 for repair of water damage and fallen trees - but deducted $1 million from the total award because he said Perry could have invested her money elsewhere, while Westcott lost interest on the same amount. \n\n“The optics of a millionaire pop star demanding hefty damages from a very ill man are terrible,” PR strategist Abesi Manyando told The Telegraph. “This isn’t just a lawsuit, it’s now a David and Goliath narrative – a global superstar with wealth, legal resources and leverage versus an elderly, declining veteran who already lost his home. And that dynamic carries emotional weight.”\n\nIt is not the first time Perry has been embroiled in a high-profile legal fight involving real estate. In 2018, Sister Catherine Rose Holzman, an 89-year-old nun, collapsed and died in a Los Angeles courtroom during a hearing tied to Perry’s attempted purchase of a former convent from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The nuns had opposed the sale to the singer, arguing the property belonged to their order; Holzman’s last public words before her fatal collapse were directed at Perry were, “To Katy Perry, please stop.”\n\nPerry, a prominent Democrat supporter who performed at President Joe Biden’s 2021 inauguration and campaigned for Vice President and failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, has recently been linked romantically to former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/katy-perry-gets-2-million-after-suing-dying-85-year-old-veteran-over-real-estate-dispute","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/katy%20perry%201.jpg?itok=jjFdokJ2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 02:30:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":383240764,"title":"Letters: We must keep pressure on lawless ICE agents","text":"Keep pressure on\nlawless ICE agents\n\nMany of us are sickened by the ongoing inhumane treatment of immigrants and others by ICE.\n\nEvery day, there are headlines about ICE’s violent treatment of innocent people. Anyone who still believes these assaults are directed toward criminals is choosing to remain ignorant. There’s overwhelming evidence that ICE routinely detains people solely due to the color of their skin, and without warrants. The trauma and destruction caused by these unconstitutional detainments include deaths, sexual abuse and neglect in ICE custody; denial of due process rights; the disappearances of hundreds after the closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’; and assaults on peaceful protesters.\n\nAs a Catholic, I note that Pope Leo XIV stated that being “pro-life” should include opposition to the inhumane treatment of immigrants.

In both 2016 and 2024, we elected Donald Trump over much more experienced women, who believed in the rule of law and our democracy. While I volunteered for the Kamala Harris campaign in 2024, our country is simply not yet ready for a woman leader, as more enlightened countries such as India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel and Great Britain have shown themselves to be.\n\nGiven the apparent misogynistic nature of the American voters, let’s not repeat the mistakes of 2016 and 2024.\n\nUkraine peace plan\nfavors the invaders\n\nRe: “Trump offers a Ukraine peace plan Kremlin can love” (Page A4, Nov. 23).\n\nThe word is that Russia is in on a full war production level and showing it by an atmospheric rain of drones on civilian and energy targets. I have never understood the timid arms policy that forbids Ukraine from having weapons with mileage into Russia. Vladimir Putin understands force only. Is Donald Trump so dazzled by the vision of a Nobel Peace Prize that the art of the deal and the cards Trump holds created this outrageous peace plan?\n\nThis is worse than the Munich Deal that led to WWII. To give up even more land on its Black Sea ports, considering Russia’s efforts to blockade grain shipments, would be disastrous. To limit its army to 600,000, forbid NATO membership, and not allow long-range weapons is another gift to dictator Putin, who feeds on such rewards, like Crimea he took in 2014.\n\nIt’s time for Congress to wake up.\n\nDavid Eisbach","summary":"Also: Include all &#124; Prosecute lawbreakers &#124; Put victory first &#124; Favoring Putin.

Trump, 79, did not mince words as he directed a slur at Walz and questioned the legal status of Representative Ilhan Omar, sparking immediate backlash from leaders and residents across the state.Trump's 'Retarded' Slur Sparks OutrageThe President's message centred on a direct and offensive attack against Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who recently ran alongside Kamala Harris in her failed presidential bid. In a statement that stunned political observers for its crudeness, Trump referred to the governor as 'seriously retarded', a slur widely condemned by disability advocates. He accused Walz of negligence, claiming the governor allowed 'Somalian gangs' to terrorise residents.'The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,' Trump wrote in the blistering post.This language marks a significant departure from standard political discourse, using a term that has long been recognised as hate speech against people with intellectual disabilities. The attack appears to be part of a broader strategy to delegitimise Walz's leadership in Minnesota, a state Trump has frequently targeted in his political rallies.Attacks on Ilhan Omar and Somali ResidentsTrump's invective did not stop at Tim Walz; he also launched a racially charged attack on Representative Ilhan Omar and the broader Somali community in Minnesota.He described Omar, a frequent target of his ire, as the 'worst \"Congressman/woman in our country and mocked her religious attire, stating she is 'always wrapped in her swaddling hijab. Going further, Trump cast doubt on her citizenship without evidence, claiming the Somali-born lawmaker probably came into the USA illegally'.These comments were paired with baseless assertions about the safety of Minnesota's streets. Trump painted a dystopian picture of the state, alleging that 'Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for \"prey\" as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone'.This rhetoric comes just days after Trump ordered a review of all green cards from Somalia and 18 other nations. He also threatened to terminate temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, a move that would affect thousands of legal residents in a state that is home to roughly 80,000 Somali people—the largest such population in the US.Walz Hits Back at Mental FitnessGovernor Tim Walz wasted little time in responding to the insults, though he chose to pivot the conversation away from the slur and towards Trump's own fitness for office. Rather than engaging in a war of words over the specific insults, Walz challenged the transparency of Trump's recent medical claims.'Release the MRI results,' Walz posted on X, a direct reference to Trump's recent assertion that a medical checkup had returned 'perfect' results.This retort highlights a growing Democratic strategy of questioning the 79-year-old president's cognitive health, turning his own attacks on competency back against him. When reached for further comment by local media, Walz's office directed reporters back to this social media post, letting the brevity of the response speak for itself.Immigration Policy Shifts and 'Reverse Migration'The context for this outburst appears to be a recent violent incident in Washington, DC, involving a 29-year-old Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members.The suspect, who had previously worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, has been charged in an attack that left one service member dead and another critically wounded.Seizing on this tragedy, Trump used his Thanksgiving message to call for drastic changes to US immigration policy. He vowed to 'permanently pause migration' from poorer nations and introduced the concept of 'reverse migration' as a necessary solution.'Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,' Trump declared.He later expanded on this threat, stating he would suspend immigration 'from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to recover fully'.However, the President provided no details on how such a sweeping policy would be implemented, nor did he specify which nations would be classified under this designation.The message concluded with a jarring shift in tone, offering a holiday greeting that excluded his political enemies.

Here are the top political turkeys ripped by conservatives in the past year. Chuck Schumer Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has received scorching criticisms from Republicans and Democrats alike in the wake of a 43-day government shutdown that left Democrats empty-handed. Democrats led by Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had refused to advance spending legislation to keep the government open past Oct. 1 without first considering extensions to supplemental funding for Obamacare. But by the end of a painful and highly visible shutdown — the longest in the country’s history — Republicans had rebuffed efforts to negotiate over the subsidies. Without an off-ramp or negotiating strategy, even the chamber’s most progressive members expressed doubts about continuing the shutdown. \"I just don’t get what the point is of delaying even longer,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said just moments after a key vote to reopen the government cleared the Senate. Many Democrats in and out of Congress blamed Schumer for failing to either keep Democrats united in their standoff over the subsidies or for failing to deliver on some other sort of concession. Across both chambers on Capitol Hill, Schumer faces questions about his continued role as the party's leader in the Senate. CHUCK SCHUMER BECOMES TOP TARGET FROM MEDIA PERSONALITIES AMID SHUTDOWN FALLOUT Kamala Harris The country’s worst kept secret got a fresh coat of paint in 2025 when a groundbreaking book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson took readers behind the scenes of President Joe Biden’s physical decline — and the effort to hide it. Questions about what Vice President Kamala Harris knew about Biden’s cognitive state rebounded in the wake of the book’s publication. Harris — who maintains that Biden could have served out another term — would eventually take his place as the Democrat on the ticket in 2024. At the time, Harris’ stand-in for Biden was seen by many in the party as the obvious choice. But that view soured later when President Donald Trump stormed to victory in November and questions arose about whether Harris should have joined the calls for Biden to step down. KAMALA HARRIS DOESN'T RULE OUT ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN NEW INTERVIEW: ‘I AM NOT DONE’ The autopen The presidential walk of fame at the White House features portraits of every president — except one. Instead of President Joe Biden, the Trump administration put up a picture of an autopen, a device used to mimic the signature of someone else, symbolizing President Joe Biden’s reliance on his inner circle to make presidential-level decisions. The House of Representatives launched an investigation into just how much of his power Biden decided to delegate. In a report put out in October, the House Oversight Committee slammed the Biden administration for what it called \"invalid executive actions.\" \"The report exposes how President Joe Biden’s top advisors, political operatives, and personal physician concealed the President’s mental and physical decline from the American people. The findings reveal that as President Biden’s condition deteriorated, his aides exercised presidential authority and facilitated executive actions without his direct authorization,\" the report states. Questions remain about just how far Biden's use of the autopen went and whether the legal standing of sensitive decisions like pardons could receive a second look. Andrew Cuomo The former governor of New York attempted a political comeback in 2025 by running for New York City mayor. The bid, which came after disastrous management of the state’s nursing home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations during his time as governor, did little to improve his political standing. Cuomo failed to capture the Democratic Party nomination, ultimately losing out to Zohran Mamdani by 7.7 percentage points. Refusing to call it quits, Cuomo launched an independent campaign. There, Cuomo again fell behind Mamdani — this time by almost nine points. In addition to a personal loss, Cuomo’s defeat dovetails with questions about whether more traditional Democrats can still compete with the vision offered by far-left figures in the party. \"This campaign was necessary to make that point – a caution flag that we are heading down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said in his concession speech. \"Well, we made that point, and they heard us, and we will hold them to it.\" FROM AOC TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, THE DEMOCRATS ARE PEDDLING FAR-LEFT POLITICS Chuck Schumer — again Schumer’s woes over the shutdown weren’t the only sore spot for the Senate minority leader in the last few months. The meteoric rise of Zohran Mamdani put this year’s biggest political turkey in a pressure cooker he could not escape. He first faced questions about Mamdani in the lead up to the New York mayoral primary. Then reporters began to ask him if he would endorse Mamdani after the self-proclaimed socialist secured the Democratic nomination. And even in the closing days of the race, Schumer faced questions about whether he had made a decision to support the race’s clear front-runner. Through it all, Schumer gave the same non-answer. \"Look, the bottom line is very simple. I have a good relationship with him, and we’re continuing to talk,\" Schumer told reporters less than a week out from the election. While other Democrats, including Jeffries, also delayed in giving responses about Mamdani, Schumer’s refusal to speak on the New York City Mayoral race stands out. Schumer’s dismissal of the topic fueled questions about the direction of the Democratic Party and whether its congressional factions could play along with the momentum of its leftward flank.

He used derogatory language to refer to Walz and accused Omar of engaging in incest, all while proposing an extreme solution for handling illegal immigration.\n\nFollowing an incident earlier in the week where two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House, Trump took to Truth Social to declare his intention to halt all immigration from what he termed ‘third world’ countries. Tragically, one of the soldiers, Sarah Beckstrom, succumbed to her injuries on Thanksgiving.\n\nTrump further alleged that Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and former running mate of Kamala Harris, has permitted an influx of Somali migrants who, according to Trump, terrorize the local population.\n\n“Somalian gangs are roaming the streets, searching for victims while our wonderful citizens remain confined in their homes, praying for safety,” Trump expressed in his post on Truth Social.\n\nHe continued by labeling Governor Walz as “seriously retarded,” attributing his inaction to either fear, incompetence, or both.\n\nTurning his focus to Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota, Trump mocked her traditional attire and made unfounded claims about her immigration status, suggesting she entered the U.S. unlawfully by marrying her brother.\n\n‘Probably came into the USA. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated.’\n\nThe president ended his rant by vowing to ‘cure’ the issue of migration with ‘reverse migration,’ claiming ‘disruptive populations’ were admitted into the US via Joe Biden’s ‘illegal autopen approval.’\n\n‘Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.

All the speakers contributed something to show how important the former vice president was to our country and to his family. None used the occasion as a platform to attack political opponents. All the living former vice presidents were invited, whether Democrat or Republican (kudos to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Al Gore for attending).\n\nAs Shakespeare’s Antony said of the deceased Brutus, one could say of the great Cheney, “This was a man!”\n\nJoe B.

It took the city and City Council years to let this iconic building decline through poor maintenance management. The time spent on further review is minor in comparison. \n\nThe citizens of Dallas deserve the right to be a part of the best decision for our city. Citizens have got to stop the city leaders’ and council members’ continuing to spend money to cover up management ineptness.\n\nDiane C. Gentile, Dallas\n\nPreferential access\n\nRe: “AP, administration continue fight over access,” Tuesday news story.\n\nI found this article interesting. The Associated Press is suing the administration because of limited access in small Trump press meetings. It seems reasonable to me that if President Donald Trump is holding a press conference in the Oval Office or on Air Force One and has limited space, he would give preferential access to a news outlet that perhaps will write more positive articles about him or his administration, which is extremely unlikely of the AP. After all, there is limited space. \n\nI read The Dallas Morning News daily and have yet to read anything but negative, slanted articles from The Associated Press that pertain to the president. I don’t expect all to be positive, but the president has done a lot of good that the reader never hears about from the AP. What is wrong with “fair and balanced”?\n\nLynda H. Leake, Dallas/Uptown\n\nSpecies decline\n\nIt was disheartening to learn that the Interior Department is rolling back rules for preserving endangered species and their environments. When you consider that the only life we know of to date is on this planet, all forms of life on Earth are incredibly precious and rare. \n\nBecause of human industrialization and massive population growth, we have been losing species at a rate that mirrors some of the greatest mass extinctions in geologic history. To undercut the modest efforts we make to slow this downward spiral for the sake of enabling easier human development in critical habitats is incredibly short-sighted. \n\nThe ecosystems of our world are being knocked out of balance. As species die off, the natural processes that provide for us die off with them. The serious decline of pollinating bees necessary to produce the crops we need is a clear example. \n\nWe need our Congress to assert its responsibility to counter the administration’s efforts to put profits before the long-term health of our ecosystems by preserving and expanding the Endangered Species Act. Contact your senators and your representatives and urge them to act.\n\nJim Brady, Dallas\n\nI’ll throw in depository building\n\nRe: “Put Epstein in the rearview,” by Jimmie George, Sunday Letters.\n\nThe author of this letter says that it’s time to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein matter because there’s nothing new and important to be learned. On the other hand, the letter states, “And if you believe he committed suicide, I’ll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge at a good price.”\n\nIf the author believes so adamantly that Epstein didn’t commit suicide, which was only a little over six years ago, that means whoever planned his demise (i.e., murder) is probably still alive. That, in turn, means there’s evidently a big cover-up going on, not just about his murder, but regarding those who were Epstein’s accomplices in committing the heinous crimes he and Ghislaine Maxwell committed.\n\nIf you believe there’s no reason to uncover the truth — and it’s not just the majority of Democrats, but also Republicans and independents who want it — I’ll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge and throw in the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nLarry Postel, Dallas\n\nIf AI runs rampant\n\nRe: “The AI Kids Are Not Alright,” by Javier E. David, Sunday Business.\n\nSpot on! Until we realize the full extent of letting AI run rampant in business, government and the arts, I highly recommend one read Ira Levin’s novel, This Perfect Day. If this doesn’t open your eyes to AI utopia, nothing will.\n\nJohn Eggen, Red Oak\n\nSchool choice\n\nRe: “Schools wane as population swells,” Sunday Metro story.\n\nThe last part of this excellent article, which lays out the problems facing government schools with declining enrollment, says it all: “Experts [which ones?] say public schools need to start getting creative. ... The school districts are really going to need to really promote their success, and that’s kind of a new thing for school districts.” \n\nAmen and right on. Government schools had a monopoly on public education from the 1700s, starting in Massachusetts. Parents, aka taxpayers, now have choices that will bring competition to be the best school.\n\nDoug Caldwell, Plano","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2025/11/28/letters-to-the-editor-cheney-city-hall-ap-endangered-species-epstein-ai-schools/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LZIQBJLIMFEELOABR7B7MRWE4Y.jpg?auth=c679311146d4c21303694e0cb9b4674520a2897748bbc1fb654a01b88bbd1662&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 18:26:15","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":383159250,"title":"MIKEY SMITH: 8 unhinged Donald Trump moments as he lashes out at another female reporter","text":"In the dead of last night Donald Trump made an announcement that could set the tone for the rest of his presidency. In the wake of the murder of one, and grave injury of a second National Guard troop patrolling the streets of Downtown Washington DC on his orders, Trump is ramping up his purge of foreign born people in the United States. In a statement on Truth Social last night, he said his ban-hammer would no longer be confined to people who entered the country illegally. Nor will it only be for people who share the Afghan background of the alleged shooter, nor just people who came in under the refugee programme from that country. No, he's repeatedly taken aim at the Somali community in Minnesota, almost all of whom are legal residents - and many of whom are citizens. Why? Because they're from - and I'm using his words here - a \"third world country\". He confirmed neither a green card nor citizenship would be an exemption from his purge. And he said those who should be worried are people who \"undermine domestic tranquility\", who are \"a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilisation.\" Which sounds awfully broad and open to some pretty bad-faith interpretation. Pretty racist too, if we're counting. Meanwhile in Trumpworld Here's everything you need to know Donald Trump announced a huge ramp-up in his plan for mass deportations of even legal migrants to the US in response to the Washington DC shooting. The attack, which left one National Guard troop dead and another fighting for his life, was allegedly committed by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national allowed into the US following the fall of Kabul in 2021. But in a late-night flurry of posts on Truth Social, he confirmed his response would not be restricted to those he held responsible for the shooting - but to any migrant community he feels is \"undermining\" America. \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,\" he wrote. \"Other than that HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for - you won't be here for long!\" Using the outdated term \"third world countries\", the US President announced a \"pause\" on migration from certain parts of the world - during which the US would seek to remove anyone who is not a \"net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.\" Using the outdated term \"third world countries\", the US President announced a \"pause\" on migration from certain parts of the world - during which the US would seek to remove anyone who is not a \"net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.\" He said all federal benefits to non-citizens would be scrapped, and that even citizens could have their status revoked if they \"undermine domestic tranquility.\" He went on to say his plan for mass deportations would be expanded to include \"any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\" Trump confirmed specifically that those who hold \"green card\" permanent residency status would not be exempt from the purge. Every time Trump has addressed the shootings since Wednesday afternoon, Trump has started out by blaming the Afghan community, before quickly swerving to attack Somali people in Minnesota. In his Truth Social screed last night he said Minnesota governor Tim Walz - who was Kamala Harris' running mate in 2024 - was \"seriously retarded\" for allowing a Somalian community to \"completely take over his state. This is untrue. Around 80,000 Somali people live in Minnesota, out of a population of 5.7 million people - making them less than 1.5% of the total. Even in the large 'Twin Cities' area of Minneapolis, St Paul and Bloomington, where the vast majority of Somali Minnesotans live, they make up just 1.7% of the population. He launched a horrific, racist attack on Ilhan Omar, a sitting member of Congress from Minnesota with a Somali background, saying she was \"always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the USA illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how \"badly\" she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country.\" Ms Omar came to the US with her family, who legally claimed asylum in 1995, when she was 14. She became a US citizen in 2000, when she was 17. She was not married when she was granted citizenship. Trump gave a Q&A after speaking by video link to serving troops last night. He was asked what Somali people had to do with the shooting. He admitted: \"Nothing.\" But he went on: \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble, they're ripping us off for a lot of money, there's a tremendous amount of money going back to Somalia. What the hell are we paying money to Somalia for? But they're ripping off our country at a level that few people have been able to see before.\" He then repeated some of his attacks on Ms Omar. Because it's basically breathing at this point. Asked if he was going to attend the funeral of murdered National Guard troop Sarah Beckstrom, Trump replied: \"I haven't thought about it yet, but it's certainly something I can conceive of. I love West Virginia. You know, I won West Virginia by one of the biggest margins of any president anywhere.\" Trump, as we know, does not like to be bothered with reality and facts. So when a reporter noted that Homeland Security officials had confirmed the alleged DC shooter had worked \"very closely with the CIA for years\", was vetted and came up clean - he did not enjoy that. He replied: \"He went cuckoo. He went nuts. And that happens too. It happens too often with these people. You see them. But, er, look. This is how they came in.\" He raised up a printed out photo of a full planeload of Afghans - many of them interpreters and fixers for US troops stationed in Afghanistan - being rescued from the Taliban. He continued: \"This is how they come in. They're standing on top of each other. That's an airplane. There was no vetting. They came in un-vetted. We have a lot of others in this country but we're going to get them out. They go cookoo.\" In fact, the refugees were not standing on top of each other. The 640 or so people on the US Air Force C17 aircraft pictured were seated on the floor of the aircraft using a procedure known as \"floor loading\", where cargo straps are run from wall to wall in the plane's hold for passengers to hang on to as makeshift seatbelts. Trump liked it even less when she pointed out that the Department of Justice's Inspector General just reported that there was \"thorough vetting of Afghans who were brought into the US.\" \"Are you stupid?\" He barked at the diligent reporter. \"Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person. And there's a law passed that makes it almost impossible to get them out. You can't get them out once they come in. And they came in, and they were unvetted. They were unchecked. There were many of them, and they came in on big planes and it was disgraceful.\" Every element of that answer is untrue, with one exception: They were indeed big planes. At the same event, Trump was asked to confirm that it was his administration that granted the alleged shooter asylum. Trump replied: \"When it comes to asylum, when they're flown in, it's very hard to get them out. No matter how you want to do it it's very hard to get them out. But we're going to be getting them all out now.\" With that, he thumped the table, presumably in celebration of not actually admitting that yes, it was his administration that vetted and granted the alleged shooter asylum seven months ago, and wrapped up the session. Since the campaign, Trump has made an increasingly preposterous claim about the number of illegal migrants who were allowed into the US during Joe Biden's presidency. The number varies from time to time, but the most common version is that \"20 million\" people entered the US illegally over the four years Biden was president. Trump repeats this at least once a week, and it's always been nonsense. He said: \"The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census)\" This is pretty close to true. The actual figure from the Census bureau is 51.3 millon, which is up from 45.2 million when Trump was last in office. That figure counts foreign born citizens and non-citizens - which would also include any surveyed undocumented people. So if the total foreign born population went up by 6.1 million, despite 20 million coming in illegally, then 13.9 million would have had to leave during the same time period. 13 million people is about one in 24 of the US population. That's the kind of population turnover that gets noticed.","summary":"Trump last night made an announcement that could set the tone for the rest of his presidency, as he ramps up his purge of foreign-born people in the US","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-8-unhinged-donald-36324778","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36324755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Trump-25332039406057.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 17:26:30","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":383151810,"title":"Walz hits back at Trump with four-word taunt after president’s mental health slur","text":"Governor Tim Walz has hit back at Donald Trump after the president used a mental health slur against him in a Thanksgiving rant. \n\nTrump’s post began by telling Americans to have a happy Thanksgiving but then segued into a series of attacks, against the politically correct, migrants, refugees and eventually Walz. \n\nThe president using a slur that criticised the former Democratic vice-presidential candidate’s decision-making abilities. “Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,” he added, before he turned his attention to frequent MAGA target Ilhan Omar. \n\nWalz turned the attention back to Trump’s own mental acuity with his brief clap-back. \n\nPosting a screenshot of Trump’s rant to his X account, Kamala Harris’ former running mate responding with “release the MRI results” in reference to the president’s recent test. \n\nEarlier in November, Trump said he received a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam as part of his recent physical, saying it was “very standard”. \n\n“Getting an MRI is very standard.

Robert Garcia of Long Beach could represent conservative Orange County cities if reelected","text":"A day after California voters passed Proposition 50, Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Long Beach whose district stands to gain more Republican voters than any other House member under the new congressional maps, pledged to represent all constituents in what will be California’s new 42nd Congressional District if he’s reelected.\n\n“Regardless of political parties — I’ll represent everyone. And there’s great people and neighborhoods all across the new district,” Garcia wrote in a Nov. 5 social media post.\n\nThe hoopla surrounding the 42nd Congressional District isn’t just that Garcia will be running in an area that will look vastly different from what it does today.\n\nIt’s that the openly gay, progressive liberal who, up to this point, has represented a heavily Democratic district in deep-blue Los Angeles County, would be the lawmaker for some of Orange County’s most conservative coastal communities, including Huntington Beach and part of Newport Beach, if reelected.\n\nIn 2023, the Huntington Beach City Council voted to allow only government and various military flags to fly on city-owned property. Critics viewed the ban on non-government banners as a way to keep the Pride flag — a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community — from being displayed.\n\nAnd the city, where all seven City Council members are Republicans, is also where President Donald Trump received over 9,500 more votes than former Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election, according to the California secretary of state’s office.\n\nTrump also won in Newport Beach, where he received over 8,300 more votes than Harris last year. (Trump ultimately lost not only California but also Orange County as a whole in 2024.)\n\nGarcia, on the other hand, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. As the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, he’s relentlessly pursued the full release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. And just this week, he led a congressional hearing into alleged misconduct by federal immigration agents carrying out Trump’s mass deportation policy.\n\nAlthough voters in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach tend to be more conservative than Long Beach, Garcia said there are still plenty of people who care about issues that he also finds important.\n\n“Yes, there’s a lot more conservative folks here,” Garcia acknowledged over a lunch of salmon fish tacos and iced tea at Duke’s restaurant in Huntington Beach this week. “There’s also a ton of Democrats and progressives here.”\n\n“And,” Garcia continued, “there’s a ton of people that are independent that oppose Donald Trump’s plan to open up the Huntington Beach coast, the Newport (Beach) coast, the Seal Beach coast to new oil rigs. Those are issues that we’re going to hopefully find common ground on.”\n\nCurrently, the 42nd Congressional District, which Garcia was first elected to represent in 2022, lies entirely within L.A. County. It stretches north from Long Beach and includes some communities in southeast L.A. County, including Lakewood, Downey and Huntington Park.\n\nBut under the new map expected to take effect with next year’s midterm elections, the district would lose those communities in southeast L.A. County and instead swing south, picking up at least portions of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa in Orange County.\n\nThe current 42nd Congressional District includes 53% registered Democratic voters as well as 18% Republican voters and 23% no party preference or other. With next year’s changes, the district will include 40% registered Democratic voters, 30% Republican and 28% no party preference or other.\n\nIt’s not that the Orange County cities that will be folded into the 42nd Congressional District haven’t been represented by a Democrat before.\n\nTheir current congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, is a Democrat. So was Katie Porter, who served before Min.\n\nBut as Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns puts it: Porter and Min were elected based on a congressional map drawn by an independent redistricting commission and under a nonpartisan system that California voters previously approved.\n\nYet that’s just one issue Burns has about Huntington Beach possibly being represented by Garcia under the new map. He’s also worried that Garcia’s ideas for the city won’t align with what residents truly want.\n\nOver the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats proposed a mid-decade redistricting effort to position California Democrats to pick up five additional House seats in the 2026 midterm elections as a counter to similar gerrymandering efforts by GOP-led states.\n\nThat effort led to voters adopting new, gerrymandered maps for California in a special election a few weeks ago. The maps are being challenged in court as unconstitutional by California Republicans and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans in some of Orange County’s more conservative, lower-density communities continue to balk at the idea of being lumped into the same district as Long Beach, a much more liberal, urban community in L.A. County.\n\nGarcia is well aware that his political views and the views of some of his potentially new constituents won’t always line up.\n\nHis strategy is to find areas of common interest upon which he’d advocate for, such as coastal preservation, investments in infrastructure and support for small local businesses.\n\n“We’re not always going to agree on every issue, and that’s fine,” he said.\n\nBut, Garcia said, “I want Huntington Beach, Newport, Seal, communities on the coast to look back and say, ‘Damn, Robert Garcia is bringing us more federal resources to help our budgets than anyone we’ve ever had,’” he said.\n\nHuntington Beach Mayor Pro Tem Casey McKeon, who will be sworn in as mayor next week, said many residents in the city remain skeptical about representation under the new congressional maps.\n\nHe did not want to speculate who would win the 42nd Congressional District race next year but said he’s willing to keep an open mind should Garcia be elected to represent Huntington Beach.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who the representative is,” said McKeon. “We would expect our congressional representative to work on projects that affect Huntington Beach.”\n\nFor example, he hopes whoever is elected to represent the city after the midterm elections will advocate for federal funding for sand replenishment projects.\n\n“It shouldn’t matter (the) political lines,” he said. “I hope to have a good relationship with our representative in Congress.”\n\nBurns, the outgoing mayor of Huntington Beach, is wary that being lumped into the same congressional district as Long Beach will mean that voters there will overshadow those from smaller communities and likely elect someone with a more urban mindset.\n\nLong Beach is the seventh most populous city in California, with some neighborhoods boasting mid-rise and high-rise apartments and condos. That sort of high-density living is a stark contrast to Huntington Beach, Burns said.\n\n“Long Beach is quite different,” Burns said. “Is he (Garcia) going to represent us in a Huntington Beach manner, or does he have his own ideals of what he thinks Huntington Beach should be? We’re obviously more conservative than he has shown. Hopefully, he will be respectful of those values and help us live those values.”\n\nAlthough Burns was an officer with the Long Beach Police Department when Garcia was mayor, it’s been a long time since the two have crossed paths, both men said.\n\n“We have different political perspectives, but I respect his service as a Long Beach police officer,” Garcia said.\n\nThe congressmember also said that some of his college friends now live in Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, and he considers himself fairly familiar with what will be the new 42nd Congressional District.\n\nIn addition, he said he’s been to the homes of some Huntington Beach residents who invited him to meet with small business owners and community members to hear their perspectives.\n\nHaving served on the Long Beach City Council and as mayor there for eight years before being elected to Congress, Garcia said he understands the fiscal challenges local municipalities face and that basic quality-of-life issues like sidewalk maintenance still matter. He intends to advocate on such issues, he said.\n\nJust don’t expect the congressmember to pull a 180 on his political stances, whether it’s about LGBTQ+ rights or other core values.\n\n“If people are being attacked, if communities are being marginalized, it’s my place to speak up. I’m not going to shy from that,” he said.\n\nGarcia said if he is reelected, he’d represent “some very wealthy communities,” yet he continues to believe billionaires and large corporations shouldn’t get tax breaks while average citizens struggle to pay their rent.\n\n“I always vote what I believe is the right thing for the communities I represent, for our state and for what I believe in,” Garcia said.\n\nAt the same time, he said he respects the fact that not everyone shares his opinions. He’s spent his career working with people with differing views, he said, and expects that to continue even if he represents more conservative communities.\n\n“I’ve worked with Republicans my whole life,” he said. “I’m actually not worried about it at all.”","summary":"The new 42nd Congressional District will include OC communities of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa under redistricting map.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/11/28/democratic-rep-robert-garcia-of-long-beach-could-represent-conservative-orange-county-cities-if-reelected/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LDN-L-ROBERT-GARCIA-1127-JG-02.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 16:22:26","author":"Gqlshare,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.006},{"id":383164056,"title":"Trump targets Walz with slur, attacks Omar and Somali community","text":"In an invective posted to the Truth Social platform on Thanksgiving, President Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe Minnesota Gov.

Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?\n\nGen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teens reported first seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.\n\nBut they have also seen the world shaped by pandemic-era isolation and two Trump presidencies that have celebrated the gutting of reproductive freedoms and LGBTQ+ rights. Sexual conservatives want gen Z to be straight, get married and have children, lots of them – but not to educate themselves about sex or venture across heteronormative boundaries. As a political gender gap emerges between young men and women, the right are urging gen Z men to fulfil their masculine destinies and gen Z women to fall in line, minding the home and hearth.\n\nAmid this tug of war between progressive ideals and stifling sexual conservatism, in the wake of a loneliness-breeding lockdown, gen Z is trying to date, to hook up, to fall in love. It is a lot to grapple with, for those living it and for those trying to understand it.\n\nAs part of our sex lives of gen Z series, we gathered 13 data points that, while not nearly conclusive, begin to show what young people think about sex and the partners they’re having it with.\n\n1 Gen Z is the queerest generation\n\nNearly a quarter of gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ+, compared with 10% of all US adults. Millennials come next, at 15%, with gen X (6%), baby boomers (4%) and the silent generation (2%) trailing far behind. (PRRI, 2024)\n\n2 They are in the middle of a sex recession\n\nThe great “sex recession” is the buzzword of the moment if you like making sweeping assumptions about gen Z’s sex lives. Yet, there is something to it: gen Z are having sex less and later than millennials did. (CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2024)\n\n3 Gen Z men are having less sex\n\nA survey conducted by the Kinsey Institute in partnership with the sexual wellness brand Lovehoney found that one in four gen Z adults aged 18 to 24 have not had partnered sex yet. Break that down by gender, and you will find that one in three gen Z men reported never having partnered sex, compared with only one in five gen Z women. (Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)\n\n4 Gen Z men are more likely to experience singledom\n\nYou could say that gen Z men are grappling with a great “relationship recession” too, based on their likelihood of being single. (Pew Research Center, 2023)\n\n5 Gen Z women are more queer\n\nIf women under 30 are more likely to be in a relationship than men under 30, it begs the question: who are they dating? Older men, in spite of some gen Z seeing age gap relationships as exploitative and taboo? Other young women? After all, gen Z women are significantly more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than gen Z men. (PRRI, 2024)\n\n6 A political chasm is dividing gen Z\n\nThere is a growing divide between young men and young women’s political views in the US, as evidenced by the 2024 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. More than half of gen Z men (56%) voted for Trump, while a majority of gen Z women turned out for Harris (58%). The election was in many ways shaped by this wide gender gap. In April 2025, young women were far less likely to identify as Republican than young men. (Tufts CIRCLE, 2024; NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, 2025)\n\n7 They do not want to date across the political divide\n\nGen Z’s gender split along party lines might be affecting its relationship and marriage goals, more than older generations. (NPR/PBS/Marist, 2025)\n\n8 Conservative policy leads to fear of sex\n\nSome women’s sex lives have been adversely affected by recent conservative political triumphs. On social media, the raw emotion of Trump’s election soon made itself clear: talk of a 4B movement spiked in the US as young women discussed boycotting heterosexual marriage, dating, sex and childbirth in protest of institutionalized misogyny and abuse.\n\nThe fall of Roe v Wade in 2022 was also devastating to many young women. As reproductive restrictions rippled through the US, nearly 20% of gen Z women said they were afraid of having sex. (Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)\n\nThe political situation in the US is also having a chilling effect on young LGBTQ+ people: More than a third of LGBTQ+ adults say they do not feel comfortable being open about their identity while dating in 2025. Even more gen Z LGBTQ+ people – 44% of those ages 18 to 24 – said as much. (Kinsey Institute + DatingNews.com, 2025)\n\n9 Gen Z adults eye traditional monogamy\n\nNow on to how gen Z dates: Non-monogamy is on the table, but gen Z does not seem to be as taken with it as other generations – perhaps because some young people have not experienced monogamous relationships yet and yearn for what they do not know.\n\nThese figures are from a survey of the users of Feeld, a dating app that specializes in kink, open relationships and other non-traditional dating situations, so take it with a grain of salt … (Kinsey Institute+ Feeld, 2024)\n\n10 Making a move is tricky for gen Z\n\nAs dismay with the stagnant situation on dating apps grows, one survey found that 72% of gen Z singles say passivity in making the first move has increased, compared to 63% of all singles. (Match, 2025)\n\n11 One night stands might be going extinct\n\nIn 2004, 78% of millennials said their friends commonly have one night stands; just 23% of gen Z said the same 20 years later, in 2024. (YouGov/The Times & Populus, 2025)\n\n12 First date sex can be a no-no\n\nGen Z is more likely to want long-term relationships and less likely to be into casual sex than millennials or gen X, per one survey. Sex on the first date is a relationship “dealbreaker” for 48% of gen Z. (Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)\n\n13 Gen Z daters are into AI\n\nGen Z is the first generation to have generative AI and chatbot technology available to them early and often in their romantic lives, and it looks as if they are taking advantage – whether for companionship or for dating advice. Of course, users beware.

Tim Walz, and Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nTrump began his post with a familiar mix of gratitude and outrage. “A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at,” he wrote, before blaming “foolish countries throughout the World” and the rise of “Political Correctness” for America’s woes on immigration.\n\nTrump also noted how the United States now has “an official Foreign population” of 53 million people, according to the census, and asserted that “most… are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.” He suggested that hardworking Americans are footing the bill for “massive payments” to those “supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble.”\n\n\"They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating them alive to do so!\" he wrote. \"A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family.\"\n\nTrump even accused the federal government of masking the true scale of the nation’s immigration crisis, saying, “The real migrant population is much higher.” He warned that this “refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America,” pointing to issues like “failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits.”\n\nRecommended: What Charlie Kirk Said About Biden’s Afghan Refugee Crisis Has New Meaning Today\n\nThen came the part that has set social media ablaze. Trump zeroed in on Minnesota, saying the state has been “completely taken over” by “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia.” He painted a grim picture of “Somalian gangs… roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.”\n\nThe president didn’t stop there. He blasted Kamala Harris’s former running mate.\n\nThe seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc…\n\nSay what you want about Trump’s messaging, but it was classic Trump. Naturally, social media is abuzz, with many of his supporters hailing the post for its blunt message, and others could hardly believe he said what he did about Walz. Something tells me that Trump doesn’t care. And after someone shot and nearly killed him last year, why would he?","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/28/can-you-believe-donald-trump-said-this-about-tim-walz-n4946491","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/329/89e901be-7f7a-4f4c-87ac-95481518756e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 14:45:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":383108652,"title":"Jennifer Lopez cooks Thanksgiving meal with child Emme inside $52M Bel Air mansion she used to share with Ben Affleck but is struggling to sell","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Nov 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Reeves 'lied to Brits about £21bn black hole to justify Benefits Street tax raid on workers' - and knew the UK actually had a £4bn SURPLUS\n\nThe tender family moment captured just minutes before Brit father, 28, died in jetski crash in front of his loving partner and baby in Dubai\n\nTrump 'is set to recognise Russian control over Crimea and other occupied Ukrainian territories in bid to secure deal with Putin to end war'\n\nRevealed: The new diet that exactly mimics weight-loss jabs - allowing you to shed kilos super fast WITHOUT costly Mounjaro and its embarrassing side-effects.

I've invited him but he doesn't want to show up,' Trump claimed. Trump and Biden's first presidential debate last year, before the latter pulled out and Kamala Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee, teetered off the rails when they traded jabs over their golf games. \n\nAnswering questions from CNN moderator Dana Bash about concerns voters have expressed about their age, the pair's bickering descended into Trump and Biden engaging in a standoff over their handicaps.\n\nTrump has previously made boasting claims about his golfing success, bragging that he has won multiple club championships. \n\nAnd he doubled down on his claims on Thursday as he insisted that they were all legitimate victories - despite past accusations of cheating against the president. \n\n'I know a lot about golf. I've won 38 golf championships and I don't get to practice very much,' he continued. \n\n'I won one last year. I won a club championship, beating a 27-year-old kid. I said 'You know, I'm decades older than you but the fairway doesn't know how old you are,' as you walk up the middle and he's in the rough. \n\n'I've been a good golfer over the years. Club championships are our majors. I've won 38 of them, every one of them legitimately. It has to be legitimate because you have a lot of people following you with club championships.' \n\nHe went on to claim that he has a 'very low handicap' but dodged around providing a definitive number. \n\n'I guess I'm very - I got to be right around scratch or better. I beat a plus-three. That's three better, three below par. If you look at it for those that don't know, in the finals of the club championship last year, with all I was going through and with no practice. So, I'm a good golfer.' \n\nTrump has been frequently accused of cheating and liberally interpreting the rules on the golf course. \n\nRick Reilly's book, 'Commander in Cheat', published in 2019, examines the president's apparent penchant for cheating in golf.\n\n'Trump doesn't just cheat at golf,' Reilly wrote in an excerpt published by Golf.com . 'He cheats like a three-card Monte dealer. He throws it, boots it, and moves it.\n\n'He lies about his lies. He fudges and foozles and fluffs. At Winged Foot, where Trump is a member, the caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him: 'Pele.'\n\nEarlier this year, film star Samuel L. Jackson also accused him of cheating when the pair played a round together.\n\nHowever, MLB legend Roger Clemens appeared to defend the president when they played a round together in the summer. \n\nClemens and Trump played at the latter's Trump National Golf Club in Virginia with the baseball star's son, Kacy, and the club's director of golf, John O'Leary, per the Daily Beast .\n\nThe former New York Yankee shared a photo of the group's scorecard and while Trump shot a respectable 77, he still finished behind the other three players in his group.\n\nKacy, 31, shot a 69, O'Leary wasn't far behind with a 71 and Clemens finished one stroke ahead of Trump with a 76.\n\n'For everyone asking about the scorecard! Mr. President didn't miss a fairway!!,' he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump was seemingly thankful for his golf game on Thursday as he spent Thanksgiving detailing his many achievements on the course, including one outlandish boast.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-15333881/trump-golf-claim-joe-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/28/14/104267937-0-image-m-18_1764339423000.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 14:18:44","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":383096412,"title":"The Mooch is selling a $49 online course to Gen Z on how to survive failure","text":"Ousted White House official and financier Anthony Scaramucci is selling a $49 course for young professionals about how to survive failure - something he knows a bit about. \n\nScaramucci, also known as “The Mooch,” has created “The Resilience Lab,” a video course that advertises itself as helping young people turn their biggest failures into their “most valuable assets.” The project, which launched this month, is aimed at Gen-Z professionals, according to Bloomberg.\n\nScaramucci’s latest endeavor comes after he survived a series of career failures himself, including being ousted as President Donald Trump’s communications director in 2017 after holding the job for just 11 days.\n\nHe was removed from the role shortly after going on an expletive-laden rant about other White House officials in an interview with The New Yorker. Two years later, Trump called Scaramucci a “highly unstable ‘nut job’” and claimed he “barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence.” \n\nScaramucci has since appeared to cut ties with the MAGA world. The 61-year-old labelled Trump a “grifter” in 2023 and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOther career setbacks included early Bitcoin losses and a former business partnership with Sam Bankman-Fried, a convicted crypto fraudster, Bloomberg reported. \n\nScaramucci outlined the past setbacks on the Resilience Lab website, writing that his failures have helped inform the $49 course.\n\n“I failed the bar exam twice after graduating from Harvard Law School,” the website reads. “I was fired from the White House after just 11 days and became a global punchline. I’ve been praised as a genius and caricatured as a failure in the press.”\n\n“Each time, I got back up, learned the lesson and came back stronger. This course is the sum of that scar tissue. Now I use what I've learned to give young professionals the playbook I never had.”\n\nScaramucci cites his failures throughout the course. In one video about the importance of projecting confidence, he recalled the public humiliation of being fired from the White House. \n\n“I get fired in such a spectacular way that I’m parodied on Saturday Night Live, I'm lit up by all the late-night comedians, and I'm destroyed by all the cable news pundits,” Scaramucci recalled. “So when you talk about getting fired, on the 31st of July, 2017, I was blown through the front door of the White House, skinned alive and then rolled in Margarita salt. It was an absolutely miserable feeling.”\n\nIn the course, Scaramucci teaches Gen-Z professionals how to “own your mistakes” and project “unshakeable security,” according to the Resilience Lab website. The website features photos of Scaramucci from throughout his career, including a shot from the White House briefing room. \n\n“It’s the best investment you will ever make in your own career, and it will help you avoid the mistakes that took me decades to learn,” Scaramucci said in a video advertising the course.\n\nScaramucci’s course includes five modules, which cover topics including “how to be comfortable with rejection and stay in the game” and “how to manage your ego so it doesn't kill your career,” according to the website. It’s also free for those who can’t afford the course.\n\n“There’s no course in high school, there’s no course in college that teaches this,” Scaramucci told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Scaramucci for comment.","summary":"The ex-Trump official says he became a ‘global punchline,’ and now wants to coach young professionals","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/anthony-scaramucci-gen-z-failure-course-b2872345.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/17/01/GettyImages-820353314.jpg?crop=3000,2000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tD78ah3A-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-28 13:58:38","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":383086630,"title":"Michael Barone: Dick Cheney: Always Unintimidated","text":"The word that best describes how former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wielded the responsibilities he undertook in public affairs over a long career, began improbably early in life and extended into years of repudiation by his fellow partisans, is “unintimidated.”\n\nHe was unintimidated by his rise to become White House chief of staff at age 34 in 1975, after flunking out of Yale University and not finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin (while his wife, Lynne Cheney, earned hers).\n\nCheney, who died early this month and was eulogized in a ceremony to which the current president and vice president were not invited, rose after being awarded an American Political Science Association fellowship in Washington. There, he favorably impressed two bosses who were elected to Congress at ages 28 and 30 — William Steiger, who, before his death at age 40, pushed a capital gains tax cut through a 2-1 Democratic House, and Donald Rumsfeld, who became former President Richard Nixon’s antipoverty program chief and former President Gerald Ford’s chief of staff.\n\nStill in his 30s, Cheney remained unintimidated by the travails of his patrons and his country — the forced resignation of Nixon in August 1974, the evacuation of U.S. troops from the embassy in Saigon in April 1975, the unveiling of Ford’s WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons in October 1974. He seemed no more impressed than intimidated by his West Wing office near the president’s, nor his duties dealing with eminences such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\nAlthough Ford trailed far behind in polls, he nearly won a full term in 1976: if he had gotten 11,117 more votes in Ohio and 14,464 in Mississippi, he would have had 272 electoral votes to former President Jimmy Carter’s 265. Cheney returned to his native Wyoming and, undaunted by voters who expected to meet and grill candidates for high office in person, won election to the state’s sole House seat in 1978.\n\nHe was undaunted as well by what many regarded as inevitable American decline. I remember a conversation shortly after Reagan’s inauguration in 1981, in which he expressed worry about overcoming Soviet advances abroad and budget deficits and stagflation at home. As a Reagan backer, during the Iran-Contra affair, he defended the administration’s right to conduct foreign policy — a harbinger of future stands in future controversies — and he was elected House minority whip after former President George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988.\n\nBush’s unexpected failure to get John Tower, a fellow Texan, confirmed as defense secretary had two pivotal consequences. One was the naming of Cheney, at age 48, as defense secretary. The other was the election by an 87-85 margin of Newt Gingrich, 46, to succeed Cheney as whip, which put him in line to push aside former Minority Leader Robert Michel and lead Republicans to their first House majority in 40 years in 1994. Whether Cheney’s talents would have produced that result is uncertain; in any case, Republicans have won House majorities in three-quarters of the elections since.\n\nMore immediately consequential was Cheney’s appointment. Unintimidated, despite his lack of military service, he assembled Operation Desert Shield and coolly fired the Air Force chief of staff for an unauthorized interview on the eve of Operation Desert Storm. His White House, congressional and national security experience made him a natural choice as head of former President George W. Bush’s vice presidential selection committee and, after due consultation, for the vice presidential nomination itself.\n\nOnly four men served eight years as vice president before 1950; three made well-known comments about the insignificance of the office, and the fourth was known for his alcoholism. But since 1950, there have been five vice presidents who served eight years; three of them (Nixon, H.W. Bush and Joe Biden) were later elected president in their own right, and a fourth (Al Gore) won the popular vote for the office.\n\nCheney was the odd man out, yet he was arguably the most consequential vice president of the five. After the 9/11 attacks, he pressed hard for aggressive measures to protect America from terrorism, arguing that enhanced interrogations and military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq were justified if there was even a 1% chance of preventing a terrorist attack that, in a nuclear age, could have been orders of magnitude greater than 9/11. He acted on this conviction, unintimidated by the prospect of widespread opposition and of a decline that, in fact, occurred in his job approval.\n\nIn most ideological quarters, Cheney’s recommendations, implemented with W. Bush’s substantial but not total approval, were, if not a crime, then a blunder. But even if, as in all wars, mistakes were made, “regime change in Baghdad also brought blessings,” wrote The Wall Street Journal’s Barton Swaim.\n\nBuilding on those blessings has been, ironically, President Donald Trump, who has routinely called the Iraq War a mistake and has been full of scorn for Cheney. Yet it is impossible to imagine the success of Trump’s Abraham Accords and bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities if the Hussein regime were still in place; history may record it was necessary to take out the terrorist regime in Iraq before taking out the terrorist regime in Iran. Trump’s successful foreign policies may owe more to Cheney than either would feel comfortable admitting.\n\nCheney was no orator but performed ably in his two vice presidential debates, in 2000 against Joe Lieberman, whom he liked and admired, and in 2004 against John Edwards, whose smarmy phoniness he despised. In that contest, Cheney was the first major party nominee to support same-sex marriage — long before Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton — and he gave unintimidated support to his daughter Mary Cheney and her wife and their children.\n\nHe gave unintimidated support as well to his daughter Liz Cheney, who, as a former Wyoming representative and member of the Republican leadership, opposed Trump’s course of action on Jan. 6 and supported his impeachment, conduct that I wrote at the time “any reasonable person could find impeachable.” That led to the Cheneys’ otherwise surprising endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.\n\nLet me close on a personal note. When I ran into Cheney, he often recalled playing high school football for Casper against Worland quarterback Grant Ujifusa, who later created “The Almanac of American Politics” and enlisted me as a coauthor. With both now gone, I can’t help thinking that playing high school football on cold — maybe freezing — Wyoming fall Friday evenings may leave you unintimidated by anything you face later.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/123114-dick-cheney-always-unintimidated-2025-11-28","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 12:48:03","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.125},{"id":383069568,"title":"Trump rages over ‘seriously retarded Governor’ Tim Walz in furious Thanksgiving message","text":"President Trump ripped Minnesota Gov.

Those filled with pain and anger can say things they regret.\n\nBut something else seems to be happening as U.S. President Donald Trump uses the killing and wounding of two National Guard members in Washington this week to endorse “reverse migration” and call for America’s most restrictive immigration measures yet.\n\nGiven Trump’s track record, the policies (or edicts, or rage-fuelled threats) announced in a late-night social media rant look less like a politician lashing out in anger and more like someone seizing on an opportunity.\n\nA permanent pause on migration from “all third-world countries”; removing those judged to be “not a net asset” to the U.S.; deporting those who are “noncompatible with western civilization.”\n\n“Only reverse migration can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote.\n\nReverse migration, as in deporting, dispatching, doing away with—through incentives, intimidation or force — those who have made it to the former promised land of America.\n\nThe concept is not new, but it is ascendant.\n\nGermany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany party, the AfD, made “remigration” a central plank of this year’s federal election, producing and distributed fake airplane boarding passes.\n\nOne native-born person’s cheeky campaign stunt sends chills down the immigrant spine — particularly in Germany.\n\nIn 2023, a jury of German linguists picked “remigration” the “Non-word of the Year,” calling it “euphemistic camouflage … that obscures the actual intentions.”\n\nNamely, “a shift in migration policy discourse towards the normalization of right-wing populist and right-wing extremist positions.”\n\nIf you can credit Trump with one thing, it is stunning clarity of purpose. No euphemisms, no niceties, no beating around the bush.\n\nThe follow-through, however, will require bending the truth, breaking existing laws and bursting immigrant dreams.\n\nReferring to the Washington shooting, he told U.S. military members in a Thanksgiving message Thursday that it was reminder of the need to control immigration as a means of ensuring national security.\n\n“For the most part, we don’t want them. They come in illegally. They have lots of problems … They come out of jails in many cases, mental institutions, they’re gang members. they’re drug dealers.”\n\nThat is not the case for Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, so far as has been reported. The man charged in the shooting is a paramilitary veteran of the war in Afghanistan who had fought alongside American military and intelligence forces.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Lakanwal was “one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration.”\n\nOthers have jumped to the defence of America’s Afghan allies.\n\nShawn VanDriver, founder of AfghanEvac, a charity that resettles Afghans in the U.S., said immigrants from the country “undergo some of the most extensive security vetting of any population entering the country.”\n\nBut that’s now “stopped indefinitely” for Afghans while the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service conducts what its director, Joseph Edlow, called “a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”\n\nThis feels less like a simple, hasty reaction from the Trump administration, more like a steadily growing wave of hostility from a president ringing all the national security alarms to shut America’s borders to foreign goods and citizens.\n\nA week ago, Trump announced he was ending special immigration protections for Somali nationals that allowed them to remain in the U.S. rather than be forced to return to a country hobbled by war, political instability and Islamist terrorism.\n\nHe accused Somali gangs of “terrorizing” the people of Minnesota, where a large number of Somali immigrants have settled, and having stolen “billions of dollars.”\n\nThis is in reference to an allegedly fraudulent scheme run through a charity resulting in charges against nearly 80 individuals. Federal prosecutors have described it as the ”largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country.”\n\n“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote.\n\nTrump’s latest rant said that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.”\n\nHe said gangs are “roving the streets.”\n\nHe called Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who ran last year as Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential candidate, “seriously retarded.”\n\nHe mocked Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee who is now a U.S. citizen and Democratic lawmaker, and alleged without proof that she “probably came into the U.S.A. illegally.”\n\nThe unproven allegation refers to years-old claims that Omar married her brother — something that she has repeatedly denied and referred to as “absurd and offensive.”\n\nWalz, reacting to the cancelled immigration protections for Somalis, said it was “not surprising that (Trump) has chosen to broadly target an entire community.”\n\n“This is what he does to change the subject.”\n\nIt’s a war of words ahead of greater hostilities for people on U.S. soil with tough-to-pronounce names, thick accents, foreign customs and dark skin.\n\nBut the impact is already coming clear.\n\nTrump himself cited census statistics putting the number of immigrants in the country at 53 million — a group he derided as mostly on welfare, from failed nations, having criminal records, psychological problems and links to gangs and drug cartels.\n\nIt turns out that figure isn’t quite on the mark — not wrong so much as it is outdated. \n\nIn January 2025, there were 53.3 million immigrants in the country, which the Pew Research Center said was “the largest number ever recorded.”\n\nWithin a few months of Trump’s return to the White House — a tempestuous period that Pew noted had seen 181 executive actions on immigration alone — the foreign-born population had dropped for the first time since the 1960s.\n\nBy June, the immigrant population was down more than a million to 51.9 million people.\n\nStay tuned to see how low Trump can go.","summary":"The policies announced in a social media rant look less like a politician lashing out in anger and more like someone seizing on an opportunity.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/trump-reverse-migration-stragety-after-national-guard-shooting/article_f195038b-f06a-4c04-b80d-b5e79e5ea1da.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/59/d59216cd-b1b9-5839-be39-b568f4e2b6be/692992fb4509f.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 12:30:00","author":"Allan Woods","authors":["Allan Woods"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":383054858,"title":"Where redistricting stands a year out from the midterm elections","text":"Rewriting district lines this late in the cycle isn’t typically how an election year begins.

Democrats have launched their own map-drawing pushes in response, sparking political and legal battles nationwide that will influence the 2026 playing field and help decide who ends up running Congress. \n\n“The story of the race for the House has been dominated by mid-cycle redistricting to such a degree that it has been challenging to assess the overall state of play, with new developments popping up almost daily,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nHow states handle redistricting varies widely. In some states, lawmakers can simply rewrite the lines if they have the votes. In others, any overhaul requires a constitutional change, a slower path that typically sends the decision directly to voters. Here’s a look at which states have finished their maps, which ones are tied up in court, and where new players could still emerge.\n\nStates that approved new maps\n\nTexas ignited the mid-cycle scramble by approving a map aimed at flipping five Democratic districts, two in South Texas, one each in Dallas and Houston, and another running between Austin and San Antonio. However, a federal court put the brakes on the plan, stating that the new lines likely constitute an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and directed the state to revert to its earlier map for now. \n\nThe state is now asking the Supreme Court to intervene in a fight that has a fast-approaching deadline: Texas candidates for Congress must file for their chosen districts by Dec. 8. \n\nRep. Julie Johnson (D-TX) said the uncertainty has left candidates and voters in limbo. “It’s like a ping pong ball going back and forth,” she said in an interview on CNN, arguing the lower court’s ruling was clear and that mid-cycle map changes create “too much uncertainty in the process.” She added that voters expect fairness and stability, not constant shifts in district lines driven by political winds.\n\nRepublicans have defended the map in court by denying that the new lines were a racial gerrymander.\n\nCalifornia became the first Democratic-run state to answer Trump’s call for new maps. Voters approved a congressional overhaul on Nov. 4 that scraps the lines drawn by the state’s independent commission after the 2020 census and replaces them with a plan expected to give Democrats a shot at as many as five more seats. \n\nThe map aims to effectively wipe out potential gains from the new Republican map in Texas. The party currently controls 43 of the state’s 52 districts. The Justice Department has now sided with Republicans in a lawsuit challenging the new boundaries.\n\nMissouri followed Texas as the second Republican state to redraw its House lines at Trump’s urging. Kehoe signed the new map on Sept. 28, targeting a Democratic-held Kansas City district in hopes of flipping another seat. Republicans now hold six of eight. Opponents are pursuing lawsuits and collecting signatures for a potential referendum.\n\nNorth Carolina became the third GOP-controlled state to move ahead with the kind of map changes Trump has been urging. On Oct. 22, the Republican-led legislature signed off on a congressional redraw that reconfigures a Democratic district in the eastern part of the state, potentially giving the GOP another seat. The plan does not require the governor’s sign-off. Republicans now hold 10 of 14 seats, and the new map is already the subject of a lawsuit.\n\nOhio’s redistricting commission, nominally bipartisan but firmly controlled by Republicans, unexpectedly approved a deal that puts two Democratic incumbents, Marcy Kaptur in the northwest and Greg Landsman in Cincinnati, in tougher districts. Rep. Emilia Sykes’ district, meanwhile, becomes more favorable to Democrats. The state was required to redraw its congressional map because the previous GOP-drawn lines were enacted without any Democratic support, triggering a redo under Ohio law.\n\nIn Utah, a state judge threw out the existing congressional map, finding it ran afoul of the state’s voter-approved anti-gerrymandering rules, and instead put in place a new plan that forms a compact, Democratic-leaning district around Salt Lake City. Her decision overrode the map passed by the GOP-controlled legislature, which would have made it far harder for Democrats to compete. Gov. Spencer Cox said he intends to bring lawmakers back for a special session next month, as Republican legislators push a constitutional amendment aimed at reaffirming their authority to revise voter-approved ballot measures.\n\nThe decision also prompted the first public break in silence from Utah’s congressional delegation. Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT), whose district would lose significant territory under the new map, sharply criticized Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling, accusing her of overstepping. “It is painful to watch a Utah judge abandon the restraint, balance, and humility that our system depends upon,” he wrote, arguing she had “commandeered” the mapmaking authority that should rest with elected lawmakers. Owens said her decision imposed “an outcome that was never chosen by the people,” framing it as a disruption to a system that had functioned for “more than a century.”\n\nStates moving toward revised maps\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats are pushing a multi-step effort that would shift redistricting power from the state’s bipartisan commission to the legislature starting next year. The commission deadlocked after the 2020 census, leaving a court to draw the current lines, and Democrats want a new process that gives lawmakers control. Their proposal cleared the General Assembly in late October but must pass again after the 2025 elections before going to voters for final approval. If enacted, a revised map would likely put three GOP-held districts in the crosshairs.\n\nAnalysts say the stakes are enormous. As David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report put it, “There’s a ton of upside for Democrats in the Old Dominion,” noting that even modest line changes could flip multiple GOP districts.\n\nLouisiana has pushed its primary calendar back, with Gov. Jeff Landry signing a bill in October that shifts the date from April 18 to May 16. The move is intended to give lawmakers more time to revise the state’s congressional lines if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the current map. Republicans hold four of the six seats.\n\nMaryland remains one of the simplest places for Democrats to try adding a seat to their column. With complete control of the state government, they could redraw the lines in a way that jeopardizes Rep. Andy Harris, the lone Republican in the delegation. However, a similar effort was rejected by a state court after the last census. This time around, the state Senate’s Democratic leader has signaled reluctance to reopen the maps, but Gov. Wes Moore is moving forward with a commission tasked with producing new proposals.\n\nStates weighing mid-cycle changes\n\nThe Indiana General Assembly is now poised to reopen the redistricting fight in December, a reversal that came after both Trump and Vice President JD Vance urged GOP lawmakers to push ahead with a new congressional map. The proposal on the table would likely wipe out both Democratic-held districts and deliver Republicans a 9–0 delegation.\n\nJust days earlier, Trump’s effort appeared to be going nowhere, with the state Senate signaling it had no plans to return before the year’s end. And while senators have now agreed to reconvene, the outcome still hinges on whether enough of them ultimately support the plan. Without those votes, it won’t reach Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.\n\n“The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement. “To resolve this issue, the Senate intends to reconvene as part of the regular 2026 session on Dec. 8 and make a final decision that week on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”\n\nIn Florida, Republicans opened the door to possible mid-cycle redistricting by creating a House committee to study the issue, a move that could lead to new lines in a state where the GOP currently holds 20 of 28 congressional seats.\n\nIn Illinois, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has been urging state lawmakers to revisit their congressional map, but there’s little indication they intend to reopen the process. The current lines already give Democrats a strong advantage, though another redraw could be used to squeeze out one additional GOP-held district.\n\nColorado could soon join the list of states eyeing mid-cycle map changes. Attorney General Phil Weiser, now running for governor, is urging Democrats to craft an “in case of emergency” ballot measure for 2026 that would temporarily hand redistricting power to the legislature for the 2028 cycle before restoring authority to the state’s independent commission. Gov. Jared Polis, who is finishing his final term, has shown little interest in bypassing the commission, but Weiser argues that Democratic voters are increasingly open to the idea as more Republican-led states press ahead with their own redraws.\n\nIn New York, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a constitutional amendment that would permit mid-decade redistricting. To advance, it must pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions before appearing on the statewide ballot. Democrats currently hold 19 of the state’s 26 House seats.\n\nKansas Republicans quietly backed away from their attempt to trigger a special redistricting session this fall, unable to muster enough support without Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s cooperation. But the fight is only paused. Once the Legislature returns in January, GOP leaders are expected to renew their push to redraw the map, a move that would almost certainly center on making Rep. Sharice Davids’s Kansas City–area seat harder for Democrats to hold. \n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has signaled he’s “open” to revisiting the state’s congressional map, but no formal push has materialized. Any midcycle redraw wouldn’t add a new GOP seat, but it could fortify the Omaha-area 2nd District, a swing seat Kamala Harris carried in 2024 and currently held by retiring Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE).\n\nDemocrats are only three seats away from reclaiming the House. While Trump is banking on GOP-led redraws to counter the usual midterm drag, the overall battlefield still hasn’t shifted decisively in his favor. “Democrats do remain favored to win the House next year,” Kondik said, even after months of mid-cycle changes and with several major states still weighing new maps. \n\nHe noted that only an unusually early Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act could fundamentally alter the landscape, but its timing is unpredictable and likely too late to matter for the 2026 elections. With potential redraws still looming in places such as Florida, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, and Illinois, control of the House will ultimately hinge on just a handful of seats.","summary":"A coast-to-coast redistricting arms race ignited by President Donald Trump has plunged states into a frenzied, mid-cycle scramble that will help determine whether&#160;Republicans&#160;can maintain their narrow House majority in 2026.

As I mentioned yesterday, I'll be rerunning \"Best Of\" editions of the Morning Briefing a few times during the holiday season. Hey, even I need to overindulge and spend time with loved ones. Here's the MB from the day after the election last. A time of Thanksgiving indeed.)\n\nTop O' the Briefing\n\nHappy, happy Wednesday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. \n\nWhat a night. \n\nThis election celebration edition of the Briefing will be a bit different. There aren't a lot of links because there is really only one story today. The pre-election posts are already obsolete. \n\nAlso, I was busy with yet another PJ Media epic live blog until the wee hours of the morning my time. They're always a lot of fun, but last night's was obviously special. Thousands of people, thousands of comments, a good time was had by all. It was like being at a watch party without having to shower or smell other people. \n\nThere was, of course, a lot of tension and anxiety at the beginning of the night. Because of the Democrats' relentless assault on election transparency and integrity — especially in recent years — faith in the system has been severely shaken. Any good news in the early going was difficult to get excited about because we were all waiting for news of \"irregularities\" to start coming in. \n\nRegular readers here know that I have been nothing but pessimistic throughout this election cycle. I knew that all of the signs looked good for Trump as Election Day approached, but I was convinced that the Dems would find some way to blow it all up. Pennsylvania was the biggest surprise for me. I was convinced that the Magic Mail-In Ballot Machine in Philadelphia would muck up the works. \n\nIt was not to be a night when the Dems' attempts to put their thumbs on the scales would work, however.\n\nThat's because Trump was over-performing everywhere, even in blue states. New Jersey and Virginia were closer than anyone expected. He was cutting into traditional Democratic constituencies all over the place. The Dem electorate seemed to quickly remember that it didn't like Kamala Harris very much in the 2020 primaries. \n\nIn the end, his numbers were too strong for the Democrats to pull any of their stunts. The New York Times was predicting that he would win the popular vote almost before any other news organization. It was that kind of night. At one point, before CNN had called the race for Trump, Jake Tapper asked John King what they were waiting for. King replied, \"Just to see how big the shellacking will be.\"\n\nOne thing I noticed about the CNN coverage is that most of them didn't seem terribly upset. They were definitely caught off-guard in 2016, which is why they had such emotional on-air meltdowns. They were quite prepared for what happened last night. \n\nThere will be plenty to write about in the coming days regarding the media's awfulness. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this election, and the leftists in the MSM will fail to figure any of it out. \n\nToday, let us all revel in the fact that Donald Trump just pulled the Republic back from the brink of commie disaster. \n\nAnd he did it bigly. \n\nEverything Isn't Awful\n\nCats are on another level.. 😨 pic.twitter.com/9ZT779FuZu— Buitengebieden (@buitengebieden) November 5, 2024\n\nMAGA ALL OVER THE PLACE.

There, he favorably impressed two bosses who were elected to Congress at ages 28 and 30 -- William Steiger, who, before his death at age 40, pushed a capital gains tax cut through a 2-1 Democratic House, and Donald Rumsfeld, who became former President Richard Nixon's antipoverty program chief and former President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.\n\nStill in his 30s, Cheney remained unintimidated by the travails of his patrons and his country -- the forced resignation of Nixon in August 1974, the evacuation of U.S. troops from the embassy in Saigon in April 1975, the unveiling of Ford's WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons in October 1974. He seemed no more impressed than intimidated by his West Wing office near the president's, nor his duties dealing with eminences such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\nAlthough Ford trailed far behind in polls, he nearly won a full term in 1976: if he had gotten 11,117 more votes in Ohio and 14,464 in Mississippi, he would have had 272 electoral votes to former President Jimmy Carter's 265. Cheney returned to his native Wyoming and, undaunted by voters who expected to meet and grill candidates for high office in person, won election to the state's sole House seat in 1978.\n\nHe was undaunted as well by what many regarded as inevitable American decline. I remember a conversation shortly after Reagan's inauguration in 1981, in which he expressed worry about overcoming Soviet advances abroad and budget deficits and stagflation at home. As a Reagan backer, during the Iran-Contra affair, he defended the administration's right to conduct foreign policy -- a harbinger of future stands in future controversies -- and he was elected House minority whip after former President George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988.\n\nBush's unexpected failure to get John Tower, a fellow Texan, confirmed as defense secretary had two pivotal consequences. One was the naming of Cheney, at age 48, as defense secretary. The other was the election by an 87-85 margin of Newt Gingrich, 46, to succeed Cheney as whip, which put him in line to push aside former Minority Leader Robert Michel and lead Republicans to their first House majority in 40 years in 1994. Whether Cheney's talents would have produced that result is uncertain; in any case, Republicans have won House majorities in three-quarters of the elections since.\n\nMore immediately consequential was Cheney's appointment. Unintimidated, despite his lack of military service, he assembled Operation Desert Shield and coolly fired the Air Force chief of staff for an unauthorized interview on the eve of Operation Desert Storm. His White House, congressional and national security experience made him a natural choice as head of former President George W. Bush's vice presidential selection committee and, after due consultation, for the vice presidential nomination itself.\n\nOnly four men served eight years as vice president before 1950; three made well-known comments about the insignificance of the office, and the fourth was known for his alcoholism. But since 1950, there have been five vice presidents who served eight years; three of them (Nixon, H.W. Bush and Joe Biden) were later elected president in their own right, and a fourth (Al Gore) won the popular vote for the office.\n\nCheney was the odd man out, yet he was arguably the most consequential vice president of the five. After the 9/11 attacks, he pressed hard for aggressive measures to protect America from terrorism, arguing that enhanced interrogations and military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq were justified if there was even a one percent chance of preventing a terrorist attack that, in a nuclear age, could have been orders of magnitude greater than 9/11. He acted on this conviction, unintimidated by the prospect of widespread opposition and of a decline that, in fact, occurred in his job approval.\n\nIn most ideological quarters, Cheney's recommendations, implemented with W. Bush's substantial but not total approval, were, if not a crime, then a blunder. But even if, as in all wars, mistakes were made, \"regime change in Baghdad also brought blessings,\" wrote The Wall Street Journal's Barton Swaim.\n\nBuilding on those blessings has been, ironically, President Donald Trump, who has routinely called the Iraq War a mistake and has been full of scorn for Cheney. Yet it is impossible to imagine the success of Trump's Abraham Accords and bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities if the Hussein regime were still in place; history may record it was necessary to take out the terrorist regime in Iraq before taking out the terrorist regime in Iran. Trump's successful foreign policies may owe more to Cheney than either would feel comfortable admitting.\n\nCheney was no orator but performed ably in his two vice presidential debates, in 2000 against Joe Lieberman, whom he liked and admired, and in 2004 against John Edwards, whose smarmy phoniness he despised. In that contest, Cheney was the first major party nominee to support same-sex marriage -- long before Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton -- and he gave unintimidated support to his daughter Mary Cheney and her wife and their children.\n\nHe gave unintimidated support as well to his daughter Liz Cheney, who, as a former Wyoming representative and member of the Republican leadership, opposed Trump's course of action on Jan. 6 and supported his impeachment, conduct that I wrote at the time \"any reasonable person could find impeachable.\" That led to the Cheneys' otherwise surprising endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.\n\nLet me close on a personal note. When I ran into Cheney, he often recalled playing high school football for Casper against Worland quarterback Grant Ujifusa, who later created \"The Almanac of American Politics\" and enlisted me as a coauthor. With both now gone, I can't help thinking that playing high school football on cold -- maybe freezing -- Wyoming fall Friday evenings may leave you unintimidated by anything you face later.\n\nMichael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

Gavin Newsom’s roaring start to the 2028 presidential election may already be scaring away potential competitors.\n\nThat could be true when it comes to the candidate who possibly looks the best on paper: Gretchen Whitmer. As the center-left governor of a critical swing state who held major roles in the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigns and who has managed to retain strong approval ratings, Whitmer seems to have everything going for her. (RELATED: Whitmer Says America Is Ready for a Female President)\n\nAnd yet, Michigan’s governor has numerous times in recent months suggested that she may not wage a presidential bid.\n\nSpeculation that she may pass on the race kicked off in April when she responded to the question of what she is looking forward to in 2026 by saying, “Retiring.”\n\nThis year, her appearances on national news shows have grown few and far between, leading many to conclude that she is stepping away from the limelight. Some also view her decision to prioritize working with President Donald Trump on Michigan’s needs — such as securing a new fighter jet mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base — rather than fighting him at every turn, à la Newsom, as a retreat from a national political future. This term in office, Trump has, in appreciation of her strategy, called her “a very good person” and said she is doing an “excellent job.”\n\nWhitmer’s prioritization of collaboration with the president has disappointed some Democrats, with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel saying, “Appeasement is not workable strategy with a fascist.” The famous picture of Whitmer holding up a folder to hide her face in the White House captures her effort to work with Trump despite the frustration within her own party.\n\nIn October, Whitmer was asked head-on about whether she would run for president by a Canadian journalist. She said, “I don’t know if I need to be the main character in the next chapter, but I want to have a hand in writing it.” Whitmer added that the speculation that she could run for president was a “big compliment.”\n\n“I think I’ve got an important vantage point as the governor of an important swing state,” she continued, “so I anticipate helping, but I don’t know if I’m going to be the person.”\n\nWhitmer also clarified that she wants to keep her attention on Michigan. “I got a big job right now to stay focused on, and I’m going to do that,” she said. “I don’t want to take my eye off the ball and go out having missed something, having lost something, having a catastrophe happen under my watch.”\n\nContrast that with Newsom’s splashy declaration on CBS News that he is considering a presidential run and will make a decision after next year’s midterms. (RELATED: Gavin Newsom’s Very Good Year*)\n\nThe different strategies come as early polling shows that Newsom has pulled well ahead of the pack. In a poll this month by Emerson College that asked voters the open-ended question of who they would support for the Democratic nomination for president, 24 percent said Newsom, while only 0.4 percent named Whitmer. Kamala Harris followed Newsom with 10 percent support, while Pete Buttigieg pulled in 9 percent. (RELATED: Pete Buttigieg: America’s Second Gay President?)\n\nBut as Newsom has burst out of the gate at full speed and continues to garner headline after headline crowing him Democrats’ frontrunner (“Admit It. Gavin Newsom Is the 2028 Front-runner”; “Gavin Newsom ‘light years ahead’ in 2028 Democratic field after Prop. 50 win”), Whitmer may have decided that it’s wiser to wait for Newsom to grow stale with voters or stumble on the trail before making her move.\n\nIf she wants to be in the race, however, she may have to act sooner rather than later. This week, Axios reported that some of her senior aides have begun looking for new jobs to take after Whitmer finishes her second term in office in January 2027 because “they haven’t got a signal to play for anything after her term ends.”\n\nWhitmer, Axios reported, is “privately expressing ambivalence about running for president in 2028.” Even still, the outlet added that the governor has also privately said that she is keeping her options open.\n\nLast month, Whitmer did tell Bloomberg News: “I can’t rule anything out at this juncture.” Also, a “senior Michigan Democrat” told Axios that the idea that Whitmer is taking herself out of the race is merely “wishful thinking on behalf of some Democrats.”\n\nIn other private discussions reported on this week by Axios, Whitmer has reportedly told people that she “feels obligated to focus on Michigan through the end of her term rather than take more steps for a presidential campaign.”\n\nGavin Newsom has chosen to go the route of unabashedly running for president even while governor of California. If resentment grows over the perception that Newsom is in it only for himself and that he isn’t solving California’s problems — as it has in the past — then that strategy could come back to bite him. If it does, then Whitmer will be able to say that she was the one who remained focused on the people of her state.\n\nAnd if Newsom’s strategy doesn’t backfire? Well, then maybe Whitmer will retire to spend more time with her kids rather than wage a losing battle.\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes:\n\nTemple Shows DEI’s Ongoing Hold on Medical Schools\n\nWoman Who Gave Birth at 62 Via IVF Accused of Committing Fraud to Get More Children\n\nGavin Newsom’s Very Good Year","url":"https://spectator.org/is-gretchen-whitmer-backing-down-from-2028/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-at-1.34.25-PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 03:16:52","author":"Ellie Gardey Holmes","authors":["Ellie Gardey Holmes"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":382906186,"title":"The Mamdani effect: American Jews are worried about New York's new mayor","text":"The Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) on Thursday published disturbing findings from its “Voice of the Jewish People” survey for November 2025, which probed the mood among American Jews in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York City mayor and rising antisemitic rhetoric from both radical left‑wing and Republican circles. The survey finds deep, broad anxiety across the community: 99% of respondents expressed concern about antisemitism. Of them, 62% said they were worried equally about antisemitism coming from both political sides (left and right), 20% were mainly worried about antisemitism from the left, and 17% claimed most concern about antisemitism from the right. When asked how Mamdani’s election affects their feelings, the dominant sentiment was “concern” (56%). A large majority (67%) believe the election is likely to hurt the security of New York’s Jewish community only 6% think the community’s security could strengthen. Most American Jews now view Mamdani as anti‑Israel and antisemitic Although in recent U.S. election polls about a third of Jewish voters in New York supported Mamdani, the JPPI survey now shows that nearly two‑thirds of U.S. Jews (64%) define him, after the election victory, as both anti‑Israeli and antisemitic — a sharp rise since the survey began last summer. An additional 19% consider him anti‑Israeli but not antisemitic. The survey also gauged opinions on the connection between anti‑Zionism and antisemitism: 72% of respondents believe that anti‑Zionism is indeed antisemitism, either “definitely” or “usually” 17% think anti‑Zionism is antisemitic only “sometimes.” Only 11% believe the two are completely separate. Importantly, there is a stark divide along ideological lines: among “very liberal” respondents, only 44% see anti‑Zionism as antisemitism — compared with 92% among “very conservative” Jews. Despite the tension, JPPI finds high support for Zionism among American Jews: 70% of respondents define themselves as Zionists, and another 12% say they are “non‑Zionist but support Zionism.” Only 3% define themselves as anti‑Zionist. Among Jewish Trump voters, Zionism support reaches 81%, compared with 64% among Jews who voted for Kamala Harris. Zionism is not racism This month marks 50 years since the 1975 UN decision that declared Zionism “a form of racism” (Resolution 3379). Regarding this legacy, 59% of JPPI respondents say “there is nothing racist about Zionism.” A quarter (28%) say Zionism is not racist, though some interpret it that way. Eight percent see Zionism as mostly non‑racist though containing a few racist elements, and only 4% responded that “Zionism is racism.” When asked what they believe “the average American” thinks, only 8% thought the average American sees Zionism as a non‑racist movement.

But after the victories of both Virginia governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat, and New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a progressive, Martin believes the party is on the right track. FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HIS PARTY AFTER OFF-YEAR ELECTION SUCCESS He reportedly also said that young people feel \"disillusioned\" by the lack of job opportunities, something he blamed on President Donald Trump's administration. Prior to the off-year elections, James Carville, a veteran strategist for the Democratic Party, warned that far-left messaging and policies were hurting the Democratic Party’s image with young men. \"They were told, ‘The future is female, you must always believe the woman is never wrong, #MeToo,'\" Carville said on a podcast in July. \"And men are like, ‘S---, do I count? What about my life? I mean, we're only 48% of the voting population.’\" More recently, he has argued that any future president from either party will have to move in a more economically populist direction to win back young people who cannot afford the same standard of living as their parents and grandparents. KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS In March, New York Times columnist Ezra Klein spoke with a Democratic pollster David Shor about how \"75-year-old White men supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than 20-year-old White men.\" \"It is a real shift,\" Shor agreed. \"This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years — that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers, and maybe even in some ways more so, to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years.\" NYU professor Scott Galloway argued that the affordability crisis made people turn against Democrats in 2024. He argued in a podcast in November that one of the biggest shifts he noticed in the 2024 election was middle-aged women toward the GOP, suggesting that mothers were voting for Republicans in order to help their struggling sons.

Americans of all persuasions, races, and creeds will gather with family around the table and give thanks, most of them to the Almighty, for the bounty they have received this year.\n\nIt’s easy to take Thanksgiving for granted. And yet it is something uniquely American, and truly a wonder. It is a holiday that confirms that we as a country are committed to gratitude and to recommitting ourselves annually to this national character trait.\n\nIt acts as some sort of baptismal sacrament. Immigrants take their first timorous step toward Americanization when they start honoring this sacred holiday and learn to cook its dishes. And thereby, without being fully aware, they begin to incarnate the national spirit.\n\nIn personal terms, a disposition to be grateful renders important benefits, reducing anxiety and depression, and making us better companions and better sleepers. This is so self-evident it hardly requires research to substantiate it, but the evidence does exist.\n\nIn geopolitics, the thankful disposition draws a bright line between the United States and wretched states officially devoted to its opposite, ungratefulness. A commitment to gratitude may have been one of the things—right up there with love of liberty—that made America the historic sworn enemy of Marxism, whose guiding ideology, envy, is the wages of ingratitude.\n\nThanksgiving is unquestionably uniquely American. I have lived at least a year in seven countries, in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, many more if one counts shorter stays, and have never encountered anything like it anywhere else.\n\nYes, in East Asia, I experienced firsthand what the Koreans call the Chuseok festival, held on 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, so from late September to early October, depending on the year. But it’s not dedicated to giving thanks, but rather to the full moon.\n\nCanada, Liberia and the Caribbean island-nation of Grenada also have official Thanksgiving days, but they are derivatives of America’s.\n\nThanksgiving is not just uniquely tied to this country because it is reflective of the American national character. Its lineage is the thread of the national quilt.\n\nAnyone who has watched A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, and its companion, The Mayflower Voyagers, will know the essentials of how the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims and their Indian hosts in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony. Right there, Thanksgiving starts as a needed slap in the face to the “land acknowledgement” crowd.\n\n(And yes, it might be better to read a book and learn history right and not from Peanuts, but don’t underestimate the value of popular culture in propagandizing the national spirit. When Charlie Brown exclaims at the Thanksgiving table, “We thank the Lord for a bountiful harvest,” Hollywood was telling generations of young Americans that it wasn’t just ok to be patriotic and faithful, but that it was normal and expected.)\n\nThen, in one of its very firsts acts, the first Congress in 1789 requested that the newly elected President Washington proclaim a national day of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it wasn’t till later, in the middle of the Civil War and in response to a persistent, decades-long letter-writing campaign by editor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale, that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 proclaimed the last Thursday in November as our official day of Thanksgiving. Then Congress in 1941, just as America was about to enter another war, officially made it the fourth Thursday.\n\nThus, Congress and our most important leaders ratified an outlook that is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nExperiencing gratitude is “associated with greater longevity among older adults,” says a Harvard study last year. According to the British Psychological Society, “around 18.5 per cent of individual differences in people’s happiness could be predicted by the amount of gratitude they feel.”\n\nSaying thanks to your partner and meaning it also makes the institution of marriage stronger. A team at the University of Illinois found that “higher levels of perceived gratitude buffered against the stresses of both financial strain and ineffective arguing.” (One could ask, in marriage, is there any other type of arguing?)\n\nMeanwhile, at UC Berkeley, a 2009 study found that “Gratitude was uniquely related to total sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction.”\n\nOf course, Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, and the various congresses in question—to say nothing of the Pilgrim fathers, Samoset or Squanto—did not have any of these benefits in mind, they just wanted to thank the Lord. Maybe the unintended consequences are payback.\n\nThat is not going to help you deal with your aunt who voted for Kamala Harris and will show up dressed in a Handmaid’s Tale outfit. Just tell her that if President Trump and Zohran Mamdani can bury the hatchet, she can get along with others, too.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nOriginally published by Washington Examiner.","summary":"The nation will this week partake in a ritual unlike any other in the rest of the world.

More than half of people in the UK believe the differences in people’s political views are so divisive it is dangerous for society, recent polling by Ipsos found.\n\nThe changes in political polarisation resulting from exposure to X posts were measured using a novel approach. First, the academics used AI to analyse posts in X’s “for you” feed in real time. Then the system showed more divisive posts to one cohort and fewer divisive posts to another, a power normally the sole preserve of X. Divisive posts included those that showed support for undemocratic practices, partisan violence, opposition to bipartisan consensus and biased evaluations of politicised facts.\n\nAfter a week of reading these subtly altered feeds, the researchers asked users to rank how warm or cold, favourable or unfavourable they felt towards their political opponents. The changes in “affective polarisation” were ranked at more than two degrees on a 0 to 100 degree “feeling thermometer”. This was the same amount of increased polarisation that typically occurred in the US in the four decades to 2020. Feeding users fewer posts with antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity decreased political division by a similar amount.\n\nSocial media platforms have long been accused of encouraging divisive content to boost user engagement and therefore advertising revenues. But the research found that while there was a slight reduction in overall engagement in terms of time spent on the platform and numbers of posts viewed when divisive content was down-ranked, those users tended to “like” or repost more often.\n\n“The success of this method shows that it can be integrated into social media AI to mitigate harmful personal and societal consequences,” the authors wrote. “At the same time, our engagement analyses indicate a practical trade-off: interventions that down-rank [antidemocratic and partisan content] may reduce short-term engagement volume, posing challenges for engagement-driven business models and supporting the hypothesis that content that provokes strong reactions generates more engagement.”","summary":"Study finds that a week of political content can bring about a shift in views that previously would have taken three years\n\nSmall changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.\n\nA groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/27/partisan-x-posts-increase-political-polarisation-among-users-social-media-research","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bce34435ba0b45acd799c01d4d7f88b251029f96/256_0_2631_2104/master/2631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 19:00:43","author":"Robert Booth","authors":["Robert Booth"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":382984406,"title":"This MAGA leader's angry exit spells mortal danger for Trump","text":"Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene surprised me Friday by announcing her resignation, effective Jan. 5.\n\nI was surprised, because just a few days prior she flexed her muscle when she got the president to step off. She had been demanding the release of the Epstein files. Donald Trump called her a traitor. Though she got death threats, she didn’t budge. Then, last Monday, he caved.\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash said their feud was the breakup heard around the world. That seemed confirmed by Greene’s resignation. Trump called her a RINO (Republican in Name Only). He pledged support for a primary challenger. Indeed, it appeared she is similar to many moderate Republicans, a casualty of a GOP in thrall to Trump.\n\nBut I think there’s another way of looking at it.\n\nFirst, it’s far from certain that she would have lost. As I have said before, Greene is highly attuned to the conspiracy wing of the Republican Party. That’s the faction that demanded the release of the Epstein files. That’s the faction, on hearing last spring that the Justice Department would not make them public, that lost faith in Trump.\n\nGreene stood up to him and won. Would she lose next year? Maybe. But she also raised the question of whether Trump is a spent force.\n\nSecond, Greene is ambitious. She appears to be dissatisfied with representing a district and is aiming for something bigger, perhaps a run for the presidency or, more likely, a role in the pundit corps.\n\nBefore the official “breakup,” Greene said the president “abandoned” his MAGA base. She criticized the Republicans’ role in the longest government shutdown in history. She was vocal about dramatically rising Obamacare premiums. She trashed Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nOn ABC’s The View, co-host Sunny Hostin said, “I feel like I’m sitting next to a completely different Majorie Taylor Greene.” \n\nCo-host Joy Behar said, “Maybe you should become a Democrat.” \n\nIn response, Greene said, “I’m not a Democrat. I think both parties have failed.”\n\nIt doesn’t take much to imagine her as a television pundit who speaks for the alienation of the MAGA faithful from all politics. (Also: she’s resigning in January. Congresspeople don’t usually do that if they believe they can’t win. Instead, they say they aren’t running again.)\n\nThat leads me to my final point. It’s being suggested that Greene wasn’t MAGA enough. Trump declared her persona non grata. As a consequence, she’s resigning. This is the president’s preferred view.\n\nBut the truth is probably the opposite.\n\nGreene is MAGA to the core. She embodies its purest id. She spread the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She defended the J6 insurrection. She suggested support for executing Democrats. The list goes on and on. It could be that Greene is leaving because there’s no future for her. But it could be that she’s leaving because there’s no future for MAGA.\n\nGreene implied as much in her resignation announcement.\n\nIn the video, she characterized herself and Trump voters as loyal soldiers in a rebellion against the establishment. She suggested that they were betrayed by their leader, who joined forces with the enemy.\n\n“I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better. If I am cast aside by the president … and replaced by neocons, big pharma, big tech, military industrial war complex, foreign leaders and the elite donor class that can never ever relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”\n\nBut the strongest evidence to suggest that Greene herself does not believe there’s a future for MAGA came when she said the following:\n\n“There is no plan to save the world or a 4-D chess game being played.”\n\nIt’s just one line, easily overlooked, but it’s critically important. It refers to the story that the conspiracy wing of the Republican Party believes to be the absolute truth — that there is a secret cabal of pedophiles, represented by Jeffrey Epstein, that’s trying to destroy America.\n\nThe hero of the story, Trump, was supposed to return to power after being cheated in 2020 to reveal the names of the conspirators. (They were said to be people like billionaire George Soros and other super-Jews who “control” Democrats like Barack Obama.) The plan was supposed to culminate in a bloody day of reckoning called “The Storm.” It was to vanquish evil, restore justice and make America great again.\n\nWhen the Justice Department decided against releasing the Epstein files, on account of Trump’s name appearing in them too many times, MAGA supporters experienced a crisis of faith. He had forced them to choose between believing in him or believing in their enemies.\n\nIn her resignation announcement, Greene affirmed that the enemies are indeed real: \n\n“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president.”\n\nAnd in saying “there is no plan to save the world,” she came as close as she’ll get to telling supporters they’re right to stop believing in him.\n\nThere will be no storm, she suggests.\n\nShe isn’t a traitor to MAGA.\n\nBut, by implication, Trump is.\n\nThe president’s most zealous supporters have for years been willing to overlook his crimes, because, as believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, they believed he was chosen by God to vanquish villainy.\n\nTheir loyalty got him through the first impeachment. It got him through the pandemic and the J6 insurrection. It got him through the second impeachment. And, after GOP elites left him for dead, it was the basis for his political revival and victory nearly three years later.\n\nHowever, during the past few months, his most zealous supporters have been increasingly demoralized, unsure of what to believe about “the plan.” Now, with the alienation of a figure with impeccable MAGA credentials, they have a persuasive confirmation of their suspicions.\n\nTrump continues to believe, as president, that he can do whatever he wants, the law and the Constitution be damned. He was always mistaken in that belief, but the error is becoming increasingly acute.\n\nHe has divided MAGA, the most powerful political force protecting him from facing the full consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, the opposition is not only more united but downright burning with rage.\n\nThe story of Greene and a demoralized MAGA base is the untold aspect of next year’s congressional elections. Most of the focus is on indie voters who are getting madder about the high cost of essentials, and for good reason. Independents helped Trump beat Kamala Harris.\n\nBut what happens when MAGA thinks of Trump as no better than Harris? As Greene said, “both parties have failed.”\n\nThey don’t vote for Democrats.\n\nThey stay home.","summary":"Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene surprised me Friday by announcing her resignation, effective Jan. 5.\n\nI was surprised, because just a few days prior she flexed her muscle when she got the president to step off. She had been demanding the release of the Epstein files. Donald Trump called her a traitor. Though she got death threats, she didn’t budge. Then, last Monday, he caved.\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash said their feud was the breakup heard around the world. That seemed confirmed by Greene’s resignation. Trump called her a RINO (Republican in Name Only). He pledged support for a primary challenger. Indeed, it appeared she is similar to many moderate Republicans, a casualty of a GOP in thrall to Trump.\n\nBut I think there’s another way of looking at it.\n\nFirst, it’s far from certain that she would have lost. As I have said before, Greene is highly attuned to the conspiracy wing of the Republican Party. That’s the faction that demanded the release of the Epstein files. That’s the faction, on hearing last spri","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/mtg-2674340804/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/maga-hats.jpg?id=61129901&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=187%2C0%2C188%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 17:19:55","author":"John Stoehr","authors":["John Stoehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.463},{"id":382822168,"title":"You can't see this anywhere else' - Macy's 99th Thanksgiving parade kicks off","text":"Skip to content\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nIsrael-Gaza War\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\nUS & Canada\n\nUK Politics\n\nN.
