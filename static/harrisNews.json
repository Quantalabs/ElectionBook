On Wednesday, Politico released an unseen clip from 2021 that showed Porter yelling at a staff member to \"get out of my f------ shot!\" during a video interview. \"Look, it’s uncomfortable to watch, as was the first one,\" Jansing said about the clip. \"But here’s my question: Would the reaction be different if the candidate was a man? Is there still a double standard for women in politics, or is this just bad?\" 'THE VIEW' CO-HOST SAYS KATIE PORTER 'NEEDS TO DO BETTER' AFTER INTERVIEW VIDEO GOES VIRAL Former Lincoln Project adviser Tara Setmayer said that the clip was \"bad all around\" but that there was \"absolutely\" a double standard for women in politics. \"All you have to do is look at how Hillary Clinton was treated when she ran for president versus Donald Trump,\" Setmayer said. \"Look at how Kamala Harris was treated last year against Donald Trump. Look at the way the media treats people in the administration like Stephen Miller, who can have a meltdown on television, or Donald Trump threatening people constantly, or Tom Homan, the ICE czar, the border czar, and the nasty things he says. Go down the list of men who behaved badly but are seemingly rewarded for that with more power.\" LIBERAL MEDIA DARLING IN THE HOT SEAT AFTER EXPLOSIVE INTERVIEW GOES VIRAL She added, \"So there is clearly a double standard in the way that society views how women behave versus men and what’s considered good and bad behavior. And that shouldn’t be the case. But with this case, with Katie Porter, that is just bad.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Porter’s campaign for comment. KATIE PORTER INTERVIEW GOES VIRAL AS JOURNALISTS MARVEL AT DEMOCRAT'S MELTDOWN Porter has come under fire over the last few days after clips of past interviews went viral.

Harris' comments come as part of her effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the 2024 election during her nationwide tour for her new campaign memoir, \"107 Days.\" According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), Harris set the tone for her 90-minute conversation from the moment she stepped on stage, stating, \"He does not have a mandate.\" KAMALA HARRIS TAKES APPARENT SHOT AT TRUMP ADMIN IN BIZARRE OUTBURST: 'THESE MOTHER----- ARE CRAZY' The former vice president also argued that Trump's supporters have been deceived by the president following his election win, saying he has failed to fulfill the promises he ran on. \"I do believe that there are a significant number of people that voted for Donald Trump because they believed him when he said he was going to bring down prices,\" she said. \"And he lied. Today, the cost of groceries is higher, unemployment is higher, inflation is higher. He made them a promise he has not kept.\" Harris has been on a public event blitz since the release of \"107 Days\" in September, kicking off her book tour in New York City before making stops nationwide to promote the new political memoir that walks readers from former President Joe Biden's attempted 2024 run through her picking up the mantle in an effort to defeat President Donald Trump at the ballot box.

He does not have a mandate! That is not a mandate! That is not a mandate!\" she claimed during a stop in Houston on Saturday. Harris lost both the Electoral College and popular vote to Trump during the 2024 election in a defeat that also included each of the seven battleground states voting in favor of Trump. Harris ended the campaign with 75,019,617 total votes to Trump's 77,304,184 votes, and 226 electoral votes to Trump's 312.

Not only will redistricting play a role, but there’s also the gubernatorial race, with Vivek Ramaswamy likely replacing term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine, a fellow Republican. As has been the case for the past few election cycles, Ohio is a state to watch, and 2026 is no exception.\n\nOhio came up during Wednesday’s episode of “The Tony Kinnett Cast.” Former Rep. David McIntosh, the co-founder of The Club for Growth came on to discuss “a midterm blitz” and redistricting. In Ohio, there’s a predicted pick-up of at least two seats. \n\nFrom Redistricting… \n\nMcIntosh emphasized a key point, one Vice President JD Vance made about redistricting. “It’s key that we win these redistricting battles in the state level. The House is very closely divided,” McIntosh reminded.\n\n“The goal here is to add anywhere from five to 10 Republican seats by matching what the Democrat have done for the past decade, and then conservatives and Republicans will be represented in Congress,” he added.\n\nAs Kinnett put it, Ohio is “turning out to be way more important for ’26 than anyone thought.”\n\nNot only is redistricting mandated in Ohio, but some of the closest House races could be there. The two likely pickups are the seats held by Democrat Reps. Marcy Kaptur of the 9th Congressional District and Emilia Sykes of the 13th Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of the 1st Congressional District could be a third. All have been targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nMcIntosh called to mind that there are really only 25-30 “battleground seats,” a category Kaptur and Sykes could certainly fall into. Those 25-30 races further benefit Republicans as “there are more Democrats sitting in a Trump district than Republicans representing a Kamala Harris district,” McIntosh explained. \n\nPresident Donald Trump won the 9th Congressional District and came close in the 13th Congressional District.\n\nMcIntosh later spoke about the search for the ideal candidates, emphasizing the importance of those who are “committed to free markets, limited government, lower taxes, [and] who’s going to support President Trump on that economic agenda,” as well as campaign strategy. McIntosh also referenced the endorsement of Trump, which “is going to tell voters in Ohio, ‘We need you back again, you can’t just vote every four years. This is almost like a referendum on President Trump, get out and vote.'”\n\nAs Kinnett reminded, “Ohio has gone more red in the presidential [races] over the last couple of elections.” Trump won the Buckeye State in 2016, 2020, and 2024, after former President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012.\n\nSpeaking further about the “intensity” of such congressional races, Kinnett predicted that “this could be a big turning point, a big swivel point for the state of Ohio, for the next 10-20 years,” with McIntosh concurring.\n\nMcIntosh and Kinnett brought up Ramaswamy with what McIntosh is “seeing on the ground” in Ohio. Ramaswamy “is exciting Republicans and independents all over the state with his vision for the state,” McIntosh pointed out.\n\nThe U.S. Senate race also came up. Republican Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed to fill Vance’s seat is likely to face former Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost last year to now Sen. Bernie Moreno.\n\n“He’s sounded like one of them but he went back to Washington and just voted with these far-left crazies,” McIntosh said with regards to how Brown is “still trying.” Husted drew a contrast between himself and Brown when speaking to The Daily Signal, framing it as a “D.C. guy versus Ohio guy” race.\n\nIn between his appearances throughout Ohio, Ramaswamy took part in the Turning Point USA tour, speaking at Montana State University on Tuesday. While there, he spoke about the assassination of TPUSA’s Charlie Kirk.\n\nDuring his 20-minute speech, Ramaswamy showed himself to be a charismatic figure, one who likely represents the future of Ohio and the conservative movement. He further demonstrated he is not only unifying the Ohio Republican Party, but that he is a young politician to be on the lookout for. \n\nThe theme of his speech was “a fork in the road for the future of the conservative movement” as well as the importance of American “identity.”\n\nTowards the end of his speech, Ramaswamy referenced his run for governor and the restoration of the American dream.\n\n“That is up to us to deliver to you,” Ramaswamy told the crowd. “And if we fail now, we’ve got nobody left to blame but ourselves. I say that as somebody who is running for governor of my own home state of Ohio, next year. That is the standard I want you to hold me to. We expect that,” he said. “That’s on us. But in the meantime, don’t be cynical about our country, because it’s still the last best hope that we have on planet Earth.”\n\nThe State of the Race(s)\n\nKaptur and Sykes are in “Toss-Up” races, while Landsman’s is regarded as “Lean Democratic” or “Likely Democratic.”\n\nDays after Brown announced in August, an Emerson College poll showed Husted leading Brown. Ramaswamy led Democrat Amy Acton, who has declared, as well as former Rep. Tim Ryan, who has not declared, though there’s chatter he’ll run. Both races “Lean Republican.”\n\nTime will tell, not only when it comes to the effect the redistricting process will have, but how Trump’s second term and the state of affairs in Ohio, the country, and around the world will affect these races.","summary":"The 2026 elections are 13 months away, and they&#8217;ll especially matter in Ohio.

Collier recently alleged that Engelbert said in a private conversation, \"[Caitlin Clark] should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court because without the platform that the WNBA gives her, she wouldn't make anything,\" and that \"Players should be on their knees, thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.\" In her conversation with Harris, Collier defended her decision to make the statements publicly, as the WNBA player's union is currently negotiating with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement.

Caitlin has been a transformational player in this league. She's been a great representative of the game. She’s brought in tens of millions of new fans to the game,\" Engelbert said. Engelbert addressed the alleged comments about the other players, claiming there have been a lot of \"inaccuracies\" reported in the media, but she did not explicitly deny making those comments as she did with the alleged Clark comments. \"There's a lot of innacuracy out there through social media and all this reporting,\" Engelbert said. \"A lot of reporting, a lot of innacuracy about what I say, what I didn't say.\" Engelbert later said, \"I'm disheartened. I'm a human too. I have a family. I have two kids who are devastated by these comments. So, all I say is that it's obviously been a tough week, and I just think there's a lot of innacuracy out there.\" Still, Engelbert acknowledged that if players don't feel \"appreciated\" then she has to do better. \"I was disheartened to hear that some players feel the league and that I personally do not care about them or listen to them,\" Engelbert said before Game 1 of the WNBA Finals Friday night. \"If the players in the ‘W’ don’t feel appreciated and value from the league, we have to do better, and I have to do better.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The players’ association and the WNBA agreed to an eight-year agreement in 2020, but the WNBPA voted last year to opt out of the agreement early.

Make no mistake about that,\" David Ellison said Thursday at Bloomberg's Screentime media conference in Hollywood, adding that his father had been a \"phenomenal\" mentor and \"we couldn't have a better relationship.\" \"He is the largest shareholder in the business,\" Ellison said. \"What's important for everybody to know is the way he approaches this is: How do we maximize value for our shareholders? ... I think he's best in the world for doing that.\" Since the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners acquired Paramount in August, its stock is up more than 50%. Much of the run-up came last month after news leaked that Paramount was interested in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, TBS, Food Network and one of Hollywood's most prolific film and television studios. Ellison refused to comment on Paramount's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery or whether his team had already made a bid. But he did shed light on the business strategy behind any pursuit, while trying to tamp down fears that another big merger would result in more cost-cutting, more job losses and a reduction in content spending. \"The way we approach everything is, first and foremost: What's good for the talent community, what's good for our shareholders and value creation, and what's good for basically storytelling at large?\" Ellison said. \"We're looking at actually producing more movies [and] more television series ... because you need that content.\" Paramount staffers are bracing for a massive workforce reduction next month, part of the company's goal of finding more than $2 billion in spending cuts. But, since the takeover, Paramount's Ellison has made a priority of beefing up relationships with talent through a series of big bets, including agreeing to pay $7.7 billion for media rights to UFC’s mixed martial arts events in the U.S. in a seven-year deal with TKO Group Holdings. The company also invested in the construction of a Texas-based production hub for prolific “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan and agreed to pay $1.5 billion over five years for streaming rights for “South Park,” the Comedy Central cartoon. And Paramount lured Matt and Ross Duffer, who created “Stranger Things,” away from Netflix with an exclusive four-year television, streaming and film deal. Earlier this week, Paramount spent $150 million to acquire Bari Weiss' the Free Press news site, while also naming Weiss editor in chief of CBS News. Warner Bros. Discovery, led by Chief Executive David Zaslav, also has declined to discuss Paramount's interest, although people close to the company have suggested Zaslav would like to see bidding war. No other studios have publicly expressed interest and, on Wednesday, Netflix Co-Chief Executive Greg Peters downplayed such speculation. “We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,” Peters said during a separate appearance at the Screentime conference, adding the track record for big mergers was not great. But Wall Street widely expects more consolidation among entertainment firms. \"Ironically, it was David Zaslav last year who said that consolidation in the media business is important,\" Ellison said, adding \"there are a lot of options out there.\" But he declined to elaborate. Analysts have speculated that, beyond Paramount, few other media companies have financial firepower to pull off a bid. And Paramount has an \"in\" that several other media companies, including Brian Roberts' Comcast, lack: a good relationship with President Trump and his administration. Trump has called Larry Ellison a good friend. After David Ellison spoke with Trump at a June UFC fight, the previous managers of Paramount got traction in their efforts to settle Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview last fall with Kamala Harris. Paramount paid $16 million in July to settle the suit and weeks later the Federal Communications Commission approved the Ellison takeover of Paramount. \"We have a good relationship with the administration,\" David Ellison said.","summary":"Larry Ellison helped finance the $8-billion takeover of Paramount, and his largesse would be key in any deal for Warner Bros. Discovery.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-10-09/paramounts-david-ellison-addresses-his-fathers-role-and-relationship-with-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fd3204/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3456x2304+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2Fe8%2F0dbac0584a90924f4ae1e7f2f808%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 20:40:02","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.323},{"id":367826212,"title":"Meghan Markle to Join Kamala Harris, Selena Gomez and More at “Fortune's” Most Powerful Women Summit","text":"Meghan Markle is joining a group of powerful women — including Kamala Harris, Selena Gomez and more — at Fortune's annual Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, D.C., next week.\n\n The Duchess of Sussex will sit down with Fortune's Alyson Shontell on Tuesday, Oct. 14, to discuss launching her line of As ever lifestyle products, as well as \"navigating entrepreneurship in the public eye and building a brand that will endure.\"\n\n The three-day event will also include talks by former Vice President Harris, on her presidential campaign and recently-released book, 107 Days; Selena Gomez, on her Rare Beauty brand; Kara Lawson, on coaching the USA Women's Basketball Team; Brené Brown on team leadership and company culture; and more.\n\n The appearance caps off a busy stretch of travel for Meghan, who is in New York City this week with Prince Harry to receive an award for their charity work, following her debut at Paris Fashion Week last weekend.\n\n The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being presented with Project Healthy Minds’ Humanitarians of the Year Award at the nonprofit's third annual World Mental Health Day Gala on Thursday, Oct. 9.\n\n The couple, who have partnered with Project Healthy Minds for the last two years, are being recognized, as co-founders of their Archwell Foundation, for their \"commitment to mental health support and building a safer, more equitable digital world for today's youth and families.\"\n\n In a statement last month, Harry and Meghan said, \"Working with families and young people to prioritize safety online has been some of the most meaningful work of our lives.

Weiss is a vocal supporter of Israel and a fierce critic of antisemitism that has spread across the US since Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel two years ago.\n\nWeiss’ right-of-center views, that also include anti-wokism and scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, have roiled the liberal network, which as reported by The Post has been compared to a “snake pit” by current and former CBS staffers.\n\nIn his memo to staff on Monday, Ellison lamented a “partisan” environment consumed by “hostile disputes” and said Weiss will bring “rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum.”\n\nEllison’s Skydance merged with Paramount in August for $8 billion, and as part of the deal, the newly-formed company vowed to the Federal Communications Commission that it would address bias complaints.\n\nWeeks before the merger was approved by the FCC, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nThe network denied any wrongdoing, but it eventually settled the lawsuit, with Ellison sweetening the deal by agreeing to throw in an additional $20 million in pro-MAGA advertising to get the deal done, Trump has said\n\nAside from the Harris scandal, the network was forced to fend off calls of bias over its Israel coverage, which riled the company’s then-controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\n\nAmong the complaints was a controversial “60 Minutes” segment featuring State Department officials who quit over American support for Israel’s efforts to root out Hamas terrorists in Gaza — a piece that the American Jewish Committee said was “shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information.”","summary":"\"This is the first time she [Bari] really got involved [in the editorial meeting].

Smith said on his show that the Democratic Party has anointed their nominees in recent elections rather than letting Americans choose them — unlike Republicans since President Donald Trump entered politics. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary Cleaning Up Kamala HERE)\n\n“See, when I talked about voting for Kamala Harris, I wasn’t excited about her. And as far as I’m concerned, she didn’t earn it because she didn’t go through a primary. And the Democrats talking about ‘a threat to democracy’ — shut the hell up,” Smith said. “I don’t want to hear that because you didn’t care about that when you circumvented the democratic process to make sure that the vice president, the former vice president, would be able to bypass a Democratic primary and go straight to the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States.”\n\n“You could have got Joe Biden out earlier, but you didn’t do it because you wanted her there because it was her turn. In 2016, when Hillary had competition, Hillary Rodham Clinton — oh, it was her turn,” he continued. “When Biden was getting smoked in the primaries before [Democratic South Carolina] Representative Clyburn came to save the day, it was his turn. That’s my problem with the Democrats.”\n\nBiden and Harris both campaigned in 2024 on Trump supposedly threatening American democracy. Moreover, Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett has repeatedly compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, while Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have accused Republicans of being fascists.\n\nFurthermore, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in May agreed with comedian Akaash Singh on “Flagrant” that the Democratic Party was “a threat to democracy,” based on its presidential primary process since 2008.\n\n“I’m not going to argue with that point,” Sanders said. “And that’s why I’m proudly an independent.”\n\nEven left-wing voters and former President Bill Clinton adviser Doug Schoen asserted at the time of Harris becoming the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee that they were dissatisfied with the process.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Biden was the first president to recognize Indigenous People's Day.Columbus day vs. indigenous peoples’ dayColumbus Day, a federal holiday since 1971, has long been celebrated in honor of Christopher Columbus and embraced by many Italian Americans as a symbol of cultural pride, as per Fox News. However, in recent years, the holiday has become a flashpoint for debate, as activists and Indigenous groups argue that celebrating Columbus overlooks the suffering of Native Americans that followed European colonization.Critics contend that Columbus’s arrival in 1492 marked the beginning of centuries of violence, displacement, and genocide against Indigenous peoples. They have pushed to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, a day that recognizes and honors the history, resilience, and cultures of Native Americans.Several US cities and states have since adopted Indigenous Peoples’ Day in place of Columbus Day, and statues of Columbus have been removed or toppled during protests, particularly amid the social unrest of 2020.Former Vice President Kamala Harris has voiced support for the shift, urging Americans to confront what she called the nation’s “shameful past” tied to European exploration and colonization.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onColumbus DayIndigenous Peoples' DayDonald TrumpChristopher ColumbusJoe Bidencolumbusindigenous peoples daytrumpTrump columbus dayColumbus Day vs indigenous peoples’ day\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

In the video, Porter yells, “Get out of my f*ing shot!” This clip has caused a lot of anger online and made people question how she treats her staff.The video was reportedly filmed in 2021 during a talk with Jennifer Granholm about electric cars and saving money for Californians, according to a report by TOI. A masked staff member sneaks in behind as Porter stands talking in a kitchen, trying to issue a correction in her statement. But that pisses Porter off, who sends a barrage of expletives in the staffers way before readying to re-start her remarks. However, the original footage—released in 2021—has now been edited out. The unedited clip resurfaced this week, creating a fresh political problem for Porter. The timing is bad for Porter because she is currently running for California governor in 2026, trying to appear as a progressive but practical leader. Recent interview troubleJust a few days before this video came out, Porter faced another controversy during a CBS News interview. When asked how she would win support from Trump voters, Porter got defensive and asked, “How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?”, as mentioned in the report by TOI. She then called the interview “unnecessarily argumentative” and tried to remove her microphone to end it early. These two incidents together have revived old concerns about her temperament and leadership behavior.Who is Katie Porter?A native of Fort Dodge, Iowa, Porter was born in 1974. She is both a Yale and Harvard alumni, getting degrees in American studies and law from them respectively. Porter taught law at the University of California, Irvine, focusing on bankruptcy and consumer finance. During the 2008 money crisis, she worked on mortgage deals for then–Attorney General Kamala Harris, which made her known for helping consumers. In 2018, she made news by winning a Republican area in Orange County, one of the first Democrats to win there in many years.Live EventsPorter became famous for her whiteboard questioning in Congress, grilling bank and pharma executives over prices and fees. Fans called her the “whiteboard warrior” for her sharp questioning style. She tried to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2023 but lost to Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey in 2024. Now, she is running to become California’s governor after Gavin Newsom. She calls herself a leader who wants big changes for the people.A pattern of tensionThe video coming back has made people talk again about Porter being a strict boss. Some former staff say she wants everything perfect and loses her temper quickly, while her supporters say she is just a tough but fair boss.Porter issued a statement saying she holds herself and her team to “a high standard” and tries to be “more intentional in showing gratitude”, as mentioned in the report by TOI.She did not say sorry directly, but her tone shows she knows this may have caused problems. Some people in her own party now say this seems like she gets angry often, not just once. Political aides fear that the angry video and CBS interview together could hurt her image as a disciplined and strong candidate. Analysts say this could damage her chances, since voters expect calmness from someone running for a governor’s role. Porter's image of being tough but fair may now look more like uncontrolled aggression, which could confuse voters about her personality. A high-stakes electionThe 2026 California governor race will be watched by many people in the U.S. Porter used to be seen as a rising progressive leader. Now, she has a tough job to win back trust from voters and her staff. She is still good at her policies and media work, but recent problems make people focus more on her behavior than her ideas. People from other parties may use these incidents to say she is not stable or ready for office.Despite all this, Porter remains defiant and continues campaigning statewide, saying her record of fighting powerful interests matters more than “any viral clip”, as stated by TOI report. However, experts warn that in today’s media age, one emotional outburst can overshadow years of hard work and discipline.FAQsQ1.

They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.\n\nThe singer born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.\n\nSince the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.\n\nFor his fans, Bad Bunny’s booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.\n\nRoc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\nHe is a known global hitmaker who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles.\n\nOn Saturday, Bad Bunny hosted the season 51 premiere of “Saturday Night Live” with a few jokes about his forthcoming Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nHe has long been critical of President Donald Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Some Trump supporters consider his Super Bowl booking to be a divisive political pick.\n\n“I’ve never heard of him,” Trump said in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax when asked about Bad Bunny. “I don’t know who he is… I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”","summary":"Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States when comparing the week before.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/09/bad-bunny-streams-soar/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TV_-_SNL_68310_5584c6.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 17:57:30","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.085},{"id":367789978,"title":"Jane Fonda, derided as ‘Hanoi Jane’ and a traitor during the Vietnam War, is a modern-day force in Democratic politics","text":"By Seema Mehta, Los Angeles Times\n\nLOS ANGELES — Celebrated for decades as Hollywood royalty, Jane Fonda could easily be living a comfortable life of extravagance and leisure.\n\nInstead, the 87-year-old actor and Vietnam War-era provocateur is as likely to be seen knocking on voters’ doors in Phoenix on a balmy summer afternoon as sashaying down a red carpet at a glitzy movie premiere.\n\nPolitically active for more than a half-century, Fonda is now focusing her energy, celebrity, connections and resources on fighting climate change and combating the “existential crises” created by President Trump.\n\nCalling fossil fuels a threat to humanity, Fonda created JanePAC, a political action committee that has spent millions on candidates at the forefront of that fight.\n\n“Nature has always been in my bones, in my cells,” Fonda said in a recent interview, describing herself as an environmentalist since her tomboy youth. “And then, about 10 years ago … I started reading more, and I realized what we’re doing to the climate, which means what we’re doing to us, what we’re doing to the future, to our grandchildren and our children.\n\n“Our existence is being challenged all because an industry, the fossil-fuel industry, wants to make more money,” she said. “I mean, I try to understand what, what must they think when they go to sleep at night? These men, they’re destroying everything.”\n\nRather than hosting fancy political fundraisers or headlining presidential campaign rallies, Fonda devotes her efforts to electing like-minded state legislators, city council members, utility board officials and candidates in other less flashy but critical races.\n\nFonda said her organization took its cue from successful GOP tactics.\n\n“I hate to say this, but you know, in terms of playing the long game, the Republicans have been better than the Democrats,” she said. “They started to work down ballot, and they took over state legislatures. They took over governorships and mayors and city councils, boards of supervisors, and before we knew what had happened, they had power on the grassroots level.”\n\nFonda said her PAC selects candidates to back based on their climate-change record and viability. The beneficiaries include candidates running for state legislature and city council. Some of the races are often obscure, such as the Silver River Project board (an Arizona utility), the Port of Bellingham commission in Washington and the Lane Community College board in Oregon.\n\n“Down ballot, if you come in, especially for primaries, you can really make a difference. You know, not all Democrats are the same,” she said. “We want candidates who have shown public courage in standing up to fossil fuels. We want candidates who can win. We’re not a protest PAC. We’re in it to win it.”\n\nSince her birth, Fonda’s life has been infused by political activism.\n\nHer father, the late actor Henry Fonda, witnessed the lynching of a Black man during the 1919 Omaha race riots when he was 14, casting him into becoming a lifelong liberal.\n\nThough such matters were not discussed at the dinner table, Fonda’s father raised money for Democratic candidates and starred in politically imbued films such as “The Grapes of Wrath,” about the exploitation of migrant workers during the Dust Bowl, and “12 Angry Men,” which focused on prejudice, groupthink and the importance of due process during the McCarthy era.\n\nBut his daughter Jane did not become politically active until her early 30s.\n\n“Before then, I kind of led a life of ignorance, somewhat hedonistic,” she said. “Maybe deep down, I knew that once I know something, I can’t turn away.”\n\nIn “Prime Time,” Fonda’s 2011 memoir, she describes the final chapter of her life as a time of “coming to fruition rather than simply a period of marking time, or the absence of youth.”\n\n“Unlike during childhood, Act III is a quiet ripening. It takes time and experience, and yes, perhaps the inevitable slowing down,” she wrote. “You have to learn to sort out what’s fundamentally important to you from what’s irrelevant.”\n\nIn 1972, Fonda appeared in Jean-Luc Godard’s film “Tout Va Bien,” about workers’ rights in the aftermath of widespread street protests in France four years earlier. It was her first role in a political movie and coincided with her off-screen move into activism.\n\nFonda’s most noteworthy and reviled political moment occurred the same year, when she was photographed by the North Vietnamese sitting atop an antiaircraft gun.\n\nThe images led to Fonda being tarred as “Hanoi Jane” and a traitor to the United States, which had deployed millions of American soldiers to Southeast Asia, many of whom never returned. Fonda says it is something she “will regret to my dying day.”\n\n“It is possible that it was a setup, that the Vietnamese had it all planned,” Fonda wrote in 2011. “I will never know. But if they did, I can’t blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake.”\n\nFonda married liberal activist Tom Hayden in 1973. He served in the California Legislature for 18 years and was a force in Democratic politics until his death in 2016.\n\nFonda’s political beliefs have been a through line in her Hollywood career.\n\nIn 1979, she played a reporter in “The China Syndrome,” a film about a fictional meltdown at a nuclear power plant near Los Angeles. The movie’s theatrical release occurred less than two weeks before the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe 1980 movie “9 to 5,” starring Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, was a biting comedy that highlighted the treatment of women in the workplace and income inequality long before such issues were routinely discussed in workplaces.\n\nTwo years later, as home VCRs grew popular, Fonda created exercise videos that shattered sales records.\n\nShe urged women to “feel the burn,” and revenue from the videos funded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a political action committee founded by Fonda and Hayden.\n\nThis year, Fonda offered signed copies to donors to JanePAC, which she created in 2022.\n\n“I’m still in shock that those leg warmers and leotards caught on the way they did,” Fonda wrote to supporters in April. “If you’ve ever done one of my leg lifts, or even thought about doing one, now’s your chance to own a piece of that history.”\n\nUCLA lecturer Jim Newton, a veteran Los Angeles Times political journalist and historian of the state’s politics, described Fonda as confrontational, controversial and unapologetic.\n\n“She’s remarkable, utterly admirable, a principled person who has devoted her life to fighting for what she believes in,” said Newton, who quotes Fonda in his new book, “Here Beside the Rising Tide: Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and an American Awakening.”\n\nNewton added that Fonda’s outspoken nature certainly harmed her career.\n\n“I’m sure that there are directors, producers, whatnot, especially in the ’70s and ’80s, who passed on chances to work with her because of her politics,” he said. “And I’m sure she knew that, right? She did it. It’s not been without sacrifice. She’s true to herself, like very few people.”\n\nA year after Fonda and Hayden divorced in 1990, she married CNN founder and philanthropist Ted Turner, who she once described as “my favorite ex-husband.” Though Fonda largely paused her acting career during their decade-long marriage, she remained politically active.\n\nIn 1995, Fonda founded a Georgia effort dedicated to reducing teenage pregnancy. Five years later, she launched the Jane Fonda Center for Reproductive Health at Emory University.\n\nAfter Fonda and Turner divorced, she worked with Tomlin on raising the minimum wage in Michigan and then launched Fire Drill Fridays — acts of civil disobedience — with Greenpeace in 2019.\n\nFonda said she decided to create her political action committee after facing headwinds persuading Gov. Gavin Newsom to create setbacks for oil wells in 2020.\n\n“He wasn’t moving on it, and somebody very high up in his campaign said to us, ‘You can have millions of people in your organization all over California, but you don’t have a big enough carrot or stick to move the governor. … You don’t have an electoral strategy,’” Fonda recalled. “Since we’ve started the PAC, it’s interesting how politicians deal with us differently. They know that we’ve got money. They know that we have tens of thousands of volunteers all over the country.”\n\nInitially concentrated on climate change, JanePAC has expanded its focus since Trump was reelected in November.\n\n“We’re facing two existential crises, climate and democracy, and it’s now or never for both,” Fonda said. “We can’t have a stable democracy with an unstable climate, and we can’t have a stable climate unless we have a democracy, And so we have to fight both together.”\n\nFonda’s PAC has raised more than $9 million since its creation through June 30, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn 2024, JanePAC supported 154 campaigns and won 96 of those races. The committee gave nearly $700,000 directly to campaigns and helped raise more than $1.1 million for their endorsed candidates and ballot measures. In 2025, they have endorsed 63 campaigns and plan to soon launch get-out-the-vote efforts in support of Proposition 50, Newsom’s ballot measure to redraw California’s congressional districts that will appear on the November ballot.\n\nArizona state Rep. Oscar De Los Santos, the minority leader in the state’s House of Representatives, recalled Fonda’s support during the 2024 election, not only for his reelection bid but also a broader effort to try to win Democratic control of the state Legislature.\n\nIn addition to raising $500,000 at a Phoenix event for candidates, De Los Santos recalled the actor spending days knocking on Arizona voters’ doors.\n\n“It is a moral validator to have Jane Fonda support your campaigns, especially at a time when corporate interests have more money and more power than ever, having somebody in your corner who’s been on the right side of history for decades,” said De Los Santos, who represents a south Phoenix district deeply affected by environmental justice issues.\n\nVoters are often stunned when Fonda shows up on their doorstep.\n\n“I’ve had people walking out of their laundry room and dropping all the laundry,” Fonda said with a laugh.\n\nBut others don’t know who she is and Fonda doesn’t tell them.\n\n“It’s amazing. You wouldn’t think that in just a few minutes on someone’s doorstep, you can really find out a lot,” Fonda said, recalling discovering her love of canvassing when she was married to Hayden.”I loved talking to people and finding out what they care about and what they’re scared of and what they’re angry about.”\n\nFonda does not walk in lockstep with the Democratic party. In 2023, she joined other climate-change activists protesting a big-money Joe Biden fundraiser. They argued that the then-president had strayed from the environmental promises he made when he ran for election, such as by approving a massive oil drilling project on the North Slope of Alaska.\n\nFonda said she supported Biden’s 2024 reelection despite disagreeing with some of his policies because of the threat she believed Trump poses.\n\n“When you see what the choice was, of course you’re going to vote,” she said. “I get so mad at people who say, you know, ‘I don’t like him, so I’m not going to vote.’ [A] young person said to me, we already have fascism. They don’t know history. You know, we don’t teach civics anymore, so they don’t understand that what’s happening now is leading to fascism. I mean, this is real tyranny.”\n\nBut she also faulted Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris after she became the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, as well as 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, for failing to speak to the economic pain being experienced by Americans who backed Trump.\n\n“They’re not all MAGA,” she said.\n\nMany were just angry and hurting, she said, because they couldn’t afford groceries or pay medical bills. Fonda believes many now have buyer’s remorse.\n\nFonda reflected on the parallels between the turmoil in the 1960s and today. In the interview, which took place before the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, she argued that today’s political climate is more perilous.\n\n“I’m not sure that what we have right now in the U.S. is a democracy,” she said. “It’s far graver. Far, far graver now than it was.”\n\nFonda said she remains driven, not by blind optimism, but by immersing herself in work that she believes makes a difference.\n\n“This is what I’m going to be doing for the rest of my life,” she said.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Bush, announced this week he is running for governor in Maine.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Bush’s campaign for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBush’s campaign will be a key test as to whether there is still room for a more traditional version of conservatism in the Republican party, which has become increasingly dominated by President Donald Trump’s style of politics. In 2022, George P. Bush’s defeat in the Texas attorney general GOP primary was viewed as the potential end of the decades-long political dynasty, but Jonathan Bush’s campaign could give the family an opportunity to reboot its influence over the GOP.\n\nMaine is a Democratic-leaning state that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about seven percentage points last November. But it does have an independent streak and has been willing to support moderate Republicans like Senator Susan Collins in the past.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nBush, the co-founder of Athenahealth, who has been speculated to be considering a campaign, officially jumped into the race on Wednesday—joining many other Republicans and Democrats hoping to succeed incumbent Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat who cannot run for reelection due to term limits.\n\n“Maine is the greatest place on earth to live and raise a family, but for many Mainers, it’s gotten too hard to achieve the American dream here. We’re paying too much to Augusta and getting too little,” he said in a campaign launch video. “Maine needs big change. I’ve made my career disrupting the status quo, creating jobs and helping people achieve their American dream.”\n\nBush touted support for auditing the state government, lowering taxes, investing in trade schools, and erasing regulations as ways he would advance Maine’s economy.\n\nA Newsweek illustration shows Jonathan Bush, running for Maine governor, with Jeb Bush and former President George W. Bush.\n\nBush has cast himself as a disruptor and problem solver in a state where Republicans typically need to be moderate to win a majority of voters. President Trump will likely loom over the primary and general election—candidates like Bush may need to walk a fine line to win support from Trump-aligned conservatives without alienating moderates in the general election.\n\nBush is a nephew to former President George H.W. Bush, cousin to former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and grandson to former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush. He has ties to Maine, with the Walker’s Point Estate in Kennebunkport serving as a summer retreat.\n\nMaine politics experts told Newsweek in August that there could be Republicans in Maine who support the idea of a more moderate candidate—and that there could be a path to victory for Bush.\n\n“There are still Republicans in Maine who have fond memories of the Bush family, and some who support an idea of moderate, or at least non-Trumpish, conservatism who could well be open to such a candidate, and there are Republicans who hope to follow Trump’s political path. I don’t think it’s been established yet which faction is stronger,” Ronald Schmidt, professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine, told Newsweek at the time.\n\nBush won’t be the only candidate whose family has political ties. Both the son of Senator Angus King, Angus King III, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and Representative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, are already in the race on the Democratic side.\n\nSeveral other notable candidates are also running, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson on the Democratic side. Republican candidates include Robert Charles, former U.S. assistant secretary of state, and State Senator James Libby.\n\nForecasters give Democrats an advantage in the race—the Cook Political Report classifies it as Likely Democratic, and Sabato’s Crystal Ball views it as Lean Democratic.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nGOP candidate Robert Charles wrote on X: “Our state faces unparalleled chaos thanks to Augusta Democrats, and now has the chance to elect a conservative Governor who will cut crime, cut taxes and end Augusta Democrats’ nonsense. We cannot waste this once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix Maine on a divisive, Never-Trump elitist whose entire political identity is built on a hatred for the leader who delivered record jobs, border security, and American First policies.”\n\nJonathan Bush told WGAN on Friday: “I think Maine’s biggest problem is its economic growth crisis. That it’s just accepted it’s going to be a shrinking pie, and a shrinking pie is no way to live. We’re going to make more pie in Maine, and that’s what I’m going to do as governor.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMaine’s primary election is set for June 9, 2026, and the general election for November 3, 2026. Candidates like Bush will spend the coming months making their cases to voters about why the...","summary":"Jonathan Bush announced he is running for governor, joining several other candidates in the race to succeed Governor Janet Mills.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bush-family-makes-move-to-reboot-dynasty-official-in-maine-10855360","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bush-family-makes-moves-reboot-political.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 17:09:25","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.096},{"id":367764906,"title":"Cabinet spontaneously applauds as Trump signs Columbus Day proclamation: 'We're back, Italians'","text":"President Donald Trump's Cabinet and others at the White House broke out into applause Thursday afternoon when Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. \"Today we have your Columbus Day proclamation for Monday, which we're signing a bit early,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf told Trump Thursday ahead of the monthly Cabinet meeting. \"Columbus, obviously, discovered the new world in 1492. He was a great Italian explorer. He sailed his three ships, the Nina, the Pinto and Santa Maria, across the Atlantic Ocean, and landed in what's today the Caribbean.

The press actually broke out in applause. Good. Columbus Day. We're back. Columbus Day. We're back, Italians. We love the Italians.\" Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1971, following decades of the Italian American community already celebrating the explorer and previous presidents recognizing the holiday with their own proclamations. Activists in recent years, however, have worked to disassociate the day from Columbus — claiming it celebrates colonialism and genocide of indigenous people — in favor of celebrating Native Americans. Activists also have worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was among political leaders who favored celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day, and called on Americans in 2021 to \"not shy away\" from its \"shameful past\" of European explorers. \"Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for Tribal nations — perpetrating violence, stealing land and spreading disease,\" she said just one day after Columbus Day 2021. \"We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on Native communities today.\" DAVID MARCUS: BRING BACK THE REDSKINS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE TORN DOWN BY WOKENESS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump also signed another proclamation Thursday honoring Viking explorer Leif Erikson on Oct. 9.

Dan Goldman of New York on live TV Wednesday, blasting him for twisting facts about a Minnesota politician’s murder and calling President Donald Trump a “fascist.”\n\nICE facilities in Chicago and Portland, Oregon have been the scene of multiple riots targeting the agency amid the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, prompting Trump to deploy the National Guard to protect federal property. During a heated exchange on “CNN NewsNight” over the move, Goldman clashed with Lyman and “Just Right” host Phil Williams, claiming host Abby Phillip was “fact-checking” the two conservatives before denouncing Trump as a “fascist.” (RELATED: Ana Navarro Freaks Out When CNN Panelist Points Out Criminal Illegal Immigrants)\n\n“You’re not going to sit here and fact-check us when you spread the Russia collusion hoax, come on!” Lyman said, prompting Goldman to respond, “I didn’t actually fact-check you. Abby did.”\n\nAfter some back and forth, Williams pointed out the Biden administration’s record on the border.\n\n“You’re absolutely on the wrong side — you’re on the wrong side of history on all of this, and you know it. You’re on the absolute wrong side of history. Your party ruined the border control policies of this — of this nation. You let 11 to 12 to 13 million people stream across the border. And now we’re dealing with it. And you don’t want [to] deal with the fact that we have to deal with that,” Williams told Goldman, who responded, “I guarantee you, I can guarantee you, that you are on the wrong side of history because this President is authoritarian and he is a fascist.”\n\n“That is assassination prep language,” Lyman shot back in response to the rhetoric. Goldman tried to walk it back as Lyman cut him off, accusing him of using language that justifies violence.\n\nGoldman started to object that calling Trump a fascist doesn’t incite violence, but Phillip cut in and played a clip of Trump calling then-Vice President Kamala Harris a “Marxist” and “fascist.”\n\n“Look, I respect the ‘both sides’ attempt right here right now, but I think in the current political climate — in the current political climate, when the political violence has been directed to one side, which is to my side, the right side-” Lyman said before Goldman interrupted, “No, it’s not.”\n\n“Oh, it’s not? Did Charlie Kirk just get assassinated a month ago on the today?” Lyman shot back, while Williams also mentioned Kirk and an attack on an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas.\n\nGoldman then tried to bring up the murders of Democratic State Rep. Melissa Hortman of Minnesota and her husband.\n\n“By a guy who had a flag that said, ‘No Kings,’ or flyers that said, ‘No Kings?’ Who was appointed by Tim Walz?” Lyman shot back.\n\nThe accused killer of Hortman claimed he was acting on behalf of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in a letter to the FBI, according to the New York Daily News.

It’s actually about whether you’re asserting that using certain words is essentially violence,” Phillip claimed. “And I’m trying to argue to you that if you’re going to apply that standard to Congressman Goldman, you got to apply it to Donald Trump. And if you don’t apply it to Donald Trump and you don’t think that that’s violence, then I don’t understand how this works.”\n\n“Abby, I don’t know if maybe you weren’t listening to what I just said. I just said it’s unacceptable for no matter who it is to call someone else a fascist,” Lyman responded. “And let me explain the assassination prep language. When people hear the word fascist, Nazi, Hitler, you rightfully think of people in the 1940s who had to be defeated by any means necessary because of what they were doing to this world.”\n\n“So, when you call someone like Charlie Kirk, when you call someone like Speaker Gilbert, like Jay Jones, who I don’t know if your viewers know this because it hasn’t been discussed on this show in four days,” Lyman continued, closing with emphasis. “When the attorney general candidate in Virginia is calling for two bullets to the head for Speaker Gilbert and calling his little children fascists, you are implicitly justifying resistance by any means necessary.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Armitas said he has been working with a Washington-based FBI special agent since March on a forensic re-examination of a case that had seemed no closer to a solution than it was over 1,700 days ago.\n\nArmitas carefully laid out every step the hoodie-wearing suspect took in planting devices at the Democratic National Committee and the Capitol Hill Club, a private Republican social club, on Jan. 5, 2021.\n\nHis report includes a number of surprises, including the contention that the DNC pipe bomb was planted on Jan. 5, retrieved a few hours later so it wouldn’t be discovered too soon, and placed again just in time for two police officers to discover it at 1:05 p.m. Jan. 6.\n\nHe also says video released by the FBI was digitally altered to make it more difficult to identify a suspect.\n\nThe pipe bombs saga began with an account of a ham-handed 5'7\" suspect wearing a grey hoodie and rare Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers who allegedly planted live pipe bombs on the southwest side of the Democratic National Committee headquarters and the rear of the Capitol Hill Club adjacent to the Republican National Committee headquarters.\n\nIn the months and years since, the FBI and Metropolitan Police Department put up a $500,000 reward for clues leading to an arrest in the case. No arrests have been made.\n\nVideo probe maps out FBI problems\n\nArmitas said he was told that his report needed to be submitted prior to Oct. 7. He addressed the report to U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), chairman of the House Select Subcommittee to Investigate the Remaining Questions Surrounding Jan. 6.\n\n‘The physical profile of the device is in the opposite orientation from how it was discovered.’\n\nArmitas’ report says video footage released by the FBI of the hoodie-wearing suspect was digitally altered. Software was used to crop the image area and reduce the video frame rate, he said.\n\nThe suspect planted a device under a park bench on the southwest side of the DNC headquarters at 7:54 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 5, 2021. While sitting on the bench, the suspect retrieved a phone from a backpack and appeared to send a text message before bending down and laying the device in the mulch.\n\n“After they sit down near the park bench, they plant the DNC device with no apparent attempt to wind or set the device up,” Armitas wrote. “However, the physical profile of the device is in the opposite orientation from how it was discovered.”\n\nRELATED: Bongino may have given big hint about nature of J6-related pipe bomb case\n\n The Jan. 6 pipe bombs found under a bench at the Democratic National Committee (left) and hidden next to garbage bins behind the Capitol Hill Club.FBI photos\n\nThe pipe bombs each had 60-minute egg timers attached, a detail that makes no obvious sense considering that the devices were planted at least 16 hours before they were discovered.\n\n“We see the short end facing out on the 5th, but on the 6th you see the long end facing out,” the report said of the DNC device. “Notice also that the dial is upside down and not oriented in a way to wind it or attach the clips.”\n\nVideo released by the FBI from the southern DNC security camera was originally high-definition footage with a 16:9 aspect ratio, but it was manipulated by software to a 4:3 aspect ratio with a much lower frame rate, Armitas said.\n\n The hoodie-wearing pipe-bomb suspect appears to wave at a Capitol Police SUV along 1st Street Southeast at 8:14p.m. Jan. 5, 2021.BlazeTV/The Mandate\n\nA map video released by the FBI used two camera angles with videos supposedly in sync, but they were actually out of sync by “around 15 seconds,” he said.\n\n“The DNC video has been doctored so much and so hard that it is no longer representative of events in real time,” he said in the report.\n\nThe DNC pipe bomb was not found during a Secret Service K-9 security sweep of the DNC building early Jan. 6 for a pending visit of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\nDNC device apparently retrieved — and replaced by a cop?\n\nArmitas said he believes the DNC device was placed Jan. 5 but retrieved from under the bench shortly before 4:40 a.m. on Jan. 6. The location of the DNC device was too public, and the device had been broken on Jan. 5 when the suspect tried to plant it next to the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, he said.\n\nThere was too much of a risk of the bomb being discovered after daylight. Given the Secret Service, Capitol Police, and Metropolitan Police Department presence at the DNC on the morning of the 6th, it seems most likely that the device would be discovered too early, he said.\n\n“There’s almost no possible way that the bomb could have been at the DNC for 17 hours and it not be discovered,” Armitas said.\n\nThe pipe bomber originally tried to plant the device under a bush next to the Congressional Black Caucus Institute in the 400 block of New Jersey Avenue Southeast, according to Armitas’ video research.\n\nRELATED: How the Capitol Police were set up to fail on January 6\n\n The DNC pipe bomb was retrieved by a man with a red Nike backpack just prior to 4:40 a.m. Jan. 6, who walked north and handed it off to someone in a Dodge Charger, a researcher says.U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nThe device broke apart, leaving a piece behind under the bush. The broken component was noticed just after 1 p.m. on Jan. 6 by a construction worker and a short time later by a Capitol Police countersurveillance officer, he said.\n\nBased on his video analysis, Armitas said the DNC bomb was retrieved by a man wearing a red Nike backpack, who took it a couple of blocks north, crossed Capitol Street Southeast, and handed it off to someone in a dark-color Dodge Charger. Armitas tracked the red backpack man to the Rayburn House Office Building after the device handoff.\n\nThe device was re-placed at the DNC between 12:50 and 12:52 p.m., about 13 minutes before a Capitol Police countersurveillance team noticed the bomb at the base of a park bench.\n\nAccording to Armitas' video analysis, the individual who placed the device there appeared to be a law officer.\n\nJournalists and GOP congressional investigators have pointed out for years how the U.S. Secret Service teams at the DNC to protect Vice President-elect Harris acted like the bomb was a dud. After being notified by Capitol Police of the device’s placement feet from the southwest side of the DNC building, Secret Service agents sat in two SUVs finishing their lunches before getting out to investigate.\n\n A K-9 unit search along the front of the Democratic National Committee building the morning of Jan. 6 found no evidence of a pipe bomb that would later be found at 1:05 p.m.U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nThe agents milled around the adjacent DNC driveway, on a sidewalk near the park benches, and on the sidewalk along Capitol Street Southeast. Pedestrians walked right past the bomb for more than five minutes. Vehicle traffic on streets surrounding the DNC continued as normal. Several commuter trains rumbled across the trestle just feet from the DNC property.\n\nAgents did not secure Harris and evacuate her from the front of the building for 10 minutes. No buildings were cordoned off, and no safe blast perimeter was established. A uniformed Capitol Police officer tiptoed up to the device to snap a photograph.\n\nA perimeter was eventually established. The DNC bomb was destroyed by a bomb robot at curbside, just feet from the DNC building.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Capitol Police CCTV security cameras on the Fairchild Building and on a traffic pole across from the DNC were turned away from the scene, apparently deliberately, making it nearly impossible to see who re-placed the bomb and who found it.\n\nCamera 3173 — located directly across the street from where the pipe bomb was found at 1:05 p.m. — turned away from the DNC building at 1:29 p.m., before the bomb squad arrived. Camera 8020 — located on the Fairchild Building — was filming the assemblage of the bomb squad on E Street Southeast when it, too, was directed away at 1:44 p.m. to focus on some distant railroad tracks. Camera 8021, which was recording the operations of a bomb robot, suddenly panned away from the scene just before 2:21 p.m.\n\nRELATED: Was the January 6 DNC ‘pipe bomb’ PLANTED by the Secret Service or FBI?\n\n U.S. Capitol Police countersurveillance officers walk past the DNC building seven minutes before returning and discovering the pipe bomb. Once the bomb was discovered, the Secret Service acted as if it was not a threat. U.S. Capitol Police CCTV \n\nCapitol Police camera 4502 — mounted on the nearby Capitol power plant — did capture parts of the initial aftermath of the bomb discovery and some of the bomb-robot operations.\n\nHarris — who left the Capitol at 11:22 a.m. despite being a sitting U.S. senator and despite the historic nature of the certification of her election win — never spoke of the alleged danger she was in. Mainstream media never asked Harris if she felt her life was in danger on Jan. 6 after Politico disclosed her presence at the DNC.\n\nAccording to the investigation done by Armitas, here is how the bombs hoax was set up and carried out on Jan. 5 and 6.\n\nDNC pipe bomb timeline\n\n7:34-7:42 p.m. Jan. 5 — The suspect walked north on New Jersey Avenue and looked down an alley adjacent to the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. The suspect set down the backpack and rose on tiptoes to look northwest toward D Street.\n\nArmitas suggested in the report that the suspect may have been looking for an “overwatch” vehicle driven by someone who would be monitoring USCP radio traffic and security cameras and relaying that intelligence to the suspect.\n\nThe suspect then walked north to Capitol and D Streets and returned south after 20 seconds. The suspect got out a cell phone, ostensibly to send a text.\n\n7:43 p.m. — The hoodie suspect sat on a bench next to the DNC and pulled a cell phone from a backpack. The motion of typing text on the phone was almost invisible because the video released by the FBI had been drastically down-sampled.\n\n The video of the pipe-bomb suspect released by the FBI was cropped and had the video frame rate down-sampled, an investigator told Blaze News.Capitol Hill Club\n\n7:46 p.m. — A Capitol Police officer arrived in the area that the bomber was peering toward minutes earlier. The officer parked a vehicle obstructing the crosswalk and entered the night entrance to the Longworth House Office Building, according to Armitas' video analysis. The officer appeared to stay inside Longworth for three hours, exiting the building at 11:13 p.m. and returning to his vehicle.\n\n7:47 p.m. — The suspect stood and traveled north back to New Jersey Avenue, then detoured west toward the CBCI alley. The suspect sat for about 20 seconds at the base of a large bush and leaned forward into the bush. It became apparent the next morning that a piece of the pipe bomb broke off the device and came to rest under the bush.\n\n7:50 p.m. — The suspect left the CBCI alley, heading toward New Jersey Avenue, then rushed back into the alley to retrieve the backpack. “It is my belief that they received a text and were directed to the DNC,” Armitas wrote.\n\n7:54 p.m. — The suspect sat on the left side of a park bench at the DNC, then stood and moved closer to the end of the bench. The phone appeared to be in the suspect's hands. As the suspect sat back down, the suspect planted the bomb “with no apparent attempt to wind or set the device up,” Armitas said. “However, the physical profile of the device is in the opposite orientation from how it was discovered.”\n\nThe short end of the pipe bomb faced out after the suspect laid it down. When Capitol Police found the device some 16 hours later, the long end was facing out and the dial on the egg timer was upside down “and not oriented in a way to wind it or attach the clips,” Armitas wrote.\n\nThe suspect left the DNC, traveling north along Capitol Street Southeast, and moved the backpack from the right hand to the left to avoid it hitting a bicyclist on the sidewalk.\n\n7:57 p.m. — Suspect was now wearing the backpack, a change in behavior that “indicates the person planting these devices views them as dangerous, and it means that there was only 1 device carried at a time.” The individual turned to look down the alley beside the CBCI, possibly scanning for the broken piece of the device left behind.\n\nCapitol Hill Club device timeline\n\n8:09 p.m. Jan. 5 — The suspect walked a route toward the Capitol Hill Club and Republican National Committee that minimized possible exposure to Capitol Police security cameras. The suspect entered Rumsey Court and spent four minutes not visible to any security cameras that have been made public.\n\n8:14 p.m. — The suspect left Rumsey Court on the sidewalk along 1st Street Southeast and headed north. As the suspect passed in front of the green awning of the Capitol Hill Club, the suspect appeared to wave and point with the left arm to a Capitol Police SUV driving south on 1st Street. It appeared this waving motion caused a shoulder cramp, as the suspect wrapped the arm across the face and rubbed the shoulder.\n\nPotentially showing familiarity with this neighborhood, the suspect took a mini-shortcut along a short path to the right of the “RNC rock” at 1st and C streets and proceeded east on C.\n\n Two U.S. Capitol Police SUVs make a traffic stop across C Street while the pipe-bomb suspect walks down Rumsey Court to place a pipe bomb behind the Capitol Hill Club on Jan. 5, 2021.U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\n8:15 p.m. — It appeared that the suspect attempted to plant a pipe bomb in a bush “outside a congressional dormitory on C Street,” Armitas wrote. He or she was cut short when a Capitol Police SUV with emergency lights on turned onto C Street from 1st Street.\n\nThe suspect, ostensibly not knowing that the Capitol Police vehicle was making a traffic stop, fled down the north entrance of Rumsey Court but remained in the area. Security cameras in Rumsey Court captured audio of the suspect’s Nike Air Max shoes emitting a squeaking sound.\n\nFormer FBI Special Agent Kyle Seraphin, who worked on the pipe-bombs case several months after Jan. 6, said the USCP vehicles appeared to carry out a blocking maneuver.\n\n “I see a ‘blocking vehicle,’ then they acknowledge [the suspect] and circle back to set up a blocking position,” Seraphin said. “The other vehicle then doubles back to assist.”\n\n8:18 p.m. — The suspect was captured on a security camera rounding the corner of a building on Rumsey Court to plant the device. A widely circulated photo of the suspect released by the FBI came from HD video footage that was cropped to change its aspect ratio, Armitas said.\n\nThe suspect planted the device between rolling plastic trash bins along the back wall of the Capitol Hill Club. The area was very remote and would be visible only to someone taking out the trash from the Capitol Hill Club or someone opening the wooden gate and entering the rear of the apartment building at 109 C Street. The building’s laundry facilities were located inside this entrance.\n\nThe suspect appears to depart Rumsey Court via a garden at St. Peter’s on Capitol Hill, a Catholic church at 313 2nd St. Southeast.\n\n8:31 p.m. — According to internal USCP communications, the suspect was last seen turning east from 6th Street to D Street, heading toward Eastern Market at 227 7th St. Southeast.\n\n12:40 p.m. Jan. 6 — The Capitol Hill Club pipe bomb was reported to the security officer at the nearby Republican National Committee building just after 12:40 p.m. on Jan. 6. Karlin Younger, then 37, a resident of 109 C Street who went in and out of the laundry room at the rear entrance that faces Rumsey Court, reported the device.\n\nYounger approached the guard shack at the Republican National Committee building. The guards summoned the director of security, Ken Capolino, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer. Capolino snapped a photo of the device next to the trash bin. The photo was sent to the Capitol Police Command Center, former USCP Chief Steven Sund told Blaze News.\n\n“Because this location is so remote, there can be no expectation for this to be discovered naturally at a precise time,” Armitas said. “You must have a dedicated person waiting to make the initial discovery, and that person must have a believable story on why they were at this remote location.”\n\nRELATED: FBI sent 55 agents to the Capitol Jan. 6, none for ‘crowd control,’ former Chief Steven Sund says\n\n The photo of the Capitol Hill Club pipe bomb was snapped by RNC security director Ken Capolino, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer, at about 12:40 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021.Ken Capolino via Armitas\n\nYounger claims there was no device present next to the trash bins when she first went into and exited from the laundry entrance. This would mean the device would have had to be planted between her first and second trips to the laundry room.\n\nShe reported that the egg timer on the bomb read 20 minutes. She said she discerned this detail by leaning down to get a closer look at the device. She said she also leaned in to try to determine whether the bomb was ticking.\n\nA man who works on the ground floor of the Longworth House Office Building, 1 Independence Ave. Southeast, left the Longworth and entered the alley of the Capitol Hill Club carrying a collapsed umbrella. The man was out of the view of security cameras for 18 minutes and departed the court before Younger returned to move her laundry from the washer to the dryer.\n\nUpon returning to the Longworth building, the man was allowed to walk through security without going through the metal detector.\n\nThe FBI obtained a geofence warrant for all cellular devices present at the two bomb sites on Jan. 5 and 6. Data for a set of phones contained in the AT&T geofence warrant was allegedly corrupt and unusable, Armitas said.\n\nAT&T referred the FBI to First Responder Network Authority, or FirstNet, a cellular provider for law enforcement and first responders in the D.C. market. “The story of this event states that when a FirstNet employee tried to pull up data for the relevant sections of D.C., it crashed their server and corrupted the data,” Armitas wrote.\n\nAll of the civilian devices on the FirstNet system in D.C. were “investigated, apparently to the satisfaction of the FBI,” Armitas wrote, meaning the only remaining data was for encrypted devices belonging to law enforcement or first responders.\n\nYounger, the woman who found the Capitol Hill Club device, was an employee of FirstNet at the time, Armitas wrote. According to online credit records, Younger worked for First Responder Network Authority from Oct. 1, 2016 until Aug. 15, 2021. Her job titles included state plans leads analyst, external affairs, and investment lead.\n\nBlaze News reached out to Younger and the FBI for comment.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) faced off in the final debate of this campaign cycle, featuring personal attacks from Rep. Sherrill, who repeatedly called Ciattarelli a killer, while Ciattarelli focused on Rep. Sherrill’s questionable investment record and posthumous personal attacks against Charlie Kirk.\n\nAt one point in the debate, hosted by the local affiliate ABC 7, Ciattarelli whistled and mumbled to himself, “desperate!”\n\nModerator Bill Ritter, a local news anchor, attempted to pose questions about a variety of local issues of high concern to New Jersey residents, including the barely functional state of New Jersey transit and the dilapidated public education system after eight years of radical leftist Massachusetts native Gov. Phil Murphy. While the candidates presented differing viewpoints on local issues, the debate reached its most tense state during discussions about the candidates’ personal records. At one point, Rep. Sherrill was asked her stance about leftist political violence in the country, which she claimed to oppose – opening the door for Ciattarelli to note that Rep. Sherrill disparaged Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk in the immediate aftermath of his assassination in September.\n\nRep. Sherrill voted in September to pass a bill condemning Kirk’s assassination, but followed it up with a statement in which she falsely claimed Kirk “was advocating for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black [sic] people.”\n\n“She’s missed 9o percent of the votes in Washington,” Ciattarelli noted, but “skipped out of two very important joint appearances in New Jersey to get to Washington, DC, to vote yes on the Charlie Kirk resolution celebrating his life.”\n\n“I applaud her yes on that vote. When she came back to New Jersey and caught hell from the left, she issued a statement condemning Charlie Kirk, calling him a misogynist and a racist,” he continued. “The two things are inconsistent to me. The way to tamp down the hateful rhetoric is by having the right kind of leadership in place.”\n\nThe Republican candidate vowed that he would avoid violent and incendiary rhetoric if elected, noting, “I’ve always conducted myself in a respectful way even when I disagree with people. I’m never going to tarnish the name my parents gave me and I’m never going to embarrass my four children.”\n\nSherrill responded by once again attacking Charlie Kirk, falsely claiming that he advocated for the abolition of women’s rights.\n\nElsewhere in the debate, Rep. Sherrill condemned Ciattarelli for founding and owning medical publishing businesses, claiming that he personally “killed” people by publishing information that allegedly downplayed the dangers of opioids. The company, she claimed, was “working with some of the worst offenders and saying that opioids were safe … publishing their propaganda.”\n\n“First of all, shame on you,” Ciattarelli replied.\n\n“During the Biden administration, she had no problem whatsoever with thousands of people crashing our border each and every day not knowing what impact they had on our communities with regard to the fentanyl crisis, fentanyl abuse, fentanyl distribution, vaccination rates and the like,” Ciattarelli replied, adding that, regarding the claims about his business, “It’s a lie.”\n\nCiattarelli later taunted Rep. Sherill as she repeated her attack, quipping, “I got to walk at my college graduation.” Rep. Sherrill, revelations indicated in late September, was blocked from walking at her graduation at the United States Naval Academy. The circumstances around that decision are not publicly clear, though reports alleged that Rep. Sherrill had ties to a purported cheating scandal.\n\nRep. Sherrill replied to that attack by claiming that after Ciattarelli graduated, he “went on to kill tens of thousands of people in New Jersey, including children.”\n\nIn addition to her college circumstances, Ciattarelli also attacked Rep. Sherrill because “she had to pay federal fines for breaking federal law on stock trades and stock reporting … trading defense stocks while serving on the house armed services committee.”\n\nThe polling in anticipation of November’s gubernatorial election in New Jersey shows a tight race between the two candidates. Ciattarelli has taken to campaigning in the most reliably Democrat parts of the state, including Hudson, Bergen, and Essex counties, while Democrats nationally have sounded the alarm that Rep. Sherrill is a weak candidate.\n\n“We’re jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it’s a blue state and we may not need to act,” Janet Murguia, president of the left-leaning UnidosUS Action Fund, told CBS News on Wednesday. CBS noted that the Sherrill campaign, “some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign.”\n\n“Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill’s campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on ‘kitchen table’ issues like inflation and cost of living,” the report observed.\n\nThis is Ciattarelli’s second time running as the Republican nominee for governor of the state. In 2021 he lost, but performed surprisingly well in a state that voted heavily for former President Biden, bringing the race within four percentage points of victory.\n\nThe gubernatorial election will be held on November 4, though early voting is currently open.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.","summary":"New Jersey gubernatorial hopefuls Jack Ciattarelli and Rep.

Their voters rely on it.","text":"Republicans are waging war on health care—but the people they’re hurting most are their own voters. That’s not hyperbole. \n\n“More Than Half of [Affordable Care Act] Marketplace Enrollees Live in Republican Congressional Districts,” reads the headline at health policy outlet KFF—and even that undersells it. You hear “more than half” and think 51%, maybe 52%. In reality, it’s 57%. That’s not a slim majority. \n\nAnd it gets even more striking.\n\n“At least 10% of the population in all congressional districts in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina are enrolled in the ACA Marketplaces,” KFF writes.\n\nThose are all states that went for President Donald Trump last year. Florida alone has 28 House districts. And Texas and Utah almost qualify, with all but three House districts between them having 10% or greater ACA enrollment.\n\nMeanwhile, not one state that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won has a single district where more than 10% of residents are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, aka Obamacare.\n\nThe South is especially dependent on the ACA marketplace since many Republican-led states in the region have refused to expand Medicaid, forcing millions of their own residents onto ACA plans. It’s no wonder even MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has broken with her party’s hatred of expanded ACA subsidies. \n\nYet the GOP keeps swinging a sledgehammer at the very people keeping them in office.\n\nIt’s uncanny how precisely Trump and his party manage to harm their base. And it’s part of the eternal irony of American politics: Democrats fight for programs that disproportionately help voters in red states. From rural broadband to farm subsidies and rural education, liberals are once again sharing the wealth generated by blue states like California and New York—the same states that red America loves to demonize.\n\nThey set out to own the libs, but they’re owning themselves.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to protect those subsidies, even though many of its beneficiaries will vote Republican again.

Alex Padilla (D-CA) into the race, spelling danger for her in the crowded primary battle to win voters. Padilla’s entrance into the race as a left-wing Democrat would likely pose the greatest threat to Porter’s base, as she is viewed as one of the more liberal candidates campaigning. \n\n“If the Democratic leadership doesn’t think that Katie Porter is ready for prime time, [then there is] the push to get Padilla to enter the race,” Republican strategist Matt Clink told the Washington Examiner. “He could immediately become a front row.” \n\n“Katie Porter is clearly running far left of center,” he said. “So I think Padilla could come in and he’s got a carpet niche that would be left of center.” \n\nPadilla enjoys comparable name recognition to Porter, which strategists have said is the primary reason she’s considered the front-runner. He also made headlines in June when he was detained during a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, garnering him support from liberals frustrated by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nOpen primary threatens Porter’s hold\n\nChallenges from Padilla and other rumored Democratic contenders, such as businessman Rick Caruso, might not be a problem if it weren’t for California’s open primary system.\n\nIn that structure, candidates for governor, regardless of their political party, are listed on the same ballot — with the top two candidates proceeding to the general election. The vote is already split between seven candidates, bringing the total to nine if Padilla and Caruso hop in. That means there’s an ever-shrinking slice of voters for the crowded field of contenders to vie for.\n\nDemocratic strategist Kaivan Shroff suggested that if controversy over Porter’s likeability and media style persists, he believes “it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary,” giving rivals such as former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Beccera a boost. \n\n“I do see [the CBS interview] perhaps not being a big deal,” he said. “At the same time, now, if there’s several other more current examples of this, where she continues to have moments like that, I do think it can turn into a larger narrative in this primary, especially because it is a competitive primary.”\n\nHours after Shroff made the comments, more footage of Porter losing it during a media interview resurfaced, adding fuel to the fire. The gubernatorial candidate is seen yelling, “Get out of my f***ing shot!” at a staff member who wandered into the background of an interview video she was recording, in resurfaced clips obtained by Politico. \n\nFor Democrats disillusioned by Porter, “there are other options here, and there’s still time,” Shroff said of alternatives, arguing that the race remains wide open as the primary election remains eight months away. \n\nClink suggested that the open primary system spells warning signs for Porter’s belief that she can pull off a win without the help of any Republican voters. \n\n“She’s assuming that she makes it through the open primary to get into a general election, and then she can ignore Republican voters, but that’s a big assumption on her part,” he said, adding she has only “focused Republican attention that OK, we know who they will never vote for Katie Porter now.”\n\n“Let’s say you only have two Republican candidates and you have seven or eight Democratic candidates. Let’s say that the two Republican candidates split the Republican vote, and let’s say that the seven Democratic candidates split the Democratic vote. It’s not inconceivable that the top two finishers in the primary could be Republicans. If you just do simple math … I don’t think that it’s likely, but mathematically, it works,” Clink said.\n\nWhile nearly 40% of Californians voted for President Donald Trump on the Republican side in the 2024 election, Porter has expressed full confidence that she can emerge as the victor in the governor’s race next year because she believes most Democrats will coalesce behind her candidacy in the primary and leave the general election to her and a Republican candidate. With the state leaning majority-Democrat, Porter believes she can pull off a win. \n\nWhen asked what she would do if the race ended up between her and another Democrat, in which case the winning candidates would need to secure support of some moderates and Republicans, Porter replied, “I don’t intend that to be the case. … I’m going to build the support. I have the support already in terms of name recognition.”\n\nAnother Harris crash?\n\nPorter’s CBS interview also raised concerns about the likability factor in the gubernatorial race, similar to the scrutiny Harris triggered during the media interviews she granted during her 2024 presidential campaign. \n\nShroff warned the CBS kerfuffle was “not really a one-off,” pointing to other public incidents in which Porter has struggled to manage her public image, including when she lost the Senate primary last year to Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and accused him of rigging the election.\n\n“I remember she kind of left on such a sour note in her race against Adam Schiff,” he said. “And definitely interesting to … make the point that if she’s willing to do that on camera with a journalist from CBS … what is she like behind the scenes? And I think we kind of have a glimpse of that from several other episodes and moments.” \n\nOf comparisons between Porter and Harris in the wake of the CBS debacle, Clink suggested it would be unwise for the gubernatorial candidate to follow the former vice president’s lead of avoiding the press when it comes to building rapport with voters.\n\n“Porter’s next few interviews are going to be heavily scrutinized, and I think that she would be wise to do the opposite of what Kamala Harris did. She should get out and do as many interviews as possible so that she buries the bad CBS interview with decent interviews with other reporters,” Clink said. \n\nNot the strongest candidate: Critics pounce on Porter\n\nAs Porter tries to recoup her image, her challengers are pouncing on the CBS debacle as an opportunity to argue to voters that she’s not a strong candidate. \n\nVillaraigosa attacked his rival for trying to exit the tough interview. \n\n“We need a governor who will work to solve hard problems and who is not afraid to answer simple questions. You can’t just throw up your hands and refuse to answer as Katie Porter did,” he told the Washington Examiner. “California faces a lot of big problems, and voters deserve a leader who will answer the questions and speak the truth about how to solve them.”\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Examiner, Hilton made a dig at Porter for saying she didn’t “need” Trump voters to become California governor.\n\n“Every day, I’m on the road meeting Californians from every background and political stripe. As governor, I’ll serve every citizen of this state—whether they voted for the President or not, whether they vote for me or not. It’s not about what the politicians ‘need,’ California needs a governor focused on improving people’s lives, not another career politician looking out for political insiders and allies. And I’m certainly not afraid to talk to the media about it,” the Republican candidate said. \n\nClink believes that at the end of the day, Porter’s front-runner status at the head of a stack of nearly 10 candidates is “all well and good” over a year before the election, but all it does is put a big target on your back.” \n\n“For Katie Porter, I think it just highlights the fact that she has very thin skin,” he said. “She’s a very good politician, but she’s not a very good retail politician.”","summary":"Political strategists are raising questions about California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter’s campaign to succeed Gov.

(Noam Galai/Getty Images)\n\nThe anonymous leakers are already on fire. Jeremy Barr of The Guardian spread the early spurts: “CBS News veterans I’ve talked to are encouraging Bari Weiss to not mess with the Golden Goose(s) of ’60 Minutes’ and ‘CBS News Sunday Morning.’”\n\nWhat makes them “golden”? They’re the opposite of the Weiss principles. They rely on a narrow spectrum of ideas and persistently favor one political party over another.\n\n“60 Minutes” is notoriously pro-Democrat, from Steve Kroft trying to save Bill Clinton‘s 1992 campaign from the early adultery charges of his mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to Kroft performing a series of blatantly promotional interviews with Barack Obama, starting in 2008.\n\nPresident Donald Trump exposed Lesley Stahl for what she didn’t put on the air during their interview in the last weeks of the 2020 campaign. She huffed that there was no way to verify that Hunter Biden’s laptop full of potentially devastating Biden family influence-peddling evidence was real. Then the media verified it … in 2022, with Joe Biden safely elected.\n\nIn 2022, Scott Pelley did the Kroft spit-and-polish interview with President Biden. He cooked up gooey gushers like this one: “You have lived a long life of triumph and tragedy. In November, you’ll be 80. And I wonder what it is that keeps you in the arena.” We know part of the answer: He was kept in the arena by powerful White House aides who were actually running America and who easily manipulated the partisan journalists to fall in line.\n\nCBS infuriated the troops by settling with Trump over their sappy interviews with Biden and Kamala Harris. Previous CBS chair Shari Redstone told The New York Times that CBS employees warned her that in October 2023, when Pelley scored a second softball session with Biden, the president had seemed “drowsy and had to be prodded to answer.” She worried that CBS might be accused of “editing the interview to conceal Mr. Biden’s failings.”\n\nBiden’s doddering was still apparent on air, but imagine what Team Pelley edited out.\n\nIt’s been a very long time since CBS was aiming for an audience that was “center-left to center-right.” They’ve been trying to drag everyone to the left, even in the so-called glory days of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite. CBS loved the Kennedys, but it despised Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. The Bushes, who never wanted to upset a liberal journalist, learned just how much Dan Rather hated them.\n\nCan CBS actually move to the center? And will that expose how tilted the other networks are every day? It must be a terrifying prospect for the badly named “mainstream media.” Because merely adding Democrat scandals and policy failures to the definition of “newsworthiness” is a nightmare, a concept they refuse to accept.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

That solipsism, together with street smarts and shamelessness, give him a unique ability to smash through seemingly unbreachable obstacles to upend the status quo. In the Middle East, this has proved priceless. Polite, received opinion has insisted for decades that the Israel-Palestine conflict was unsolvable. But to Trump, that is only a spur to success.\n\nWe saw that in his first term when he negotiated the unprecedented Abraham Accords, through which Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Sudan established diplomatic relations with Israel. While the deals were sidelined by the October 7 terrorist atrocity which plunged the Middle East into crisis, if this works, will truly cap it all.\n\nImagine if Joe Biden or Kamala Harris were still in office. Hamas felt emboldened every time Biden castigated Israel’s military strategy, particularly when the doddery premier called Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to enter the southern city of Rafah a ‘red line’. The Israeli PM ignored him - and subsequently the operation proved hugely effective in driving out Hamas.\n\nTrump has taken a very different approach, backing Israel to the hilt, understanding that Hamas had to realise it could not win if peace was to be secured. That, combined with the equally important decision to turn the screw on Qatar to rein in the terrorists of Hamas, has brought us to the imminent release of the remaining hostages.\n\nAnd what a contrast, and potentially an end to this hideous conflict with our own prime minister. Sir Keir Starmer’s main contribution since taking office last July has been to treat Israel – our long-standing ally in the fight against Islamic terror – as some sort of recalcitrant enemy.\n\nCowed by a surging block of sectarian Muslim voters, Starmer has blocked certain arms exports to Israel, backed the International Criminal Court’s bizarre arrest warrant for Netanyahu, restored funding to UNWRA, the UN agency that employed some of the October 7 terrorists, and most recently rewarded Hamas for its despiciable massacre by recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nHow puny and ridiculous Starmer – and British statecraft – now look. While he rewarded Hamas, Trump, has secured near-universal support from Arab and Muslim states for a comprehensive plan to bring the war to an end and, if the next stages of his plan can be delivered, rebuild Gaza.\n\nTrump is said to crave the Nobel Peace Prize. If indeed the hostages are released and Gaza becomes the focus of rebuilding and peaceful co-existence, he will be a shoo-in.\n\nStephen Pollard is a former editor of the Jewish Chronicle.","summary":"Donald Trump has provided a clear demonstration of leadership and hard power by securing the release of Hamas's hostages.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15177251/Trump-moved-mountains-sheer-force-gargantuan-personality-puny-ridiculous-Starmer-looks.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/09/12/102843113-0-image-m-13_1760009784336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 11:38:11","author":"Editor,Stephen Pollard","authors":["Editor","Stephen Pollard"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":367676570,"title":"Ossoff sticks with Trump resistance despite shutdown pressure","text":"However, the shutdown revealed a strategy for Ossoff that could help him in a midterm election year when turnout is historically lower. He is running a base-centric campaign as Democrats clamor for their party leaders to vocally oppose President Donald Trump.\n\n“There is no middle ground for him when it comes to these big decisions that have to be made, and I think the shutdown proves that,” said Ryan Mahoney, a longtime Georgia-based GOP strategist who’s worked with past Republican senators in the state.\n\nOssoff boasts the seventh-most liberal voting record among his colleagues for a Congress that began in January, according to voteview.com, a product of UCLA’s Department of Political Science. But he’s also made the risky calculation of calling for Trump’s impeachment in April, arguing the president was “selling access” to the White House to enrich his family.\n\nTrump won Georgia by 2 points in 2024 against Vice President Kamala Harris, but the state has also drifted into purple territory in recent years and is represented by two Democratic senators.\n\nIn brief remarks to reporters, Ossoff framed his shutdown votes in the context of expiring Obamacare subsidies that Democrats want extended in exchange for their support. \n\n“No one can figure out why, with health insurance premiums set to double for more than 20 million Americans and government funding run out, the U.S. House of Representatives has decided to take the week off,” Ossoff said, pointing to Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-LA) decision to keep the House on recess after it passed the six-week funding bill.\n\nBut even before then, Ossoff has sided with the grassroots of his party. In March, he broke with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) when leadership caved in a separate fight over government funding.\n\nThe Senate GOP’s campaign arm has aggressively targeted Ossoff in a bid to expand the party’s 53-47 majority. An ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released on the shutdown’s first day, accused Ossoff of having “stabbed our veterans in the back, voting with Schumer to shut down the government.”\n\n“Jon Ossoff has proved time and time again he will always go along with what national Democrats like Kamala Harris demand,” said NRSC regional spokesman Nick Puglia.\n\nHarris visited Atlanta on Wednesday as part of a tour promoting her new book about the 2024 campaign.\n\nThree Republicans are vying for a chance to knock off Ossoff: Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA) and Buddy Carter (R-GA), as well as former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley. Gov. Brian Kemp’s (R-GA) decision not to run and then endorse Dooley delivered a one-two punch to Republicans that could jeopardize the fragile peace between the governor and Trump.\n\nNational Democrats, still recovering from their 2024 loss, have made healthcare one pillar of a renewed focus on the cost of living as they head into the midterm elections. How much Obamacare premiums rise and how long the shutdown drags on could have varying impacts at the polls for elections like the Georgia Senate race.\n\n“I think the cost of health insurance will” affect contests, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the Washington Examiner. “If this goes forward and people see their premiums double or get worse — dramatically worse, they have to cut back on coverage or give up on health insurance — I think that’ll move a lot of votes. Eventually, the Republicans will realize that.”\n\nOssoff is leaning on his status as a fundraising juggernaut to expand his already deep campaign coffers, ensuring an expensive contest against the eventual GOP nominee. According to his campaign, he raised $12 million in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30 and ballooned his cash on hand to $21 million.\n\n“Republicans are already spending millions of dollars targeting Senator Ossoff, yet our campaign continues to build an unstoppable grassroots coalition to win next November,” Ossoff campaign manager Ellen Foster said in a release.\n\nINDEPENDENT ANGUS KING STICKS WITH REPUBLICANS IN SIXTH FAILED SHUTDOWN VOTE\n\nOssoff’s Georgia colleague, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), won a runoff race in 2022 against Republican Herschel Walker by just under 3 points and is not up for reelection until 2028.\n\n“Ossoff is an excellent partner,” Warnock recently told the Washington Examiner, reflecting on the shutdown’s potential midterm effects. “We are working every day on behalf of the people of Georgia, and he will defeat whoever [Republicans] put up.”\n\nDavid Sivak contributed to this report.","summary":"He’s the country’s most vulnerable Senate Democrat up for reelection.

I think it's hard to see that kind of interaction transpire.”Stewart also reflected on the timing of Collier’s message to the WNBA commissioner. She further explained its importance with respect to the collective bargaining agreement.“Then you still have to have negotiations and continue to be cordial across the table, so definitely agree with Phee,” Stewart added. I think that our messaging right now is, it's not personal, it is business. Show us, show us your money and we'll show you yours, you know what I mean, like let's actually talk about it.”Napheesa Collier had earlier made headlines by calling out the WNBA’s leadership during her end-of-season media session. Instead of addressing Collier’s specific points, Engelbert responded by expressing disappointment that Collier had portrayed the league’s leadership in a negative light.Although Engelbert’s response drew criticism from many players and fans, Stewart chose not to join in the backlash. She refrained from mocking or criticizing Engelbert’s statement. Instead, the New York Liberty star limited her comments to supporting Napheesa Collier.Napheesa Collier spoke with Kamala Harris about her decision to criticize Cathy EngelbertDuring the recent A Day of Unreasonable Conversation summit, Napheesa Collier sat down with former Vice President Kamala Harris to talk about what pushed her to make the bold statement about the league’s leadership.Collier explained that her frustration came from the collective bargaining agreement negotiations and seeing little to no progress being made.\"I am on the union for our CBA negotiations, like our collective bargaining negotiations for our league,\" Collier said. \"And for so long I felt like I saw what was going on behind closed doors.\"For so long, we tried to have these conversations and move the needle in those meetings that we would have with the league within our leadership. And I saw nothing was changing.Even though the players’ union and the league still haven’t finalized the collective bargaining agreement, the WNBA Finals are moving forward between the Las Vegas Aces and the Phoenix Mercury.On Wednesday, A’ja Wilson’s game-winning shot gave the Aces a 3-0 series lead, putting them just one win away from claiming their third championship in four years.","summary":"Breanna Stewart recently shared her thoughts on the ongoing saga between Napheesa Collier and Cathy Engelbert.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/wnba/news-i-agree-phee-unrivaled-co-founder-stands-napheesa-collier-cathy-engelbert-pushes-back-accusations","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/95e9c-17599985263493-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 10:47:36","author":"Advait Jajodia","authors":["Advait Jajodia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":367675212,"title":"Barabak: Beyond election House fight, Democrats’ chances slim to win Senate","text":"There’s a reason for the fearsome redistricting fight raging across America. It’s about Democrats trying to rein in Donald Trump and his rogue-elephant regime.\n\nOr, if you’re the country’s aspiring strongman, it’s about avoiding accountability and sanction.\n\nThat’s why Trump and fellow Republicans are trying to rig the midterm election, by gerrymandering congressional lines in hopes of boosting the GOP’s chances of keeping its tenuous hold on the House past 2026.\n\nCalifornia Democrats are seeking payback by redrawing the state’s congressional lines in hopes of swiping five or more GOP-held seats.\n\nVoters will have their say on the matter Nov. 4, when they decide Proposition 50.\n\nOf course, there are two branches of Congress. Why, then, is there so much focus on the House? Simply put, it’s because of the steep odds Democrats face trying to win control of the Senate, which are somewhere between slim and none — with slim last seen cinching his saddle before cantering out of town.\n\nLet’s take a moment for a quick refresher.\n\nEvery two years, all 435 House seats are on the ballot. Senate terms are staggered and run six years, so roughly a third of the chamber’s 100 seats are up for a vote in each federal election. In 2026, there will be 35 Senate contests.\n\nMost won’t be remotely competitive.\n\nOver before they begin\n\nIn fact, more than two dozen of those races are effectively over before they begin, given the advantage one party holds over the other.\n\nMississippi, for instance, will send a Democrat to the U.S. Senate the day that Delaware elects a Republican; both will occur right after Trump and Adam Schiff get inked with matching “I Love L.A.” tattoos.\n\nThat leaves nine Senate races that are at least somewhat competitive. Of those, three are considered toss-ups: open-seat contests in Michigan and North Carolina and the race in Georgia, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term.\n\nDemocrats need to gain four seats to take control of the Senate, meaning even if they win all three of those even-steven races — which is far from certain — they still need to successfully defend seats in Minnesota and New Hampshire and pick up at least one other GOP-held seat.\n\nThat’s where the going gets tough.\n\nKamala Harris won Maine, which suggests Republican Susan Collins could be vulnerable. But the five-term senator has repeatedly managed to hang on, even in good Democratic years.\n\nThe three other races are tougher still.\n\nOhio used to be a major Midwestern battleground, but it’s grown solidly Republican. Democrats landed their prized recruit, former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who narrowly lost his 2024 reelection bid and may be the only Democrat with a realistic shot at the seat. Still, he’s facing an uphill fight in the special election against Republican Jon Husted, an ex-lieutenant governor who was appointed to replace Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIn Iowa, where Republican Joni Ernst is retiring, GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson starts out the favorite in another state that’s grown increasingly red.\n\n(Hinson, a USC grad and former KABC-TV intern, has taken to trash-talking the Golden State — “I don’t want to see the country look like California” — because that’s what Republicans do these days.)\n\nWhere dreams die\n\nWhich leaves Texas, land of shattered Democratic dreams.\n\nIt’s been more than three decades since the party has won a statewide election. Ever since, Democrats have insisted this is the year they’d end their losing streak.\n\nThey’ve tried various approaches. A “dream team” that consisted of a slate of Black, white and Latino nominees. A ticket topped by political celebrity Wendy Davis, of filibuster fame. An out-of-nowhere phenom by the name of Beto O’Rourke. All failed.\n\nThis time, Democrats are hoping for an assist from the GOP.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn is seeking his fifth term and faces the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, in a primary that’s already grown fierce and ugly.\n\nPaxton is MAGA down to the soles of his feet, which would normally give him a big advantage in a GOP primary. But his history — allegations of bribery and corruption, an impeachment trial, a messy divorce — have left him in bad odor with many Republicans.\n\nThe GOP’s Senate campaign committee and Majority Leader John Thune have aggressively thrown their weight behind Cornyn, though Trump has so far remained neutral.\n\nDemocrats would love to run against Paxton, given polls suggesting a competitive race if he’s the nominee. First, though, they’ll have to sort out their own primary.\n\nColin Allred, the former NFL linebacker who lost in November to Ted Cruz, is running again and faces James Talarico, a state representative and seminarian from the Austin area, who’s became an online sensation with his godly persona and viral take-down of conservative pieties.\n\nO’Rourke also hasn’t ruled out another try for Senate.\n\nGarry Mauro, a Democrat and former Texas land commissioner, is clear-eyed in assessing his party’s prospects.\n\n“If you run on the right issues and don’t leave yourself a crazy radical … then I think you have a real chance of building a winning race,” he said. But “to say this isn’t a leaning-R state would be Pollyannish, and I’m not Pollyannish.”\n\nWhich means counting on the Lone Star state to deliver a Democratic-run U.S. Senate is a bit like trusting a drunken gambler to preserve and protect your rent money.\n\nThat’s why Democrats are betting the House in hopes of corralling Trump.\n\nMark Z.

On the morning of the primary, in June, Mamdani crisscrossed the city as fast as his new security detail could drive him. Giddy commuters on a subway platform in Jackson Heights missed their trains just to show him their “I Voted” stickers. Aboveground, he dispatched an aide to a nearby Indian restaurant, to pick him up paan, a betel-leaf wrap, which he chewed daintily, careful not to spill any of the filling on the dark suit and tie that he has adopted as his political uniform. In Inwood, even a pair of volunteers for Cuomo sheepishly stopped him for selfies.\nAt a moment when the country is consumed with nativist fervor and New York appears a nest of cynical cronyism—eight months ago, Mayor Eric Adams agreed to go along with President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation program, to save himself from corruption charges—Mamdani is running a campaign that embraces the city as a beacon for immigrants like him. His win in the primary was a shock to the political establishment, and the powerful began to slink in his direction. Barack Obama gave him a call the next day. After a chilly summer courtship, Governor Kathy Hochul, a hypercautious moderate, warmly endorsed him. The Reverend Al Sharpton, who has not endorsed Mamdani or any other candidate, recently told me, “He has had the best entry into citywide politics of any candidate I have seen, probably, in my life.”\nIn certain ideological precincts, Mamdani’s name has become totemic—shorthand for everything wrong with New York, which itself is shorthand for everything wrong with America. Trump has called him a “100% Communist Lunatic” on Truth Social. Jeff Blau, the C.E.O. of the real-estate giant Related Companies, and his wife, the investor Lisa Blau, recently called for an emergency breakfast meeting of the wealthy. “If we fail to mobilize, the financial capital of the world risks being handed over to a socialist this November,” the invitation read. A real-estate lobbyist told me that he does not know anyone who is leaving the city because of Mamdani, though he does know “several who may pied-à-terre.” John Catsimatidis, a supermarket mogul and a Trump confidant, said, “Fidel Castro had the same smile.”\nSenator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries have held off on endorsing Mamdani, reportedly in part because of his criticism of Israel. Meanwhile, much of the rest of the city’s political class is jostling for position around him. Kathryn Wylde, the longtime head of the Partnership for New York City—a lobby group representing the city’s business leaders—brokered meetings this summer between Mamdani and her members; many remained skeptical, but some left with a strange new respect for the kid. “After I did the meetings with, say, three hundred executives, somebody asked me, ‘How would you rate their reactions on a scale of one to ten?’ ” Wylde told me. “I said, ‘One to ten.’ ” Patrick Gaspard, an Obama Administration official and the former president of the Center for American Progress, has been quietly advising Mamdani since last fall. He describes Mamdani as a prototype for a new generation of American politicians, forged in the Palestinian-rights movement. “He’s the first to arrive on the shore, but, just over the horizon, you can see more ships coming in,” Gaspard said.\nIn person, Mamdani is as self-possessed and quick to a punch line as he is in his campaign videos, which regularly go viral. He is also tactical and shrewd, careful with his words. From Bernie Sanders, whose 2016 Presidential race inspired him to embrace socialist politics, Mamdani has learned how to pivot relentlessly back to his economic agenda, and it’s rare for him to speak for more than a few minutes without returning to his pledges to freeze the rent in the city’s rent-stabilized apartments, make buses free and faster, and provide universal care for kids starting at six weeks of age. But unlike Sanders, who loathes talking about himself—“Zohran doesn’t need any political advice from me,” the senator told me, in September—Mamdani has found power in telling his story.\nI met Mamdani in person for the first time in late March, at Qahwah House, a Yemeni coffee shop in Morningside Heights. It was the morning after the end of Ramadan, and polling in the primary showed him in the teens—in second place, but well behind Cuomo. He ordered a pot of Adeni chai for us to share, and, if the guy behind the register clocked him, he didn’t show it in his face. The previous day, Mamdani had been in Bay Ridge, Kensington, and Jamaica—home to large Muslim communities in Brooklyn and Queens—for Eid prayers, addressing some twenty-five thousand people. He expressed polite incredulity at the press’s lack of interest in those numbers. “That’s where I feel a sense of confidence,” he told me.\nMamdani has a solicitous, animated way of speaking that can verge on TED talk. He gestures prolifically, displaying the thick silver rings he wears, and likes to pull quotations from Nelson Mandela, F.D.R., Toni Morrison, Aristotle. Sipping his chai, he spoke with precision, not just about what he’d do as mayor but about the voters who were going to help him win—Muslims and South Asians, renters, young people, Democrats who oppose Israel’s war in Gaza. When prodded about the inevitable backlash to his more expensive proposals, Mamdani shrugged. “I am not afraid of my own ideas,” he said. When I mentioned the difficulty of what he hoped to pull off, he smiled: “I think for far too long we’ve tried not to lose, as opposed to figuring out how to win.”\nNew Yorkers can be unforgiving when a mayor is caught out of town at the wrong time. (In 2011, Michael Bloomberg was nearly done in when he was rumored to be in Bermuda during a New York snowstorm.) Mamdani got on the next flight out of Entebbe, but the trip took twenty-two hours. While he was in the air, his opponents pounced. Cuomo, who is now running as an Independent, started calling reporters to slam Mamdani’s views on policing. The Times, which in both its news and opinion coverage has been overtly skeptical of Mamdani’s fitness to be mayor, speculated that the shooting “may lead some to further scrutinize” him. Laura Loomer, the Trump ally and far-right troll, suggested that the State Department ban Mamdani from reëntering the country—a scenario that his aides took seriously enough to run by lawyers.\nBut when Mamdani arrived at J.F.K., at 7 A.M., he breezed through customs. The N.Y.P.D. had confirmed that the Park Avenue shooter wasn’t motivated by pro-Palestinian sentiment; he was a casino worker from Las Vegas who had sustained brain injuries while playing football in high school, and his target had been the N.F.L.’s headquarters, in the same building. From the airport, Mamdani was whisked into a waiting S.U.V. and driven straight to the home of the deceased N.Y.P.D. officer, Didarul Islam. A Bangladeshi Muslim immigrant who’d been working a side gig as a security guard at the office building to help pay his family’s mortgage, Islam was the kind of New Yorker who Mamdani had recognized was often overlooked in the city’s politics. At Islam’s home, in the Bronx, Mamdani was received by the officer’s parents, his pregnant widow, his children, and other grieving relatives. He wept with them for a few minutes. Then, with Bangladeshi hospitality, the family served the candidate breakfast.\nOn the morning of Islam’s funeral, the streets of Parkchester, a neighborhood of brick row houses and big-box stores, were blocked off on both sides of the expressway. In front of the mosque, the Parkchester Jame Masjid, thousands of officers watched silently as hundreds of men and boys prayed on mats unfurled on the streets and sidewalks. Helicopters flew low overhead. It wasn’t so long ago that the N.Y.P.D. treated many Muslim communities like fronts in the war on terror, yet more Muslims are joining the force every year, for largely the same reason that the Irish did a hundred and fifty years ago—the N.Y.P.D. is one of the only big employers in town where working-class immigrants can reasonably hope for advancement.\nOfficer Islam, by department custom, was promoted to detective first grade at his funeral. Inside the mosque, Adams, Hochul, and other invited officials sat in chairs close to the front, dressed in dark suits. Mamdani sat on the other side of the room, on the floor among the mourners. During the primary campaign, Mamdani had visited the mosque on three separate occasions, and he has continued to visit Islam’s family since the funeral. “He was the one who would cut his father’s beard,” Mamdani told me.\nPolicing is an awkward subject for Mamdani, who if elected will be in charge of a department that he was once in favor of defunding. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, he tweeted, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” Much like his comments on Israel, Mamdani’s past statements on the police have been obsessively picked apart by his detractors—a key difference is that managing the cops is an everyday part of the mayor’s job.\nThe legacy of every New York mayor in recent history has been shaped by the N.Y.P.D. Bloomberg’s accomplishments running the city will always be stacked against his support of stop-and-frisk policing. Bill de Blasio, who was in office during the early days of Black Lives Matter, never forgot watching hundreds of officers turn their backs on him at the funerals of two cops who were killed on the job. Eric Adams, who started his career as a transit cop, was undone in part by his dealings with corrupt old friends from the department. During the campaign, Mamdani abandoned the language of “defund”; he recently pledged to work with the N.Y.P.D. if elected. He told me that he now believes policing is a public good, in that it is “a critical part of how we deliver public safety.” But he has struggled to explain why he changed his mind, apart from the fact that he is running for mayor.\nOne of Mamdani’s more poetic campaign motifs is “public excellence”—the idea that socialists need not compromise on quality-of-life concerns. In the past few months, Mamdani has attempted to reframe his suspicion of police as a human-resources issue, an obstacle to excellence: rank-and-file cops are regularly asked to handle distressing situations outside their skill set, such as dealing with the homeless and the mentally ill. He hopes to take those tasks off their hands by creating a Department of Community Safety, though, by his own admission, some of the details are “still to be determined.” At the prompting of a Times interviewer, in September, Mamdani half-apologized for his old tweets about the N.Y.P.D., but he rejects the notion that his views have evolved. “The principles remain the same,” he told me. “There are also lessons that you learn along the way.”\nNo small number of Mamdani’s detractors wonder if someone of his age and experience will be capable of running the biggest city in the country. New York has a hundred-and-sixteen-billion-dollar budget, three hundred thousand employees, and a police department larger than the Belgian Army. For more than a century, people have wondered if the city is ungovernable; with the exception of Fiorello La Guardia, who had New Deal money raining down on him, every idealistic leader who has been elected mayor has left City Hall in some way battered by it. “The good mayor turns out to be weak or foolish or ‘not so good’ . . . or the people become disgusted,” the muckraker Lincoln Steffens wrote in 1903. A City Hall veteran recently told me, “You’re constantly making bad decisions that you know are bad decisions. You’re presented with two bad options, and you’ve got to pick one, and that’s your day.”\nIf Mamdani is elected, the N.Y.P.D. may well continue to sweep up homeless encampments and forcibly remove protesters who block bridges or roads; he hasn’t yet ruled these things out. (“His administration will not seek to criminalize peaceful protest or poverty,” a Mamdani aide said.) At a recent forum on public safety sponsored by the policy journal Vital City, he was asked about police involuntarily detaining the mentally ill. “It is a last resort,” Mamdani said. “It is something that—if nothing else can work, then it’s there.”\nNair met Mahmood while she was researching “Mississippi Masala.” The daughter of a stern, high-ranking Indian state official, she studied at Harvard, and by her thirties had garnered attention for films that examined life on the margins of Indian society: among cabaret dancers, street children, visiting emigrants. Mahmood was born in Bombay in 1946 and grew up in Uganda, part of the Indian diaspora that emerged in East Africa during the British colonial period. In 1962, the year Uganda became independent, Mahmood was awarded one of twenty-three scholarships to study in America which were offered to the new country’s brightest students. (Barack Obama’s father had come to study in the U.S., three years earlier, under a similar program for Kenyan students.) He returned home after his studies abroad, and, like the protagonist Nair later imagined for “Mississippi Masala,” was exiled in Idi Amin’s 1972 expulsion of some sixty thousand Asians from the country. The event became a focus of Mahmood’s writing on the pains of decolonization; for Nair, it became the backdrop for a love story. “He’s some kind of lefty,” Nair told her collaborator, Sooni Taraporevala, the day they planned to meet Mahmood for an interview.\nIn 1996, Mahmood published his breakthrough work, “Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism,” which described the persistence of colonial structures in independent African nations. He dedicated it to Nair and to Zohran, who, he wrote, “daily takes us on the trail that is his discovery of life.” Three years after the book was published, Columbia offered Mahmood a tenured professorship. The family moved to New York, into a faculty apartment in Morningside Heights, where they often had Edward and Mariam Said and Rashid and Mona Khalidi over for dinner. “For Zohran, they were ‘uncles’ and ‘aunties,’ ” Mahmood told me in an e-mail.\nDuring the fall of 1999, Mamdani’s parents enrolled him at the Bank Street School for Children, a private school. The first year, he felt singled out—“being told again and again that I was very articulate with my English,” Mamdani recalled. Eventually, though, he settled into a typical Upper West Side childhood: Absolute Bagels, soccer in Riverside Park, listening to Jay-Z and Eiffel 65 on his Walkman on the way to school. In 2004, Mahmood took a sabbatical, and the family returned to Kampala for a year. One day, Mahmood went to Zohran’s school, to see how his son was adjusting. “He is doing well except that I do not always understand him,” Zohran’s teacher told him. On orders from the headmaster, the teacher had asked all the Indian students to raise their hands. Zohran had kept his down, and, when prodded, he’d protested, “I am not Indian! I am Ugandan!”\nOn a Saturday morning this summer, I met Mamdani outside the Bronx High School of Science, his alma mater, to walk around with one of his favorite old teachers, Marc Kagan, who happens to be the brother of Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court Justice. Kagan, the author of “Take Back the Power”—a firsthand account of his years as a radical organizer in the city’s transit union—taught social studies at Bronx Science for ten years. He inspired fervent admiration in his students, some of whom (Mamdani included) called themselves Kaganites. In his classes, Kagan talked about how race, gender, and class had shaped world events. “We got away from the great-man theory of history,” Kagan, a bespectacled, gray-bearded guy in his late sixties, said as we crossed the school’s sunken courtyard. Mamdani caught my eye and mugged. “There’s just one,” he said, nodding toward Kagan.\nMamdani sat down on some steps and looked up at Kagan, relieved to slip into a comfortable old dynamic. Kagan recounted a parent-teacher conference with Mahmood during Zohran’s freshman year. “I didn’t know who your father was—I just figured him as one of these striving parents,” he said. “He was grumping about your grade.” Mamdani tensed up. “He wasn’t grumping, like, ‘Why aren’t you giving my son a better grade?’ It was, like, ‘Zohran should be able to do better.’ And I said, ‘Never mind the grade, because the wheels are spinning in your son’s head.’ And he just floated out of the room.”\nMamdani credits Kagan with showing him how to command an audience. He remembered the start of class one day during his senior spring, when moods were light and attentions were drifting:“Everybody’s talking, having a great time, and then you just hear the sound of this machete hit a desk.” Kagan had chopped a stalk of sugarcane in half. “And he says, ‘Sugarcane was one of the most valuable crops in the New World,’ ” Mamdani said. Kagan handed out slices of the sugarcane, so that his students could touch and taste it.\nThe world of Bronx Science—a selective public school of some three thousand students, many of them the children of working-class immigrants—differed dramatically from the affluent intellectual milieu of Mamdani’s childhood. He remembers seeing students of color rehearsing in a jazz combo during his tour of the school. “It was almost a level of parody how aware we were of race,” Mamdani told me. “There would be, like, Ultimate Frisbee games where the two teams were ‘immigration nation’ and ‘white nation.’ With no malice. Simply, these were the two teams.” On a 2016 episode of the podcast “Encompassed,” an oral history of Bronx Science, a twenty-four-year-old Mamdani joked about a teacher who had chased him down the hall for stealing hall-pass forms. “Keep in mind, this guy is a graduate of the Israel Defense Forces,” he said. “He’s tailed brown guys for a long time.”\nIn 2008, Mamdani played on the school’s cricket team, which was mostly made up of other South Asian kids. It was the first year that the Department of Education oversaw a cricket league, and many of the other teams were from Queens, where Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and other South Asian immigrant communities were growing. “My social circles shifted,” he told me. “By the time I graduated, my closest friends lived in Bath Beach, Glen Oaks.”\nFor college, Mamdani went to Bowdoin, a bucolic liberal-arts school in Brunswick, Maine. (Columbia, where his father taught, rejected him.) Though Bowdoin was whiter and preppier than Bronx Science, Mamdani found his way. The writer Erica Berry, a close friend from college, said, “Walking through the dining hall with him would take longer than with other people, because he’d be stopping at random tables, giving high fives.” In chatty columns for the school paper, the Bowdoin Orient, Mamdani regularly sounded off on the topics of the day. On relations between athletes and non-athletes: “I propose . . . we start a process of integration.” On dance-floor etiquette: “Whether it’s grinding, the placement of your hands or leaning in for a kiss, you need to get consent.” On the “horrible choice of pump-up music” at the student gym: “How can I be expected to pump five-pound weights with Enya as my soundtrack?”\nIn time, his columns looked beyond life on campus. “I had arrived in a society where privilege was a different color,” Mamdani wrote, in 2013, about spending the summer studying Arabic in Cairo, as Mohamed Morsi was deposed by the Egyptian military. “Gone was the image of the white Christian male that I had grown accustomed to, and in its place was a darker, more familiar picture—one that, for the first time, I fit: brown skin, black hair, and a Muslim name.” The focus of the piece was Mamdani’s decision to grow a beard, which had started as a “symbolic middle finger” to the bearded-terrorist stereotype in America but acquired a different meaning during his time abroad: “Many of my Egyptian friends—first jokingly and then more seriously—told me that I looked ikhwani, like a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.”\nMamdani majored in Africana studies and wrote his thesis on the post-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon and the Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Berry remembers him holding court in the dining hall about Israel and Palestine—an unusual sight at Bowdoin, a fairly apolitical school. Matthew Miles Goodrich, who was a year behind Mamdani, and who became a founding member of the Sunrise Movement, told me, “We had a professor who liked to say that Bowdoin was a hotbed of social rest.”\nAs a junior, Mamdani co-founded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, which only a handful of his classmates joined. The following year, he exchanged public statements with Bowdoin’s president, Barry Mills, over Mills’s rejection of a call to boycott Israeli academic institutions. Mills characterized the demand as an infringement on academic freedom. Mamdani and a co-writer countered that Mills was “ignoring how the boycott has instead served as the catalyst for greater discussion of Israel’s human rights abuses.”\nThe occupation of Palestine was a formative moral and political issue for Mamdani. He says that his views were shaped by two years that his family spent in South Africa before moving to New York. “Hearing the words of Mandela about the interconnectedness of the struggle for freedom with the struggle for Palestinian human rights, and then coming here and seeing the very different way in which that same conversation was being had,” Mamdani told me, “there was a glaring exception to the supposedly universal beliefs when it came to applying them to Palestinians.” In an e-mail, Mahmood recalled discussions with his colleagues in Cape Town about “whether particular strategies for combatting apartheid—such as the global boycott of apartheid South Africa—were relevant for the struggle to decolonize or dezionize Israel.” He added,“Zohran was a listener. . . . I doubt that he remained unaffected by the exchange on these issues.”\nA few days before the taping, Colbert’s producers held a prep call with the candidates and their aides. The sample questions covered basic political topics, such as the meaning of democratic socialism. Right before the candidates went onstage, the producers appeared in the greenroom and said that they wanted to go over a few more questions. Earlier that day, a group of prominent Jewish figures, including Elisha Wiesel, the son of Elie Wiesel, had sent a letter to Colbert demanding that he grill Mamdani on his views of Israel. According to people who were in the room, one of the producers suggested a “thumbs-up or thumbs-down” segment: “Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: Hamas. Thumbs-up or thumbs-down: a Palestinian state.”\nMamdani’s face dropped. “I just couldn’t believe what was happening,” he told me. “That a genocide could be distilled into a late-night game.” His aides were incensed. “You have the first Muslim candidate for mayor in the history of New York,” Zara Rahim, a senior adviser to Mamdani, told one of the producers. “You don’t want to ask him a question about that?” (CBS did not respond to a request for comment.) In the end, the game didn’t happen, but Colbert did ask Mamdani whether he believed that Israel had the right to exist. “Yes, like all nations, I believe it has a right to exist,” he said. “And a responsibility also to uphold international law.”\nMamdani got this question so many times during the campaign that he came to feel besieged by it. “It’s Islamophobia, the way it’s posed and repeated,” a prominent Muslim leader in the city, who has talked to Mamdani about this, told me. Cuomo, who, as part of his return to political life last year, joined the legal team defending Benjamin Netanyahu in the International Criminal Court, hoped to make Mamdani’s criticisms of Israel the defining issue of the election. “It’s very simple: anti-Zionism is antisemitism,” the former governor declared, shortly after entering the race. A pro-Cuomo super PAC mocked up a mailer claiming that Mamdani “Rejects Jewish Rights.” It included a photo altered to make his beard look darker and bushier.\nThroughout the primary, Mamdani was steady in his support of Palestinian rights, though he did hone the language that he used to talk about Israel. Whereas he once made jokes about the I.D.F., he adopted a more solemn tone this year, emphasizing a sense of shared humanity. He often quotes prominent Israelis, such as the Holocaust historian Amos Goldberg, who has described Israel’s destruction of Gaza as a genocide, and the former Israeli Prime Minster Ehud Olmert, who has condemned the war as cruel and criminal. Mamdani tends to focus on Israel’s violations of international law, which are the basis of his pledge to arrest Netanyahu, in deference to a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, if Netanyahu comes to New York. (This is arguably his most tough-on-crime policy.) He emphasizes that New Yorkers don’t have to share his views on foreign policy to think he’d be a good mayor. When asked about how he’ll win over Zionist voters, he’s partial to a line from Ed Koch: “If you agree with me on nine out of twelve issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on twelve out of twelve, see a psychiatrist.”\nOne of the few times Mamdani got tripped up was in June, when he appeared on the podcast of the right-leaning publication The Bulwark. He declined to denounce the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which many supporters of Israel interpret as an incitement to anti-Jewish violence. “It’s a word that means ‘struggle,’ ” Mamdani said, referring to “intifada.” After he won the primary, performing well with Jewish voters, especially those under forty, he said that he would “discourage” his supporters from using the slogan.\nMany of Mamdani’s detractors believed that his stance on Israel would sink his campaign. But Mamdani and his earliest allies, having watched Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lose support over their refusal to oppose the Netanyahu government’s destruction of Gaza, were confident that his position on the war would be a strength. In February, when Mamdani was still unknown to many voters, Álvaro López, a leader in the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, published a memo detailing a campaign strategy for him that relied in part on mainstream Democrats who had been “radicalized” by Gaza. “A big issue with the Palestinian-solidarity movement was that they were kind of two steps ahead of where the majority of working-class people were at,” López, who grew up in Brooklyn and spent ten years as a natural-wine rep before becoming a full-time union organizer, told me. “The connection wasn’t being made to, like, ‘This is why your eggs are so expensive.’ ”\nThat disconnect—between calls for social justice and appeals to working-class voters—was an issue for Mamdani. His base appeared to be whiter, richer, and more educated than the city as a whole. His supporters have been caricatured as striving transplants who can’t decide if they’re upwardly or downwardly mobile—denizens of what the New York City data journalist Michael Lange has termed the Commie Corridor, in gentrified Brooklyn and Queens. In the primary, Mamdani did best in neighborhoods where the median income is between fifty thousand and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Cuomo won in rich and white neighborhoods, but also in poor and Black ones.\nConscious of this, Mamdani spent many Sundays this summer in church, courting Black congregations around the city. In August, he appeared at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, in Brooklyn, and read an obscure passage from the Book of Lamentations. “Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young,” he recited. “But my people have become heartless, like ostriches in the desert.” That drew some “all right” s and “amen”s, but the skepticism in the room was palpable. “Zohran knows by now that I will be on him,” Rashad Raymond Moore, the church’s senior pastor, said, after Mamdani finished speaking. “As soon as he won, I said, ‘Now, are the people who voted for you the same people who are pricing us out?’ He’s been in that tension.”\nMost days that summer, Mamdani, then twenty-five years old, caught the 1 train at 116th Street, a few blocks from where he lived with his parents. Then he’d brace himself for the hour-and-a-half-long, three-train commute to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he was working for the City Council campaign of the Reverend Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian Lutheran pastor and community organizer. Mamdani had struggled with claustrophobia since childhood—he avoided elevators when he could—and he came to remember that summer as the worst of it. When a train stalled in a tunnel, as often happened on the N as it left Atlantic Avenue, Mamdani would feel his anxiety rising. He began inviting strangers to talk to him, about anything. “It makes all the difference when you feel the walls closing in on you,” he recalled. “And then the train would get moving.”\nBefore he got involved in politics, Mamdani tried to make a career as a rapper, tutoring high-school kids to pay for studio time.He recorded multilingual songs under the name Young Cardamom, rapping in Luganda and Hindi, as well as in English, and filmed puckish, elaborate music videos. (The best one is for “Wabula Naawe,” in which Mamdani and his collaborator HAB play feuding guerrilla leaders.) But, eventually, Mamdani recalled in a podcast interview this spring,“there was a point at which my dad said, ‘I think it’s time for a real job.’ ” When I recently asked Mamdani if his mayoral run was a complex ploy to boost his Spotify streams, he shook his head. “I can tell you—they’re not up,” he assured me.\nIn 2015, Mamdani volunteered for the City Council campaign of a Queens lawyer named Ali Najmi, whom he learned about from a Village Voice interview with Heems, a former member of the rap trio Das Racist. Mamdani took a particular liking to canvassing. “Climbing a six-story walkup, getting to that top floor, and having a senior open their door—you see a glimpse into what it is that they live with every single day,” he said. He soon became a paid hand, working on several local campaigns in quick succession. El-Yateem’s campaign, in Bay Ridge—the sturdy, middle-class enclave immortalized in “Saturday Night Fever” as the home of John Travolta’s character—would become a template for his own.\nEl-Yateem, or Father K, as many know him, was born in the West Bank town of Beit Jala in 1968. At the age of nineteen, when he was a student at Bethlehem Bible College, he was arrested by the Israeli military, tortured, interrogated, and held for fifty-seven days with no charges. Six years later, he was assigned to be a pastor at a church in Bay Ridge, where the pews, once occupied by Norwegian immigrants, were filling up with Arab Christians, many of them Palestinian exiles.\nEl-Yateem was one of the first local candidates endorsed by the rejuvenated New York City D.S.A. after a membership boom that followed Bernie Sanders’s first run for President. Rather than advocating loudly for radical policies, El-Yateem emphasized cost-of-living issues and argued that the Democratic Party should expand its political tent by engaging the city’s Arab, Muslim, and South Asian communities, which together numbered about a million people yet had few representatives in local government. “We need to be part of the decision-making,” El-Yateem told NBC News.\nOn Election Day, El-Yateem lost, placing second in a five-way race, with more than thirty per cent of the vote. At that time, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was still a bartender at a Mexican restaurant near Union Square. El-Yateem’s showing looked to Mamdani like a breakthrough. The fact that a socialist Arab immigrant who supported the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement could pull thirty per cent in Bay Ridge was enough to make him think that he could run for office himself. “Bernie gave me the language of democratic socialism,” Mamdani said. “Khader El-Yateem showed me that all my different politics, they had a place that they could belong.”\nAfter the Summer of Hell, perhaps sensing that he’d one day need to keep his cool on the train, Mamdani saw a behavioral therapist, to address his claustrophobia. For their last session, Mamdani and the therapist rode the subway together. To both of their alarm, the train stopped in a dark tunnel. “The therapist was, like, ‘Did you stall this train?’ ” Mamdani told me, laughing.\nHe found the apartment on StreetEasy, in 2018. It was advertised as spacious, with an eat-in kitchen. In reality, it’s tiny, what a broker might creatively call a classic three. The living room, which has a single window, is decorated with elegant vintage couches, healthy-looking houseplants, and posters for old Bollywood movies. On a bookshelf I spotted a copy of “The Power Broker,” Erica Berry’s “Wolfish,” and Kal Penn’s memoir, “You Can’t Be Serious.” (Nair has credited a teen-age Zohran with persuading her to cast Penn in her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri’s “The Namesake” after he saw “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.”) “Chicken or goat?” Mamdani asked, flipping the contents of plastic takeout containers onto plates and handing one to me. An aide had run out for biryani.\nAfter Mamdani moved to Astoria, he took a job as a foreclosure-prevention counsellor at Chhaya, a community-development organization that serves South Asian and Indo-Caribbean immigrants. His salary was forty-seven thousand dollars; the apartment was rent-stabilized. When Mamdani signed the lease, the rent was two thousand dollars a month. Now he and Duwaji, his wife, pay twenty-three hundred. (Duwaji, an illustrator who has contributed to The New Yorker, did much of the decorating.) Sitting on a purple-and-gold sofa, Mamdani tasted his biryani and frowned. It was a little bland. “We won’t reveal where I got this,” he said. He ate with his hands—something that has become a fixation among right-wingers—and offered me a fork and knife.\nWorking with Chhaya clients who were facing foreclosure, Mamdani got an intimate look at the little insanities of the city’s housing crisis. Many of his clients were small landlords—immigrant owners of two-family properties who relied on tenants to stay afloat. He tried to match clients with government programs that might help them, but often there was nothing he could do. “I remember talking to this Pakistani guy, who only spoke Urdu,” he said. “I asked him, ‘Did you know that the lien on your house is about to be sold?’ And he said, ‘No, I had no idea.’ ”\nFrom the beginning, a centerpiece of Mamdani’s campaign has been his proposal to freeze the rents for the city’s million or so rent-stabilized units—generally found in buildings of six or more apartments which were built before 1974. A mayor can do this, in effect, because the mayor appoints all nine members of the Rent Guidelines Board, which determines how much the owners of these buildings are allowed to raise the rent each year. What Mamdani and some of his allies in the tenants’-rights movement appreciated is that the board isn’t some sleepy arm of the city bureaucracy—it is full of political potential. De Blasio backed rent freezes three times in his eight years as mayor; under Adams, rent for these apartments has been allowed to increase, cumulatively, about twelve per cent. “The Rent Guidelines Board is sort of like a Swedish social-democracy institution,” Cea Weaver, a D.S.A.-aligned tenant organizer who has been advising Mamdani, said. “Organized tenants and organized landlords come together in front of a city board appointed by the mayor, who is reflective of the general populace.”\nA decade and a half ago, an elaborately coiffed stunt candidate named Jimmy McMillan ran for governor of New York with the indelible catchphrase “The rent is too damn high!” At the time, the tagline got mostly laughs; Kenan Thompson played McMillan on “Saturday Night Live.” But, just a few years later, socialist candidates in the outer boroughs discovered that McMillan had been on to something. Tascha Van Auken, who managed a network of fifty thousand volunteers during Mamdani’s primary campaign, told me, “People were feeling the affordability pinch extra, extra urgently.” Van Auken, who also recently served as the artistic-direction manager for Blue Man Group, was involved with Ocasio-Cortez’s first campaign and ran or helped out on several other D.S.A. races that toppled Democratic incumbents. In every local campaign she’s worked on, Van Auken said, the pain of rising rents was one of the first things people talked about when they answered their doors. Local D.S.A. politicians tried to get their neighbors to see “renter” as a political identity; Mamdani made “freeze the rent” a citywide rallying cry.\nIf Mamdani is elected and secures a rent freeze next year, one of his biggest opponents will be an old friend. Kenny Burgos, who was two years behind Mamdani at Bronx Science, was elected to the Assembly in 2020, and the two sat next to each other in the legislature. Burgos, a Democrat but not a D.S.A. member, shocked many in Albany last year when he gave up his seat to become the C.E.O. of the New York Apartment Association, a lobby group that represents the landlords of rent-stabilized buildings. Like Mamdani, Burgos is fluent in the new political language of social media. Earlier this year, when the N.Y.A.A. contributed two and a half million dollars to a super PAC backing Cuomo in the primary, he texted Mamdani a GIF of Wesley Snipes weeping while shooting his friend, from the movie “New Jack City.” Mamdani gave it a “HA HA” reaction.\nBurgos’s members have been making noise since 2019, when tenants’-rights groups in Albany pushed Cuomo to impose stringent regulations on them. “The 2019 rent laws systematically destroyed parts of the real-estate industry,” Jason Haber, a co-founder of the American Real Estate Association and a senior broker at Compass, who has advised an anti-Mamdani super PAC, told me. Old apartment buildings get more expensive to maintain as they age; when rents stay flat, owners can feel squeezed. (Mamdani likes to point out that the Rent Guidelines Board’s most recent data show net operating income for landlords of rent-stabilized buildings up 12.1 per cent in a single year.) Weaver, the tenant organizer, worries that a freeze will prompt landlords to engage in a “capital strike,” in which they withhold updates and repairs to their properties. “Zohran holds the political cards, but landlords are able to create the narrative that the buildings need more money,” she said. “It’s what keeps me up at night.”\nMamdani knows that a rent freeze won’t solve New York’s housing crisis: rent-stabilized units make up only about a quarter of the city’s housing stock. The median rent for an apartment on the open market has topped thirty-five hundred dollars. High-end condos in Manhattan can sell for five thousand dollars a square foot. Some hundred and forty thousand New York City schoolchildren are homeless. Part of Mamdani’s strategy has been to cast the affordability problem as one that affects everyone, even the rich. “This is a crisis that is suffocating many rungs of life,” he told me.“It’s one crisis that has varying levels of intensity, all deeply felt.”\nEffectively addressing the problem will require the construction of hundreds of thousands of housing units in a city already stuffed with them, and major help from the state government in Albany, which Mamdani isn’t guaranteed to get. He’s advocated for the city to become more involved in housing construction and development, but he’s also flirted with the rhetoric of “abundance,” and expressed an openness to private development. According to the Times, Mamdani suggested at a meeting with Black executives in July that the rent freeze might not be permanent. (“He has said time and time again that the policy commitment is for four years,” an aide told me.) When I asked Mamdani what was negotiable and what wasn’t, he put up his hands, declining to rule anything out. “I’m not running to punish landlords,” he said. “We know it’s a broken system.”\nBurgos disagreed with that assessment. “He got stuff done,” he told me. Burgos mentioned the hundreds of millions of dollars in debt relief that Mamdani helped taxi-medallion owners win from City Hall in 2021, in part by going on a fifteen-day hunger strike, and a pilot program that made one bus route in every borough free. “Find me another new Assembly member who got tens of millions of dollars for an individual program,” Burgos said.\nBurgos remembered talking to Mamdani after Adams won the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary: “He was, like, ‘Who are we going to get to run against this guy in four years?’ I said, ‘Why don’t you do it?’ He said, ‘I’m too young, they won’t take me seriously.’ ” Mamdani was then becoming a prominent figure in D.S.A., which had positioned itself against the mainstream Democratic Party. In Albany, Mamdani attended weekly meetings of the Socialists in Office Committee, and he considered himself an ambassador for the organization. “For me, there’s no point in doing this without D.S.A.,” he told the leftist magazine Dissent in 2022.\nSince D.S.A. started winning elections in the late twenty-tens, it’s had to confront the challenge of having allies in power. Last year, national D.S.A. leaders withdrew their endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez because she strayed from the organization’s line on Israel. Mamdani has encouraged members to put on the pressure. “It’s a good thing that the rank and file of the organization has been emboldened to make demands of elected officials,” he told Dissent. “We cannot count on our electeds going into these spaces coming out the way they were sent in.”\nIn the spring of 2023, Mamdani introduced the Not on Our Dime! act, a measure that would prohibit New York nonprofits from sending any money to support illegal settler activity in Gaza and the West Bank. He argued that tens of millions of dollars were passing through local groups to support “violations of international law.” “The leadership came down on it harder than any bill I’d ever seen,” a veteran Democratic state senator told me. “They said it would never get a floor vote.” Dozens of colleagues, including Burgos, signed a letter denouncing Mamdani and his co-sponsors. The bill “was only introduced to antagonize pro-Israel New Yorkers and further sow divisions within the Democratic Party,” the letter said. Burgos spoke with Mamdani shortly afterward. “He said, ‘I’ll never pass another bill in this town again,’ ” Burgos told me.\nWhen I asked Mamdani if he’d thought his career in Albany was over at that point, he shook his head. “I lived through many ends in Albany,” he said. A few months later, the Hamas attacks of October 7th, and the ruptures they immediately produced in the U.S., gave new shape to Mamdani’s politics. On October 13th, he was arrested during a ceasefire demonstration outside Chuck Schumer’s apartment in Park Slope. He conferred with other Muslim leaders who were concerned about Islamophobic backlash in the city, and some of them became part of the brain trust of his mayoral campaign.\nThat winter, Mamdani was invited by leaders of the Working Families Party to a series of meetings with other elected officials who were considering challenging Eric Adams in the primary. (It’s hard to remember now, but this was before Adams was indicted, before Trump got reëlected, and before Adams and Trump cut a deal.) The W.F.P. was floating the idea of having several candidates run as a collaborative slate, to avoid the infighting that they believed helped Adams win in 2021. The other candidates, for the most part, didn’t know Mamdani or trust D.S.A. “The movement against the war is growing, Zohran is at the center of it, and we thought, He needs to be at the table,” Ana María Archila, the W.F.P.’s other New York co-director, recalled. “I can’t tell you how much resistance there was to his presence.” Meanwhile, some D.S.A.-affiliated officials worried that Mamdani would look like a “spoiler” and hurt the organization’s standing with progressive Democrats. “This is unfair to our project as a whole and could be ruinous,” Emily Gallagher, an Assembly member from Brooklyn, wrote to members of the New York chapter, ahead of a vote on endorsing him.\nMamdani’s campaign began in earnest last fall, after Trump won his second term. Many people’s first encounter with him was a video he posted in November, in which he interviewed Black and brown New Yorkers in working-class neighborhoods about why Trump had done better with their cohort—and why some of them hadn’t voted at all—in 2024. Some talked about food prices and the cost of living; others talked about being demoralized by war. “I like the Democrats, but I don’t like this in Gaza—a lot of people are dying,” a bearded older man said. At a moment when Democrats appeared clueless about social media and out of touch with working-class people, Mamdani came across as curious and undaunted.\nSo began a campaign that fused blunt political messaging with bighearted moving images—a sensibility not unlike that of Nair’s films. In a video promoting the rent freeze, Mamdani plunged into the frigid waters of Coney Island on New Year’s Day and emerged with his suit and tie sopping; he made late-night visits to halal venders to discuss the rising costs of chicken and rice. In all his videos, an affectionate and softly romantic vision of the city came through. In May, the W.F.P. ranked Mamdani at the top of its slate of endorsements, and though his competitors kept waiting for him to slip, he only kept up his run of deft politicking.\nThe week before the primary, one of Mamdani’s aides, Julian Gerson, suggested that he walk the length of Manhattan, meeting voters along the way. The rest of the campaign staff thought it was impractical, but Mamdani was taken with it. That Friday night, at dusk, Mamdani set out from Inwood. The resulting video, of a young candidate striding through the city into the early-morning hours, getting cheers everywhere he went, convinced more than a few holdouts that something was happening.\nHe recounts this story in “Slow Poison: Idi Amin, Yoweri Museveni, and the Making of the Ugandan State,” his latest book on African politics, published this month by Harvard University Press. In Mahmood’s recollection, the bus driver, after being informed of his young passenger’s religion, reached for his microphone. “Folks, we have a Muslim with us,” he said. “He wants to stop for ten minutes so he can pray.”\nThe driver asked for a show of hands—how many on the bus would be O.K. with an unscheduled stop? Everyone raised a hand. The driver pulled over. When Mahmood got out, the other passengers followed him. They formed a circle around him and watched as he prostrated himself. Then everybody got back on the bus together.\nMahmood told me in an e-mail that he did not feel afraid when the other passengers surrounded him. “I assumed an innocent curiosity on their part,” he wrote. “No one I had met thought that Muslims are naturally inclined to terrorism. . . . The overwhelming belief was that political consciousness was learnt, and taught, through engagement and encounters. Thinking of my fellow travelers in the bus, there was nothing threatening about them, no reason for me to give it a second thought.”\nZohran Mamdani grew up in the world that has emerged since that bus trip. One of his early memories of New York is from after 9/11, when a teacher pulled him aside and said to tell her if anyone tried to make him feel bad about his religion. He was nine. This past summer, Mamdani endured death threats, racist harassment, and accusations of antisemitism. “It takes a toll,” he said, tearing up, at a press conference amid the controversy after the Bulwark podcast. “When I speak, especially when I speak with emotion, I am characterized by those same rivals as being a monster, as being at the gates—language that describes almost a barbarian looking to dismantle civilization.”\nThe same qualities that make Mamdani a generational figure have already made him a target. “There’s no ‘if’ about it—as soon as Zohran puts his hand on the Quran and is sworn in as the first Muslim mayor of New York, Donald Trump will start firing away,” Gaspard, formerly of the Center for American Progress, said. Bernie Sanders, practically yelling into the phone, reminded me of the repression that has historically kept socialists at the margins of American politics. “There was extraordinary opposition, illegal opposition,” Sanders said. “You know that, right?”\nMamdani spent the summer meeting with people who are trying to assess how much of a break from the past he’ll actually be. Not every Wall Street suit who met Mamdani hated him. “He’s not looking for a government takeover,” one told me, with measured optimism. “I don’t think he’s a socialist.” City Hall veterans have emphasized that, apart from Trump’s incursions, Mamdani’s ability to govern will be defined by the people he surrounds himself with—and that he may have to choose between people who are experienced and people who share his political program. “His circle is small,” a former deputy mayor told me. “He’s going to have to take chances and be prepared to be wrong.”\nMamdani has said that, until the evening of the primary, he had doubts about whether he could win. He spent an hour and a half furiously writing a victory speech after Cuomo called him early that night to concede. Sitting with Mamdani in his living room, as the single window darkened, I got the sense that the feeling of surprise had worn off. It was around 9 P.M. when he nudged me toward the door. “My brother,” he said, slapping his hands on his knees and rising from the sofa. Mamdani’s night wasn’t over. There were more calls with aides, more interviews to prepare for. He took our dishes to the kitchen and started rinsing them in the sink. He was still wearing his tie. ♦","summary":"The thirty-three-year-old socialist is rewriting the rules of New York politics.

Follow them at therevolvingdoorproject.org.\n\nFor decades, many Democratic pundits and strategists have had a simple answer for how the party could win: move to “the center.” Just look at Bill Clinton: After three consecutive routs in presidential elections from 1980 to 1988, Clinton ended the longest period of continuous Republican White House occupancy since the run-up to the Great Depression.\n\nDemocrats’ 1992 win is often attributed to Bill Clinton’s embrace of “Third Way” neoliberal politics, seasoning conservative economic policy with a pinch of putative social liberalism. However, as his secretary of labor (Robert Reich) recently observed, the 1992 campaign was far more heterogeneous than that telling lets on. In line with his iconic “it’s the economy, stupid” declaration, Clinton ran on significant fiscal stimulus, raising taxes on the wealthy, and public health care. Crediting moderation for the 1992 win misstates the order of events; tacking to the right followed winning the election.\n\nMoreover, Clinton’s “New Democrats” did worse in congressional elections following the party’s embrace of Third Way politics over the course of early 1993, when advisors like Robert Rubin successfully pushed for abandoning more populist campaign promises in favor of austerity. From 1930 to 1994, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives for all but four years, or about 94 percent of the time. From 1994 to the present, the party has held a House majority only 27 percent of the time—eight years total. Democratic dominance in the Senate in the 20th century was less pronounced, with Republican majorities for 12 years between 1930 and 1994. Since 1994, Democrats have held Senate majorities for 12 years. That’s a drop from controlling the upper chamber 81 percent of the time to just 40 percent.\n\nNow, this was not entirely about neoliberalism. The main reason for the party’s dominance in that period was the Democratic “Solid South,” and that was doomed once Democrats became the party of civil rights (though it took some years to shake out). Still, if Clintonite politics was so powerful, then one would expect winning the House more than a quarter of the time.\n\nWhatever the case, on the heels of the party’s 2024 defeat, Democrats are again searching for a way out of the wilderness. Unsurprisingly, a loud chorus is insisting the shortest path is a sharp right turn. It is hard to predict exactly what will work in politics, but compulsively playing up moderation and savvy positioning on key issues undermines the party’s brand, legitimates Republican talking points, and reinforces the perception that the Democratic Party stands for nothing.\n\nTHE EMPIRICAL CASE FOR CLINTONITE TRIANGULATION runs into some immediate difficulties. Political scientists have argued that moderate candidates are historically more likely to win, but as G. Elliott Morris demonstrates, any such advantage was barely detectable in 2024. There is a debate about the statistical analysis here, as it’s hard to be certain about just how little the benefit is, or what “moderation” even means, but it’s simply undeniable that the centrist elements of both parties have dwindled. Most of the “electable moderates” of ages past have lost.\n\nMore concretely, in 2024, Kamala Harris ran a fairly moderate campaign: she boasted about her gun ownership, pandered to cryptocurrency holders, promised to secure the border and deploy more police to fight crime, campaigned with the Republican Liz Cheney, and picked a straight, cis white man (albeit a fairly progressive one) as her running mate. Indeed, in her book, Harris says that she opted not to select Pete Buttigieg as her running mate out of a concern for backlash to a woman of color and a queer person sharing the ticket.\n\nHarris also refused to give protesters against the Gaza genocide so much as a hearing. This clash reached its acme at the Democratic National Convention, where protestors demanded the party allow a pro-Palestine speaker (whose proposed speech was completely reasonable) to take the stage. Democratic leadership, and Harris specifically, rebuffed this demand, despite turning the stage over to multiple pro-Israeli speakers.\n\nConversely, when various big donors and moderate pundits criticized Harris’s anti-price gouging program, which included a fairly mild program to control large increases in grocery prices, which polled extremely well, she backed away from it. “When your opponent calls you ‘communist,’ maybe don’t propose price controls,” suggested former Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell. The Post editorial board lamented that Harris had wasted her economic policy’s potential by caving to “populist gimmicks.” Neoliberal mainstays Ken Rogoff, Jason Furman, and Noah Smith all lambasted the Harris campaign.\n\nFollowing this outcry, Harris all but abandoned her winning economic populist bent out of concern of alienating centrists and wealthy businesspeople. As The New York Times reported, the campaign handed off economic messaging to Uber executive and Harris’s brother-in-law Tony West, who made a point, as he did while a member of Obama’s Justice Department, to defer to the wishes of corporate titans.\n\nWhile Harris was not as conservative as Clinton in 1996, all in all it was a fairly triangulate-y campaign. It did not work.\n\nAnd if Harris’s relatively moderate campaign has somehow been memory-holed by the politics experts of 2025, Joe Biden’s fairly progressive campaign of 2020 has also been carefully forgotten. His abominable later record on Gaza notwithstanding, he ran on a massive welfare state buildout, full employment, “at least three” genders, and with a Black woman running mate. That did work.\n\nOf course, it would be going too far to conclude that progressive policy and messaging is guaranteed to work, while centrist moderation will always fail. Political success depends on many things—the particular talents and weaknesses of each candidate, incumbency, the economic and historical moment, the bias of journalists, the information environment, and on and on.\n\nBut it is clear that centrist Democrats are much more concerned with shutting down the left than providing a good-faith case that moderation wins. The fact that they largely ignore Harris’s Clintonite campaign is proof of that.\n\nIn 2024, voters concerned about Gaza were met with the casual, callous deflection of “Trump will be worse.” Centrists insisted, ad nauseum, that protesters needed to shut up and fall in line. On the flip side, when Harris did something that offended neoliberal sensibilities by suggesting that companies shouldn’t be able to charge consumers exorbitant prices for food immediately following natural disasters, those same commentators and establishment figures tripped over themselves to smear Harris as a communist. In both instances, the rush toward the center was accomplished by punching left, harming the party’s image by branding large swathes of their copartisans as dangerous radicals who can’t be trusted to lead.\n\nCentrist Democrats seeking to distance themselves from the left seem compelled to regurgitate Republican broadsides against the left.\n\nThis tendency is a hallmark of Democratic triangulation. When Republicans moderate, they rarely do it by tarring their conservative flank. They disagree without denigrating. On the other hand, centrist Democrats seeking to distance themselves from the left seem compelled to regurgitate Republican broadsides against the left as if driven by some primal instinct. They seem unable to envision a way of toning down their progressivism without fundamentally validating the Republican critique such a move is intended to address.\n\nThis compulsion to validate the right also leads centrists to misjudge public opinion, or fail to anticipate obvious trends. Ezra Klein, for instance, caused a stir recently when he suggested that to be nationally competitive, Democrats needed to run pro-life candidates in Missouri, Ohio, and Kansas. Notably, Klein managed to select three states where recent pro-choice ballot initiatives passed easily. Who’s laser-focused on public opinion, again?\n\nCentrists also played into the right’s hands with Gaza protests, joining with conservatives to tar universities as radicalizing, anti-free speech cesspools of antisemitism. That falsehood is now the justification for Trump and Vance’s war on higher education as they seek to end free speech on campuses and subjugate academia to the regime’s ideology. And now as public opinion has steadily and predictably soured on Israel, particularly among Democrats, even some of the most fanatical pro-Israel centrists are scrambling to hedge their bets.\n\nElsewhere, at the centrist confab WelcomeFest, speakers specifically cautioned against highlighting ICE’s illegal deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and lamented that Democrats had opposed Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill. However, while a narrow majority supported Florida’s original bill, the expansion to exclude LGBTQ content all the way up to 8th grade was unpopular and resulted in 40 percent of Florida parents reporting they’d like to move. And highlighting Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to an El Salvador gulag allowed Democrats, particularly Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, to turn the tide of public opinion against Trump on draconian immigration enforcement. It was a safe bet that the public would turn on Trump’s horrible immigration policies once they got a good look at them, because that’s what happened last time.\n\nEmpirically, research has found that when left-wing parties embrace anti-immigration politics, they lose vote share and empower the far right. For a concrete example, look at the U.K., where Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attempted to outflank Nigel Farage’s Reform party to the right, and earned himself a 69 percent disapproval rating. Democrats’ leading lights apparently aim to replicate this disastrous failure.\n\nAs Hunter Walker and Luppe B Luppen write in their book The Truce, Joe Biden was the first Democratic president in decades to cut a genuine deal with his party’s progressive wing (at least until he threw it away on Gaza). The result was a productive working relationship that would have gotten a lot more done if he hadn’t been repeatedly betrayed by centrists like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nIt is one thing for moderates to argue for their position within the Democratic coalition. It is quite another to constantly smear their own coalition members—and by extension their party as a whole—with transparently fraudulent arguments that progressivism can never win.","summary":"Pivoting to the right didn't work in 2024.

'You also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot.'\n\nLater on in the video call, in which Porter touted the Biden administration's climate agenda and promoted electric vehicles, the then-Congresswoman reportedly also complained to Granholm that she had not yet visited the White House despite raising a 's**t ton' of money for Biden.\n\n'Never been there,' she lamented. 'Some of my colleagues [have been] there three, four times. I don't fit in the photo-op for some reason.' \n\nShe also moaned about being out of touch with Biden officials. \n\n'I'm like the least in-connection with the White House member of Congress,' Porter reportedly said - prompting Granholm to try to assuage her.\n\n'That is not true,' the then-Energy Secretary could be heard saying, according to Politico. \n\nThe final, edited version of the webinar that was published by the Department of Energy, did not include the exchanges.\n\nBut the new report spells trouble for Porter, who has faced accusations for years that she was a difficult boss or was abusive to employees during her time in Congress.\n\nHer recent meltdown in an interview with local CBS News reporter Julie Watts also does not seem to help.\n\nIn the now-viral interview, Porter was being probed about Newsom's attempt to redistrict California to benefit Democrats - and what she would say to Californians who voted for President Donald Trump whom Watts said she will 'need to win.'\n\nPorter, though, seemed to disagree as she furrowed her brow and asked: 'How would I need them in order to win, ma'am?'\n\nStill, Watts stood her ground. \n\n'Unless you think you're going to get 60 percent of the vote. You think you'll get 60 percent? Everyone who did not vote for Trump will vote for you?'\n\nPresident Trump won just 38 percent of the vote in the Golden State to Kamala Harris' 58 percent.\n\n'If it is me versus a Republican? I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump,' Porter said, after laughing at Watts' initial question.\n\nWatts then pointed out that California's electoral system involves a 'jungle primary,' in which several candidates from all parties contest one primary, with the top two candidates moving on to the general.\n\nWith that in mind, Porter was pressed on what would happen were her general election opponent to be another Democrat.\n\n'I don't intend that to be the case,' she responded.\n\nWatts then questioned how Porter could be sure that a Democrat-on-Democrat general wouldn't happen.\n\nThe question prompted the former congresswoman to get increasingly annoyed, as she said she would build the support and cited her experience representing Orange County in Congress, which is a swing district.\n\n'But you just said you don't need those Trump voters,' Watts retorted.\n\nWith that, Porter finally began to crack, starting to gesture with her hands and questioning Watts' interview. \n\n'Well you asked me if I needed them to win. I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative, what is your question?'\n\nAt that point, Watts returned to the original topic, which was that she wanted to know what she'd say to Trump voters against Newsom's redistricting efforts.\n\n'I'm happy to say that, it's the 'do you need them to win' part that I don't understand,' the Democrat responded.\n\nStill, she became fed up with the questions.\n\n'I don't want to keep doing this, I want to call it. Thank you,' she said, suggesting she was about to walk out on Watts.\n\nWatts asked: 'You're not going to do the interview with us?'\n\nPorter answered: 'Nope, not like this, I'm not. Not with seven follow-ups to every single question you ask.'\n\nWatts said that 'every single candidate' had gone through a similar interview, with Porter responding: 'I don't care.'\n\n'I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation in which you ask me about every issue on this list and if every question, you're gonna make up a follow up question, we're never going to get there,' she continued.\n\nPorter indignantly claimed she 'never had to do this before' as she was daring herself to walk out on Watts, who again pointed out that every other candidate had done the same interview. \n\n'I'm me. I'm running for governor because I'm a leader, so I am going to make-' she said before Watts asked: 'So you're not going to answer interview questions from reporters?'\n\nWatts tried to bring the interview back to her list of questions but Porter refused. \n\n'I don't want to have a negative experience with you and I don't want this all on camera,' Porter said.\n\nWatts agreed that she didn't want to have a negative experience either but she would 'love to continue to ask these questions so that we can show our viewers what every candidate feels about every one of these issues that they care about and redistricting is a massive issue.'\n\nThe clip was blasted across social media and pounced on by her electoral rivals on both sides.\n\nFellow Democrat Xavier Beccera wrote: 'I’m not interested in excluding any vote.

It's time for change in California.'\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Porter's campaign for comment.\n\nBut in a statement to Politico on Wednesday, the former congresswoman said: 'It's no secret I hold myself and my staff to a higher standard and that was especially true as a member of Congress.\n\n'I have sought to be more intentional in showing gratitude to my staff for their important work,' she said.\n\nPorter left Congress following an unsuccessful run for Senate. \n\nShe was first elected to Congress in the 2018 midterms and has represented first California's 45th district and then 47th district since 2023.","summary":"Aspiring California governor Katie Porter once flipped out at a staffer for 'getting in her shot' in a newly-resurfaced video.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15175383/Katie-Porter-flips-staffer-video.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/09/01/102827697-0-image-a-43_1759968813027.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/08/3510054249005496384/1024x576_MP4_3510054249005496384.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-09 01:29:28","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":367537942,"title":"Breitbart Business Digest: An Anti-Tariff Paper Accidentally Makes the Case for Trump's Tariffs","text":"Learning the Wrong History of Declining Manufacturing Employment\n\nFor decades, politicians have promised to bring back factory jobs. A new working paper from a pair of liberal economists at Stanford’s Institute for Economic Policy Research tries to make sense of what actually drives manufacturing employment. It’s full of useful data. But in trying to defend the conventional wisdom against tariffs, it ends up making the case for exactly the policies—Donald Trump’s tariffs—that it tries to argue against.\n\nEconomists Jared Bernstein and Daniel Posthumus, in a working paper released last month, examined manufacturing employment from 1949 to today. Their decomposition is straightforward: employment growth equals output growth minus productivity growth. The story is clear.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1970, factory jobs grew 1.4 percent annually because output growth outpaced productivity gains. From 1970 to 2000, employment stagnated as productivity accelerated. Since 2000, jobs have fallen 1.2 percent per year as output growth collapsed.\n\nThe worst period was 2000 to 2010, the “China Shock” period. As Chinese imports flooded American markets, 5.7 million factory jobs disappeared. The trade deficit hit 6.5 percent of GDP. Entire communities were devastated.\n\nBernstein and Posthumus call this period “destructive” and say that such shocks shouldn’t happen again. Then they argue against the one policy tool that would actually prevent it.\n\nThe Dependency Contradiction\n\nThe paper opposes “sweeping tariffs” on the grounds that “half of our imports are inputs into domestic manufacturing.” Tax those imports, the argument goes, and you make American production more expensive and less competitive.\n\nBut that claim proves too much. If American factories are so dependent on foreign parts that taxing them would cause significant disruption, what does that say about our vulnerability?\n\nBernstein and Posthumus themselves advocate subsidies for sectors “vulnerable to export controls from trading partners”—semiconductors, batteries, critical minerals. These are areas where foreign suppliers could cut us off, threatening national security or economic stability. But if we’re so dependent on imported inputs that tariffs would disrupt production, we’re massively vulnerable to export controls. The authors’ anti-tariff argument accidentally proves we’ve hollowed out our industrial base to a dangerous degree.\n\nYou can’t have it both ways. Either imported inputs are critical to our manufacturing—in which case that dependence represents exactly the strategic vulnerability that justifies bringing production home—or they’re not critical, in which case tariffs won’t cause the disruption predicted.\n\nThe authors have documented a crisis and then argued we’re too dependent to fix it.\n\nTarifflation Didn’t Happen\n\nBut set aside the logic for a moment and look at what actually happened. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs beginning in April 2025, including the Liberation Day tariffs. The authors published this paper in September, months after those tariffs took effect.\n\nAccording to the tariff-bashers, prices should have risen sharply. They predicted that higher import costs would get passed to consumers. Kamala Harris called it a national sales tax. Anti-tariff economists insisted that Americans pay the tariff tax.\n\nExcept that’s not what the data shows. The Harvard Business School tariff price tracker—which monitors prices on tariffed imports versus non-tariffed domestic goods as well as domestic goods whose prices might be affected by tariffs—finds that prices on non-tariffed domestic goods have risen more than prices on tariffed imports. Prices of domestic goods that are considered affected by tariffs—because they have lots of tariffed inputs or compete with imports—are down since Liberation Day.\n\nThe tarifflation scare story has come crashing down. Importers absorbed costs through lower margins. Foreign exporters cut prices to maintain market share. Domestic competitors held prices steady to gain share from imports. The predicted price increases didn’t materialize.\n\nThis completely undermines the central economic case against tariffs. If tariffs don’t raise consumer prices—and the evidence so far says they haven’t—what’s the argument against them? That they might raise prices in the future? That they violate free trade theory?\n\nAt some point, evidence matters more than theory.\n\nTomorrow: Part II of our examination of the Bernstein and Posthumus paper.","summary":"A new academic paper attempting to defend the conventional wisdom against Trump's tariffs unwittingly made the case for them.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: An Anti-Tariff Paper Accidentally Makes the Case for Trump&#8217;s Tariffs appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/10/08/breitbart-business-digest-an-anti-tariff-paper-accidentally-makes-the-case-for-trumps-tariffs/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/trump-dance-getty-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 01:00:57","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.68},{"id":367584460,"title":"Retribution Is Here","text":"If the secret to understanding a strongman is to identify his greatest weakness, one place to start with Donald Trump is his obsession with his own eventual obituaries. Trump knows that they will mention his history-making presidencies, his ostentatious wealth, and his unusual charisma—but he also is aware that when he dies, people will remember his conviction on 34 felony counts, and that there is nothing he can do about it. Even now, White House officials have told me, Trump rages about how his guilty verdict is sure to be mentioned way up high in his obituaries.\n\nTrump’s fixation on all of this leapt to mind today when I heard that he’d called for the arrests of the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago—not just because it explains Trump’s psychology, but also because this obsession is one of the driving motivations of his revenge crusade, which is now escalating dramatically.\n\nIt bears pausing on the starkness of these facts: The president of the United States today demanded the jailing of two elected officials who belong to the opposing political party. Trump did not offer evidence that Governor J. B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson had committed a crime, nor did he even suggest what charge either man would face, though the outburst presumably stemmed from their opposition to Trump sending the National Guard to Chicago to protect ICE officers.\n\nThis, of course, is hardly the first time Trump has urged the incarceration of his political foes. (This is the man who led “Lock her up” chants at his rallies, after all.) But what makes this moment so significant is what happened a short time later, in a courtroom just outside Washington, D.C. There, former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned on charges of making false statements to Congress. Trump’s threats are no longer bluster. The guardrails of his first term are gone. He is instead surrounded by enablers, including a pliant attorney general. The federal government is taking legal action against those whom Trump wants punished. Retribution is here.\n\nWhite House aides scoffed to reporters in the first months of this administration that the talk of vengeance was an overblown media creation and that Trump was instead focusing on matters such as tariffs and resolving global conflicts. They acknowledged that during a signature campaign speech, Trump had flat-out declared, “I am your retribution,” promising his supporters that he’d strike back at those in power who they believed had oppressed them or curtailed their freedoms. He would simply right some wrongs, his aides claimed, by, say, pardoning the January 6 rioters—and yes, yes, all of them, including those who’d violently attacked police officers. Even as those around him, led by his aide Stephen Miller and others using Project 2025 as a playbook, began to challenge powerful institutions—such as law firms and universities—that they believed had long worked against conservatives, the president’s aides insisted that talk of revenge was just hyperbole.\n\nYet after the passage of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the revival of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, things changed, one current and two former White House officials, as well as one outside adviser, told me on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump couldn’t get some die-hard MAGA supporters to stop dwelling on his ties to the disgraced sex offender. The signature Republican legislation proved unpopular. The economy, whipsawed by tariffs, was displaying warning signs. Trump’s poll numbers began to slip, and the GOP was in danger of losing the midterms—which alarmed Trump and fueled some of his most extreme moves. With Republican control of Congress in danger, Trump began focusing more on retaliation.\n\nTrump has long ruminated about the criminal and civil charges that were brought against him after his first term in office. He now privately acknowledges that they were a political gift, believing that the charges reeked of government overreach and made him look like a martyr to his supporters, the outside adviser and one former official told me. He has told advisers that, in retrospect, every day he spent at the defense table in a Manhattan courtroom during a trial for falsifying business records was a political advertisement. The case yielded a conviction, but that was the only trial he faced before last year’s presidential election (after his win, he faced no real punishment and was able to make the other cases vanish). But in the moment, he was terrified of being convicted and still seethes at the humiliation he faced.\n\nHe has fumed for months to aides and outside allies about the injustices he believes he has faced, but often, his rants—or social-media posts—have not contained explicit instructions, leaving it up to officials to determine how, or whether, to carry out his wishes, one current and one former aide told me. But one Truth Social post late last month was shocking in its directness. In what appeared to have been intended as a private message to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump directly called for the prosecution of Comey as well as of Senator Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James. All three had crossed Trump: Comey had helped steer the initial steps of the Russia investigation; Schiff was among the leaders of Trump’s first impeachment; James was behind a civil case that resulted in a $500 million penalty for the president. Comey was indicted just days after Trump’s message, in a case brought by a replacement federal prosecutor after the original attorney balked and was forced out. Another prosecutor reportedly resigned rather than bring charges against James.\n\nThe normal barriers between the White House and the Department of Justice were obliterated. And Trump made his motivation plain, writing in the message to Bondi: “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n\nTrump has never much cared for the principles of the criminal-justice system. In the 1980s, he added to his then-growing fame by calling for the execution of the five suspects in the Central Park jogger case before they’d even been convicted. (They were later exonerated.) In his 2016 campaign, he called for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, though she had not been charged with any crime. In his first term, Trump believed that the Department of Justice was there to serve his whims—he famously asked for his own Roy Cohn, the notoriously ruthless New York lawyer—but was stymied at times by his previous attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, and by entrenched department norms enforced by career officials. Trump’s wishes for investigations into Clinton, John Kerry, and Barack Obama were denied.\n\nBut those obstacles are gone. Trump has insisted that the Department of Justice under Joe Biden was weaponized against him, claims goaded on by aides such as Miller and Russell Vought, who also champion efforts to expand the president’s power over all facets of the executive branch. And Bondi’s appearance before the Senate oversight committee yesterday was defined by her refusal to answer basic questions about her work—including the Comey indictment—as well as an obsequiousness to Trump that suggested that she was indeed comfortable acting as the president’s personal lawyer.\n\n“The firewall between the political side and the DOJ has completely eroded,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told me in an email. “And there’s the very peculiar parallel that you have a former FBI director coming in to be charged with lying to Congress, yet we have the Attorney General of the United States not being truthful to Congress.”\n\nThe administration has creatively used other levers of government to punish its foes; see the way it has wielded the threat of cutting off federal funding to universities or federal business with large law firms, or the way it’s either toyed with or initiated harassment against individuals—stripping security clearances, triggering IRS audits, revoking licenses, pursuing expensive litigation. The pace has picked up since the murder of Charlie Kirk. Officials have used the assassination as a pretext to act upon plans that were already in the works, some written by Miller, to crack down on what they deem are lefty NGOs and other organizations, including those funded by George Soros.\n\nWhen I asked what charges Trump thought would be appropriate against Pritzker and Johnson, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded in a statement that the men “have blood on their hands,” and that “these failed leaders have stood idly by while innocent Americans fall victim to violent crime time and time again.”\n\nTrump has aimed to expand presidential power and use it to go after his critics in ways that this country has never seen. He stripped away Kamala Harris’s security detail, the Department of Justice is investigating the former CIA director turned Trump critic John Brennan, and the Federal Communications Commission threatened Jimmy Kimmel. In some cases, he wants to inflict on others the charges he himself faced: John Bolton, the president’s former national security adviser, had his home raided by FBI agents as part of a classified-materials probe, and Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, has been accused of mortgage fraud (Trump was previously accused of mishandling classified materials and falsifying property records).\n\nThose close to Trump no longer downplay the possibility of the retribution campaign widening further. And the president himself, following Comey’s indictment, indicated that his personal vengeance tour is only getting started.\n\n“They weaponized the Justice Department like nobody in history,” Trump said. “What they’ve done is terrible, and so I would, I hope, frankly, I hope there are others. You can’t let this happen to a country.”","summary":"The president’s threats of revenge are no longer bluster.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/trump-retribution-comey-chicago/684497/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Zlr9ZRlbP-6aYeSUc91oF1VE0s4=/0x0:4800x2700/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_08_Trumps_Retribution/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 00:56:00","author":"Jonathan Lemire","authors":["Jonathan Lemire"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":367513830,"title":"The issue that got Trump elected is now his biggest threat","text":"President Donald Trump won in 2024 because of the economy.

If the government doesn’t exist to make people’s lives better, then what’s the point?\n\nThat’s why the latest Economist/YouGov poll should set off alarms for Republican strategists everywhere. Nearly one-half of respondents listed top concerns that reflect the basic costs and conditions of everyday life: inflation (24%), jobs (12%), and health care (11%). Those just happen to be the issues where Republicans are weakest.\n\nTrump broke through with some lower-income voters in 2024, seizing on their anger over rising prices. But that anger hasn’t gone away: It has turned back on him. His supporters still feel the pinch, and no slogan or scapegoat will fix that. Inflation is the one issue he can’t talk his way out of, and it’s only getting worse.\n\nRelated | Even MAGA minions call bullsh-t on Trump’s social media lies\n\nBeyond so-called illegal immigration, which remains a reliably conservative rallying cry, the Republican base is restless over economic anxiety. And that’s fertile ground for Democrats. And they don’t have to win over all those restless voters—just a fraction would reshape the map.\n\nTrump’s approval rating remains deeply underwater (38% approve, 54% disapprove), with many conservatives souring on his performance. Moderates, meanwhile, have largely abandoned him. Among those who voted for Trump in 2024, a meaningful share—15%—now disapprove of the job he’s doing. Between disaffected Trump voters and those who stayed home last time, there’s an opening big enough to matter.\n\nPerhaps the most revealing number in the poll shows how people see the economy itself. Only a small minority (19%) think things are improving, and even among Trump voters, less than half say the economy is getting better. Normally, partisans rally around their own president, claiming optimism out of loyalty. Not this time. A significant slice of Trump’s base thinks the economy is heading in the wrong direction. That’s new—and dangerous—for him.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that roughly one in five Trump voters think the economy is getting worse, disapprove of his presidency, and list inflation as their top concern. That cluster of discontent could be enough to swing close races or, just as crucially, depress Republican turnout altogether. \n\nAdd to that a broad majority of independents who think things are worsening, and Democrats have a real opportunity to expand their coalition.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump’s most effective ad featured Vice President Kamala Harris talking about gender-affirming surgery for prison inmates. It wasn’t successful because of transphobia—polling shows most Americans support protecting trans people from discrimination—but because it reinforced a perception that Democrats were talking about issues far removed from people’s daily struggles.\n\nDemocrats won’t make that mistake again. This cycle, their message will center squarely on the economy, more so than even Bill Clinton’s famous “It’s the economy, stupid” mantra in 1992. With Republican chaos sabotaging the economy from the White House down all the way down to state legislatures, Democrats don’t just have a chance to win next year. They have a chance to run up the score.","summary":"President Donald Trump won in 2024 because of the economy. He promised voters he’d lower prices on Day 1, and people foolishly believed him.

Sign up for it here.\n\nThe winter of early 1981 was a simpler time, a gentler time. Like so many college students, I was watching Saturday Night Live in the living room of my small dorm when the SNL cast member Charles Rocket dropped an f-bomb on live television. I looked around at my fellow students. Did we just hear that? The show was already struggling with ratings, and within a few weeks, Rocket and the producer—and eventually, most of the cast—were fired. Oh, to be so young again, and so easily shocked at someone dropping the Mother of All Obscenities on live television.\n\nActually, the Mother of All Obscenities might be the one that includes mother, and if you haven’t heard it lately, former Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris would be happy to refresh your memory. Addressing a gathering in Los Angeles a few days ago, Harris delivered her verdict on the current Trump administration: “These motherfuckers are crazy.”\n\nHarris might have gone for the thermonuclear option, but plenty of other politicians are rooting around in the verbal dumpster. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for example, recently posted a video about the government shutdown in which he tried to sound like Robert De Niro, vowing that the Democratic position on cutting health-care funding was “No. Fucking. Way.” (Sorry, senator. You’ve got the New York accent, but you’re no Bobby D.) And Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on Monday that she’s changing her mind on health care because she wasn’t in Congress “when all this Obamacare, ‘Affordable Care Act’ bullshit started.”\n\nElected officials cursing is a spreading epidemic, and it has to stop. I say this as someone who loves to swear. I was raised by a father who claimed to be offended by profanity, but my dad was just like the Old Man in A Christmas Story: When he was angry—especially at inanimate objects—he would invent swears like a German lexicographer trying to come up with new compound nouns.\n\nI went off to college and graduate school and became a man of letters: B.A., M.A., Ph.D. But I never let go of other letters that I love, especially F and all of the delightful things that could be appended to it. I find hauling off with various Anglo-Saxonisms cathartic on those occasions when I bang my elbow on the edge of my chair or have to reboot a balky router for the 19th time. I know it’s crude, but I console myself with the conclusions of a 2015 study that suggested that swearing may actually be a sign of intelligence. People who are “good at language,” Timothy Jay, one of the study’s authors, said to CNN, “are good at generating a swearing vocabulary.” You bet your ass we are.\n\nSorry, sorry. Habit.\n\nBut even though swearing has its honored place in my life, I don’t want to hear it from my elected officials. One of the delights of swearing is that it’s unusual, a release from normal decorum that comes only from extraordinary circumstances. (For a great example of how unexpected cursing can be funny and perfectly timed, watch this clip from the 1987 film Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, which has almost no profanity until Steve Martin’s character is finally pushed over the brink by a rental company that rented him a nonexistent car.)\n\nIf you swear all the time or in every circumstance, however, it’s not swearing—it’s just the way you talk. Russians, in my experience, are the leaders in casual cursing, and after a while, you don’t hear it anymore; you just think that obscene words are regular particles of Russian speech. Frequent cursing can become tiring instead of funny. As the swearing-study author Jay notes, the strategic use of obscenity “is a social cognitive skill like picking the right clothes for the right occasion. That’s a pretty sophisticated social tool.”\n\nIf only American politicians could be that sophisticated. Instead, politics in the United States is plagued by middle-aged people swearing just to seem cool.\n\nThey are not cool.\n\nThe Democrats have some true public-swearing champs, but President Donald Trump and the wannabe tough guys who surround him are no slouches in the profanity competition. Presidents historically have shown more decorum than the common folk in Congress—especially that rabble in the House, of course—but not Trump. He loves the word bullshit, which he has used while speaking publicly in the White House, and he’s not above tippling the harder stuff: Iran and Israel, he said to a press spray some months ago, have been fighting so long that “they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing.”\n\nThe president is the most effortlessly vulgar of the bunch when he swears, because when he talks about almost anything, he already sounds like a low-level Mafia guy complaining about what he has to kick upstairs to the bosses. Yesterday, when asked about who would be given back pay after the government shutdown ends, he said that “for the most part, we’re going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way.”\n\nThat’s a statement that actually would have sounded even more naturally mookish if it had some profanity in it.\n\nVice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of Facial Grooming Pete Hegseth have also both apparently decided that public cursing is edgy. “We’re done with that shit,” Hegseth told a conference of generals and admirals last week, with “that shit” meaning all that “woke” stuff I don’t like. I’ve worked with a lot of senior officers, and I know the military is a swearing culture, but men and women with stars on their shoulders have all mastered some basic rules of public deportment, and Hegseth’s naughtiness landed in front of that audience with a quiet thud.\n\nVance, whose White House portfolio now seems to consist of trolling on social media, is perhaps the most artificial and wince-inducing swearer in the administration. When an interlocutor on X suggested last month that blowing up speedboats on the high seas is a war crime, Vance summoned his years of legal training at Yale and responded: “I don’t give a shit what you call it.”\n\nDid you get a little shiver from the icy manliness of that statement? Vance also called the podcaster Jon Favreau a “dipshit” online, which produces somewhat less of a frisson. (California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has taken to trolling the administration, later used the same word to refer to Vance.)\n\nHere, I must admit that I have been part of the problem. In 2021, in this magazine, I called Vance an “asshole.” But I had a serious discussion with my editors about using that one word, just once. I haven’t done it since, and with the exception of a few podcasts here and there, I try not to swear in public.\n\nI accept that American culture has become, shall we say, more tolerant. We’ve come a long way since Norman Mailer’s publisher made the silly demand that he replace the classic f-bomb with “fug” in his 1948 novel, The Naked and the Dead, which supposedly prompted the actor Tallulah Bankhead to say, upon meeting Mailer, “So you’re the young man who can’t spell fuck.” I don’t really wish for a return to the days when network censors deliberated over the acceptability of hell and damn on TV shows. (Watch the stilted result here of when actors on House, M.D. had to call House an “ass” a million times, when they clearly meant to add a second syllable.) The advent of cable has freed a lot of entertainment from these artificial constraints.\n\nPolitics, however, is not entertainment. Some voters may want political life to sound like a reality show, but politicians shouldn’t give them one. I expect politicians to model the behavior they’d like to see in the electorate instead of attempting to feign authenticity by being crude. And yes, I still think politics should be a noble calling, and I would like political leaders to set standards for our kids—and everyone else—in public. I know this is a fantasy. For more than 30 years, from the time of the Clintons to the Trumps, our political culture has become more vulgarized, with no one more lacking in taste and class than our current president. But everyone else in public life can do better, instead of acting like a bunch of foul-mouthed sh—\n\nWell, you know.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Myth of Mad King George\n\nBy Rick Atkinson\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nTake a look.

Plus:\n\nWhy Kamala Harris’s book feels like another defeat\nWill A.I. make a “permanent underclass” of us all?\n“One Battle After Another” is even better on second viewing\n\nEmily Nussbaum \nA staff writer covering television.\nThe evening I first met Keri Russell, we had a fun time pounding Sancerres, talking about her rise to stardom, which began when, at fifteen, on a whim, she tagged along to an open call for “The All New Mickey Mouse Club.” By the time I staggered home, a few things were clear: Russell was smart, darkly funny, and also a bit guarded—an introvert, reflexively self-deprecating. She was a girl’s girl, whose deep friendships went back decades. And although we talked about a lot of subjects (her three kids, especially), she wasn’t all that interested in talking about being an actress—her craft, her ambitions—the subject I’d assumed would be central to the piece.\nInstead, when I started writing, I wound up focussing on the topics that lit her up, in particular a magical year and a half in the early two thousands, shortly after “Felicity” ended, when, burned out by the hours and the It Girl media attention, she fled Los Angeles for New York. At the time, she was toying with the idea of leaving acting. She didn’t do it, of course—and her stellar performances have wound up mirroring the shifts in television, as old-school network and prestige cable transformed into the chaotic flux of the streaming model. She played a key role in each decade: first “Felicity,” then her astounding performance in “The Americans,” where she fell for her costar Matthew Rhys; and, most recently, her starring role in Netflix’s hit political thriller “The Diplomat,” playing a woman as anxious about public life as Russell herself can be. Still, her self-image as a not-quite actress—a conscientious objector in the age of the influencer—had stuck around.\nI met with Keri a few more times, but one of the best interviews was in upstate New York, where I joined her and Rhys, the father of her youngest child, for beers and grilled cheese. Rhys, who described himself as “eternally seeking to channel the spirit of David Niven,” played the wild card to Russell’s straight man, teasing her, then lovingly hyping her up. Russell’s old friends from the “Mickey Mouse Club” opened up to me as well, sharing memories of the early nineties, warm, funny stories that had little to do with fame and a lot to do with the kind of bond that buoys a person through life. As one member of her New York crew put it, Russell was seeking something even more elusive than fame: a sense of self that doesn’t rise and fall with one’s accomplishments.\n\nIn “107 Days,” Kamala Harris’s best-selling memoir about her Presidential run, there’s a long list of people she turns against or complains about or belittles—from her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, to her own grandnieces. And she has little good to say about those who might make their own runs for high office. “The book certainly makes it more difficult to see her as the kind of leader that the Democrats need now,” Amy Davidson Sorkin writes. “We’re left with burst balloons and buckets of ice water. And Donald Trump.” Read the story »\n\nWill A.I.

Despite Trump’s remarks, the officials were firm in their opposition.\n\nThe Republican president made this comment in a social media post, once again demonstrating his tendency to call for legal action against his Democratic adversaries—a significant deviation from the traditional practice of the Justice Department, which typically maintains its independence from presidential influence.\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” This referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Trump was objecting to. \n\nResponding on X, Johnson noted, “This is not the first instance of Trump attempting to unjustly incarcerate a Black man. I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker, also responding on X, asserted, “I won’t step back. Trump is now pushing for the arrest of elected officials counterbalancing his authority. What’s left on the road to total authoritarianism?”\n\nAbigail Jackson, spokeswoman for the White House, was questioned about the specific crimes Trump believed Pritzker and Johnson had committed, but she did not specify any. However, she accused them of having “blood on their hands,” citing Chicago Police Department data that showed at least five people were killed and 25 shot over the weekend.\n\nJackson further commented, “Instead of acting to curb the crime, these Trump-Deranged individuals prefer to let the violence persist while criticizing the President for trying to make their city safe again.”\n\nNational Guard troops from Texas are positioned outside Chicago, despite a lawsuit by the state and city to block the deployment.\n\nThe troops’ mission is not clear, but the Trump administration has undertaken an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\n\nTrump has called Chicago a “hellhole,” though police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. Protesters have skirmished with agents outside a detention center in the village of Broadview, outside Chicago. \n\nA woman in Chicago was shot by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend after she and a man were accused of using their vehicles to strike and then box in the agent’s vehicle. The agent then exited his car and fired five shots at Marimar Martinez, 30.\n\nMartinez and Anthony Ruiz, 21, are charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer and were ordered to be released Monday pending trial. Martinez’s lawyer, Christopher Parente, claimed body camera footage contradicts the federal government’s narrative of her actions.\n\nTrump’s comment came as former FBI Director James Comey appeared in a Virginia courtroom, pleading not guilty in a case that has intensified concerns about the Justice Department’s efforts to target Trump adversaries.\n\nWhen Trump was campaigning for the White House in 2024 at a time he faced criminal and civil investigations, he told supporters, “I am your retribution.”\n\nThe Justice Department has also opened criminal investigations this year against California Sen. Adam Schiff, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor. The three, all Democrats, have all denied wrongdoing and say the investigations are politically motivated.\n\nPritzker, one of Trump’s fiercest critics, has called the president a “wannabe dictator,” comparing his leadership to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The governor has suggested that Trump, who has threatened Chicago with apocalyptic force, suffers from dementia.\n\nPritzker, eyed as a potential 2028 White House contender, has strongly fought any federal intervention along with Johnson, saying it is not wanted or needed in Illinois or Chicago.\n\n“Certainly there’s a lot more going on in the world than for him to send troops into Chicago,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in August during a visit to a South Side neighborhood where a campaign videographer was also in tow. “He ought to be focused on some of the bigger problems.”\n\nPritzker alleges that Trump is trying to militarize cities to affect the outcome of the 2026 election by impeding voting efforts in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.\n\nThe heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune is seeking a third term as governor next year and has sidestepped questions about higher ambitions. Pritzker was among the finalists considered as a running mate for Democratic Kamala Harris’ presidential run in 2024.\n\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and Illinois because they have some of the country’s strongest immigrant protections. Both are “sanctuary” jurisdictions, which limit cooperation between police and federal immigration agents.\n\nJohnson, a first-term mayor, has strengthened those protections with executive orders, including one that bars immigration agents from using city-owned land as staging areas for operations. He calls Trump’s actions unconstitutional.\n\nJohnson has accused Trump of waging a war on Chicago and having an “animus” toward women and people of color. Nearly one-third of Chicago’s 2.7 million residents are Black and roughly one-third are Hispanic.\n\n“He’s a monster,” Johnson told reporters in May. “Period.”\n\nTareen reported from Chicago. Associated Press writer Christine Fernando in Chicago contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday stated that the Illinois&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Suggests Jail for Illinois Governor and Chicago Mayor Over Opposition to Guard Deployment first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-suggests-jail-for-illinois-governor-and-chicago-mayor-over-opposition-to-guard-deployment/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-says-Illinois-governor-and-Chicago-mayor-should-be-jailed.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 21:13:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":367484042,"title":"Creatives Benefit From ‘A Day Of Unreasonable Conversation,’ Which Included Remarks From Fromer Vice President Kamala Harris","text":"Napheesa Collier and Kamala Harris at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\n“Reasonable people adapt to the world, the unreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world to themselves. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable people.”\n\nThis is a quote from George Bernard Shaw and served as the mantra for A Day of Unreasonable Conversation, held recently at The Getty Center in Los Angeles.\n\nThe event is an invitation-only gathering designed to equip culture makers, including television writers, producers, executives, artists, and digital storytellers, for the year ahead.\n\nThe gathering is intentionally non-partisan and solution-oriented, focusing on issues of broad public salience, such as public health, climate, education, and navigating disagreements between those with differing perspectives.\n\nNow in its fourth year, A Day of Unreasonable Conversation has become one of the entertainment industry’s most trusted convenings where Hollywood’s storytellers and public leaders meet to listen. This year’s convening featured more than 500 television creators and 150 top digital storytellers, alongside leaders in philanthropy, advocacy, and government.\n\nThe program was hosted by Atsuko Okatsuka and included conversations with Kerry Washington, Paul “Triple H”, Jay Shetty, W. Kamau Bell, Phil Rosenthal, Sara Gilbert, Terry Crews, Eddie Huang, Karine Jean-Pierre, Mara Brock Akil, Adam Kinzinger, Greg Berlanti, Todd Rose, Don Cheadle, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more, plus performances by Ruby Ibarra and Linda Perry.\n\nEach segment of the event posed a question, such as “What If We’re Learning All the Wrong Lessons,” “What If No News Is Good News,” and “What If Hope is Not an Illusion” among them.\n\nThe day was capped off by a discussion entitled, “What If We Could Write the Next Chapter,” that featured a conversation about resilience between WNBA player and advocate Napheesa Collier and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nIn addressing the gathered creatives, Harris remarked that right now, “There is a powerful intention and force to divide the communities and the country, and make people feel alone. There is an agenda at play that is causing people to feel very disempowered. And my feeling, and I feel this very strongly, is you can never let anyone take your power from you. And this is a room full of extraordinary, creative people who are opinion leaders. You have a pen, you have a voice, you have a platform.”\n\nThe 49th Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, speaking at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nShe went on to say, “And you, as storytellers, are living this. You're not passive observers. You know that. You're living it, and I would ask you that all the emotions that we are feeling. Give those emotions, gift that experience, to those people that you are writing about and writing for.”\n\nLeaning a little forward in her chair, she said, “It gets back to my point about helping people, even if it doesn't change the circumstance. Because there's so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they've lost their mind. When, in fact, these motherfuckers are crazy,” which elicited a laugh from the crowd, which Harris joined.\n\nThe 2024 Presidential contender, in discussing losing the election, seemingly made a personal call to action to the audience, saying, “I said it at the end of every rally, ‘I believe when we fight we win.’ I believe that. Deeply,” however, she added, “Sometimes the fight takes a while.”\n\nKerry Washingon leading a discussion at \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation.\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nOpening the day, Okatsuka said that organizers of the event genuinely hoped that participants would simply give consideration to opposing views and contemplate with the idea that, “Dang, I never thought of things that way.”\n\nRepeated throughout the day was the concept that the best way to change culture is through storytelling.\n\nThis was reiterated by Todd Rose, an American scientist and social entrepreneur, speaking about collective illusions, who said, “There’s no more powerful form of social proof on the planet than storytelling. Even when you know you’re watching fiction, your brain treats those character as your in-group.”\n\nHe points to the 1980’s series Cheers which introduced the concept of the Designated Driver simply using a background actor who simply said, ‘nothing for me, I’m the designated driver.’\n\n“By putting something like that in the background, it gives people permission by lowering the cost of courage,” explained Rose.\n\nBerlanti, a prolific writer/director of multiple TV shows and films, including Arrow, The Flash and The Green Lantern, among others, participated in the panel “What If We Can’t Have Heroes?”\n\nIn a perfect example of the theme of the day — that storytelling can not only inform but evoke strong feelings as well — Berlanti began his comments on the topic… by telling the opening of a story, that he concluded as the panel wrapped up.\n\nHe also remarked that, “Stories have a way of helping shape the world through the unconscious and not just through the intellect. One of the ways you can offer light with both your characters and your own actions, is just to create something that feels true and truthful.”\n\nGreg Berlanti, (center) with Anthony Breznican and Sharmen Obaid-Chinoy, discussing heroes during \"A Day of Unreasonable Conversation.\"\nCredit: Lindsay Rosenberg\n\nAfter coming off stage, he said that he participated in the day’s event because, “Anything that gets people talking about issues that they might be too intimidated to talk about is helpful, especially at this time. It’s very easy for a lot of individuals to just not take on hard topics and the more we can encourage people, especially writers and showrunners, to do that from multiple perspectives, the better it is for the audience.”\n\nBell, who hosted the documentary series United Shades of America for seven seasons, told the crowd during the “What If American Isn’t Divided – Just Exhausted” segment, “I’ve got bad news for you; it’s on you to stop fascism in America. I mean each and every one of you. But you’re like, ‘I’m not ready!’ You’re in entertainment, you know the hero is never ready! Luke Skywalker wasn’t ready, Harry Potter wasn’t ready, Jesus Christ wasn’t ready. Figure out how you can be better at your job as creators to get the message in the content that your bosses don’t want.”\n\nOf the many creatives in the audience taking in the panels, was Jenji Kohan, creator and showrunner of many series including Weeds and Orange is the New Black. She said that while she couldn’t pinpoint how she’d use the information presented that day in her creative endeavors going forward, everything she’d heard throughout was, “certainly food for thought.”\n\nA Day of Unreasonable Conversation is a program of Propper Daley | BPI in partnership with Invisible Hand, and presented by Imaginable Futures in partnership with Omidyar Network, Stand Together, and Imagine Entertainment, with additional support from New America, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Knight Foundation, Conrad N.

Their commentary has flooded social media in the days since the hunt began, prompting some to come to Swift’s defense and even more to campaign generally about the use of AI. Swift has yet to comment on the backlash, leaving fans to speculate about how the videos were made and whether they used CGI or AI.\nAccording to Ben Colman, CEO and cofounder of AI detection company Reality Defender, it seems “highly likely” some of the promo clips were AI-generated. He cited garbled and nonsensical text in some clips as one giveaway. Representatives for Swift and Google did not respond to requests for comment on this story.\nAI-generated media has become ubiquitous in entertainment and advertising, even as artists and fans scoff at its use. Just last month Pew Research Center published the results of a survey that found nearly half of respondents would like a painting less if they learned it was made by AI; younger adults were even more likely to respond negatively to AI-generated media.\nBy Monday, many of the Life of a Showgirl promo videos had seemingly disappeared from YouTube, and some of the X posts containing them were deleted (searches for “Taylor Swift AI” are also restricted on X as of this writing, a move that was implemented previously to stop the spread of nonconsensual sexually-explicit deepfakes of Swift).\nAs backlash over the videos spread, some Swift fans began sharing posts on X and TikTok using the hashtag #SwiftiesAgainstAI to voice their concerns and call on Swift to apologize if AI was used to make the videos. She has not publicly responded to the fan outcry.\n“I really would like for her to say something,” says Ellie Schnitt, a Swiftie with over 500,000 followers on X. Schnitt is a passionate defender of Swift who supported her new album all weekend, despite its lackluster critical reception. Schnitt considers a lot of the criticism aimed at Swift to be blown out of proportion, but if Swift were using AI, that would be where Schnitt draws a line.\n“Privating [the videos] is not enough,” Schnitt posted on Monday, tagging Swift and using the #SwiftiesAgainstAI hashtag. “You know firsthand the harm AI images can cause. You know better, so do better,” she continued. Schnitt tells WIRED that if Swift did use, or sign off on using, generative AI for the videos that move would seem at odds with the songwriter’s long, public campaign for artistic ownership and fair royalties. Swift has also struggled with her image being subjected to AI manipulation during political campaigns and in deepfake sexual exploitation.\nWhen endorsing Kamala Harris for president in an Instagram post last year, Swift specifically addressed AI-generated images and videos writing, “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.” In response to the album promos, one #SwifitesAgainstAI post revisited this statement and questioned whether Swift had been “lobotomized.”\nOther issues Swifties like Schnitt have with AI include the environmental impact from rapidly increasing demands for electricity and water, as well as the potential for AI to harm critical thinking skills.\n“We are very much losing this battle against common sense when it comes to using generative AI,” Schnitt says, adding that if the videos are AI and Swift apologizes for it, the move could be “a touchstone moment” in the pushback against the technology.\nLobo, who also made a post using the #SwiftiesAgainstAI hashtag, doesn’t think Swift will comment on the backlash. She does think the pop star, whether she used AI or not, will be wary of doing so in the future out of fear of angering her fans. As a contrast to the promos, Lobo’s X post highlighted Swift’s 2017 lyric video for the song “Look What You Made Me Do,” which was designed by a motion design studio. Lots of fans responded to Lobo’s post noting they missed the artistry and attention to detail in some of Swift’s earlier lyric videos.\n“Back then, when she wasn’t even as big as she is now, she was careful enough to hire someone to make something so beautifully and carefully done,” Lobo says. “I have a job that is threatened by AI, and AI just completely disregards the art and turns it into a product.”\nWhile it’s unclear what AI models, if any, were used to generate the promo videos, Reality Defender’s Colman says there are some models trained on non-copyrighted data and others that tread into more unethical territory. But mainstream AI products offered by companies like OpenAI and Google are currently battling to make training their models on copyrighted work legal under fair use, to the dismay of artists who are losing paid work to AI.\nColman says that current generative AI models and a “good prompt” could generate the kinds of images used in Swift’s promos in around two minutes. Many of these kinds of videos are made with diffusion AI models, which produce output comparable to Sora, OpenAI’s video app that has given users the ability to easily deepfake themselves.\nGoogle teased Swift’s scavenger hunt from its official Instagram account, although it’s unclear whether the promo videos that were part of the challenge were made with Google’s AI features. Earlier this year, Google started promoting a tool to convert photos into short, AI-generated videos. The latest iteration is called Veo 3. If the Swift teasers were supposed to entice her fans to use Google’s AI suite, the plan seems to have backfired. This demographic may actually be among the most vocal and least likely people to glom onto AI tools.\nMost of the people involved in the backlash are “huge fans,” Lobo says, they just “don’t want AI to infiltrate what we feel is a safe space.” As long as Swift stays silent, it will remain a question of whether it even did.","summary":"A scavenger hunt campaign to promote Taylor Swift’s new album The Life of a Showgirl resulted in a viral #SwiftiesAgainstAI campaign.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/taylor-swift-swifties-against-ai-viral/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/68e5828d8c3af7cdfe932788/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Taylor-Swift-AI-Promo-Culture-2239032475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 20:53:21","author":"Kat Tenbarge","authors":["Kat Tenbarge"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.049},{"id":367491680,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Liberal media darling under fire after viral interview","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics coverage.
