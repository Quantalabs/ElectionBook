'He's been perfect with maintaining sobriety. And he works at MPS with some of the most challenging students that we have in special education.\n\n'So I think the judge took into account all of his circumstances.'\n\nThe teacher had been on his way home from a local bar on October 21, when authorities noted he was driving past other vehicles in the wrong direction at 'close to highway speeds,' according to a criminal complaint obtained by the Journal Sentinel.\n\nHe said he was unaware that Harris had been in town for a rally and had no intention of hurting her or anyone on her campaign, the complaint adds. \n\nIt also notes that his blood alcohol content was 0.252 - more than three times the legal limit that night.\n\nWacker even seemed to be heavily intoxicated with an empty Miller Lite beer can in his vehicle in body camera footage police previously released.\n\n'Where are you coming from tonight, my boss?' one of the cops asked as Wacker fumbled looking for his license to present to law enforcement.\n\n'You don't know? Clearly had a little too much to drink even with your Miller Lite here, huh?'\n\n'Doesn't matter,' Wacker replied, apathetically before officers told him to give up on the search for his ID and to get out of his car.\n\nAn officer asked Wacker: 'Where are you coming from then?'\n\n'Down south,' he replied.\n\n'You know you could have killed somebody, right? You're going the wrong way in traffic, man, on a very busy highway here. You understand that?' he asked.\n\nWhen he was then asked how much he had to drink, Wacker slurred his words as he claimed: 'A couple of beers.'\n\nThe officers finally put the teacher through a field sobriety test when he was unable to find his ID to hand over to the cops. \n\nAs part of his probation, the teacher must now abstain from alcohol or illegal drugs and continue to meet with his therapist.","summary":"A Wisconsin judge handed down a stunning sentence for Wayne Wacker, 55, on Monday - months after he narrowly avoided slamming into Vice President Kamala Harris' motorcade.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14657753/Drunk-driver-Wayne-Wacker-probation-Kamala-Harris-motorcade.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/29/01/97804363-0-image-a-21_1745887728176.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/12/09/8840159793406823237/1024x576_MP4_8840159793406823237.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:58:19","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.016},{"id":315817328,"title":"At White House Correspondents’ Dinner, fake remorse over Biden ‘mistakes’","text":"Imagine a neurological disease that changed your perceptions in subtle, damaging ways. \n\nStubbing your toe would bring pleasure. Rotten meat would taste delicious. Deadly cold would feel comfy. \n\nMeanwhile, a gentle neck massage would make you feel sick, and fresh food would taste disgusting.\n\nYou wouldn’t last long with such a disease. But our society is facing something similar.\n\nThe news media, which are supposed to act as a sort of nervous system for the body politic, instead give us misinformation. \n\nThe national equivalent of stubbed toes and rotten meat gets media praise and approval, while healthy things are treated as vile and wrong.\n\nThe latest example comes from Saturday’s much-diminished annual dinner of the much-diminished White House Correspondents’ Association, whose self-appointed members meet annually to give themselves awards and congratulate themselves on their brave truth-telling.\n\nThis year went badly.\n\nThe WHCA dinner, which DC journalists call their “nerd prom,” once featured famous comedians as headliners.\n\nPresidents would reliably attend and put up with being “roasted” — usually more harshly for the Republican ones than for Democrats — as part of a Washington ritual. \n\nIt was important to look like a good sport, so that the press would think well of you.\n\nBut this year, there were no comedians, no president, and not even much in the way of senior administration officials or important members of Congress. \n\nThe poor DC press corps has reached that Washington nadir of not being worth sucking up to. \n\nGiven their penchant for calling Trump Hitler and smearing his aides and supporters as Nazis, trying to come off as nice guys probably seemed pointless anyway.\n\nCelebrities, too, were missing. Last year, the journalists got to mingle with Scarlett Johansson, Colin Jost, Chris Hemsworth, Rachel Brosnahan, Keri Russell, and Rufus Sewell. \n\nThis year, the stars stayed away. Nobody knows better than Hollywood when you’re a loser, and nobody shuns losers harder than Hollywood.\n\nSo instead we got two things from this year’s event: Lame self-justification and, mirabile dictu, a small measure of actual accountability for massive media failure.\n\nIt came in regard to the legacy media’s utterly deliberate effort to prop up Joe Biden’s leaderless presidential administration, and then to transfer its propping-up services to Kamala Harris’ hapless presidential campaign.\n\nWHCA President Eugene Daniels tried to put a good face on things. \n\n“We’ve been tested, attacked, but every single day our members get up, they run to the White House, plane, train, automobile with one mission: holding the powerful accountable,” he said. \n\nWell, that certainly wasn’t their role under Biden. \n\nIn 2020, the legacy media buried the Hunter Biden laptop story, joining the Biden campaign’s knowingly and obviously false claims that The Post’s reporting was “Russian disinformation.” \n\nIt boosted the Biden operation’s basement strategy that kept Joe campaigning by Zoom — allegedly for COVID reasons but actually because, as was already plain, he was mentally incapable of doing otherwise.\n\nThe press covered for Biden when, unlike normal presidents, he was kept tightly controlled and scripted. \n\nReporters who asked questions at his rare press conferences were picked in advance, and Biden read off his answers from pre-printed cards featuring their photos. \n\nThis was no secret to the legacy media members, but they didn’t tell Americans.\n\nIn fact, when Republicans released videos of Biden acting senile and clueless, the White House press corps joined Democratic flacks to call them “cheap fakes” — when in fact, as we’ve all seen since, the clips accurately displayed Biden’s infirmities.\n\nNow that the election is over, those same reporters are trying to act as if they were deceived. \n\nSeveral, notably CNN’s Jake Tapper, are publishing exposés of how the fraud was maintained, as if they didn’t know all along. \n\nAt Saturday’s dinner, Axios correspondent Alex Thompson made a show of lighting into the Biden administration for maintaining the fiction, and his fellow journalists for buying it. \n\n“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said.\n\n“Being truth tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves,” he continued. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story . . . We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”\n\nBut journalists didn’t “miss” the story. They lied about it. \n\nThey chose not to cover what Americans could see with their own eyes. \n\nAnd they did so for political reasons: to help Democrats and hurt Republicans. \n\nThen, when Biden was obviously toast, they pivoted to claims that the formerly hopeless Harris was presidential timber, as well as “joyful” and “brat.” Puhleez.\n\nA healthy country’s political nervous system would tell us when our president is mentally incompetent. Instead, we had one that smothered the truth.\n\nIt should hurt when you stub your toe. And this toe-stubbing should be painful for the political press.\n\nMaybe then they’ll learn something.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"This year's White House Correspondents' Dinner was a flop — because the DC press corps has reached that Washington nadir of not being worth sucking up to. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/opinion/at-white-house-correspondents-dinner-fake-remorse-over-biden-mistakes/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/shutterstock_editorial_WHCADinner_15270689by-e1745886724879.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:33:44","author":"Glenn H.

I find her very beautiful,” he told author Ramin Setoodeh for his book “Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass.”\n\n“I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump,” he continued. “I hear she’s very talented. I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!”\n\nHe also admitted to not knowing her music “well.”\n\n“But she is liberal, or is that just an act?” Trump asked Setoodeh, Variety’s co-editor-in-chief. “She’s legitimately liberal? It’s not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.”\n\nSwift made her feelings known with her endorsement of Harris, writing in part at the time, “I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”\n\nThe “Love Story” songstress pointedly signed the endorsement as a “childless cat lady” — a now-infamous reference to JD Vance’s controversial comments about women without children.","summary":"The NFL team visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after their victory over the Kansas City Chiefs — and Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce — in the big game.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/04/28/celebrity-news/trump-disses-taylor-swift-during-eagles-visit-to-white-house/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/103497133.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 00:30:51","author":"Audrey Rock","authors":["Audrey Rock"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.463},{"id":315818098,"title":"Has ’60 Minutes’ Run Out of Time? Shari Redstone’s Big Decision","text":"That ticking noise that begins every 60 Minutes segment? Turns out that’s not a stopwatch. It’s a time bomb.\n\n At least that’s how it’s sounding lately, like the illustrious citadel of American broadcast journalism is on the brink of blowing up. Last night, in the latest shudder suggesting an imminent explosion, correspondent Scott Pelley ended the show with a “Last Minute” segment that all but declared open rebellion against 60 Minutes’ corporate overlords at Paramount and raised a fist in solidarity with longtime executive producer Bill Owens, who just days earlier had bolted CBS in protest over what he called editorial meddling by management.\n\n “No one here is happy about it,” Pelley informed viewers, perched on a stool before a backdrop of the program’s iconic ticking timepiece. “But in resigning, Bill proved one thing — he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.”\n\n What’s got everyone so worked up, of course, is the $20 billion lawsuit — that’s billion with a “b” — President Trump lobbed onto the 60 Minutes‘ set last year, claiming that the show had perpetrated “election interference” by editing a videotaped interview with Kamala Harris from its original 45 minutes to a more broadcast-friendly 21 minutes. You know, the same way 60 Minutes had, without complaint, edited Trump’s interview from 45 to 20 minutes during the 2020 campaign. The way, in fact, TV news has been editing interviews since Edward R. Murrow was cutting them on kinescope.\n\n Nobody is taking Trump’s lawsuit seriously — probably not even Trump. It has next to no chance of prevailing in court. But what is being taken seriously — especially by Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, which owns CBS, which produces 60 Minutes — is the fact that Redstone is trying to sell her company for $8 billion to Skydance Media. That deal requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which has the authority to review transfers of broadcast licenses, a necessary step for Skydance and Paramount to complete their transaction. And, of course, the FCC is now run by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, who has not-so-subtly hinted that certain complaints against 60 Minutes are “likely to arise” and that if Redstone wants the deal to go smoothly she should probably settle the $20 billion suit with the guy in the Oval Office.\n\n In other words, nice little merger you’ve got here. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n The stakes involved are obviously incredibly high — not just for 60 Minutes but for all of news broadcasting and the whole notion of a free press. This isn’t, after all, the first time Trump has strong-armed a major media outlet, not even in the last six months. Last December, he got ABC to pay him $15 million to settle an only slightly less flimsy defamation suit (this one against George Stephanopoulos, who supposedly slandered the president by referring to what Trump did to E. Jean Carroll as “rape” when technically the court had deemed it “sexual abuse”). That corporate capitulation was troubling enough. But if Redstone were now to settle the even-easier-to-beat 60 Minutes suit, it would shred the show’s long tradition of editorial integrity and send a deep, muzzling chill through all of journalism, not to mention torch Redstone’s own reputation.\n\n But, alas, it’s starting to look like that’s precisely what she’s about to do.\n\n One of the reasons Owens’ departure was so shocking was that it seemed to signal Redstone was on the verge of caving. In truth, the reasons for Owens’ exit may have been more nuanced, possibly having something to do with the return of former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky, who assumed an oversight role after 60 Minutes took heat for a segment on Israel’s war in Gaza. Still, the snowballing narrative is that Owens sacrificed himself in a desperate warning to Redstone not to sink 60 Minutes over her Skydance deal. That’s more or less how Pelley presented it at the end of 60 Minutes last night. And it was certainly how a slew of headlines played it, as well (“Woman Who Destroyed CBS News,” “60 Minutes Sacrificed for Sale,” and “Redstone Greed Ending Legacy,” among them). It was also Jake Tapper’s take during a seven-minute Redstone rant on CNN just hours after Owens announced he was quitting.\n\n “It seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle,” Tapper said with an angry frown. “Hope the money’s worth it, Shari!”\n\n Of course, Tapper’s right, the money isn’t worth it. Sure, the Skydance merger would conceivably add hundreds of millions of dollars to Redstone’s personal fortune, but she’s already likely worth half a billion if not more. There isn’t a whole lot on planet Earth that she can’t already afford. Still, Redstone’s own bank account isn’t the whole point; she’s also trying to protect the media empire her father built and that she took over just before her father Sumner Redstone died at 97 in 2020. And after years of cable-TV declines, missed streaming opportunities and less-than-blockbuster feature releases, a cash-infusing merger, particularly with another family-run firm that’s promised to keep Paramount intact, may well be the company’s best, if not only, hope for a future.\n\n Most of the other suitors circling Redstone a few years ago — Warner Bros., Sony, Barry Diller and Byron Allen, to name a few — wanted to carve up Paramount, keep what they liked and sell the rest for scrap. Skydance, though, run by billionaire Larry Ellison’s son David, was reportedly the only one to assure Redstone that Paramount would be kept whole. Whether Skydance keeps its word about that is TBD — as far as anyone knows there isn’t anything in writing — but at least, as kin themselves, the Ellisons can theoretically appreciate Redstone’s impulse to safeguard her father’s legacy. (Unless, that is, they decide they can make even more money by breaking their word).\n\n The point here is this: Redstone is trapped in a lose-lose situation. If she fights Trump on the 60 Minutes suit, it could blow up the Skydance deal, leaving her company bleeding on the floor. If she caves to Trump and settles, it could blow up 60 Minutes — the crown jewel of Paramount’s news division and one its few truly trusted global brands — leaving the company bleeding on the floor.\n\n Come to think of it, that ticking sound may not be a stopwatch or a bomb. It could be something worse: Donald Trump counting down the seconds until the free press runs out of time.","summary":"The Paramount mogul is stuck in the middle of an impossible choice.

And we’re taking those last two, running our normal course.”\n\n“On the [Paramount-Skydance] transaction itself, we are getting close to the informal 180 day clock. I think we’re somewhere in the 160s but we’re just running our normal process across a lot of different transactions right now,” he added. “We’re just going to apply the law and the facts and the record and move forward. We are simply focused on the record that’s before us, and we’re going to make our decision based on the agency’s record itself.” \n\nDespite Carr’s claim that the FCC’s work is unrelated to the lawsuit, the agency made the transcript and camera footage of the interview public as part of a “news distortion” investigation. \n\nHe previously said that a “news distortion” complaint from conservative law firm The Center for American Rights over the interview would likely arise in the agency’s review of the Skydance transaction. The final deadline for the public comment period ended on March 24.\n\n“Personally, I have not reviewed those comments at this point, but at some point we will get to it in terms of reviewing the comments and making a final decision,” Carr said.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s public comments calling for the maximum fines and punishment for CBS, Carr said that no decisions have been made but that “all options remain on the table” and the investigation remains ongoing. He did not rule out the possibility for broadcast license revocations as a result of public interest standard violations.\n\n“License revocations is a tool that the FCC has in its toolkit. It’s long been viewed as sort of the regulatory death penalty. So it’s a pretty high bar to meet to go down that path,” he said. “But it is one of the the options the FCC has, and we continue to take a vigorous look at the public interest standard and making sure that the FCC enforces it. We’ve opened lots of investigations so far. We’re going to see where they go.” \n\nIn addition to its scrutiny of Paramount, the FCC has launched investigations into Comcast and Disney over their diversity, equity and inclusion policies. \n\n“There’s some concerning things that we’ve seen there about potential discrimination that we are continuing to run down inside the building, and we’ll see where that investigation on Disney and ABC goes,” Carr added. “But there’s some concerning elements there about potentially making race-based and gender-based discriminatory decisions. We have to let that play out in terms of the process, but that’s one where I’m particularly interested to see where it goes.”","summary":"Brendan Carr added \"all options remain on the table\" in its \"60 Minutes\" investigation after the president called for the \"maximum fines and punishment\"\n\n\nThe post FCC Chair Says CBS-Trump Settlement Talks Have Nothing to Do With Paramount-Skydance Deal Review appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-brendan-carr-cbs-trump-settlement-talks-60-minutes-investigation/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brendan-carr-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 23:36:24","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":315808270,"title":"At White House, Trump celebrates Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl victory","text":"April 28 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump on Monday celebrated the Philadelphia Eagles' LIX Super Bowl championship in February.\n\nTrump attended that game on Feb. 9 in New Orleans' Caesars Superdome, won by the Eagles 40-22 over the Kansas City Chiefs.

Limited time offer.\n\nThe 78-year-old used his address to the gathered media to take an impromptu shot at Swift, adding another chapter to their public war of words. \n\nTrump had delighted in seeing Swift booed by the crowd at Super Bowl LIX as he became the first sitting President to attend a Super Bowl. Swift appeared to shake it off when the booing started, but she and partner Travis Kelce were both visibly emotional after the game in February. \n\nKelce, the Chiefs’ tight end, was distraught on the field after the game, leading to speculation the 35-year-old was set to retire. \n\nThe booing Swift received was later echoed by Trump, who took to social media to troll the singer after watching the Eagles blow the Chiefs away 40-22 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. \n\n“The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!” Trump wrote on social media. \n\nHis public swipe was another twist in his feud with Swift which has sizzled since the pop star publicly endorsed Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 US Presidential elections.\n\nYou can watch Trump’s public swipe in the video player above.\n\nTrump showed he does not forgive or forget when he decided to stick the boot into Swift once more when he delivered a speech on the White House lawn, congratulating Eagles players on their championship.\n\n“The Eagles punched their ticket to a re-match with the Kansas City Chiefs and you know what happened,” he said. \n\n“It was an incredible game. It was a little surprising, but right from the beginning of the first quarter of the big game... which I was there. I watched in person. I was there along with Taylor Swift. How did that work out? How did that one work out.”\n\nSections of the crowd could be heard laughing loudly during the TV broadcast. \n\nThe Chiefs had been attempting to win a fourth championship in the space of six years and a third-consecutive Super Bowl title. They famously defeated the Eagles in the 2023 Super Bowl. \n\nThe Super Bowl MVP this year was awarded to Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, who cut the Chiefs defence to shreds. \n\nTrump publicly praised Hurts after the game — but the quarterback was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday. \n\nHurts was a controversial no-show at the White House with 15 other Eagles players electing not to attend the event. \n\nAustralian Jordan Mailata was hard not to miss as he stood on the podium behind Trump. \n\nThe White House told reporters Hurts had told officials he would not be attending because of “scheduling conflicts”. \n\nHurts earlier stammered his way through a question about whether he would be visiting 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at the Time 100 gala last week, leading to speculation that his absence was likely.\n\nHurts said “umm” before the red carpet interviewer moved on to a different line of questioning.\n\nIt comes as fellow Eagles star Saquon Barkley was photographed with Trump outside the president’s New Jersey golf club on Sunday.\n\nBarkley responded to backlash from fans who criticised him for spending so much time with the divisive president.\n\n“lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,” Barkley wrote Monday on X. “Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago... and look forward to finishing my round with Trump! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.”\n\nHurts was part of the foursome that played with Obama last October, along with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie.\n\nIt is unclear if Hurts’ decision is politically motivated — or a legitimate conflict — as the 26-year-old is generally tight-lipped and steers clear of controversies off the field.\n\nThe Eagles’ 2018 White House was cancelled by Trump during his first term as few players were expected to attend and he was embroiled in a feud with the league over players kneeling for the national anthem.\n\nHurts was not part of that roster.\n\n— with The New York Post","summary":"Donald Trump has proven he does not forgive or forget with the US President taking a swipe at Taylor Swift from out of nowhere.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/nfl/donald-trumps-swipe-at-taylor-swift-kansas-city-chiefs-is-nextlevel-petty/news-story/16b2d398716da579ce8cf97cde07802d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f313d73d662f33ba49519016a8bab885","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 23:04:11","author":"Tyson Otto","authors":["Tyson Otto"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":315802412,"title":"Trump needles Taylor Swift while celebrating Eagles Super Bowl win","text":"President Trump wasn’t ready to shake it off Monday. \n\nThe commander in chief took a jab at pop superstar Taylor Swift while honoring the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles at the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, became the first sitting president to attend the big game when he, Swift and 65,717 others watched the Eagles blow out the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-22, ending the Chiefs’ dream of becoming the first back-to-back-to-back Super Bowl champions.\n\n“It was incredible.

Paramount is seeking FCC approval for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBS-produced show is currently embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit with President Trump, who claims that the show deceptively edited the sitdown to benefit Harris. The president has also criticized the program for being biased under executive producer Bill Owens.\n\nCarr was asked what would happen with his probe if the legal case, which is in mediation, was settled soon. \n\n“We’re simply focused on the record that’s before us,” Carr said, declining to address a hypothetical question on what he would do if Trump directed him to approve the merger. “We’re just going to apply the law and the facts.”\n\nThe Post had reported months earlier that Owens could be a sacrificial lamb as the merger neared completion.\n\n“It shows a lot of balls for someone who understands that nobody is untouchable at this at the point,” a CBS insider told The Post, speaking of Pelley’s move to chastise his bosses. \n\nA second insider said “Pelley is fed up with corporate disrespect for journalistic independence.”\n\nA 20-year verteran of CBS, Owens, held the role of executive producer of “60 Minutes” since 2019.

We're excited about that. I think it's going to be a great piece of legislation.\"\n\nFlanked by White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and James Blair, assistant to the president, Bessent told reporters after the meeting on Monday that he found “great unity” among congressional Republican leaders, with the House and Senate moving quickly and \"in lockstep\" on a budget bill focused on Trump’s priorities.\n\nThe meeting included Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith.\n\n“We think that they are in a substantial agreement, and that this is going to be a win for the American people. Very-pro growth,” Bessent continued.\n\nHe said there were “three legs” to the president's economic agenda: trade, tax and deregulation. He said they hoped to get the tax portion of the budget package done by July 4.\n\n“Both sides have proposals in front of the President, and we think there's a path to deliver the requisite spending reforms to get a great pro-growth tax package, along with the president's priorities that he laid out on the campaign trail,” Bessent said.\n\nHassett reiterated Trump’s claim that a billionaire tax cut is off the table. Bessent said priorities for the package would be to make tax cuts and the Jobs Act permanent, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and deductibility for loans for American-made cars.\n\nAsked if Bessent's July 4 timeline was realistic, Thune said, \"I think so. You know, I mean, it's, it all depends on how progress goes in the next few weeks.\"\n\n\"I think we, everybody, feels like we're making significant progress in trying to get the House, the Senate and the White House, kind of in the same place. But it's going to take time. It's complicated -- a lot of moving parts,\" Thune said.\n\nRepublicans have begun releasing legislative text to codify their lofty ambitions to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, with six markups scheduled this week and additional hearings anticipated in the coming weeks as conservatives face the latest test of their narrow majority.\n\n\"It's going to solve a lot of problems,\" Johnson predicted. \"It's going to be a turbo-boost for the economy, and we're looking forward to getting that done.\"\n\nBut as Trump reaches his 100th day in office this week, polling shows the public souring on the president's job performance. Nevertheless, Johnson maintains the belief that the GOP is poised to defend its narrow majority -- claiming Republicans \"are playing offense.\"\n\n\"We talked about the upcoming races, the midterm elections and we're very bullish on it,\" Johnson proclaimed. \"There's 13 Democrats sitting in districts that President Trump won. Those are the obvious targets. We have an offensive map. There's only three House Republicans sitting in districts that Kamala Harris won. So it's a lopsided map, it gives us a great opportunity and we're going to go make history.\"\n\nStill, Johnson acknowledged there have been some ups and downs in the early stages of the administration.\n\n\"These presidential terms are roller-coaster sometimes. There's been a little tumult in the markets with the tariff policy and all of that, but I think this is settling out,\" Johnson said. \"People are in very good spirits.

It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us – and you,’ Pelley told viewers. ‘Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.’\n\n‘No one here is happy about it’ Pelley revealed about the extra supervision that corporate leaders are imposing. He also noted noting how in quitting, Owens proved he was ‘the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.’\n\nPelley was blasted online by critics who claimed his outburst showed he was ungrateful to the company that he’s been with for decades and pays his massive salary.\n\n‘When you work for wages, you ride for the brand.

He won’t though because it’s all nonsense. He knows it and we know it,’ added a fourth.\n\nOthers called out Pelley for failing to address the other recent scandals 60 Minutes and CBS have been involved in.\n\n‘Scott Pelley and the entire 60 Minutes team… total frauds. After the Harris interview editing debacle, for that clown to sit there so sanctimoniously and claim a transgression was visited upon the righteous 60 Minutes staff,’ said on person.\n\n‘Such a naïve final minute that showed just how out of touch they are with reality.

No one here is happy about it.\n\n‘Stories we’ve pursued for 57 years were often controversial, lately the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. Bill made sure they were accurate and fair—he was tough that way.’ \n\nThe corporate storm swirling around CBS comes as Paramount Global races to finalize a high-stakes merger with Skydance Media, a deal that reportedly hinges on receiving the green light from federal regulators under the Trump administration. \n\nAt the same time, the network remains embroiled in an eye-popping $20 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Trump himself, who claims the show manipulated an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris last fall to paint her in a more favorable light.\n\nTrump has claimed the network cut down Harris’ ‘word salad’ answer to a question about the Israel-Hamas conflict. By doing so, he claims the network was helping the Democratic nominee secure the White House. \n\nEmployees at the network, though, have said they were simply trying to fit Harris’ answer into their one-hour broadcast.\n\nOwens, 58, who had been with CBS News for decades and served as only the third executive producer in 60 Minutes’ 57-year history since 2019, walked away from the show last week. \n\nIn his resignation, Owens cited corporate interference as the breaking point, saying it had ‘become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it – to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.’\n\nOwens – a respected figure who recently helped overhaul CBS’s Evening News – went on to promise that ’60 Minutes will continue to cover the new administration,’ and ‘future’ ones as well. \n\n‘The show is too important to the country,’ Owens ultimately declared, weeks after sources told DailyMail.com how the bigwig was ‘feeling the pressure’ brought by the Trump lawsuit.\n\nHe reportedly added during a ’60 Minutes’ staff meeting last Tuesday: ‘It’s clear the company is done with me.\n\n‘It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer,’ Owens said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVeteran 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley has been slammed for his on-air&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CBS 60 Minutes&#8217; Scott Pelley criticized for daring on-air remarks against $5 million benefactor first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/cbs-60-minutes-scott-pelley-criticized-for-daring-on-air-remarks-against-5-million-benefactor/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-CBS-60-Minutes-host-Scott-Pelley-blasted.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 22:44:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":315800516,"title":"Kamala Harris Criticized for Charging $25 Per Stream for Her Political Comeback","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris wants to propel herself back into the national political conversation, as former aides are teasing an upcoming major speech criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\nThe failed presidential candidate will deliver the keynote speech at the Emerge 20th anniversary gala at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nThe speech will be live-streamed, according to the organizer Emerge, a Democratic group that recruits and trains women to run for public office. \n\nIt’s a major fundraiser as tickets cost up to $50,000 for a sponsor.

I’m Michelle Obama. I do still worry about my daughters in the world, even though they are somewhat recognizable.”\n\nShe stressed that “my fears are for what I know is happening out there in streets all over the city.”\n\nObama was joined during the interview by her brother, Craig Robinson, who recounted trauma from when a black police officer accused him of stealing a fancy new bike when he was a kid. She drew parallels to his experience and what she believes migrants are enduring in today’s environment.\n\n“There’s so much bias and so much racism and so much ignorance that fuels those kind of choices,” she bemoaned. “I worry for people of color all over this country, and I don’t know that we will have the advocates to protect everybody.\n\n“And that … frightens me, it keeps me up at night,” she added. “How do you how do you feel comfortable going to work, going to school, when you know that there could be people out here judging you and who could upend your life in a second — that’s who I worry for right now.”\n\nObama declined to mention Trump by name or delve deep into her concerns about migrants’ well-being in the US while taking thinly veiled swipes against his administration’s policies.\n\nHowever, she vaguely lamented that “now that we have leadership that is, sort of, indiscriminately determining who belongs and who doesn’t,” while “we know that those decisions aren’t being made with courts and with due process.”\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of skirting due process by taking steps such as invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged gangbangers — who illegally entered the country — outside of traditional deportation channels.\n\nTrump has scrambled to secure to US-Mexico border and his administration has aggressively targeted illegal immigrants for deportation. \n\nIronically, the Obama administration deported over 3 million people, drawing ire from the liberal base.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign cycle, the former first lady aggressively stumped for former Vice President Kamala Harris and frequently lambasted Trump’s politics. \n\nShe later skipped his inauguration in January, which her husband attend alone.\n\nRecently, she shed light on why she skipped Trump’s inauguration — clothing. \n\n“It started with not having anything to wear,” Obama admitted last week on an episode of her podcast “IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson.” \n\n“I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off. So I was like, if I’m not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don’t even want to have a dress ready, right? Because it’s so easy to just say, let me do the right thing.” \n\nShe also seethed at the speculation about her marriage in light of her skipping both the inauguration and the late President Jimmy Carter’s funeral, which her husband also attended by himself.\n\n“My decision to skip the inauguration, what people don’t realize, or my decision to make choices at the beginning of this year that suited me were met with such ridicule and criticism,” she said. \n\n“People couldn’t believe that I was saying no for any other reason, that they had to assume that my marriage was falling apart, you know?”","summary":"Former first lady Michelle Obama voiced deep concerns about President Trump's aggressive deportation policy, railing against its impact on her home city of Chicago.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/us-news/michelle-obama-expresses-fears-about-trumps-deportation-policy-keeps-me-up-at-night/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103494349.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/D8XjOb2D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-28 22:22:17","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.203},{"id":315806724,"title":"The turmoil at 60 Minutes, briefly explained","text":"This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.\nWelcome to The Logoff: CBS News is accusing its parent company of censoring its coverage in order to appease the Trump administration, a warning sign for freedom of the press and the First Amendment.\n\nWhat’s the latest? 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley on Sunday suggested Paramount, CBS News’ owner, had degraded the program’s editorial independence through increased scrutiny of its content — including on stories about the Trump administration. Pelley connected the supervision to Paramount’s desire to get the Federal Communications Commission to approve the company’s proposed merger with Skydance Media.\n\nSo what does Pelley mean? The 60 Minutes journalist is suggesting that Paramount is monitoring CBS News’ journalism to protect its standing with the administration. While he doesn’t say it outright, the implication is that the administration could block Paramount’s merger as a penalty for unflattering coverage.\n\nIs that a valid fear? President Donald Trump earlier this month said the FCC should punish CBS for a 60 Minutes episode he did not like. Additionally, Trump is suing CBS and Paramount over a campaign interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount is considering settling, though many legal experts say Trump’s case was flimsy.\n\nFCC chair Brendan Carr is a Trump ally who frequently accuses major networks of anti-Trump bias. Earlier this month, he vaguely threatened another company’s broadcast license over its coverage of Trump’s deportation policies. Carr’s FCC is engaged in an inquiry into CBS’ campaign coverage.\nWhat’s the big picture? If the FCC factors CBS’ coverage of Trump into its merger decision, that’s the government threatening financial penalties for disfavored political speech — a violation of the First Amendment. It’s also reminiscent of autocratic regimes elsewhere, which have sought to use state power to stifle criticism and muzzle the media.\nWe don’t know for sure whether that’s happening, but Trump is calling for the network to be punished for its coverage, and it’s telling that Paramount is concerned enough to “scrutinize” CBS’ content.\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…\nI really enjoyed this piece on the challenges of “seed banking,” an effort to protect endangered plants from extinction. It’s a nice reminder that, even in difficult times, brilliant people are working on ways to protect our future.

In Sept. 2024, following Swift's endorsement of his presidential opponent Kamala Harris, he wrote \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" in a post on Truth Social. He followed the post with an appearance on Fox & Friends the next day, where he continued to bash Swift.\n\n \"I was not a Taylor Swift fan,\" he said on the show. \"It was just a question of time. ... But she’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.\"\n\n In other parts of his speech, the president talked up the Eagles' controversial \"tush push\" play, complemented star running back Saquon Barkley and invited players like Lane Johnson to speak at the podium.\n\n Several Eagles players, including star quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts, were noticeably absent from the team's visit to the White House on Monday.

If he pushes them and tries to micromanage everything they do, that could lead to ill feelings over there, so it’s a very delicate thing for him to do for the next few months.”\n\nYork also addressed the challenge that Trump faces in getting his “big bill” to his desk and enacting his agenda, which would include extending some provisions in his signature 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He assessed that Trump believes the myriad of tariffs he issued will help pay for continuing these tax cuts.\n\nBeyond what Trump faces in his future, York also addressed recent comments from Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), who blamed “do-nothing Democrats” for failing to have “guts” to oppose the president. York said Democrats have yet to solidify on what the party’s messaging to voters is, but he did suggest that Pritzker has emerged as the most “pugilistic” of the possible 2028 presidential nominees within the Democratic Party.\n\n“He really, really gives what they like to call ‘fiery speeches’ a lot, which means he usually accuses Trump of being a Nazi,” York said.\n\nHOW TO MEASURE TRUMP’S 100 DAYS?\n\nPritzker’s rumblings of a 2028 run come after he was the headlining speaker at a Democratic fundraiser, the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner, in New Hampshire, an early primary state.

Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell's retirement marks the end of a four-decade Senate career that reshaped Republican politics and the federal judiciary, setting up what will likely be one of 2026's most expensive primaries.Republicans currently control the Senate with a 53 to 47-seat majority. While Democrats hope to regain control of Congress in the 2026 election, it will be a tall order in the Senate, with only a few Republican-held seats viewed as pickup opportunities by most analysts.What To KnowThere are 33 U.S. Senate seats up for regular election in 2026—13 Democratic-held seats and 20 Republican-held seats, according to information from Ballotpedia.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has identified 35 Republican-held districts it is targeting for the 2026 midterms, while Democrats face the challenge of holding 13 districts that President Donald Trump won in 2024.Only three House Republicans represent districts that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris carried in 2024.Trump's disapproval rating is at 43 percent—a similar level to November 2018, when Republicans lost the House, according to CNN pollster Harry Enten.

These people should be investigated for ELECTION FRAUD, and add in the FoxNews Pollster while you’re at it,” the U.S. president decreed.\n\nThe polls concerning “a person named Donald J. Trump, me,” the president said, are “fake polls from fake news organizations,” a proclamation he delivered in all caps while citing pollster John McLaughlin, who he described as “one of the most highly respected in the industry.”\n\nMcLaughlin, in response to inquiries received after the release of the polls, on Sunday shared the figures cited by the president and asked “didn’t we win [the] popular vote with 50%?”\n\nAccording to a small New York Times/Siena poll of 913 registered voters, 54% of Americans disapprove of the overall job Trump is doing, compared to 42% who approve. Pollsters also found disapproving majorities on the president’s handling of the economy, immigration, the war in Ukraine, and trade.\n\nTrump’s approval rating, the Times wrote along with their poll, “is historically low for a president this early in a term, but it is in line with his stubborn unpopularity, which did not prevent him from sweeping the battleground states in last year’s election.”\n\nThe poll’s crosstabs show that pollsters spoke to an even number of Trump supporters and people who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, at 38% of each, while 16% of those polled indicated they did not vote and 7% said they voted for someone else or refused to answer the question.\n\nThe ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll of 1,992 registered voters found Trump’s disapproval rating at 55% and his approval at 42%. His disapproval rating stays the same but his approval rating falls to 39% if the polling data is extended to include all 2,464 adults contacted by pollsters.\n\n“The previous low in approval for a president at or near 100 days in office, in polls dating to 1945, was Trump’s 42% in 2017,” ABC noted with their poll.\n\nOf the 2,419 Americans contacted for that poll who shared their vote from the 2024 election, 842 reported they voted for Trump, 848 said they voted for Harris, and 729 copped to skipping the ballot box. That means the polling data included about 35.0% Harris voters and 34.8% Trump voters.\n\nIn the last elections, President Trump earned 77,284,118 votes, or 49.8% of the votes cast for president, while Harris won 74,999,166 votes or 48.3% of votes cast.\n\nAccording to the American Presidency Project, only 63.5% of the nation’s 244.7 million eligible voters cast a ballot for the president in 2024, meaning about 89.3 million voters stayed home or didn’t choose a presidential candidate. Of all eligible voters, around 31.6% picked Trump, approximately 30.7% voted for Harris, and about 36.5% chose no one.\n\nDespite the relatively even sampling seen in the polls, Trump claimed pollsters are under-counting his core constituency and this makes them “negative criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win, loose [sic] a lot of credibility, and then go on cheating and lying for the next cycle, only worse.”\n\nTrump went on to claim the organizations behind the polls are suffering from an incurable case of “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and are “truly the enemy of the people!”\n\n“We don’t have a Free and Fair ‘Press’ in this Country anymore. We have a Press that writes BAD STORIES, and CHEATS, BIG, ON POLLS. IT IS COMPROMISED AND CORRUPT. SAD,” he said in separate social media post, emphasis his.","summary":"President Donald Trump lashed out at pollsters Monday after recent surveys showed a slump in his support, prompting his call for investigations into “fake news organizations\" and alleged election fraud.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/28/trump-lashes-out-over-polls-calls-for-investigations-of-fake-news/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25117853245245.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 20:50:55","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":315783034,"title":"White House correspondents learned nothing from Biden disaster","text":"“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Axios’s Alex Thompson, winner of the Aldo Beckman Award for Overall Excellence for his coverage of that story, told the audience. “But being truth-tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves. We, myself included, missed a lot of this story.”\n\nSounds nice. But this is gaslighting.\n\nIf the political media were too credulous to see that then-President Joe Biden’s mental acuity had deteriorated to a degree that made it impossible for him to do the job, they don’t deserve to be anywhere near the White House or a newsroom because they lack the appropriate skill set. If they knew and still covered up or soft-pedaled Biden’s decline, they don’t deserve to be anywhere near the White House or a newsroom because they can’t be trusted.\n\nThose are the choices. For the most part, my money is on the latter. The notion that legacy media had been duped by Biden’s crafty handlers doesn’t stand up to the most basic scrutiny.\n\nFor one thing, let’s not forget the same outlets that covered up the former president’s cognitive regression also covered up the Hunter Biden laptop story and the family’s corruption scandals. These are the same outlets that spent years spreading harebrained conspiracy theories about a Russian asset in the White House, among a slew of sensationalist stories too numerous to mention. The failure to report on Biden’s mental regression isn’t an outlier. It had become the norm.\n\nAfter he won the nomination in 2020, the media had been making excuses for Biden, a lifelong fabulist. Or, as the New York Times might put it, a man who would “veer into a personal folklore” with “the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.” Thompson, in my estimation one of the better mainstream political reporters, also claimed that the president’s “arsenal of wacky phrases” and “quirky aphorisms” were “weaponized by Republicans to insinuate the 80-year-old president is in mental decline.”\n\nWeaponization implies that highlighting Biden’s slips was misleading the public. For the most part, that wasn’t the case.\n\nIndeed, the media laid the groundwork for excusing Biden’s inevitable mental decline — which, let’s face it, was never something to write home about in the first place — during the 2020 campaign, blaming his verbal blunders on a conveniently discovered stuttering problem. Like most of Biden’s biographical contentions, there’s scant evidence the stutter was real. Yet, there was barely a hint of skepticism from establishment media.\n\nOf course, even if the impediment were genuine, it wouldn’t explain why Biden ended a gun-safety summit in Connecticut with “God bless the Queen, man” or struggled to remember the name of a member of his Cabinet or told a crowd that we have “plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean” and so on. \n\nBy the time then-special counsel Robert Hur let the president off the hook for pilfering classified documents because he was an “elderly man with a poor memory,” most people could see it as well. In 2023, polls showed a majority of voters doubted Biden’s mental capacity. Yet we’re supposed to believe that his deterioration eluded professionals with journalism degrees and White House press passes. \n\nLet’s recall that on June 13, 2024, a video emerged of Biden wandering off at the G7 summit in Italy during a skydiving demonstration and had to be corralled by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. A few days later, Biden was filmed at a Hollywood presidential fundraiser, waving and clapping to the crowd before freezing up. Former President Barack Obama took him by the wrist and guided him offstage.\n\nAll this happened about a week before Biden’s catastrophic presidential debate with Donald Trump. Was there a national conversation on the importance of a president’s fragile mental state? No. The media went on the offensive to discredit anyone who brought it up.\n\nCNN’s media newsletter called the videos fabrications.\n\nAn MSNBC anchor said the tape was part of a “growing and insidious trend in right-wing media” to spread “highly misleading and selectively edited videos.”\n\nAn NBC News story written by its senior political reporter was headlined, “Misleading GOP videos of Biden are going viral. The fact-checks have trouble keeping up.”\n\nCBS News ran an entire segment on television, “Examining the impact of ‘cheap fakes'” — what the media called videos of an incapacitated Biden.\n\nThe New York Times predebate article was headlined, “Biden Battles Age Doubts and a Trail of Misleading Videos.”\n\nThe Associated Press allegedly fact-checked the Hollywood event with denials from three Biden spokespeople and Lewis Kay, a spokesman for Jimmy Kimmel, the emcee who hosted a Democratic fundraiser.\n\nThe Washington Post’s fact-checkers argued that a video of a perplexed Biden at the G7 summit was achieved by “deceptive framing.” “‘Cheapfake’ Biden videos enrapture right-wing media, but deeply mislead.”\n\nAnyway, virtually every major outlet treated “cheapfakes” as a conspiracy theory, though they surely knew otherwise — and I only add the word “virtually” out of prudence.\n\nAfter the debate, it became inarguable that our doddering octogenarian president wasn’t OK. Not one of the journalists featured in the above list has admitted to the lesser charge of being duped. Without any explanation, most of them simply changed their focus and began pushing Biden out of the race to help Democrats. As soon as that goal was achieved, they began covering up for then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThere was no reckoning in the aftermath of Biden’s disconcerting debate performance. Or now.\n\n“Our responsibility is not to align with any one party or any one of the genders, but to serve the people of this country with integrity and dedication,” Eugene Daniels, MSNBC’s senior Washington correspondent and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said to long applause. “We care deeply about accuracy and take seriously the heavy responsibility of being stewards of the public’s trust. What we are not is the opposition.” \n\nWhat evidence exists that this statement is true? Not one journalist has gotten as much as demoted for allegedly missing one of the biggest political stories of the decade. Other than Thompson, not one reporter had specifically acknowledged exactly how they failed. Indeed, the president of what was once a prestigious journalistic association in Washington can’t even concede that his profession has an ideological predisposition.\n\nAN OVERDUE INVESTIGATION OF ACTBLUE\n\nAnd failing to admit this obvious point is part of the problem. It’s always more difficult to cast a critical eye on your friends. Recall how Thompson stressed that “every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” implying that journalists believe the Left is less inclined to lie than the Right. Thompson only needs to say this because he’s speaking to Democrats, which establishment journalists swear is not the case.\n\nThis episode simply punctuates the mass failure of modern journalism. The lack of trust in big-money establishment media outlets is destructive in numerous ways. Perhaps it has created a vacuum that’s too often filled by disreputable people on the Left and Right. So, sure, Thompson conceded more than most at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, but it was far too little. There’s little indication industry leaders feel the need to fix anything.","summary":"Imagine getting an award for doing the bare minimum at your job, doing it poorly, and then handing in the work so late that it has become irrelevant?

In Pittsburgh, Mayor Ed Gainey, who was first elected in 2021 amid a wave of post-pandemic, post-George Floyd progressive energy, is facing a substantial Democratic primary challenge from Corey O’Connor, the county controller and son of a former mayor. At its core, the race is a test case for the future of Democratic leadership in big cities, on everything from crime and safety to combatting President Donald Trump’s administration to how the party prioritizes diversity and inclusion in the coming years. The May 20 election is one of the first major off-year Democratic primaries in which the party’s progressive and center-left wings are facing off before voters — and the first in a key swing state. The race follows an election cycle in which Democratic governance of cities coming out of Covid was front and center to Republican campaigns, too. In an interview, O’Connor said that while Gainey “is a nice guy,” his administration is “managing decline” of their city rather than focusing on “growth and opportunity.” O’Connor has painted Gainey as an unproductive mayor who has failed to fulfill basic duties like timely snow removal and pothole repair, overseen a decline in the city’s downtown and has Pittsburgh unprepared for upcoming belt-tightening on its finances. “For the Democratic Party, if we want to start winning national races again, it does start at the local level, and it starts with actually producing results so that people feel confident in Democrats running cities again,” O’Connor said. In Pittsburgh and throughout Allegheny County, progressives have been on the march with the elections of Gainey, Rep. Summer Lee and county executive Sara Innamorato, all of whom rose quickly in local politics within the last few years. Allegheny County was one of the few large counties where then-Vice President Kamala Harris hit about the same level of support in 2024 as former President Joe Biden in 2020, a point local progressives have highlighted as evidence that their governance offers a roadmap forward for Democrats. But their hold on local power is now under threat. Gainey, who in 2021 became the first challenger to unseat a Pittsburgh mayor since the Great Depression, has for months been fighting an uphill battle against a better-funded and well-known challenger in O’Connor. Yet progressives see plenty of reason for hope and believe their fortunes are improving substantially in the closing weeks of the contest — particularly as voter intensity ramps up as Trump moves quickly to enact his sweeping agenda. Gainey has sought to position himself as the strongest person to counter Trump’s funding cuts to local research institutions and immigration overhaul. In an interview, Gainey said Trump’s policy agenda has changed the race “quite a bit” because “people are feeling the pain.” Both campaigns are touting internal polling showing them with an advantage in the tough-to-model local race: Gainey’s campaign on Monday promoted its own poll showing him up 7 points, while O’Connor’s showed him up by 4. Ultimately, both results were within the surveys’ margins of error — and O’Connor’s suggested considerable tightening of the race within the last month, after his campaign previously touted polls showing him up double digits. “The momentum is on our side,” Gainey said in a campaign speech on Monday. “Our coalition is growing stronger every single day.” Pittsburgh localizes a national fight on housing, policing and race Gainey’s allies have pointed to drops in violent crime, local job growth and the city’s improved credit ratings to counter O’Connor, who they believe is trying to blame the incumbent for issues that long predated his mayorship or affected cities across the country coming out of the pandemic. They’ve also worked to tie O’Connor to Trump by touting campaign donations O’Connor has received from prominent Republican donors, and they’ve cast O’Connor as a defender of monied real estate interests, highlighting support from developers. “It’s a significant race,” Gainey said in an interview. “At the end of the day, it comes down to — do you want someone who’s going to serve the rich and powerful? Or do you want someone that’s going to serve the people?” As Election Day nears, Gainey’s supporters have accused the challenger’s backers of using racist messaging against the mayor, the first Black mayor in city history. Those tensions were inflamed this month after an outside group backing O’Connor sent a mailer showing a dilapidated home reading: “The Ed Gainey Legacy. Wasting millions. Rewarding cronies. Hurting neighborhoods.” (Soon afterward, O’Connor released a statement denouncing “hateful rhetoric.” He and his backers have said efforts to tie him to Trump or describe his campaign as racist are to distract voters from the mayor’s record.) The mailer also highlighted an increasingly tense component of the race: housing policy. Gainey has sought to enact, throughout the city, inclusionary zoning policies that require new developments to set aside at least 10% of units for affordable housing and currently apply to only a few neighborhoods. O’Connor has come out against citywide inclusionary zoning policies, which detractors say will stifle development and not lead to increased affordable housing. He has criticized Gainey as having inflated his housing record, pointing to only a few hundred new units being completed during Gainey’s tenure. During a debate on WPXI, the local NBC affiliate, O’Connor challenged Gainey to take a walking tour of affordable units built on his watch — and then declined to join Gainey in the tour after the mayor announced it would take place on Wednesday. “He knows he cannot walk around the city and produce 1,600 new units of affordable housing,” O’Connor said in a subsequent debate on WTAE, the local ABC affiliate, adding the city needs 6,000 new units and the mayor can only produce a few hundred. Gainey, whose administration recently launched a new tracker to show progress on affordable housing development since his term began in 2022, fired back that the episode showed the difference “between rhetoric and action.” In his 2021 run, Gainey beat then-Mayor Bill Peduto in a three-way primary in which Gainey won with a plurality of the vote — 46.2%. The third candidate, Tony Moreno, won 13% of the vote and ran to the right of both Peduto and Gainey. Lew Irwin, a political science professor at Duquesne University, said the 2021 results offer a clear roadmap for an O’Connor victory: Grab hold of the Peduto and Moreno vote. Irwin added that Gainey has “talked almost continually about Trump … sanctuary cities and threats to democracy” in hopes of unifying Democrats behind him. When Gainey was first elected, Irwin said Democrats were “very energized around some of these social justice issues, around issues of abuse of authority.” “But the pendulum definitely has swung back to where you’ve got a significant number of Democrats who are more concerned about showing that the Democratic Party can actually govern effectively,” he said. Yet O’Connor has also touted his progressive bona fides in the race, not distancing himself from the label as some Democrats have. He’s campaigned on his efforts on local paid sick leave legislation, auditing the county jail and housing affordability. “I’ll be the progressive mayor who gets the job done,” O’Connor said in a campaign ad. ‘The world should be watching this race’ Even Gainey’s supporters acknowledge they wish the mayor and his administration did a better job of communicating what they see as his wins over the last few years. But they’ve decried a local media environment they see as openly hostile toward him. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the most prominent publication in town, has faced a yearslong strike, and Gainey, along with other local Democrats, have refused to speak with the paper until the strike is resolved. When asked about his first-term accomplishments, Gainey touted new state investments in the city’s downtown, working to bring the NFL draft to Pittsburgh next year, affordable housing efforts and multiple data points showing a strong local economy. Gainey and his backers also describe fostering a more inclusive environment locally for Black residents and others from communities that for many years were not in positions of power in the city. “It’s more welcoming,” Gainey said of how Pittsburgh has changed during his mayoral tenure. “It’s more of a situation where people believe they can be here. It’s more about a situation where people feel like they can flourish here. We lost so many people because they didn’t believe they can make a living here. And I think that stereotype is now breaking down.” Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San Jose, a local immigrant advocacy and services nonprofit, said Gainey “has done a million great things here in the city that no one recognizes.” “We need champions, because we are in a mess, and we are looking for leaders,” Ruiz, a Gainey supporter, said. “We need strong leaders that aren’t afraid.” Should Gainey fall short, Ruiz said it will seriously harm progressive advancement and electoral chances in the city. “The world should be watching this race, because what’s happening here in Pittsburgh is going to happen — it’s already happening — in other cities,” she said. “And people need to take note.” The issue that has dogged Gainey most in the election involves his former chief of police, Larry Scirotto — though it’s not exactly the type of policing issue that Democrats nationally and in other big cities have grappled with. Gainey agreed to allow Scirotto, a college basketball referee, return to refereeing if the murder rate dropped to a certain point. WPXI reported last year of Scirotto’s return to refereeing as he maintained his job as the city’s police chief, and the agreement angered other local officials, who were unaware of it. Scirotto said the deal was made “man to man.” Within days, he announced his retirement. On the trail, in interviews and in debates, O’Connor often raises the city’s current lack of a police chief as one of the first points he makes against Gainey. On Monday, three city council members backing O’Connor elevated another controversy, demanding the mayor answer for an administration official coordinating in a group chat with campaign staff and supporters on messaging. (Marco Attisano, a Gainey campaign attorney, said it is acting “in full compliance” with campaign finance laws.) State Sen. Wayne Fontana, who is backing O’Connor, said Gainey has not achieved any big accomplishments. “I just don’t see the city moving forward in any way, shape or form,” he said. “It’s time to do something different. … Almost every week, there’s an article about some mess up or screw up.” But with Trump in the White House, Gainey has taken up the mantle of the city’s protector against the president while arguing O’Connor is in the pocket of “MAGA operatives,” pointing to donations he has received from a handful of prominent Trump and Republican donors and a speech given at a meeting attended by Republican operatives. O’Connor’s campaign has pushed back, pointing to donations the mayor has previously received from Republican donors and to Gainey’s efforts to bring the GOP convention to the city ahead of the 2024 election. In his interview with NBC News, O’Connor pointed to endorsements from local Democrats and said “it’s a lie” that he’s in the pocket of Republicans. Amid that back-and-forth, Gainey even refunded $5,000 to a Trump donor who donated to his campaign in 2021 and contributed to O’Connor in this cycle. Both candidates have racked up local endorsements, but the most prominent Democrats who hold statewide office — including Gov. Josh Shapiro and two who hail from the area, Sen. John Fetterman and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis — have remained neutral in the race. The bitterly contested race has come at a cost, said Barb Warwick, a member of city council who sits in O’Connor’s former seat and is supporting Gainey. “We have this wonderful stronghold in Allegheny County, progressive leadership making real change,” she said. “And now people are turned against each other. It’s tearing the city apart and it didn’t have to be that way. That’s what sort of bums me out.” Lee, the congresswoman who represents Pittsburgh in the U.S. House, said she welcomes the fight and believes it “exemplifies the battle for what the Democratic Party can be or might be next.” “It’s not a bad fight to have,” she said. “What is the identity of the party? Are we going to be a party that reflects the base, reflects the changing demographics of this country? Is it reflective of the democracy that we want? Or we can have a party that continues to kind of be nostalgic for a past where all of us weren’t included.

The administration did not provide any evidence to support these claims.\n\nSince the start of his second term, Trump has gone to war against FEMA, and his Cabinet is taking actions to fulfill his pledge to “eliminate” FEMA.\n\nWhile the Trump team hasn’t spelled out why it opposes the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, it’s highly likely that it’s because of the program’s ties to the Biden administration. \n\nWhile the program was initiated during Trump’s first term, President Joe Biden significantly increased funding as part of his attempt to fight climate change, which Trump has falsely described as a “hoax.” \n\nAs part of Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law, $1 billion was allocated to the FEMA program. Trump, on the other hand, infamously failed to pass an infrastructure package during his first term, despite frequent promises of an “infrastructure week.” Many of Trump’s actions have been done to spite Biden and his achievements.\n\nNow, the towns most affected by Trump’s FEMA cuts are in the heart of Trump country. For example, Trump won North Carolina’s Cabarrus County by more than 7 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris. Mount Pleasant, a town of just more than 1,600 residents in Cabarrus County, is expected to significantly suffer from Trump’s cuts to FEMA.\n\nJim Quick, vice chairman of the Cabarrus County Republican Party, told AP that despite the direct impact, Republicans in the area are unlikely to pull their support from Trump. And Republican officials from other affected areas have spoken out against the cuts.\n\n“This program is a hand-up, not a hand-out, to at-risk communities who have suffered catastrophic weather events,” GOP Rep. Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania said in a statement.\n\nAnd during a speech on the Senate floor, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana admitted that the program is a “lifesaver and a cost-saver.”\n\n“This isn’t waste,” Cassidy said.\n\nRepublican voters have been convinced by figures like Trump and outlets like Fox News that Democrats allowed wasteful government programs to flourish.

It’s her former political daddy, Donald J. Trump. In a viral clip making the rounds on TikTok, Owens—who has spent the better part of the last seven years licking the MAGA boots clean—now claims she’s disappointed in the Trump administration; specifically, Trump’s attack on free speech, calling out his moves against Harvard University as “sad” and “un-American.” “We cannot allow our rights to be infringed upon,” Owens says in the video. “And if you think it’s gonna stop with college campuses, you’re out of your mind.” Now, let’s be clear. This sudden “awakening” isn’t about principle—it’s about positioning. Owens is pivoting not because her moral compass kicked in, but because her grift hit a glass ceiling. After leaving The Daily Wire (where calling out certain groups apparently comes with real consequences), she’s now scrambling to rebrand, hoping we’ll forget the years she spent defending the indefensible. But we remember. This is the same Candace Owens who blamed George Floyd for his own death. This is the same Candace Owens who labeled Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization,” defended Harvey Weinstein, and proudly cosigned Trump’s racist birther conspiracies and his attack on Kamala Harris’ Blackness. She built her brand being the Black face for white supremacy, weaponizing anti-Black rhetoric to keep the checks rolling in. The irony is, Owens wasn’t always this version of herself. Back in 2016, before she found out how lucrative being the conservative “Black friend” could be, she ran a site called Degree180 that mocked Trump, questioned his intellect (and anatomy), and spoke openly about the reality of systemic racism in America. But by 2017, Turning Point USA came calling with a job offer as their “urban engagement” director, which, let’s be honest, is code for we need a Black face to sell white nonsense to Black audiences. From there, she became the CPAC darling who famously denied the existence of racism altogether. Imagine the audacity of a woman who once won a lawsuit against her high school for—you guessed it—racism, now standing on stage telling Black folks racism isn’t real. But if you really want to understand Candace Owens, you have to understand the trauma play at work here. Source: Jason Davis / Getty In the words of Monique Judge, Owens is still that teenage girl who once felt unsafe in her own community, sidelined by racist attacks from her white classmates, and now she’s spent her adult life trying to find acceptance in the very spaces that once weaponized that hatred against her. And here we are, watching her latest act: Owens “breaking free” from the MAGA plantation, telling us this wasn’t what she “signed up for.” But make no mistake; this isn’t a stand for truth, it’s survival. Because her white audience may love a tap-dancing Sambo, but the second you critique any faction of white power, they remind you exactly where you stand. But Owens’ identity crisis is only half the story here. The real headline is what her pivot reveals about the state of MAGA itself. Trump’s approval rating is now the lowest of any presidential candidate at this point in an election cycle, and Owens’ very public fallout with team Trump is just the latest crack in the foundation. From internal GOP infighting to mounting legal troubles and a growing number of conservatives questioning the authoritarian tactics of their own leader, MAGA is showing signs of fracture. Candace Owens didn’t grow a conscience—she read the room. The Trump train is losing steam, and she’s looking for the next ride. But Black folks? We’ve seen this grift before. And we ain’t buying it.

On Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley criticized CBS parent company Paramount for interfering with the show's coverage, in a clear show of support for his former boss. \"Bill resigned Tuesday — it was hard on him and hard on us,\" Pelley said in his closing remarks on the show. \"But he did it for us — and you. \"Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger,\" he added, noting that it needs approval from the Trump administration. \"Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways and [Owens] felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.\" \"No one here is happy about it.

Pelley references reports that Paramount Global is looking to settle a lawsuit from President Trump over an interview with Kamala Harris on \"60 Minutes\" last year. For background, the network aired different parts of Harris's response to a question about Israel on separate nights, leading Trump to accuse CBS of election interference. In reality, Paramount had no choice but to intervene. Owens had turned a program that was once held among the most journalistically sound into a propagandistic sideshow, mirroring the editorial bent of Slate Magazine and disgruntled former reporters on Bluesky. We reviewed the direction of \"60 Minutes\" under Owens' leadership last week. Examples included deceptively editing the interview with Harris ahead of the election, raving about censorship laws in Germany, breaking format to accuse Tulsi Gabbard of sympathizing with Russia, and promoting DEI as a necessity to the future of the nation. Not great. The program has also presented a clear pro-Palestinian lean to its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. In January, \"60 Minutes\" host Lesley Stahl conducted an interview with Hamas hostage Keith Siegel during which she asked whether his terrorist captors starved him on purpose or \"just didn’t have food?\" Put simply, Owens and Pelley are offended that Paramount told them they could no longer downplay the terrorist group Hamas, shill for censorship in the West, and use \"60 Minutes\" as a vehicle to push Democrat talking points. Our only criticism is that Paramount didn't step in sooner. \"60 Minutes\" is no longer a credible news program because of Owens. And, honestly, Pelley isn't blameless either.

In a memo to staff, he said he could no longer make autonomous decisions due to growing corporate oversight from CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, which is pursuing a merger requiring approval from the Trump administration.\n\nPressure on CBS has been mounting after President Donald Trump filed a $20 billion lawsuit against the network, accusing it of deceptive editing during a 2024 interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris. Although CBS and its legal team consider the lawsuit groundless, Paramount is reportedly considering a settlement or public apology, a move that has unsettled newsroom staff.\n\nDuring a staff meeting, Owens said he had become “the corporation’s problem” and hoped his resignation would prompt CBS to reflect on its editorial practices.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley addressed Owens’s resignation on air, emphasizing that while no stories had been blocked, the increased corporate supervision had compromised the independence necessary for honest journalism.\n\n“No one here is happy about it. But in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead ‘60 Minutes’ all along,” Pelley said, praising Owens.\n\nWhat Was Bill Owens’ 60 Minutes Salary?\n\nSpecific details about Owens’ salary have not been publicly disclosed. However, given his role as executive producer of 60 Minutes and the show’s prominence, it’s likely that his compensation was substantial.\n\nWhat Is Bill Owens’ Net Worth?\n\nAs of 2025, Owens’ net worth is believed to be in the millions, though exact figures have not been widely reported.","summary":"Bill Owens spent years leading 60 Minutes, but how much money has he made during his career?

While outraged opposition has been visible and vocal, it remains a far cry from developing a capacity to protect what’s left of democracy in the United States.\n\nWith the administration in its fourth month, the magnitude of the damage underway is virtually impossible for any individual to fully grasp. But none of us need a complete picture to understand that the federal government is now in the clutches of massively cruel and antidemocratic forces that have no intention of letting go.\n\nDonald Trump’s second presidential term has already given vast power to the most virulent aspects of the nation’s far-right political culture. Its flagrant goals include serving oligarchy, dismantling civil liberties, and wielding government as a weapon against academic freedom, civil rights, economic security, environmental protection, public health, workers’ rights, and so much more.\n\nThe nonstop Trumpist assaults mean that ongoing noncooperation and active resistance will be essential. This is no time for what Martin Luther King, Jr., called “the paralysis of analysis.” Yet the past hugely matters. Repetition compulsions within the Democratic Party, including among self-described liberals and progressives, unwittingly smoothed the path for Trump’s return to power. Many of the same patterns, with undue deference to party leaders and their narrow perspectives, are now hampering the potential to create real leverage against MAGA madness.\n\n“Fiscal Conservatism and Social Liberalism”\n\nToday, more than three decades after the “New Democrats” triumphed when Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992, an observation by Washington Post economics reporter Hobart Rowen days after that victory is still worth pondering: “Fiscal conservatism and social liberalism proved to be an effective campaign formula.” While campaigning with a call for moderate public investment, Clinton offered enough assurances to business elites to gain much of their support. Once elected, he quickly filled his economic team with corporate lawyers, business-friendly politicians, lobbyists, and fixers on loan from Wall Street boardrooms.\n\nThat Democratic formula proved to be a winning one — for Republicans. Two years after Clinton became president, the GOP gained control of both the House and Senate. Republicans maintained a House majority for the next 12 years and a Senate majority for 10 of them.\n\nA similar pattern set in after the next Democrat moved into the White House. Taking office in January 2009 amid the Great Recession, Barack Obama continued with predecessor George W. Bush’s “practice of bailing out the bankers while ignoring the anguish their toxic mortgage packages caused the rest of us,” as journalist Robert Scheer pointed out. By the time Obama was most of the way through his presidency, journalist David Dayen wrote, he had enabled “the dispossession of at least 5.2 million U.S. homeowner families, the explosion of inequality, and the largest ruination of middle-class wealth in nearly a century.”\n\nTwo years into Obama’s presidency, his party lost the House and didn’t regain it for eight years. When he won reelection in 2012, Republicans captured the Senate and kept control of it throughout his second term.\n\nDuring Obama’s eight years as president, the Democrats also lost upward of 900 seats in state legislatures. Along the way, they lost control of 30 legislative chambers, while the Republican share of seats went from 44% to 56%. So GOP state legislators were well-positioned to gerrymander electoral districts to their liking after the 2020 census, making it possible for Republicans to just barely (but powerfully) gain and then retain their stranglehold on the House of Representatives after the 2022 and 2024 elections.\n\nHillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024 ran for president while sticking to updated versions of “fiscal conservatism, social liberalism,” festooning their campaigns with the usual trappings of ultra-mild populist rhetoric. Much of the media establishment approved, as they checked the standard Democratic boxes. But opting to avoid genuine progressive populism on the campaign trail meant enabling Trump to pose as a better choice for the economic interests of the working class.\n\nMutual Abandonment\n\nThe party’s orientation prevents its presidential nominees from making a credible pitch to be champions of working people. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted immediately after the 2024 election. “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change.”\n\nBut there’s little evidence that the party leadership wants significant change, beyond putting themselves back in power. Midway through April, the homepage of the Democratic Party seemed like a snapshot of an institution still disconnected from the angst and anger of the electorate. A pop-up that instantly obscured all else on the screen featured a drawing of a snarling Donald Trump next to the headline: “We’re SUING Trump over two illegal executive orders.” Underneath, the featured message proclaimed: “We’re rolling up our sleeves and organizing for a brighter, more equal future. Together, we will elect Democrats up and down the ballot.” A schedule of town halls in dozens of regions was nice enough, but a true sense of urgency, let alone emergency, was notably lacking.\n\nOverall, the party seems stuck in the mud of the past, still largely mired in the Joe Biden era and wary of opening the door too wide for the more progressive grassroots base that provides millions of small donations and volunteers to get out the vote (as long as they’re genuinely inspired to do so). President Biden’s unspeakably tragic refusal to forego running for reelection until far too late was enabled by top-to-bottom party dynamics and a follow-the-leader conformity that are still all too real.\n\nOn no issue has the party leadership been more tone-deaf — with more disastrous electoral and policy results — than the war in Gaza. The refusal of all but a few members of Congress to push President Biden to stop massively arming the Israeli military for its slaughter there caused a steep erosion of support from the usual Democratic voters, as polling at the time and afterward indicated. The party’s moral collapse on Gaza helped to crater Kamala Harris’s vote totals among alienated voters reluctant to cast their ballots for what they saw as a war party, a perception especially acute among young people and notable among African Americans.\n\nThe Fact of Oligarchy\n\nPandering to potential big donors is apt to seem like just another day in elected office. A story about California Governor Gavin Newsom, often touted as a major Democratic contender for president in 2028, is in the category of “you can’t make this stuff up.” As reported by Politico this spring, he “is making sure California’s business elite can call him, maybe. Roughly 100 leaders of state-headquartered companies have received a curious package in recent months: a prepaid, inexpensive cell phone… programmed with Newsom’s digits and accompanied by notes from the governor himself. ‘If you ever need anything, I’m a phone call away,’ read one note to a prominent tech firm CEO, printed on an official letterhead, along with a hand-scrawled addendum urging the executive to reach out.… It was Newsom’s idea, a representative said, and has already yielded some ‘valuable interactions.’”\n\nIf, however, you’re waiting for Newsom to send prepaid cell phones to activists working for social justice, telling them, “If you ever need anything, I’m a phone call away,” count on waiting forever.\n\nThe dominance of super-wealthy party patrons that Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been railing against at “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies has been coalescing for a long time. “In the American republic,” wrote Walter Karp for Harper’s magazine shortly before his death in 1989, “the fact of oligarchy is the most dreaded knowledge of all, and our news keeps that knowledge from us.” Now, in the age of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, the iron heel of mega-capital is at work swiftly crushing democratic structures, while top Democrats race to stay within shouting distance of the oligarchs.\n\nA paradoxical challenge for the left is that it must take part in building a united front that includes anti-Trump corporatists and militarists, even while fighting against corporatism and militarism. What’s needed is not capitulation or ultra-leftism, but instead a dialectical approach that recognizes the twin imperatives of defeating an increasingly fascistic Republican Party while working to gain enough power to implement truly progressive agendas.\n\nFor those agendas, electoral campaigns and their candidates should be subsets of social movements, not the other way around. Still, here’s one crystal-clear lesson of history: it’s crucial who sits in the Oval Office and controls Congress. Now more than ever.\n\nFascism Would Stop Us All\n\nA horrible reality of this moment: a fascist takeover of the government is within reach — and, if completed, any possibility of fulfilling a progressive agenda would go out the Overton window. The words of the young Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, murdered in 1969 by the Chicago police (colluding with the FBI), ring profoundly true today: “Nothing is more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us all.”\n\nBut much of the 2025 Democratic Party leadership seems willing to once again pursue the tried-and-failed strategy of banking on Trump to undo himself. Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the party leaders in the House and Senate, have distinctly tilted in that direction, as if heeding strategist James Carville’s declaration that Democrats should not try to impede Trump’s rampage against the structures of democracy.\n\n“With no clear leader to voice our opposition and no control in any branch of government, it’s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,” Carville wrote in late February. “Allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.” (Evidently impressed with his political acumen, the editors of the New York Times published the op-ed piece with that advice only four months after printing an op-ed he wrote in late October under this headline: “Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.”)\n\nAs for the Democratic National Committee, it probably had nowhere to go but up in the wake of the chairmanship of Jaime Harrison, who for four years dutifully did President Biden’s bidding. Now, with no Democratic president, the new DNC chair, Ken Martin, has significant power to guide the direction of the party.\n\nIn early April, I informed Martin that my colleagues and I at RootsAction were planning a petition drive for the full DNC to hold an emergency meeting. “The value of such a meeting seems clear for many reasons,” I wrote, “including the polled low regard for the Democratic Party and the need to substantively dispel the wide perception that the party is failing to adequately respond to the current extraordinary perils.” Martin replied with a cordial text affirming that the schedule for the 448-member DNC to convene remains the same as usual — twice a year — with the next meeting set for August.\n\nThe petition, launched in mid-April (co-sponsored by RootsAction and Progressive Democrats of America), urged the DNC to “convene an emergency meeting of all its members — fully open to the public — as soon as possible.… Business as usual must give way to truly bold action that mobilizes against the autocracy that Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their cronies are further entrenching every day. The predatory, extreme, and dictatorial actions of the Trump administration call for an all-out commensurate response, which so far has been terribly lacking from the Democratic Party.”\n\nNo matter what, at this truly pivotal time, we must never give up.\n\nAs Stanley Kunitz wrote during the height of the Vietnam War:\n\nIn a murderous time the heart breaks and breaks and lives by breaking.\n\nIt is necessary to go through dark and deeper dark and not to turn.\n\nWhile reasons for pessimism escalate, I often think of how on target my RootsAction colleague India Walton was in a meeting when she said, “The only hope is in the struggle.”","summary":"Trump and his ultra-wealthy allies are dismantling democratic structures.

Others say Democrats will not nominate another woman, fearing the country is too sexist for her to win.”\n\nThe article more or less pointed to a gubernatorial run rather than waiting for 2028.\n\n“Ms. Harris has good reason for leaning toward a run for governor, according to people who have spoken with her,” the Times said. “She has watched with horror as institutions Democrats care about — universities, law firms and more — have caved under pressure. And she believes that as governor of the nation’s most populous blue state, she would have a powerful platform from which to push back against Mr. Trump and his policies, and to defend Democratic priorities and values.”\n\nThere are two things wrong with the article.\n\nThe first is that it cast Harris’ situation almost entirely in terms of advancing her political career, an example of political journalism’s tendency to cover politics as something like reporting on sports events — who’s winning, who’s losing, who’s up and who’s down — rather than a prelude to governance.\n\nThat approach, while appealing to political junkies, completely ignores the issues that a politician might face if he or she is fortunate enough to be elected. In this case, the Times implied that the 2026 election for a governor who would lead the world’s fourth-largest economy is just about opposition to Donald Trump and nothing else.\n\nThe article contained not one sentence about the California issues Harris would inherit from Gavin Newsom were she to become governor — such thorny matters as a perpetual housing shortage, homelessness, poverty, an uncertain water supply, educational deficiencies and chronic state budget deficits.\n\nHaving ignored those issues, all of which predate Trump, the Times article’s second deficiency is that it contained nothing about Harris’ abilities, or lack thereof, to confront them. And there is good reason to doubt whether she would be up to the job.\n\nAs a senator she authored no noteworthy legislation, not even on California-centered matters, while the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein steadfastly carried the state’s political water. Harris’ campaign for president in 2020 was a disaster, and after being chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate she did little of note as vice president.\n\nGoverning an extremely complex state such as California is a daunting task, as any past governor could attest, not a consolation prize for losing a presidential contest.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Governing an extremely complex state such as California is a daunting task, as any past governor could attest, not a consolation prize for losing a presidential contest.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/04/28/as-harris-ponders-run-for-california-governor-is-she-prepared-for-the-daunting-job/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OCR-L-HARRISEFFECT-0320-04.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 17:54:14","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":315733770,"title":"“60 Minutes” Rattles Viewers with Stunning Closing Segment, Implies That Trump Administration Is Pressuring Their Coverage","text":"60 Minutes surprised viewers on Sunday night by ending with a segment about their executive producer, Bill Owens, who resigned last week.Correspondent Scott Pelley spoke out on Owens’ departure, implying that CBS News' parent company, Paramount Global, had been influencing the show's coverage in order to appease President Donald Trump.Paramount is currently trying to complete a multi-million dollar merger with Skydance, which would require regulatory approval from the Trump-appointed FCC.\n\n Following the surprise resignation of 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, the news magazine's Sunday night broadcast ended with a segment implying that President Donald Trump and his administration have had an inappropriate influence on the show. \n\n Correspondent Scott Pelley, in a segment of “The Last Minute,” insinuated that the show’s parent company, Paramount Global, had started to push back on some of their more hard-hitting segments — especially those about the current administration.\n\n The company is currently in the process of completing a major merger with Skydance, and needs the Trump administration’s regulatory approval.\n\n “Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial — lately the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration,” Pelley, 67, told viewers. “Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way, but our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it.”\n\n “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways,” he continued. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”\n\n In his resignation memo obtained by multiple outlets on April 22, Owens claimed that he had lost the ability to “make independent decisions” regarding the show and “what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.”\n\n “Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it,” he continued. “Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.”\n\n In his segment, Pelley said that “no one here is happy” about Owens leaving 60 Minutes. \n\n “But in resigning, Bill proved one thing: he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along,” the former CBS Evening News anchor continued. “It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us and you.”\n\n Trump’s ongoing vendetta against 60 Minutes is a major roadblock for the Paramount-Skydance merger. The president is currently in the midst of a lawsuit with the show, over an interview they conducted with former Vice President Kamala Harris in the midst of her 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n Trump filed the lawsuit in October 2024, claiming that CBS News edited one of Harris’ answers in order to improve her chances of winning the White House. While the network initially refused his legal team’s demand for an unedited transcript of the interview, they did eventually make it public January, following a request from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n Paramount’s legal team has argued that the suit is an “affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” noting that all news shows regularly edit interviews for clarity, context and airtime — not in an effort to change the facts.\n\n However, in February, The New York Times reported that Paramount Global’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, told the board that she wanted to settle the legal battle with Trump. While the NYT said at the time that Redstone’s statement didn’t mention the Skydance deal by name, it did “underscore the fact that a pending multibillion-dollar lawsuit from the president made it difficult for Paramount to do business.”\n\n Redstone, the only daughter of late Viacom founder and CBS chairman Sumner Redstone. stands to make a significant amount of money if the merger is completed.\n\n Trump has made no secret about his desire to bring the law down on 60 Minutes, CBS News and Paramount.\n\n In an April 13 post on Truth Social, he called for his appointed FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, to impose fines and strip the network of its license over 60 Minutes segments on Greenland and Ukraine.\n\n “They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing,” Trump wrote. “Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior. CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n When 60 Minutes launched its 55th season in 2022, Owens told PEOPLE that he and his team had \"no interest in changing the content\" of the historic news magazine, even as the media landscape evolves.\n\n \"60 Minutes is a place where you're not going to get a partisan take on anything,\" Owens said at the time. \"I like to tell the staff we broadcast to the entire country.

When you're ready to invest, check out this top 10 list of stocks to buy.\n\nA full transcript is below.\n\nThis video was recorded on April 26, 2025\n\nTarek Mansour: But the important thing here is that these prediction markets are not a crystal ball, they're not almighty. But they're as close as it gets. They're the best way to forecast the future because of this skin in the game aspect. People don't lie when their money is involved.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I'm Ricky Mulvey, and that's Kalshi CEO and co-founder Tarek Mansour. On today's show, we're taking two looks at prediction markets, one from a leader in the industry, and another from a journalist telling its story. In the first part, Mansour spoke with me about how prediction markets can differ from gambling, and his platform is a source of truth.\n\nA basic question for you, but one that I think is important to your company and for our listeners understanding, Kalshi, what is the difference between an event contract and a bet?\n\nTarek Mansour: That's a great question. Obviously, we get asked this a lot, and it's one of the central questions around prediction markets. And the way I like to answer a question usually is in some ways, to outline that this question has been consistently asked whenever it came to taking new financial markets mainstream. People are not familiar with this, but when grain futures first came to the US, there was a question. There was actually a Supreme Court decision about whether these are gambling or not. Are these bets or are they not? The answer where the Supreme Court landed was, sure, there's a lot of people that are speculating on these markets, so speculation is a form of betting, it's similar in many ways. But these markets have economic utility beyond that speculative activity. That's what makes them extremely important and makes them a financial instrument rather than a bet.\n\nA simpler way to even think about that is, and I like to think about this in that different frame, which is there are two types of risks, artificial risks and natural risk. Now, artificial risk is a risk that you create for the purpose of speculating on it. So it's like rolling a dice or doing a roulette spin. Speculating on that or betting on that doesn't have really any utility outside of that betting activity itself. But something like, will Brexit happen or not? That's a natural risk. That's going to happen and impacts people in many ways, beyond whether you have a bet or speculative activity on it or not. An event contract on Brexit would be something that would qualify as a financial instrument. That's a really different thing from obviously, speculating on a die roll.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Let's get into the sports because your platform now offers, March Madness is still going on at the time of this recording, not when it's being released. What is the economic utility of an event contracts for the outcome of a sporting event?\n\nTarek Mansour: Just to take a step back. We have Kalshi markets on a very broad range of things, so politics, economics, weather, COVID and health, science, and recently entered sports. Our entry to sports was due to massive customer demand, both retail and institutional customers are in Kalshi today. Obviously, there is an industry the sports books and other that offer markets where you go and trade or bet against the house. Our market is different, and the difference is here, for any of our other event contracts or prediction markets, it's like a financial market. It's like a stock market where people are buying and selling these shares where the event is happening or not. The types of events we focused on, so for example who's going to win the Super Bowl or these title events, these are big events that have massive economic ramifications, both economic and social ramifications to the teams, the things around the teams like the cities, the towns, localities around them. You've seen there's a bunch of reports that came out. The Eagles won. That has drastic economic impact on the city, on the teams, and so on and so forth.\n\nYou see, there's massive amounts of money that are being invested on these leagues and these games and sports these days. It's a massive industry. That's not just a game. Those people could basically be taking a position to increase our volatility or hedge their volatility against a bad outcome, which is their team losing. The other thing that's really important is that people care. One of the functions of financial markets, a bit like going back to the grain futures argument, was this notion of price basing or basically figuring out what the pricing or the forecast of something is. At the time farmers needed to know what the future price of grain was going to be. The beauty of our markets and prediction markets, they give you a price, which is a forecast of whether event is going to happen or not, which can enable people to make better decisions, figure out where they should invest, and rely on a market based forecast rather than pundits saying different things.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I am rooting for your platform to dramatically disrupt the sports betting market, and I think it will. I think it's an interesting case to be made, especially for economic utility. If let's say the Cincinnati Bengals win the Super Bowl next year, there's an economic impact on that city, and I think that argument is pretty strong. If you look at something happening this weekend, there's a UFC featherweight title fight that's also on your platform, Alex Volkanovski versus Diego Lopez. Volkanovski's from Australia, so if he wins, there's an economic impact for Australia when you have the title coming back to that country. When you think about the future of your platform, though, let's go deeper, do you see that going across all sports? Because I think that's a strong argument for a title fight. But the first fight on the preliminary card, is that something that you expect to see in the future for calls? Do you expect to see the wide range of sports betting options that one can find on DraftKings and FanDuel, you planning on sticking to those high impact events?\n\nTarek Mansour: The general answer to what you're asking me, do I expect this to look like a traditional sportsbook? The answer is no. It probably won't look like a traditional sportsbook because there are key differences. Some are regulatory and they're very critical and others are even in the business model. I'll start with the business model. You've seen so our market benefits from concentration. You need these big events that a lot of people care about or have economic or social impact toward that concentrates volume and liquidity. Our business gets better and better with more volume, more liquidity. The reason is because we don't take bets against the customers. That's not how we make money. So for us, we need large sums of volumes to make money based on our small transaction fees that we take. You might have seen some of the results for example, in March Madness, and I was looking at some of the reporting, our platform within two months of launch is actually one of the large players already in the industry in terms of volume traded through the platform. Our markets really benefit from volume.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, then it makes more sense for us to concentrate as a business rather than have all this long tale of different things that you can get exposed to or bet on traditional sportsbooks. Again, because we don't make money off of someone losing a bet to us. That's just not how it works. From a regulatory perspective, we need to focus on markets that they have to satisfy number of core principles are extremely heavily regulated. There's 23 core principles we have to abide by. But two that are very relevant here. One is around the markets have to have economic relevance. If a market is totally doesn't have any impact or people don't really care about it or whether it goes one way or the other, doesn't matter in any way, shape, or form to anybody, then it's harder for us to do and doesn't really fit in our model. Number 2 is they have to be not readily susceptible to manipulation, which is another really key thing that we think about. When you think about designing a marketplace that has market integrity and fairness, you have to put up things that are not easily manipulable, where, for example, a player decides to do something, even if the economic gain is very limited, they could still do it because it's very easy to do it. Those are the two things that we think about that make us really fundamentally different from what you would see in a traditional sportsbook.\n\nRicky Mulvey: We'll stay on manipulability, the ability to manipulate a market. Because I want to get to the visibility in your market in a second, which I think is incredibly important and groundbreaking, really, what you're doing for retail speculators. But the ability to manipulate things, one of the things you can bet on is whether or not someone will say a word. What Caroline Levitt will say at a Trump press conference, whether or not the CEO of Netflix will say gaming in the next earnings call, to me, that's the thing where I wonder if that can be manipulated. Let's say I'm an investment analyst who's going to be on the Netflix earnings call, and I place a bet on gaming. I don't hear it in the comments uptop, but I've got a bet on gaming, so that's going to inform what question I ask the CEO at the bottom. For manipulating in sports, that's one where we'll use the UFC example. There's consequences beyond the bet to manipulating a fight. If someone loses a fight, there are physical and career consequences for that. But if I'm an investment analyst and I'm just like I'm going to ask this question about gaming, that seems almost like a harmless manipulation outside of the prediction market. So how are you thinking about manipulation, especially with what word will someone say in a press conference?\n\nTarek Mansour: Totally. I think that's a great question. I will say it's a few things to think about here. One is, the rules around Kalshi and the way that it's structure is very similar to a traditional financial market. A very simple analogy is the stock market. If people trade based on insider information or you're trying to manipulate a stock for the purpose of gain, that is actually illegal and there's a whole suite of systems in the New York Stock change and NASDAQ and so on and so forth that have been built over the years to flag this type of activity, figure out who did it, and then you can prosecute these people appropriately. It's the same exact thing on Kalshi. We have developed over the years, and that was a big thing. You might know some of the history of the company. We spent three years getting regulated upfront so that we can be legal, and today, we're the only legal broad prediction market in the US, with the CFT to develop some of these systems to figure out how do we preserve market integrity and make sure that these types of activities are not happening. A few things.\n\nFirst, we KYC everybody so we know who's trading on the product, we know everything about them. Second, all the trades go through our surveillance systems that flag any unusual patterns or patterns of erratic or statistically weird behaviors. Then those go to our investigation team that runs investigations, and these are happening every hour every day. We have a whole team that basically does these. If we flag someone doing something like this, they can be prosecuted from a fine all the way to criminal prosecution. These are same as typical what'd see in traditional financial markets. My answer to this at a high level is, this is pretty much on par with that investment analyst trying to manipulate a stock by asking a certain question or saying something on that earnings call. So that person, if they did that, they wouldn't be allowed to take a trade. Even if they tried to come up with some smart scheme, if the money is sizable enough if it matters, we're probably going to find it, and they're going to be prosecuted. That would be a crime. Different markets have different susceptibility to manipulation, but earnings calls have quite stringent rules around them. Same with the Fed, people ask about the Fed a lot. What Powell will say in a speech, that moves trillions of dollars in the economy. If he's slightly more hawkers than expected or more, that's why the Powell script is very well scripted beforehand, and there's rules around it because if someone leaks it before to the bond market or other, you're not going to have drastic move before the speech. I think it's very similar.\n\nRicky Mulvey: One of the things I really appreciate about your market is the visibility into what's going on. You can see trading volume for stocks if you go on Schwab, that kind of thing. But especially on the speculation side, for something like a March Madness game, DraftKings is not listing the betting volume for each game, whereas your platform, it does. Your platform also, you can see what people are betting on, you can see the live trade order flow, which is also something for stock markets. That's something that is not available to retail participants. I'll ask you some hard questions. I'll throw you some flowers. What's your philosophy on making these markets visible to the retail participants? Why is it important to you to make basically all of your markets visible to everybody on your platform?\n\nTarek Mansour: Absolutely. One comment on the hard questions, please keep them coming, I love the hard questions in some ways. A new type of financial innovation should and needs to be met with some degree of healthy skepticism, and that healthy skepticism is the thing that pushes us to improve over time. There's this nice feedback loop that improves these financial markets to get to the study state they should get to. I've always been a fan of these types of debates, and hopefully you'll throw more at me. This is a great point. Transparency has been a very core piece of the mission and the vision for prediction markets. That's the whole point. We want a market based mechanism to price the future. We don't want the pricing to be a book. We don't want the pricing to be an analyst or a pundit or one single market maker or so on and so forth. We want it to be this wisdom of the crowds aspect. We bring a variety of people with diverse opinions. Some of them may be from Wall Street, but actually on Kalshi, a lot of them are not the top hedge fund manager, and the topper's retail individuals that love reading the news, know a lot about politics and feel like they don't have an edge in traditional financial markets because the large hedge funds have all the edge and all the asymmetric information. Whereas on Kalshi, information is equal.\n\nThat's a very big part of this. We want everything to be out there. The price at any point in time, how the price comes to be, who's trading where? If you open Kalshi right now on the masters or on our economic or any of our markets, you see the live trades, as you mentioned. Who's trading what? What is the size that's going on either side? We don't want anyone to pay for that. That's open source. It's free. You can access, even if you're not a member of the product. This is really in vain with creating a level playing field where anyone can beat anyone else, if they're looking to do research to get smart about the future and be better. It will give you one anecdote about this. This is something that really makes us really happy at the company, these types of anecdotes about our customers, which is I always tell people, Kalshi has been the most accurate forecast for politics. We saw it at the election, economic inflation and so on and so forth. I've been asking people, guess who has been the best inflation forecaster, who has the best ROI, return on investment on our inflation markets in the last 2-3 years. People come and guess, and we have some hedge funds on the product and market makers and really institutional players.\n\nThey usually gets some of those typical players. But actually, the answer is it's a random dude from Kansas, never traded financial markets before, doesn't trade options. This person is an avid news reader, reads the news every day, likes to be engaged with what's going on with the economy, what's going on with geopolitics, what's going on with a variety of different things. They ended up being pretty sharp where the economy is heading. Those are types of people that are making real money. Now it's their full time job on Kalshi. If we weren't transparent, if there wasn't extreme transparency to the platform or you're trading against other people and you can see everything out in the open, it'd be harder for these people to beat the books or the traditional hedge funds, which is counter to what we're trying to build.\n\nRicky Mulvey: If this gentleman in Kansas is available for podcasts, our email is [email protected]. Hope he has an external microphone. We'd be very curious to talk to him about the macro economy if he's truly the best on your platform. There was a fundamental event for Kalshi and that was the presidential election. That was where you got the most attention on your platform, and it was groundbreaking where you were the first legal market in the United States where people could bet on the election. Now that we're a few months past that, even though it feels like a lifetime ago, what did you learn about your market in speculative behavior from the 2024 presidential election?\n\nTarek Mansour: A few things that led us to the election. The history of Kalshi is we first spent three years upfront getting regulated by the federal government to get a license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate the first derivatives exchange that can list prediction markets legally in the US. Then we operated for a while. We wanted to list the election market, but our regulator believe that we should not list it and blocked us from listing it. We sued our regulator and took them to federal court over this election market, and we won that lawsuit a few weeks before the presidential election last year. Once we won that lawsuit, we legalized election markets, and really a broad suite of prediction markets event contracts in the United States. For reference, election markets have been illegal since the Great Depression, and so we've opened up the ability to trade on the election based on our lawsuit. Once we won that lawsuit, we have grown at an unprecedented rate. It was truly incredible, and I'll give some stats.\n\nWe did $2 billion of volume in the span of a month, month and a half after we won, we were Number 1 on the app store overtaking Kalshi, Instagram, TikTok, and a number of other apps. On election day, we were the largest out of all prediction markets by quite a bit, and we got around 500 million unique people visiting our site. That's a substantial chunk of people in the world. What we've seen is, like, first of all, the entire planet really cares about US elections. This might be obvious, but I think now we have real data to prove that. Number 2, there was a period in time around the end of the day where our number of site visits overtook CNN and Fox. That was a sign where people did not know where to look, because if you looked at CNN, they were saying one Candida is winning, Harris, and if you looked at Fox, they were saying that Trump is winning, and people didn't know where to look. They came to us the prediction markets where people have their money where their mouth is to figure out who's winning and what was going on. That was really incredible. It was amazing because it worked. I don't know if you saw the announcement. We announced Don Jr. joining as an advisor in January, and a big part of why ended up being rallied about the mission, and he tweeted about this was how in Mar-a-Lago, they were using the app and the site and they were looking at the odds for figuring out who was going to win.\n\nWe've come a long way, this was a niche Internet thing to now being totally mainstream and people are using it normally. But it worked and people were saying that these markets were biased or manipulated, and so on. But actually, you saw that the polls were all at 50/50, and Kalshi and other prediction markets were at 62, 63%. The prediction markets were right. I think now there's this moment where people realize, like, we should embrace this technology. It's working. It's being used, and I've talked about this, like Doge and Elon Musk uses our markets to inform how much they're going to be cutting in federal spending. Fed and others are pulling our market data to figure out how to influence economic and government policy over time, same with institutions and businesses. But the important thing here is that these prediction markets are not a crystalbll. They're not Almighty. But they're as close as it gets. They're the best way to forecast the future because of this skin in the game aspect. The people don't lie when their money is involved.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I don't begrudge any financial institution for lobbying or trying to get close to politics. You mentioned Donald Trump Jr. as a strategic advisor. What strategy is he advising you on? What are those conversations like right now?\n\nTarek Mansour: I think people always mention things like lobbying and other, look, we're not a partisan company. Like, that's very important to understand. We have Democrats and Republicans involved with the company, both at the board level and obviously in the company itself. What we are is we're believers in the mission that we're focused on. Anyone that agrees with that mission, I think we would welcome them and we'd hope for them to come and help us. That's true for both sides of the aisle. I think it specifically when it comes to Don Jr., it's Don and actually, the Trump family for a decade now have been big fans of going direct. Talking to people directly. Twitter is obviously a big part of it, Truth Social, and so on. Part of it is like generally, the media has been pretty adverse to Trump. The intermediaries didn't really work out for them, so they had to go direct and talk directly to the people. X was a big vehicle for that. I think of prediction markets are being very complimentary to that, which is being directly involved with the people and the wisdom of the crowd or decentralization of news. Like, you go on X to get news from people, not from an authority or an institution, like a newspaper.\n\nYou go to prediction markets to get news about the future from people, from markets. I think these two gel very well together. Don has been pretty big fan for prediction markets. Obviously, they went mainstream at the end of the year that's heightened the interest, advising us all things go to market. We're expanding to new jurisdiction, the new types of markets that may be actually useful and may help us educate. This is going very mainstream. Now we have millions of customers. Like, how do we take it to the next 100 million customer? I think he's been very helpful with that over the last few months.\n\nRicky Mulvey: You talked about going direct to market. I think your platform is incredibly useful for things like odds of a recession. People have to put their money where their mouth is. It's not just opinions from an economist. We talked about the election. There's stories that can be told within your platform. Right now, Kamala Harris and Stephen A. Smith have the same percent chance on your market of being the 2028 Democratic nominee. I know you've talked about the TikTok ban before. When you look at the chart of that on your platform, up and down the volatility in that, even the Jeff Epstein files getting released, you can see people's belief wavering going up and down. Is there a story from your market that you find yourself thinking about a lot?\n\nTarek Mansour: There's so much interest around a variety of different things, and each market, and you might have seen this, there's a Kalshi idea section below the market, which is this notion that it's a bit like Twitter, but you can only post if you have a position in the market. It's beautiful because people sometimes they're making jokes and so on, but often they're talking about the analysis behind their positions. Why do I think TikTok is going to get banned? Why do I think that Gavin Newsom has no chance of being a Democratic nominee? I believe that Stephen A. Smith has actually pretty big chance, and I think the odds right now are a buy, and I think the odds are mispriced. The beauty of that is, like, you can actually craft that story from this community that is doing all this research and they're putting money where their mouth is.\n\nLook, I think right now, the story on Kalshi is that there's a lot of volatility, and you see it in the odds. Like, the odds of a recession are moving a lot. The beauty is these markets work. If you trust that these markets work and they are accurate at every point in time. If the odds are constantly moving, so they were at 70%, three days ago, now they're back at 55%. That just tells you that right now there's a lot of volatility and instability in financial markets or really the system more broadly. We see it across politics, geopolitics, economics, financial markets, even things like science and technology. It's like anything is fair game. In some ways, if anyone is on the news right now making these bold assumptions and predictions about exactly what's going to happen, they're probably being over certain and overconfident. They're probably wrong. Our markets are basically showing that volatility today. We'll see what happens. Recession market has been extremely heavily quoted in the last few days. I think it's because people don't know what's going to happen. I think they want to know, like, are we going into recession or not? Right now, the odds are, you might have checked them. I think they're like 55%.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Above 60?\n\nTarek Mansour: Oh, 64%? They're back at 64. Oh, wow. They're back up. Two thirds chance of a recession this year.\n\nRicky Mulvey: The other thing going on, there are people that are not big fans of Kalshi, and that includes casino lobbies. You've gotten cease and desist orders from Nevada, Maryland, Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio. I understand the arguments that you're not a gambling pool because you're not trading against a casino, you're trading against other players, so it's a little bit different. But just broadly, what's it like going up against a casino lobby? What's that experience like for you?\n\nTarek Mansour: Look, I don't think of it that way. There's a lot of headlines, a lot of news. The thing I say sometimes, like, don't trust the news too much. Like, the news loves to create these duels and fights and this tension because news is tension. You want to see what's happening in the background and so on. Actually, a lot of the operators, we're having a lot of very constructive dialogues with them. You see we have kalshi.com, Kalshi direct, where people go to Kalshi directly and become members of the exchange, and they trade with us. But the traditional go to market for exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange or CME, is you don't go to CME or New York Stock Exchange to buy an option or a stock. You go to Schwab and Robin that's where you go. You go to your financial broker. Right now, we're launching brokers, so we've launched Robinhood and we have something like 10-12 brokers in the pipeline today, and that's going to be a big part of our go to market for a year, and that can and will include a lot of the sports operators that want to get into a financial market offering or a prediction market offering that will be powered by Kalshi. In many ways, what people are viewing as this very conflictual competition is actually much more complimentary and looks a lot more like a partnership than people are like, thinking about.\n\nBecause people are thinking, like, the prediction market offering is not actually that competitive player props and all these different things that the books usually do and definitely not a casino, which is what casinos really do. Our offering really have nothing to do with that. But it's much more of a compliment, like, could we provide odds to the participants in those products, and could there be just much more of a healthier merger? I think a lot of operators in the space see that, and that's why they're talking to us and working on partnerships with us and so on and so forth. I think the premise is not quite right. Yes, so we do have some lawsuits right now in some of the states that believe that they have jurisdiction over this, and you might have seen the federal court in Las Vegas and Nevada ruling against Nevada in this first step or ruling in favor of our preliminary injunction because our message has been very clear. Like, financial markets are regulated at the federal level. You can trade stocks anywhere in the US because it's regulated at the federal level. If it's a state one day bans trading stocks, you can still trade stocks in a state because that's how the constitution and the law works. It's a similar thing for anything that an exchange, what we call a DCM, which is what we all does at the CFTC level.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I understand constructive dialogue, but also you got casino lobbies selling you cease and desist letters, which is usually not a let's keep talking kind of thing. If I understand, you're offering something different from the sports books and the casinos.\n\nTarek Mansour: Look, my point wasn't about everyone. I think anything new that's disrupting a potential, like, a mechanism or industry and so on, obviously, we'll come as always, a healthy degree of skepticism. I'm not saying that this is everybody in the industry. I think there's a lot in the industry that I think are looking to partner and work constructively. We want to work with anyone, anyone that's willing to partner and work with us. Then some that maybe are more resistant and are still figuring out what they want to do with this. To be clear, we didn't receive any cease and desist from casinos or rather, we received from states, which is they're not the same parties, so that's important to flag here. Again, not everybody, but, hopefully, over time, we'll rally more and more. I think the pie of people that are basically getting excited about this is growing in that industry.\n\nRicky Mulvey: You also recently announced a partnership with Robinhood. I know it's early days, but how do you expect that to impact activity on your platform? What do you expect Kalshi to do for Robinhood?\n\nTarek Mansour: Right now we have Robinhood and Webull launching the product. We have around 10-12 other brokerages that are in the process of integrating and hopefully launching sometime this year. Partnership has been extremely successful. The way we see it is very similar. Financial brokers like Robinhood, Schwab, Fidelity, Webull and so on. What they do is they list products that are exchange traded, whether it's stocks or commodities or options, even crypto now more recently. One of the markets our exchange traded today, really, the fastest growing one and the most exciting one is prediction markets because the markets are listed on Kalshi. As a regulated exchange, we no different than New York Stock Exchange or CME, and we over time, are going to put more and more of our prediction markets next to stocks and options in the brokerages so that people can really benefit from this diversity of offerings. Like, I can have my Tesla positions, for example, and I can hedge against Tesla earnings or against the Fed raising interest rates or other types of things that may going on in the world around me in one comprehensive portfolio. We're extremely excited about that direction where this can be heading. The partnership has been extremely successful. We expect and anticipate, quite a few launches in the coming quarters in terms of brokerages, and we're very excited about that part of the business.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Tarek Mansour, who's the CEO, co-founder of Kalshi. Thank you so much for your time and insight. Appreciate you joining us on Motley Fool Money.\n\nTarek Mansour: Thanks for having me, Ricky Mulvey, it's awesome. [MUSIC]\n\nRicky Mulvey: There's another major player in prediction markets. It's called Polymarket. This one runs on crypto and is currently not legal in the United States. Americans have to use a VPN if they want to play on the platform. After the break, New York Magazine features writer Jen Wieczner joins my colleague Mary Long to talk about how Polymarket achieved escape velocity in a crowded field and the chance it'll become legal in the US in the next few years.\n\nMary Long: Jen Wieczner is a features writer for New York Magazine. Her latest story is a profile on Shayne Coplan, the founder of the prediction market, Polymarket. Jen, to kick us off, I'm going to quote a quote from Coplan that you use in your story. He told you, \"The plan is to build something that didn't yet exist and needed to exist that I cared more about than anyone else.\" That's the end of the quote. This is interesting to me because tech titans like to sell us a lot of stuff that they say we need, but that maybe we don't actually need. Why does Coplan believe Polymarket needs to exist?\n\nJen Wieczner: It's interesting. I think a lot of people see Polymarket as a betting site, but he doesn't sees it as sort of an alternative source of truth, a potential alternative to news in a way to gain information that isn't readily available in the mainstream news landscape that we have. In other words, this is a way of sourcing information. You could call it crowd sourcing. There have been other attempts to harness the wisdom of the crowds, but nobody has really been able to get it to a mainstream scale where you can actually learn something about what the large part of the world is thinking this critical mass of people. That is what he set out to achieve. How could you tap into the wisdom of the crowds in a way that nobody had yet done, where you could actually glean some real insights and make predictions that were better than pundits or what you would see on TV or hear from the news.\n\nMary Long: Interestingly, and perhaps importantly, too, Polymarket called the election. Post that win, Coplan posted on X that Polymarket single handedly called the election for anything else. The global truth machine is here powered by the people. This wisdom of the crowds approach is interesting to me. But when I read that, I think, Okay, yes, Polymarket got the election, and I don't want to downplay that. I think there's something compelling about the idea that when you're using prediction markets, you're not betting against the house, you're just putting money on whatever you think the outcome will be. But I'm skeptical if that actually makes it a verifiable truth teller. Is there a running track record of the percentage of bets made on Polymarket, the final outcome that is predicted by the crowds? Then what percentage of those predictions actually turn out to be correct? If it's pitched by Shane as this is the truth, is there a running tab of how often they are actually right?\n\nJen Wieczner: I have not seen one, like a report card for prediction markets. That would be really useful. I do know that on the ones that really mattered, you know, would Biden drop out of the race huge. Would Sam Altman return as CEO of Open AI after they tried to oust him and who would win the election? They have a very good track record. As do some of the other leading prediction markets such as Kalshi, but Polymarket has kind of made themselves into the gold standard for most things. Notably, everybody got wrong that Beyonce was going to be at the DNC, including Polymarket, which I think is a notable of a funny one of one where they did not get right. But they were still even people who were close to the situation thought that Beyonce was coming, so I give them a little bit of a pass there. But I wish there was something like you're describing.\n\nMary Long: Who is actually on this platform? Because when I think about it, the image that comes to my mind is, OK, it's mostly regular people, and they're making miscellaneous bets on everything from who wins the presidential election? Will Beyonce be at the Super Bowl to whether Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are gonna get a divorce this year. Is there institutional money playing too, or is that, Hey, it's mostly Normis for lack of a better word? Is that pretty accurate?\n\nJen Wieczner: No, I think probably a large part is, you know, these professional traders, Wall Street types, hedge fund managers. I mean, we even saw the so called French whale, who made a big bet on Donald Trump is an institutional investor. There's a lot of hedge funds that are actually using Polymarket to potentially hedge their own bets as they've put a bet in the stock market that's based on some prediction about something geopolitical or macroeconomic, and they want to hedge that by also putting money on Polymarket, which I think is an interesting trend. I would say, as I talk to people, I hear a lot of people in finance in crypto who are really excited about this. Of course, there's people like me and others who just want to bet on the Oscar's. I do think most of the money is coming from that professional institutional side.\n\nMary Long: In your conversations with Shane, does the fact that so much of this money is seemingly coming from the institutional side, does that corrupt at all in his mind, this wisdom of the crowd, this democratization of truth concept that he seems really excited about?\n\nJen Wieczner: Yeah, so I should be clear. I don't know 100% that it's coming from the institution. That's my sense based on who I've been talking to. But I don't think in his mind that it corrupts it. I think, Heath sees this as a platform for everyone, the way that Amazon is a store for everyone. But he has talked about potentially the future business models and how Polymarket which doesn't currently make any money could eventually gather revenue by saying charging hedge funds a fee to list their own markets. And so I think they see this as one avenue, but they wouldn't want to we wouldn't want to limit it to only, you know, professionals.\n\nMary Long: Thanks for mentioning that Polymarket does not actually make any money at the moment. That was fascinating to me and reading your piece. For those less familiar, Polymarket was the most downloaded free news app on the Apple store this fall, and processed more than $3 billion on the presidential election alone. Despite that, as you write, it's still in world Eating expansionary mode. It does not collect fees. It does not actually make any money at the moment. Do you have a sense of when that might change? You mentioned, Okay, maybe they would turn to hedge funds and not charge the individual person that's going on in betting. But do you have a sense of what the actual business plan might be moving forward?\n\nJen Wieczner: That's a very good question. Shane was strangely unconcerned about it when I spoke with him. He's not in a rush to make money, I'll put it that way. He really wants to gain growth and mainstream audience and get as many millions of people using Polymarket to make it the most accurate source of predictions before they actually start charging. They could charge everybody a small transaction fee. I feel like he sees it as an easy change to make. When the time comes, you flip a switch. Suddenly, everybody's getting charged a small cut. You charge hedge funds a little bit more, maybe to list their own markets. But basically, you're saying when there is money flowing through, the more money that you have that people are wagering on their own predictions, the easier it's going to be for the business to actually make money just because there's so much money in the ecosystem.\n\nMary Long: Joey Krug was the founder of a blockchain based backed prediction market that's now since shut down, but he was an early investor in Polymarket. You write in your story that Krug was skeptical of Shane's pitches at first. In fact, he told Shane that prediction markets are one of the hardest types of start ups to build. There are dozens of them, and none of them hit escape velocity. Today, 90% of all prediction market activity happens on Polymarket. It seems to me like it has hit escape velocity. What's the story of how exactly it got there?\n\nJen Wieczner: I asked a lot of people this question, and what everyone pointed to was just Shane's own determination. He was so determined that he was going to make this work working around the clock. Tweeting sending every single thing he put on Twitter or X to all of his investors to try to gain traction, asking them to make bets, making it happen. I think that's part of it. Another part of it is just branding. They've been made themselves the go to prediction market. They're also available to the whole world rather than just limited to the US as others have been. Then I think they just made it fun. It's very easy to use, even though it's based on crypto, which allows this ease of use, they're not doing some of the know your customer regulatory hurdles that some other platforms do, which allows you to get on and put your money to work very quickly and if you're in the US, you do have to use a VPN. But I think those few decisions and just combined with Shane's own persistency. He's just so passionate about that, and I think you need all those ingredients together.\n\nMary Long: You mentioned that if you're in the US, you do need to use a VPN to use Polymarket. This is important to note, and it's an essential piece of your article because while Polymarket has seen massive success, it is an illegal operation in the United States and in France and Singapore and Thailand and Belgium. This is because prediction markets are considered evens contracts under US law, so they need to be regulated by the CFTC so that companies that want to offer such contracts have to apply for permission to do that. Polymarkets not done that. Again, your story opens with an arrest of Shane, raided by the FBI in his house. Polymarket hasn't filed for this license. Why? What is stopping it from doing that? You mentioned regulatory hurdles. That seems like yes, a hurdle, but a smart one to jump over.\n\nJen Wieczner: I would agree that that is the most obvious path. I think what happened was when they first started out, they just skipped ahead to it. He was young. He wanted to put this online as fast as possible and didn't bother to check the laws and go through those regulatory hurdles upfront thinking that if I just build something, if I build something that's great and then I make it popular and people will love it, then it will all just work out that people will welcome this. That's not exactly what happened, especially under the Biden administration. Prediction markets were very taboo and you have the CFTC cracking down on unregulated platforms like this. Very early on within months of their launch, really, they're dealing with an investigation from the CFTC that they eventually have to pay a pretty big fine for, especially for a young start-up. With that settlement, they basically agreed to not offer to US customers.\n\nThat closed off that path for the time being and now I think that they are likely going to reconsider that, especially under the Trump administration, which is not just friendlier to crypto, but much more friendly to prediction markets as it appears so far. Trump could potentially just give them a hall pass, write an executive order. All prediction markets are illegal now, something like that, which would give them even faster shortcut, or they're going to have to work with their lawyers of whom they have a lot and find a regulatory path, whether it's through that application or, you know, kind of trying to overturn the CFTC settlement.\n\nMary Long: A key question that you raise is, like, whether or not this illegality even matters, as you mentioned Trump could give them a hall pass. You've been in this story for a while now. Do you want to take a 50 50 bet on how this plays out over the next 12 months? Do you have a prediction will Polymarket become legal in the US, or will they just keep moving forward as is?\n\nJen Wieczner: I do and I asked all of my sources this question, as well, and by and large, everyone gave it above a 50% chance that they would become legal in the next year or two. I think, the next year to 18 months, I have a feeling they will be legal. As part of the story, actually went on, used a VPN and illegally traded on Polymarket very, very small amount. But it doesn't feel meaningfully different to me than trading on Robinhood where you can also buy extremely risky stocks or anything I'm policing bets on who's going to win the Oscars? Who's gonna win the Super Bowl? You know, what's Trump going to do next? What's Elon Musk going to write on X or how many times is he going to post? It's silly things that, sure, if you want to lose your money that way, like I don't really see the harm in doing it. You could make money. But I don't really see a reason for it to be less legal than all the other forms of risky but legal trading that we already have.\n\nMary Long: Yeah, fair point, for sure. Another prediction market that does exist legally in the US is Kalshi. They exist without crypto, though. Whereas Polymarket you can solely use crypto to make bets there. What is the fascination with crypto? I know Shane has a long history with ethereum, but why limit yourself to just crypto? Why do they like to stay in that lane?\n\nJen Wieczner: I think they've built their whole system on top of Blockchain, which allows for these bets to settle on the blockchain, so they're using actually smart contracts, which gives in some ways the outcomes of these bets an objective referee, if that makes sense, where it's not so subjective, they've set the rules and these smart contracts are just going to settle the way that they are. All the bets are also placed in crypto because it allows people this anonymity that then makes them more likely or less afraid of betting on their beliefs because they can do it without fear of people finding this out. Some of the other platforms have similar formats. But I think, this was a way to open it up to the world very quickly, and skirt the regulations that also come with using dollars. Polymarkets not actually handling any of the money because it's all just settled through smart contracts, so they don't actually have to be the bank and Shane, it speaks to his strengths as well because he was early in aim and became very passionate about crypto, while he was basically still in high school.\n\nMary Long: You paint this picture of Shane early in his 20s. It's around 2016, and at that time, he's running pretty deep in the crypto crowd. But at some point through that, he grows relatively disillusioned with that scene. You write that he became unimpressed with what he calls the Bildeba lineup of copycat start-ups and crypto scams. That's his wording, scams. You spend a lot of time with him. How now does he distinguish between the scummy side of crypto and what he might deem to be the more righteous side of it?\n\nJen Wieczner: Yeah, so one of the most ironic parts about Shane is that despite running a platform that's technically illegal and having had to deal with the regulatory consequences of that, he sees himself as the good guy, as the person who's built a platform that should be legal, that's useful, that's popular, that people really love, and he's providing an important service in the landscape of news and information. Whereas in the past, he saw people who were basically less hardworking than himself take a lot of money but not follow through on actually building it or build a wonky platform that wasn't that great or wasn't good enough to gain mainstream attention. What they built didn't match up to what they promised. Shane, who talks a huge game, like this guy, his ambitions are off the charts. He really believes that he's going to make it happen, and he swears he's not going to stop until he does.\n\nI think he's raised a large amount of venture capital, and he just believes in himself to the point where, I'm going to do this. I'm going to build this until it's legal. It's going to be something that's as useful as the other technology that we rely upon. I mean, he's a big fan of Uber and Apple and these Meta on Facebook. He's admired these CEOs and entrepreneurs for a long time, and he really sees himself as one of those big tech giants as opposed to these anonymous crypto scammers who don't even use their real name, even as they're raising money and trying to build stuff. He puts himself in a different category.\n\nRicky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Mike Lawler of New York, who held a town hall Sunday night in which he prescreened audience members to ensure they lived in his district, similar to what his Republican colleague Byron Donalds did in Florida last week.\n\nYet, despite Lawler’s efforts to keep out the supposed outside agitators whom Republicans have baselessly claimed are being paid by Democrats to incite scenes to embarrass GOP lawmakers, the prescreened attendees still took Lawler to task for not standing up to his party’s leader.\n\n“What are you doing to stand in opposition to this administration, and what specifically are you doing that warrants the label ‘moderate’?” one constituent asked Lawler after laying out the ways Trump is hurting Americans, such as putting tariffs on all imports and deporting a 2-year-old American citizen with cancer.\n\n“My record speaks for itself,” Lawler replied, eliciting gasps and even laughter from the crowd. “I have been rated the fourth-most bipartisan for a reason, which is the very simple fact that, unlike many of my colleagues, I actually do work across the aisle.”\n\nLawler also got booed when he was defending Trump’s tariffs, with constituents chanting “blah, blah, blah” and drowning out his answer.\n\nAnd in perhaps his most absurd answer, Lawler told voters not to believe that he’d vote to cut Medicaid, even though he voted earlier this month for the GOP budget blueprint that would require hundreds of billions in cuts to the lifesaving program that provides insurance to roughly 72 million Americans a year.\n\n“When it comes to Medicaid, I have been very clear: I am not cutting benefits for any eligible recipient,” Lawler said, according to The New York Times, adding of the budget he voted for, “That is as good as the paper it’s written on.”\n\nLawler, for his part, is one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the House.\n\nHe's one of just three House Republicans who represent districts that Democrat Kamala Harris won at the presidential level. Harris received 49.9% of the vote in Lawler’s district, while Trump got 49.3%, according to data compiled by The Downballot.\n\nLawler is also mulling a bid for governor of New York, which may be an even tougher climb in a blue state where Trump is deeply unpopular. According to Civiqs’ tracking poll, just 34% of voters in New York approve of the job Trump is doing as president, as opposed to 62% who disapprove.\n\nBecause of his district’s partisanship, it’s not surprising that Lawler would face blowback.\n\nHowever, GOP lawmakers are being met with enraged voters even in districts and states Trump won by large margins.\n\nIt’s a warning sign for Republicans, who will be facing strong headwinds in the 2026 midterm elections if Trump’s approval rating remains as abysmal as it is now. Even more concerning for Republicans is that Trump’s approval is this low before the impact of his tariffs have really hit voters, with experts warning that empty shelves and skyrocketing prices are expected to hit in May and June. \n\nEarly polling shows Democrats with an advantage on the generic congressional ballot, which asks voters which party they'd like to see control Congress. \n\nA Fox News poll released Friday found that Democrats hold a lead on the generic congressional ballot by 7 percentage points—a large margin that suggests a sizable Democratic victory in the midterms. The poll found that 49% of registered voters said they'd vote for a Democrat for Congress, while 42% said they'd vote for a Republican. \n\nTo put that in perspective, in 2018, when Democrats won control of the House, the final generic-ballot average had Democrats up by 7.3 points, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\n\"If the House GOP is under any illusions that Donald Trump's fall in the polls won't bring them down as well—well, they are living on fantasy island,” CNN polling analyst Harry Enten said, adding in a post on X, “Polls look like April ‘05 & '17, prior to big Dem midterm gains.”","summary":"In what is now a familiar scene, yet another GOP lawmaker got mercilessly booed and jeered by their own constituents at a town hall, facing a barrage of questions that all boiled down to one central theme: Why won’t Republicans stand up to President Donald Trump?\n\n\n\nThe latest victim to town hall rage was Republican Rep.

She wore sweats and went makeup-free for the casual gab session, which turned out to be an excellent idea when her emotions got the best of her as she discussed parenting.\n\n“I really want to be good at it,” the royal shared about being a mom to Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3.\n\nMarkle grew visibly upset when telling Kern Lima that she wanted to make sure Archie and Lilibet knew that “no one has ever loved someone more than the way our mom loved us.” She also revealed the nightly task she gave herself to make sure that happens.\n\nMarkle shared that one of her “mom friends” set up “secret emails” for their kids to send them photos of their childhood and personalized letters that they can access when they’re older.\n\nShe shared that the sentiment inspired her to do the same for Archie and Lilibet.\n\n“I thought it was such a great time capsule to create for them,” Markle said, “and so I created for the kids these email addresses … that I will give them at some point.”\n\nThe mom of two shared: “Before I go to bed, every night, I email them,” adding those conversations include pictures “you’re not going to frame” and things like their report cards and cherished memories.\n\nRevealing she plans to give Archie and Lilibet access to the emails “maybe when they’re 16, maybe when they’re 18,” Markle said she hopes the gesture ensures that her kids know “she has loved us so much.” \n\nHowever, a crying Markle made it clear that “it’s not about the grandeur of a gesture” but moments that show her children “I see you, I’m nurturing you.”\n\n“I’m just so proud of them,” the “Suits” actress continued. “They’re just so great.”\n\nWhile praising her kids, Markle acknowledged her rush of emotions, saying, “This is why it’s so nice to not have makeup on.”\n\nHer emotional podcast interview comes on the heels of her releasing never-before-seen images of Archie and Lilibet, which showed off their matching fiery red hair as they played outside of their home in Montecito, California. \n\nHours before, she debuted her daughter’s American accent in a video she shared on social media. \n\nHowever, the children weren’t her only talking point during the podcast. The duchess also addressed the rumors about a possible future in politics. \n\nWhen Kern Lima asked Markle, “Would you ever run for office?” the latter didn’t mince her words.\n\n“No,” she replied, adding, “Never. Oh, God.\n\n“I mean, you could say, ‘Never say never.’ No, I’m not interested in that. No,” Markle said.\n\nShe made history when she voted in the 2020 US presidential election, making her the first member of the modern British royal family to do so.\n\nAt the time, Markle shared she was “so excited” to see Kamala Harris, a woman of color, being represented as the then-vice presidential nominee.","summary":"The duchess couldn't hold back her tears while discussing her children and motherhood.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/28/entertainment/meghan-markle-cries-over-sweet-gift-shell-give-archie-and-lili-at-18/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103483073.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-28 16:45:18","author":"Whitney Vasquez","authors":["Whitney Vasquez"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.145},{"id":315718130,"title":"Illinois governor fuels 2028 talk with fiery speech blasting Trump and Musk: ‘It’s time to fight, everywhere, all at once’","text":"Democrats are looking for a fighter. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is determined to be one.\n\nWill others in his party take notice?\n\nThe governor of the state last represented in the White House by Barack Obama, Pritzker’s term is set to expire January of 2027, just a few months before candidates are likely to begin announcing their plans to run in the respective party primaries. He is not term limited, having won re-election in 2022 and with no restrictions on a third term in the state constitution.\n\nAnd so it appears that the governor is laying his groundwork for a potential presidential bid already. He headlined a Democratic Party event in the early primary state of New Hampshire on Sunday and delivered remarks that were simultaneously a rebuke of the White House and a war cry for his base.\n\n “It’s time to fight, everywhere, all at once,” Pritzker told the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner in Manchester.\n\n“Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” he sternly added, according to NBC News.\n\nIn his remarks, Pritzker blamed his party’s defeat in November on voter mistrust in party leadership. Democrats, he argued, do not believe that their own leaders’ actions match the urgency of the moment, or their own rhetoric.\n\n“Voters didn’t turn out for Democrats last November not because they don’t want us to fight for our values, but because they think we don’t want to fight for our values,” said Pritzker.\n\nHe also spoke with NBC News demanding that the next Democratic administration vow accountability for members of the Trump administration accused of breaking the law or violating the Constitution.\n\n“We’re going to hold people responsible. They can’t just get away with what they’re doing right now. Anybody that’s breaking the law, anybody that’s breaching the Constitution as a regular matter of the way they run their offices, those people all should be investigated,” Pritzker said. \n\nLast year’s speaker at the dinner was Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz, who at the time was raising his own national profile but was not yet under consideration for the spotlight — that elevation to prominence would take place months later, with the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the race. Now, Kamala Harris’s old running mate is just one of several Democrats, including Harris herself, under consideration as possible 2028 contenders. The former vice president is also weighing a run for governor of California.\n\nThe current governor of California, Gavin Newsom, is another one of those Democrats seen as potential 2028 fodder. But unlike his fellow Californian, Newsom seemed to be in Pritzker’s crosshairs over Newsom’s assertion that the political battle over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a distraction for the Democratic Party. The federal government continued into this week to refuse to order his return to the United States after handing him over to the government of El Salvador. Democrats including Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who represents Garcia’s home state and met with him under Salvadoran supervision during a visit this month, have demanded his return to the US.\n\nHe also aimed a clearer shot across Newsom’s bow: \"What I find ironic about the current conversation surrounding our party is that the voices flocking to podcasts and cable news shows to admonish fellow Democrats for not caring enough about the struggles of working families are the same ones who, when it comes to relieving the struggles of real people, have been timid, not bold.\"\n\nNewsom launched his own podcast in late February.\n\nPritzker singled out the Trump administration’s deportation program — and especially the government’s use of El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison to house Venezuelans and others accused of being gang members — in his speech.\n\n“Let’s start with something that should be easy to say: It’s wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law,” said the governor.\n\nHis remarks are just the latest example of comparatively younger leaders in the Democratic Party attempting to capture the energy and desire for action which voters have voiced at town hall-style events around the country since January, when Donald Trump took office and his DOGE cuts, led by Elon Musk, began at a rapid pace.\n\nPritzker, who alleged that DOGE may have broken privacy laws by accessing sensitive data at the Social Security Administration and other agencies, spoke to NBC News the same day that Senator Bernie Sanders spoke to NBC’s Meet the Press about his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, which has turned out tens of thousands of Americans over the past month. \n\nSanders will be in Pennsylvania next week continuing that tour; other Democrats in the northeastern battleground state that flipped for Trump last year have taken to hosting “empty chair” town halls in Republican districts as they respond to the same groundswell of voter anger against DOGE cuts.\n\nHarris is set to give her own speech touching on the actions of Trump’s second administration on Wednesday — her first such address since her defeat in November.","summary":"‘Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,’ vows JB Pritzker as he urges Democrats to mobilize","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/illinois-pritzker-trump-musk-2028-b2740971.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/13/GettyImages-2205736588.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Kn9pQTZ1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-28 16:43:57","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":315732716,"title":"Donald Trump is threatening the press because he doesn't like his poll numbers.

In a Truth Social post, he says the news companies that published them should be investigated for \"election fraud.\"This is the kind of thing Trump has said many times. Up until recently, it was easy to ignore. After all, it's certainly not fraud to publish a poll someone doesn't like.Right?Except of course things are different now: Donald Trump is already suing The Des Moines Register, its owner Gannett, and pollster Ann Selzer for publishing a poll he didn't like during the 2024 election.Trump filed that suit after he'd won the election last year, but before he was sworn in as president in January. And since Trump's inauguration, Brendan Carr, Trump's choice to head the Federal Communications Commission, has announced probes into Disney and Comcast over their use of diversity, equity, and inclusion practices.Carr has also opened an inquiry into an interview that ran on Paramount/CBS' \"60 Minutes\" with Kamala Harris last year. That's theoretically separate, but quite parallel, to a lawsuit Trump filed in 2024 about the same interview. That story got new attention last week when Bill Owens, the top producer at \"60 Minutes,\" said he was stepping down because he'd lost his editorial independence. Subsequent reports said Paramount owner Shari Redstone, who wants to sell her company to Larry and David Ellison, has been weighing in on programming at the show and CBS News in general.So. On the one hand, you'd be excused for ignoring a social media post from a president who says things on social media and elsewhere that he may not actually mean — or may mean at one point but then decide that he doesn't mean, after all. (Trump now says that his promise to solve the war between Russia and Ukraine on his first day in office — something he said dozens of times in 2024 and 2023 — was actually made \"in jest\".)You might also point out that even if Trump is serious, it's not clear which federal agency or official could carry out his wishes. While Carr theoretically gets to weigh in on the likes of Comcast and Paramount because they own broadcast licenses, the FCC doesn't have any oversight of the Times or the Post. (I've asked both Carr and the White House for comment.)But one thing we are learning about 2025 is that things Trump writes or says — even if they are illogical or impossible — sometimes get turned into action, anyway.If I'm running a media organization — or simply someone who thinks the federal government shouldn't be threatening media organizations because it doesn't like what they publish — I wouldn't brush this off completely.","summary":"Donald Trump says The New York Times and others should be investigated for \"election fraud\" after publishing unflattering polls.

The hotel is also known as the home to the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges.\n\nThe witness said they also saw Owens head outside to the hotel’s seasonal Jean-Georges hot dog stand — where tube steaks go for six bucks and are served with Kimchi relish and other condiments.\n\nWe hear McMahon was also spotted at the Mark having drinks with CBS News staffers a day earlier after Owens’ exit was announced. An insider said the work drinks came after a long day at the network.\n\nOwens said he is leaving due to a loss of journalistic independence, as CBS parent company Paramount looks to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump.\n\nOwens started his career at CBS as an intern back in 1988, and took over “60 Minutes” in 2019. \n\nMcMahon praised Owens in a memo, telling staffers: “Standing behind what he stood for was an easy decision for me, and I never took for granted that he did the same for me.” \n\nOn Sunday night, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley launched an on-air attack on CBS’ parent company, alleging Paramount interfered with the program’s coverage, The Post reported.\n\nThe anchor began what appeared to be a simple tribute to Owens, but then took aim at Paramount.\n\n“Bill resigned Tuesday — it was hard on him and hard on us,” Pelley said in his remarks on the show. “But he did it for us, and you,” he told viewers.\n\nPelley then surprisingly added: “Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger … Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.” He added that while “none of our stories have been blocked,” Owens had “felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”\n\n“No one here is happy about it.

Former Thiel employees Jim O’Neill and Michael Kratsios are Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, respectively.\n\nSome 55% of Palantir’s 2024 revenues come from government customers, but its fate on the market has been far rosier than other public companies that rely heavily on government revenues. Shares of defense contracting giants General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and RTX have essentially been flat during Trump’s second presidency, with Lockheed Martin’s 3% drop and RTX’s 3% advance leading the bunch. The stocks of federal government consultancies Accenture and Booz Allen Hamilton are down more than 10% apiece since Trump took office.\n\nKey Background\n\nPalantir makes AI-powered software solutions used in predictive analytics for large data sets, ranging from public health surveillance to military drone intelligence. Four of Palantir’s five cofounders are billionaires in Stephen Cohen, Alexander Karp, Joe Lonsdale and Thiel. Lonsdale left the company in 2009, while Cohen, Karp and Thiel are all still intimately involved in Palantir’s operations, taking up three positions on the company’s seven-person board of directors, with Cohen serving as the company’s president, Karp as CEO and Thiel as chairman of the board. Cohen retains a relatively low public profile and has not made a political donation since 2017, according to OpenSecrets, and Karp supported Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, but Lonsdale and Thiel are among the big tech titans most vocal in Silicon Valley’s shift to the political right. Lonsdale celebrated Trump’s November win by posting to social media “Daddy’s home.”\n\nPalantir Under Fire For New Ice Contract\n\nNo stranger to controversy, Palantir came under fire this month for a new $30 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a program known as “ImmigrationOS” assisting the agency in deportations, according to Wired. Palantir is “the company building the infrastructure of the police state,” Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham wrote this month in response to the contract.\n\nThese Are The Best Performing S&p Stocks During Trump’s First 100 Days\n\nPhilip Morris\n\nDollar General\n\nTake-Two Interactive\n\nThese Are The Worst Performing Stocks During Trump’s First 100 Days\n\nDeckers Outdoor\n\nZebra Technologies\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line\n\nWest Pharmaceuticals\n\nArista Networks\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesHow Palantir Became The S&P’s Most Expensive Stock—And Earned CEO Alex Karp A Spot On The Forbes 400By Phoebe Liu\nForbesHow A 'Deviant' Philosopher Built Palantir, A CIA-Funded Data-Mining JuggernautBy Andy Greenberg\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

That came from a Washington Post poll, which, like some others, found Trump at 42% approval among registered voters. But the Washington Post also released a finding showing Trump at 39% among all adults, including those who don’t care enough to vote even in hotly contested elections.\n\nThirty-nine percent! That’s the headline! To reach this result, the Washington Post pollsters surveyed 848 people who said they voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, and then 842 people who said they voted for Trump, and then 729 people who said they did not vote. Now, it seems odd to survey more people who voted for Harris than Trump, because you might recall that Trump received more votes than Harris. Presumably, the Washington Post then adjusted the totals to reflect the actual 2024 results. But then there is turnout — in 2024, it was 64%, the second-highest of any presidential election ever. People who did not vote, or even register to vote, really did not give a damn about the election. The Washington Post included a lot of them in the 39% mark that has gotten the commentators so excited.\n\nBut put aside arguments over specific polls. There’s no doubt that Trump’s job approval number has declined over the first 100 days. Back in January, after a week in office, Trump’s approval stood at 50.5% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Now, it’s at 45.3% in the same average, for a decline of about 5 points. \n\nThat is a bigger decline than most, but it’s also fair to say Trump’s has been a bigger 100 days than most. And you should also factor in that Trump has done some genuinely controversial things in that period and that media coverage of his presidency so far has been relentlessly negative and, in many cases, hostile. Indeed, one time-honored media practice, honed to perfection with Trump, is to bury a political figure in negative coverage and then take a poll finding — surprise! — that his job approval has fallen.\n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to step aside from all that. Are there any other measures of Trump’s performance than job approval numbers? One good place to look is what pollsters call the right-track-wrong-track question. Basically, it is, do you think the country is heading in the right direction today, or is it headed in the wrong direction?\n\nIf you look at the RealClearPolitics average of the direction-of-the-country question for the last year, you’ll see that it looks like a funnel. During the final months of Joe Biden’s presidency, between 65% and 70% of poll respondents said the country was going in the wrong direction, and between 25% and 30% said the country was going in the right direction. \n\nThen, when Trump took office, the funnel dramatically narrowed. The number of people who said the country is going in the wrong direction dropped to about 50%, while the number who said it was going in the right direction shot up to about 40%. Right now, the RealClearPolitics average numbers are 51.1% wrong direction and 40.0% right direction. \n\nWhat does that mean? First of all, remember that a majority of the country almost always says the country is going in the wrong direction. That’s just the way it is. So when even 40% say it is going in the right direction, that’s pretty good. “If that doesn’t seem like a lot, the last time it cracked 40%, you’ve got to go back to 2012,” MSNBC analyst Steve Kornacki said in March, when an NBC poll showed 44% saying the country was going in the right direction. \n\nThere are a few more results that suggest where things stand with voters. For all its problems, the Washington Post poll did ask some good questions, among them: “Overall, who do you trust to do a better job handling the country’s main problems — Trump or the Democrats in Congress?” Among registered voters, 40% said Trump, while 32% said Democrats in Congress. The Washington Post also asked, “Do you think Trump is in touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today, or is he out of touch?” Again among registered voters, 42% said Trump was in touch. When the Washington Post asked the same question about the Democratic Party, 29% said Democrats were in touch. (The number for the Republican Party was 38%.)\n\nSo, where do things stand? Obviously, Trump is less popular now than he was 100 days ago. The biggest factor in that is his still-evolving tariff policy, which has created a lot of — that dread word — uncertainty across the economic spectrum. The stock market has reacted badly, almost hysterically, so the 60-plus percent of Americans who own stocks in some form are not happy with that. Much of the rest of tariff mania is prospective — that is, it is angst over changes that are predicted to come if Trump does A, or does B, or does C. It hasn’t actually happened yet — prices haven’t shot up and the shelves aren’t empty — but all the talk has put people in a bad mood.\n\nFinally, in one specific area, Trump has been a smashing success, and that is in stopping the massive flow of illegal border crossers into the United States. Poll after poll in the run-up to the 2024 election showed that the border disaster was among the top two or three issues of the campaign. And just like that, Trump fixed the problem. Illegal crossings have now virtually disappeared. In his March 4 address to Congress, Trump said, “The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. ‘We must have legislation to secure the border.’ But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.” When he said that, he was telling the truth.\n\nHas any other president solved one of the nation’s top problems, as identified by voters in the campaign, in literally his first weeks in office? If it has happened, it’s pretty rare.\n\nSo, go back to the headlines — “HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR,” “LOWEST 100-DAY SCORE IN 80 YEARS!,” “39% APPROVAL.” Do they accurately convey Trump’s presidency so far? Let’s just say they don’t tell the whole story.","summary":"HOW TO MEASURE TRUMP&#8217;S 100 DAYS? Tomorrow marks the end of President Donald Trump&#8217;s first 100 days in office.
