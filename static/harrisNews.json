But the awardees weren’t announced until August 2024 and Citibank not brought in until September — after Biden’s disastrous June debate performance led him to withdraw from re-election in July, making a very different race with Kamala Harris the Democratic nominee.\n\nZeldin’s team is looking into whether former EPA employees are working at any of the grantees, which include the Opportunity Finance Network (receiving $2.29 billion), where Vice President Laura Silverman says she brings “economic, financial, and social justice to communities,” and the Native CDFI Network ($400 million), which has featured Sen. Elizabeth Warren as a speaker. Power Forward Communities, a $2 billion recipient, has no list of employees on its website — but does have openings for government-affairs VP, communications VP and special assistant. \n\nThe others: Climate United Fund (which got the biggest grant, nearly $7 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Inclusiv ($1.87 billion), Justice Climate Fund ($940 million) and Appalachian Community Capital ($500 million).\n\nHere Lee Zeldin tells The Post’s Kelly Jane Torrance why it was “a high priority for me and my great team to get to the bottom of these questions as quickly as possible.”\n\nThis was on our radar during the transition, when the video was posted online at the beginning of December of the Biden EPA political appointee admitting on camera they were “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.”\n\nTo us, that very obviously meant the “gold bars” were tax dollars and “off the Titanic” meant they were wasting it — and they knew it.\n\nThat was causing a lot of sirens to go off. It was a frequent topic of conversation in my meetings with senators — we spoke about accountability of funding during my confirmation hearing. I committed during my hearing to making this a top priority as soon as I got in, and our team has been planning for what has been months now to be able to hit the ground running and jump all over this urgent situation the moment we came into office. \n\nSo this was an all-in, top-priority effort that has instantly been yielding very important results for the taxpayers — and we’re just getting started.\n\nThis was a deliberate rush job meant to obligate all this funding with less oversight. In that video, the Biden EPA political appointee was talking multiple times about “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and at one point also talks about how they are giving out billions of dollars to these recipient NGOs with an eye towards getting themselves jobs at them — which added a whole other layer of massive concern.\n\nAs they were throwing gold bars off the Titanic, this $20 billion pot was sent to a financial institution outside government, which was collecting interest. \n\nThe $20 billion only goes to eight entities, and we want to know if any of those eight entities have any recently employed Biden administration officials and EPA employees.\n\nBut that’s just the start of the questions, not the end of it. We also want to know the same question as it relates to all the ultimate recipients of all the funding that was rushed out the door pre-inauguration. That’s where the biggest flag was raised in the video.\n\nEvery grant is equal. We’re doing a review of everything and reviewing all the contractual agreements.\n\nAnd we’re going to explore every option that’s available to us as it relates to every dollar the bank currently has: We are going to seek it to be returned to the EPA, and the first step is establishing control of those funds.\n\nBut we’re going to walk and chew gum and continue our review — and in many, many other respects — simultaneously.\n\nAs far as exact dollar amounts of each of the eight pots, we want to know not just how much has been sent but also how much has been obligated and how much is currently available and not yet obligated.\n\nThese questions highlight one of the concerns with the lack of oversight with this scheme — these questions should all be instantly available and handy for us to have the answers on. They’re not. \n\nAnd there are many, many other questions that we have that we are going to get answered.\n\nI want to highlight there’s zero evidence whatsoever of anything being done improperly by the bank. \n\nThis was an arrangement the EPA sought out, working with the Biden Treasury Department to park $20 billion outside of government and that deliberately resulted in less transparency, accountability and oversight. \n\nAnd I committed to Congress and the American people during my confirmation hearing that I would do everything in my power if confirmed to ensure there wasn’t any waste and abuse and I was going to get to the bottom of all of these funds. This is something that is a highest concern and priority for us.\n\nWe have very high confidence that this is just the tip of the iceberg.","summary":"A $20 billion Biden administration green-energy slush fund was collecting interest at a private bank and is being distributed without proper oversight, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin reveals in an exclusive interview.

Billions of dollars over the years have been spent on funding ridiculous programs. The list is long and disgusting to those of common sense. One also wonders how much of that money found its way into kick backs to the well-conected here in the states – you know, the deep state swamp cretins.\n\nFor example, $7.9 million was given to teach Sri-Lankan journalists to avoid binary-gendered language. One wonders how much of that made its way back into the pockets of American officials. Nothing that stupid could be real.\n\nHow about the expenditure of $70,000 to help produce a DEI musical in Ireland? That definitely sounds ripe for a few Venezuelans to be added to the Irish chorus line. And $20 million was spent on a Sesame Street production in Iraq. For far too long Iraqi kids have been denied that treat. As they all say, God bless America!\n\nOh, I almost forgot this one. Millions were spent to support the poppy fields in Afghanistan to help the Taliban produce heroin and then sell it to buy guns and ammo to kill the infidels.\n\nAccording to my research team, this wasteful corruption has been stopped just in time to bring to a halt other wasteful programs that were in the pipeline. They appear to be even be more ridiculous but in perfect alignment with the brain-dead Biden regime.\n\nJesus said that he would return when conditions on earth are similar to those that were in the days of Noah. That’s when the Nephilim were walking the earth corrupting the genetic makeup of mankind, and things were really crazy. Not quite as crazy, however, as Kamala Harris getting 74 million votes to have her fingertip put on the nuclear button.\n\nAccording to my vast research team, here are a couple of items that were about to be launched by USAID to add to the rubble when God levels the earth once more.\n\nMost of the woke world knows that Sen. Liz Warren is 1/1000 part Cherokee Native American Indian. If you look at her, it’s obvious that she has persecution written all over her minority abused face, right? Yet, she has overcome tremendous prejudice in her life as a Cherokee to achieve a prominent position in the U.S. Senate.\n\nLiz has always sought ways to save Mother Earth in the Cherokee Way. In a video produced by Pocahontas Warren, we are instructed how to stay warm in the winter and save the planet. The video teaches you how to slaughter a bison for food and warmth. You will learn how to produce 200 lbs of meat and build a carcass cavity for warmth in 20 strokes of the knife. The video would’ve been available under the title “Warren Whacks a Wigwam.”\n\nOne other discovery my team made is the huge exponential explosion of the trans movement with genetic engineering. We just discovered that years ago, the genetics of a worm wreaked havoc on God’s creation by being mingled with those of a snake. That genetic creation led to the birth of Adam Schiff.\n\nThere also was USAID money directed at what is called the Mayorkas Mutant. DOGE has fortunately stopped that atrocity just in time. Who knows what future horrors would’ve come from that genetic product? It definitely would have been monumental by mixing the Mayorkas Muck Y chromosome with a Nancy Pelosi Gag X genetic abomination. Unimaginable! \n\nIf the trans-species genetic movement funded by USAID is ever unleashed under a future swamp president, be on alert, Noah, and have your ark flameproof. This battle has been going on since Genesis 3, but this time, it’s going to end in fire.","summary":"The deep state swamp cretins have been busy via USAID","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/feds-funded-a-trans-species-genetic-movement/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/nancy-pelosi-20240611-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 23:53:56","author":"Nin Privitera","authors":["Nin Privitera"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":290287862,"title":"Trump Gifts Signed Copy Of His Book 'Our Journey Together' To PM Modi — IN PICS","text":"Live NowPremiumVideoReelsWeb StoriesPhoto GalleryPodcastMovie ReviewOpinion\n\nIFSC Code Finder\n\nPin Code Finder\n\nHome Loan EMI Calculator\n\nPersonal Loan EMI Calculator\n\nCar Loan EMI Calculator\n\nEducation Loan EMI Calculator\n\nAge calculator\n\nBMI Calculator\n\nPetrol Prices\n\nDiesel Prices\n\nGold Prices\n\nSilver Prices\n\nHomePhoto GalleryWorldTrump Gifts Signed Copy Of His Book 'Our Journey Together' To PM Modi — IN PICS\n\nTrump Gifts Signed Copy Of His Book 'Our Journey Together' To PM Modi — IN PICS\n\nPresident Donald Trump gifted PM Modi the book 'Out Journey Together', showing photos from 'Howdy Modi' and 'Namaste Trump' events.

Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview. The president has accused CBS of aiding his Democrat rival Vice President Kamala Harris through deceptive editing one month before they faced off in the presidential election. The saga began when Harris was widely mocked for a \"word salad\" answer she gave to \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker during a preview of the interview on \"Face the Nation,\" as CBS aired a more coherent answer to the same question during a primetime special. In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital, Trump’s legal team has requested \"all documents in CBS Interactive’s possession, custody, or control, wherever located, including documents in the possession of its representatives, attorneys, or other persons directly or indirectly retained by CBS Interactive, or anyone else acting on its behalf or otherwise subject to its control\" pertaining to the interview. FCC CHAIR CALLS CBS NEWS' CONDUCT ‘HARD TO EXPLAIN’ FOLLOWING RELEASE OF KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT The demand includes all communications between CBS and the FCC, The Biden administration, the Harris campaign and the DNC from September 22, 0224 through February 11, 2025. Trump’s legal team also asked for all communications about the interview involving \"60 Minutes\" executive editor Tanya Simon’s, executive producer Bill Owens, \"Face the Nation\" anchor Margaret Brennan or Whitaker, along with \"any documents containing communications about interviewing or potentially interviewing President Trump for the Election Special.\" Trump’s legal team has demanded \"any documents containing communications\" about the unedited exchange between CBS staffers and the Biden administration, Harris campaign and the DNC. The 27-page list of discovery demands also asks for all internal communications \"60 Minutes\" honchos had with editors, journalists and correspondents during the controversy, along with any communications with the Harris campaign. TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CBS EXPANDS AFTER RELEASE OF '60 MINUTES' TRANSCRIPT, ADDS PARAMOUNT AS DEFENDANT Any communications pertaining to the lawsuit between CBS and Paramount employees have also been requested, along with any communications about advertising or commercials during the programs that aired the Harris interview. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is also named and Trump’s legal team wants to see her interactions with \"60 Minutes\" employees, too. Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the former vice president from further backlash. The discovery request comes after Trump secured a legal victory earlier this week when a judge deemed CBS and Paramount’s motion to dismiss \"moot.\" CBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS STAFFERS UPSET OVER ‘60 MINUTES’ DRAMA, ADMIT KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW EDITS WERE AN ‘UNFORCED ERROR’ New FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript until the FCC got involved. Last week, Trump’s legal team led by attorneys Ed Paltzik and Dan Epstein amended the original lawsuit after the release of the unedited transcript and raw footage of its controversial \"60 Minutes\" interview. The lawsuit added CBS News' parent company, Paramount Global, as a defendant, citing how the \"60 Minutes\" election special was platformed on its Paramount+ streaming service. The lawsuit added Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, as a plaintiff and increased the damages claim to $20 billion. CBS parent company Paramount Global is reportedly considering settling the suit ahead of a planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump's FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction. Redstone is reportedly in favor of settling with the president. The case against CBS and Paramount Global is one of the many legal fronts, criminal and civil, being coordinated by Trump’s Senior Counsel Boris Epshteyn.

I assume that's what Adam McKay is doing, but it's not how we choose what we're going to work on next.\"\n\nAlthough Rogen has long been outspoken with his left-leaning views – including once branding Texas Senator Ted Cruz a \"fascist piece of s---\" during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2021 – the actor remained surprisingly optimistic as he explained he still has hope for the country despite current tension and division.He said: \"I personally try not to go too dark on all of it and think like, 'Oh, are we on the precipice of global societal collapse?' Since the end of the Civil War, America's remained a very divided country in a lot of ways.\" \n\nRogen explained Trump's shocking victory was merely the result of the country's natural tendency to \"ebb and flow\" with the times.The Superbad star explained: \"People get sick of seeing f-----g hippies doing acid and f-----g on their lawns, and they're like, Let's f------g clean up these streets a little bit. And then people get sick of seeing f-----g dorks cleaning up the streets and they go back the other way.\" \n\nRogen added: \"That's not to say it doesn’t have very real and troubling ramifications on many people's lives, but I try to maintain hope that the ball will roll onwards, even though it might be wobbling back and forth.\"The star went on to liken the \"ebb and flow\" of the country's political climate to cinematic themes. \n\nHe explained: \"I think movies are a good indicator of the culture. \n\n\"Like, there was the westerns era, and then it got more thoughtful, movies like Apocalypse Now and Platoon that critiqued the Vietnam War.

How about that?\n\n'Because that's more plausible. However, I will confess, like I said, I have no desire to do this, but assuming that I'm well off, that I have lots of money, and money is no longer a concern, if the American people came to me and looked at me and said \"Yo, man, we want you to run for office\", and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I'm not gonna lie.

The executive order Trump signed Thursday instructed the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to develop new proposed tariff levels that take into account the tariffs charged by other countries to import American goods, as well as industrial subsidies, value-added taxes, and other economic policies that Trump views as unfair. It will take weeks (and perhaps longer) for the new tariffs to be calculated and rolled out, and the changes may be implemented on a country-by-country basis, according to Megan Cassella, a reporter for CNBC.\n\nRegardless of how it shakes out, it seems like Americans will be facing a massive tax increase. \"White House officials claim that the new policy could yield up to roughly $1 trillion in new annual revenue,\" the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nThat number seems a bit absurd. America imported about $3.3 trillion of goods last year, so achieving $1 trillion in new tariff revenue would require tariffs to be set so high that they would severely reduce imports—thus reducing the revenue from tariffs. Think of it as a reverse Laffer curve. That's one reason why tariffs are a poor way to generate revenue.\n\nStill, if that's the figure the White House is going with, let's call it what it is: The largest tax increase since World War II, as a share of America's gross domestic product (GDP). Total American GDP was about $29 trillion last year, so a $1 trillion tax increase would consume about 3.4 percent of the economy, making it the largest tax increase since the Revenue Act of 1942.\n\nIf those numbers are true, then Trump's new tariffs would also dwarf the tax increases that Kamala Harris supported during last year's presidential campaign—her various proposals would have generated a paltry-by-comparison $1.7 trillion over 10 years, the Tax Foundation estimated.\n\nThe direct costs of taxes on so many imports would be only part of the problem. Trump's idea of charging different tariffs on every country's exports means the same product could be charged wildly different tax rates depending on where it was sourced. Those tariff rates would also be subject to constant fluctuation, as other countries shift their policies—as many will likely do in response to Trump's new tariffs. That's a recipe for not only higher taxes on American businesses that rely upon imports but also a constant state of uncertainty.\n\nBut for Trump, it all seems pretty straightforward.\n\n\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" the president said during his remarks in the Oval Office.\n\nThat's simply not true. Many products manufactured in the United States depend on components and raw materials sourced from abroad. Even those that don't may raise their prices—thanks to the higher prices that competitors will be forced to charge due to any new tariffs.\n\nIt all points to an obvious conclusion: As with the rest of Trump's ill-considered trade policies, it is American businesses and consumers that will bear the cost of these higher tariffs.\n\nThe only silver lining to Thursday's proposal is that it will take a while to develop the specifics of the plan. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new tariffs won't be implemented until at least April.\n\nThat means there is still time for Trump to change course and avoid a costly trade war that would hit Americans squarely in the wallet.","summary":"The specifics are still vague, but the White House is reportedly claiming that new tariffs will generate $1 trillion annually.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/13/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-could-be-largest-tax-increase-since-world-war-ii/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/admphotostwo917325-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 21:30:42","author":"Eric Boehm,Robby Soave","authors":["Eric Boehm","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":290275610,"title":"Democrats get two Senate opportunities to freshen up the party","text":"Democratic Sen.

In the meantime, I’m talking with community and my family and friends. I will have more to say soon.”\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran as vice president on the 2024 Democratic ticket, is also considering entering the Senate race, according to Politico. \n\nMinnesota is a blue-leaning state, but it’s not the safest place on the map. Republican candidates have won five of 16 Senate races since 1980, and in 2008, Democrat Al Franken eked out a victory, winning by 0.01 percentage points—just 312 votes—over Republican Norm Coleman. And last year, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won the state by just over 4 points. \n\nThe state is a must-win for Democrats in 2026 if they want any shot at retaking the Senate majority.

Gary Peters of Michigan announced he won’t seek reelection in 2026, after serving two terms. This means that 2026 will be ​​the second election cycle in a row where Democrats must defend an open Senate seat in Michigan, a state Trump took in 2024. Last year, Democrat Elissa Slotkin won her Senate race by just 0.3 points.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a reliable race-rating outlet, considers Peters' Michigan seat to be a toss-up, along with the seat held by Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia. \n\nAs Daily Kos reported in December, winning back the Senate for Democrats is a long, treacherous road. They must not only defend six seats in 2026 and 2028 that were decided by fewer than 5 points, but they must also gain three to four seats to reach the majority in 2028, depending on whether a Democrat or Republican wins the White House that year.\n\nNow, with Smith and Peters set to exit, there will be many opportunities for new leaders with fresh ideas to introduce themselves.","summary":"Democratic Sen.

It’s a pillar of his whole identity, ever since his days in the New York social scene. Before he ever ran for president (and even longer before Twitter became X), he would tweet relentlessly about celebrity gossip like he was running a personal tabloid.\n\n Throughout all three of his elections, Trump has been particularly obsessed with how celebrities interact with him, often railing against those who most definitively side against him. The ones who support him are given an unprecedented level of access, influence, and VIP treatment. But the ones who remain the most elusive are the ones with an even bigger level of reach, influence, and power than him — and that includes Taylor Swift.\n\n When Swift and Trump were finally in the same place on Sunday night for Super Bowl LIX, people wondered if they would interact. Trump had already shown support to Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs. If they had won, would Swift and Trump appear on the field together? There were no crossed paths in the actual event, but that didn’t stop Trump from still finding a way to troll Swift afterward.\n\n During the game, when Swift was shown on the Jumbotron, the stadium booed her. Trump, however, was met with cheers. Of course he loved this and spent the next day posting about it, sharing side-by-side videos of their differing receptions at Caesars Superdome with no caption. He then re-posted the extreme right-wing account Libs of TikTok, which added the caption, “Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed. The world is healing!”\n\n There’s a long history here. While Swift notoriously stayed out of the 2016 election cycle, she’s made it clear in both 2020 and 2024 that she votes blue. Her initial silence may have led Trump to falsely believe he had an ally in one of the best-selling recording artists of all time: When she endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee Senate race in 2018, he told reporters that he liked her music “25 percent less.” (In response, Swift gave a store-wide 25 percent discount to her merch.)\n\n Swift’s disinterest in MAGA still seemed to get under Trump’s skin in 2024, when he posted on Truth Social that “there’s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden.” He couldn’t stop talking about her, complimenting her appearance, and her boyfriend Travis Kelce. He went so far as to post a fake, AI-generated photo of Swift dressed as Uncle Sam and endorsing him. When she gave an emphatic endorsement of Kamala Harris on social media, Trump took to Truth Social again with his own emphatic “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.”\n\n Since winning the election, he and his own stans have been more smug than usual, perhaps because supporting him and his racist, transphobic, and misogynistic policies has become more normalized in pop culture, especially by younger influencers. When Selena Gomez shared a raw video of herself crying over recent immigration crackdowns, the White House’s press secretary shared a response video directed at Gomez featuring the mothers of people who were allegedly killed by undocumented immigrant workers.\n\n Trump’s latest Swift attack was a victory lap for the MAGA agenda, as the one person he wants on his side the most was apparently rebuffed so publicly and right in front of him. And it likely won’t be the last time he shows off his not-so-secret obsession with her. Trump will find more reasons to use Swift’s name to fuel the anger or bragging rights of his followers, who seem to be motivated largely by both of those things.","summary":"Donald Trump loves celebrity.

TOP POLITICAL HANDICAPPER REVEALS DEMOCRATS CHANCES OF WINNING BACK THE SENATE MAJORITY Senate Republicans vowed to try and flip Smith's seat in blue-leaning Minnesota. \"Minnesota is in play, and we play to win. Minnesotans deserve a senator who will fight for lower taxes, economic opportunity and safer communities,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chair Sen. Tim Scott said in a statement to Fox News. But the Senate Democrats' campaign arm quickly pledged to keep the seat in party hands. FIRST ON FOX: SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE SPOTLIGHTS ‘TEAM EFFORT’ \"No Republican has won a Minnesota Senate race in over 20 years, and Democrats will continue to hold this seat in 2026,\" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) spokesperson David Bergstein emphasized in a statement to Fox News. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the chamber, praised Smith as \"a remarkable senator — smart, compassionate, and tireless in her commitment to Minnesota and the country.\" \"While I will deeply miss her leadership and friendship in the Senate, I have no doubt that her legacy of service will continue to inspire.

The party in power - which is clearly the Republicans right now - traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections. And while an early read of the 2026 map shows the GOP will be forced to play defense in some states, they'll also go on offense in others. Besides the open seat in Michigan, the GOP will target first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff in battleground Georgia and longtime Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in swing state New Hampshire. Now the Democrats will have to pay attention to Minnesota, which the Cook Report, a top nonpartisan political handicapper, this week rated as \"Likely Democrat,\" as it unveiled its first read on the battle for the Senate majority in the 2026 cycle. However, Democrats aim to go on offense in blue-leaning Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is up for re-election, as well as in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tillis is also up in 2026. TRUMP-BACKED 2024 GOP SENATE NOMINEE IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE MOVING TOWARD ANOTHER RUN IN 2026 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who served as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democrats' 2024 national ticket, took to social media soon after Smith's news. \"Tina has always done the work to improve people’s lives: lowering the price of insulin, improving access to mental health services, passing historic climate legislation, and our party’s champion for reproductive freedom.

Although it typically gives Democrats only single-digit margins of victory, Republicans haven't been able to flip it like they have other Great Lakes states.Smith's retirement, however, may give them a chance to make inroads with the state's voters with an open race in 2026. Democrats are hoping for a 2018-esque \"blue wave\" that would keep states like Minnesota out of reach for Republicans.Democrats are viewed as having an advantage to start with, but the candidates that end up being nominated will determine how competitive the race becomes. It's likely one of the Republicans' best chances at flipping a Senate seat in a state Vice President Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.What To KnowLieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, a Democrat, already said she plans to run to replace Smith.\"I love Minnesota and my intention is to run for United States Senate and continue to serve the people of this state,\" she wrote in a post to Instagram. \"I'll make a formal announcement later this month. In the meantime, I'm talking with community and my family and friends. I will have more to say soon.\"Flanagan is likely to face several other Democrats in the primary.Governor Tim Walz, who ran for vice president last year, has been floated as a potential candidate, though he could run for a third term for governor, as Minnesota does not have term limits.Representative Angie Craig is another Democrat who could run. She outperformed Harris in her competitive suburban congressional district last year, a potential boon to an electability argument.But she and Walz have not made any statement about whether they intend to run for Senate. Newsweek reached out to each of their political teams for comment via email.Representative Ilhan Omar, a staunch progressive, could also run. A spokesperson told Axios she will be \"will be talking with Minnesotans about Tina's future of the Senate seat and DFL party in Minnesota,\" declining to rule out a run.Former Representative Dean Phillips said in a post to X, formerly Twitter, that he does not plan to run.\"I also believe in keeping one's word, and do not intend to run for Senate or MN Governor,\" he wrote. \"My calling is to build a national movement to challenge the monopoly of the duopoly, and restore common sense, competency, and cooperation. Stay tuned...\"On the Republican side, Representative Tom Emmer also said he isn't planning to make a Senate bid.\"I am focused on doing the job I was elected to do and that is serving the great people of Minnesota's Sixth District here in Congress,\" he wrote on X. \"We have a lot of work to do to implement President Trump's agenda and that's where I'm concentrating my efforts.\"GOP Representatives Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber haven't said whether they will run.Royce White, the Republican who lost to Senator Amy Klobuchar last year, has also indicated he may run again.What People Are SayingSenator Tina Smith, in a video announcing her retirement: \"This decision is not political. It is entirely personal. But it's not lost on me that our country is in need of strong, progressive leadership, right now, maybe more than ever.\"Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a post to X: \"Senator Tina Smith is not only a colleague, but a friend. She's a champion of women's rights and bravely shared her own story in her work to strengthen mental health care. While we will only work together for the next two years, our friendship and her legacy will last a lifetime.\"Journalist Chris Cillizza, on X: \"It's hard to imagine a worst first month for Senate Democrats trying to win back the majority in 2026. Gary Peters and Tina Smith retire unexpectedly, creating two open competitive seats.

But Not for Long","text":"You’d be forgiven for thinking Ye’s antisemitic tirade over the weekend — in which he expressed admiration for Hitler, literally called himself a Nazi, praised Diddy, and took out a Super Bowl ad pointing to a web store selling swastika t-shirts — was the reason his X account was deactivated this week. Even by the standards often too gracefully afforded to Ye, his behavior seemed so beyond the pale that someone must’ve stepped in to stop it.\n\n Except, from the looks of it, Ye deactivated his account out of his own volition, and he’s free to reactivate again if he so chooses. This is despite a days-long barrage of unhinged posts aimed at everyone from former Vice President Kamala Harris to Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and even X owner Elon Musk. Not to mention, he uploaded straight-up pornography to his page at one point. \n\n Of course, Ye’s behavior didn’t come without consequences. Ty Dolla $ign, among the last of his collaborators, released a statement this week condemning antisemitism and removed all mentions of Ye on his Instagram. His talent agency, 33&West, announced this week they’d be severing ties with the musician, and Shopify, which hosted the Yeezy webstore, shut the site down for violating its terms of service. But Ye’s enormous platform remains more or less intact. Up until the site was shut down, his Yeezy brand — which sold an assortment of basics as well as questionable merch for his album Vultures, featuring artwork similar to the right-wing hardcore musician Burzum — was undeniably popular. For all of the uproar over Kanye’s 2022 Twitter meltdown when he declared he’d be going “death con 3” on Jewish people, he was able to repurpose his Yeezy brand into a direct-to-consumer business that, by his own accounts, made the once-iconic musician a billionaire. \n\n Ye’s posting spree revealed a dark undercurrent present on social media platforms in whatever you might call this era after Trump’s election, with the elevation of controversial figures, many of whom share beliefs not too far from the extremes Ye posted. Last week, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance took to X to advocate for a twentysomething working for Elon Musk’s DOGE who resigned after racist posts online were discovered. The 25-year-old staffer named Marko Elez briefly left his role at the agency after a report in The Wall Street Journal revealed posts from a pseudonym he used on X declaring that “just for the record, I was racist before it was cool” and advocating to “normalize Indian hate.” \n\n “I obviously disagree with some of Elez’s posts, but I don’t think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid’s life,” Vice President Vance wrote on X. “We shouldn’t reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever. So I say bring him back.” After Elon Musk posted a poll on X asking whether or not he should be rehired, more than 200,000 users submitted votes, and before long, Elez had his job back. \n\n Much of the right’s fixation on so-called “wokeness” boils down to what they believe to be a heightened scrutiny of what’s deemed acceptable language. In New York’s much-discussed profile of the new generation of millennial and Gen Z Maga faithful, much of their disdain for progressives boiled down to no longer being able to say certain slurs. And so it would seem the pendulum has swung towards a new extreme. Where even at its most excessive, neoliberalism’s biggest sin was the occasional performative gesture of solidarity with marginalized groups from politicians, this new era outwardly rewards bigoted behavior. The vice president stepping in to get a kid their job back after people found their racist tweets is as clear an endorsement of that type of language as we can get. \n\n The past five years of noxious online discourse has been filling the air like smoke in a burning building, slowly at first, but now with terrifying velocity. Scanning X, Instagram Reels, TikTok comments, or just about any other corner of the internet reveals a new world of open-faced bigotry — multiplying like neighborhood gentrifiers or, more aptly, colonizers. In just the past few days, users have found sponsored posts on X that expressly celebrate Hitler. Since taking over the platform in 2019, Elon Musk, who faced basically zero consequences for doing an actual Nazi salute on live television after Trump’s inauguration, has ushered in an era of unfettered hate speech under the guise of being “anti-woke.” In April, an NBC News investigation found hundreds of paid, Verified accounts spreading Nazi propaganda on X and thousands more unverified accounts doing the same. \n\n The free-for-all ethos introduced on X is spreading across social media platforms, too. In January, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to the company’s content moderation policies, all but explicitly allowing transphobic language on the platform. Zuck also added UFC CEO Dana White, a Trump loyalist and staunch anti-woke crusader, to the company’s board. \n\n So, while Ye’s reputation has once again taken a hit as he faces backlash for his posting spree, there’s an unshakeable sense that his latest antics are a sign of something larger. His posts suggest a number of things at once. Most evident is the fact that Ye, who has a history of mental health issues, including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, is likely undergoing some sort of episode. But he also remains deftly perceptive of the zeitgeist. For years, the world has been drifting towards the far right, and it appears we’ve arrived at a frightening realignment in the culture — one that won’t easily or quickly be reversed.","summary":"After posts on X praising Nazis, Ye’s account was deactivated, and Shopify shut down his website — yet it all feels like a sign of something more sinister happening online","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kanye-trump-musk-rhetoric-1235263850/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kanye-commentary.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 19:32:46","author":"Jeff Ihaza","authors":["Jeff Ihaza"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":290224658,"title":"Trump unveils ‘reciprocal’, blanket tariffs on all major US trading partners","text":"US President Donald Trump announced customised, reciprocal tariffs on all imports on Thursday, citing unfair duties imposed by other countries on US goods, marking a further move towards a global trade war.\n“I have decided, for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them no more, no less”, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office before signing a presidential order.\nHe added: “In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff, and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple”, noting that the exact number would not be clear “unless you go by the individual country”.\n“If you go to the individual country and you look at what they’re charging us, in almost all cases, they’re charging us vastly more than we charge them. But those days are over”, Trump vowed.\nIt was unclear whether the tariffs will take effect immediately. The US Trade Representative and the Commerce Department will be responsible for proposing new tariffs on a country-by-country basis to address trade deficits.\nWidely anticipated owing to Trump’s threats to hit most or all of America’s trading partners with reciprocal tariffs, the president’s decision follows his move against steel and aluminium imports, which face levies of 25 per cent starting next month.\nThe new tariffs will be applied on top of those levies.\n\nNew tariffs on auto and semiconductors are expected to be announced in the coming days. Trump on Thursday said that those tariffs will be in addition to the reciprocal tariffs.\nTrump imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, effective February 4, on top of those that have been in place since he started a trade war with Beijing in 2018. Chinese countermeasures will take effect this week.\nAcross-the-board tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico are temporarily paused, but could take effect next month.\nThe White House’s flurry of tariff orders is central to Trump’s broader effort to protect American manufacturers, force allies and adversaries alike to help the US on issues like undocumented immigration and raise revenue to offset tax cuts.\nAmid the executive orders reversing his predecessor Joe Biden’s efforts to close ranks on economic and security fronts with Washington’s allies to stem China’s expanding geopolitical sway, a number of analysts have described some of Trump’s aims as dangerously contradictory and putting American jobs at risk.\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, America has a trade-weighted average import tariff rate of 2 per cent on industrial goods.\nTrump is betting that the damage the tariffs inflict on trading partners will be greater than what the US will face, a correct assessment because the country is less trade-dependent than most other large economies, said Philip Luck of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\nHowever, Luck warned that Trump’s “fortress America strategy” could undermine many of his goals in the longer term, particularly with respect to China.\n“Antagonising our partners distracts from the key problem, which is the subsidies of the PRC,” Luck explained, saying the US was focused on “what types of bourbon the EU is going to put tariffs on, rather than focusing on the non-market policies of the PRC”.\n“We need tariffs or some sort of barriers to these market behaviors, not only in the United States, but in Canada, in the EU, Japan, South Korea, [and] other places,” he added.\n\nMore expensive steel in the US means less competitive exports and less competitive production for things that use steel, Luck continued.\n“For every job in steel and aluminium, there are 80 jobs in the United States in industries that intensively use steel and aluminium. This is immensely costly.”\nAttention now turns to whether Trump will strike deals with trading partners that would waive some or all of the pending US tariffs.\nHis resolve will be tested by rising domestic inflation, an issue that helped doom the election campaign of Trump’s opponent, then US vice-president Kamala Harris, in last year’s presidential election.\nAmerica’s monthly consumer price index rose 3 per cent in January – the most since August 2023 – a warning sign that progress in the effort to tame inflation has stalled if not reversed.","summary":"American leader cites unfair duties imposed by other countries on US goods, marking further escalation towards a global trade war.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3298603/trump-unveils-reciprocal-blanket-tariffs-all-major-us-trading-partners","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/14/302f504c-9f98-4d7d-b573-3aeb9b5131ac_175a294a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 19:05:34","author":"Khushboo Razdan,Robert Delaney","authors":["Khushboo Razdan","Robert Delaney"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":290224808,"title":"Democrats Favor Kamala Harris in California's Governor Race: Poll","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris holds an early lead among Democratic voters if she chooses to run in the 2026 California gubernatorial race, according to a new poll.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' team for comment via her online contact form.Why It MattersHarris, who has served California as a district attorney, attorney general and in the U.S. Senate, has not made her next moves clear after losing the White House race to President Donald Trump. While some have floated her as possibly making another presidential bid in 2028, others believe she would be a strong candidate to replace Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be term limited after 2026.Harris would bring a high level of name recognition and fundraising ability to a race in California, generally viewed as a safely Democratic state. Her decisions about her future could play a significant role in the future direction of the entire Democratic Party after a string of stinging losses last year.What To KnowAn Emerson College poll, conducted among 469 registered voters on February 11, showed Harris with more support than other possible Democratic candidates in the gubernatorial race.Harris was backed by 57 percent of respondents in the survey, large lead over other potential Democratic contenders. Former Representative Katie Porter placed second in the poll at 9 percent, while former state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa received 4 percent.While the poll reveals possible Democratic support for Harris if she chooses to run and shows other Democrats may have an uphill battle to win over the base against the former vice president, it notably did not include candidates of other parties. California has a nonpartisan primary system for statewide races, so it's unclear how other voters could change the state of the race.Harris said of her future during phone calls in November that she is \"staying in the fight,\" Politico reported.She had an extensive career in California politics, previously serving as San Francisco district attorney and the state's attorney general. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.A poll conducted by University of California, Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times showed Harris with a substantial advantage over other candidates for the 2026 California gubernatorial race. It surveyed 4,838 registered voters from October 22 to October 29, 2024.According to that survey poll, about 72 percent of Democrats said they would be very likely or somewhat likely support Harris, compared with 8 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of voters who indicated \"no party preference.\"A Capitol Weekly poll released on Thursday showed Harris in a closer race among the entire electorate. It showed 23 percent of all voters would support her, with 21 percent backing Republican businessman John Cox. Porter placed third with 16 percent, and former Republican candidate for state controller Lanhee Chen received 10 percent support.California is viewed as among the most Democratic states in the country, backing Harris by about 20 points last November.What People Are SayingCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, to Politico: \"I would support her if she ran, I've always supported her in everything she's done.

With 52 electoral votes, a shift in California's electoral trends, could also impact key elections in the future, and challenge the party's dominance in other blue states.What to KnowCalifornia has historically been firmly blue, voting Democrat in every presidential election since 1988 and choosing a Democratic governor in each election since 2006.But polls indicate the tide could be turning on the Democrats in the Golden State. According to new polling by Capitol Weekly, published on February 6, when asked: \"Do you think the Democratic Party has shown an ability to present an effective case against the Trump administration?\" only 11% said yes, with 79% of voters saying that the Democratic Party has not shown this ability. Among Democrats the numbers didn't improve much – with 19% expressing confidence in their party, and 68% saying no. The poll surveyed 1,198 voters in California.Voters were also asked to give one word to describe the Democratic Party, and the responses were bleak. The most common words voters chose were \"lost,\" \"ineffective\" and \"weak.\" Other words included \"toothless,\" \"ineffectual\" and \"floundering.\" Some voters were more positive, describing the party as \"determined,\" \"optimistic\" and \"caring.\"Meanwhile, voters were also asked who they would be most inclined to support for governor in 2026 when Gavin Newsom's term ends. Despite not having declared her intention to run for the position, former Vice President Kamala Harris is believed by some to be a front runner due to her name recognition in California.Polls have reflected this, with a survey from UC Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times, conducted in October, showing Harris with a substantial advantage over other candidates for the 2026 California gubernatorial race.The latest Emerson College poll, conducted between February 10-11, also showed the same trend, with 57% saying they would support Harris for Governor, putting her miles ahead of any of her contenders. Last week, pressure on Harris to run escalated when California Attorney General Rob Bonta endorsed her after saying he wouldn't run.\"I would support her if she ran, I've always supported her in everything she's done. She would be field-clearing,\" Politico quoted the attorney general as saying. Bonta considered running for governor last year, but changed his mind after Donald Trump defeated Harris in the presidential race, according to Politico.Capitol Weekly's survey suggests that Harris may not be as popular previous polls have shown. Despite her name recognition, Republican John Cox was only two points behind Harris when voters were asked who they support for governor, on 21% to Harris' 23%. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, who has been a vocal MAGA supporter, is expected to announce his candidacy for California governor on Monday, according to Fox News. He was not included in the poll.The mediocre numbers for Harris come after California, where Harris previously served as San Francisco district attorney and later as state attorney general and U.S. senator, saw the largest rightward shifts in the 2024 election, along with New York, shifting towards the GOP by 12 points compared to 2020. But California and New York were not alone in shifting towards the Republican Party, with all but two states shifting rightward since 2020, giving Donald Trump a firm mandate.But polling suggestst voters aren't just turning on the Democratic party on a national level, they are also turning on the party on a statewide level.The Capitol Weeky poll shows that California voters are divided over whether they approve of Newsom. Some 52% said they had a somewhat or very favorable view of Newsom, while 48% said the opposite. Emerson's latest poll showed the same trend, with 42% saying they approve of the job Newsom is doing in office, while 40% disapprove of the job he is doing. However, according to the Capitol Weeky poll, when Democratic voters were asked who they consider to be the best leader of the Democratic Party to push back on actions of the Trump administration, the most common answer was Newsom.The governor is currently facing a recall effort after an intent to recall petition reached the required number of signatures to proceed. Organizers are now attempting to gather between 1.2 million and 1.3 million signatures over 160 days to allow the petition to be placed on the ballot for Californians to vote on.California has suffered devastating damage from wildfires that started across Los Angeles County in January. The fires burned over 47,900 acres, destroying more than 16,250 homes and businesses, and killing 29 people.Since then, several California officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Chief Kristin Crowley, have faced criticism. However, Newsom, a potential Democratic contender for the 2028 presidential election, has taken the most blame.The recall petition, organized by Saving California, accuses Newsom of \"gross mismanagement during the Los Angeles County fires,\" saying that \"inadequate resources and delayed responses left communities devastated.\"Saving California Chairman Randy Economy, a former senior adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told Newsweek last month that he is confident the 1.2 million signatures goal can be reached in light of the wildfires.\"If we don't get this done in a couple of weeks, I'll be shocked. The anger is driving this, and we've been bombarded 24 hours a day for the past two weeks with people asking, 'Where do I sign? How do I get my petition?' The demand is there, and it's only going to grow stronger,\" he said.\"I think people right now have had it. The people who lost their homes have had it. These were his traditional base of voters, and they're all disgusted with him. The anger is something I've never seen in California politics. I've been doing this for 40 years as a consultant, and I've never seen so much anger in my life,\" he added.Newsom has faced criticism over California's wildfire response, with Trump accusing him of blocking water supplies to Southern California to protect a threatened fish—claims state officials deny. Trump also alleged Newsom refused to sign a nonexistent \"water restoration declaration\" and falsely stated the U.S. military had \"turned on the water.\" The two have long clashed over water policy, including Trump's 2019 rollback of environmental protections, which Newsom challenged in court.Trump also threatened to withhold federal aid for the region unless the state changed its approach to water management.Trump and Newsom met again last week following the president's threat. The meeting did not result in any resolution on federal aid, but the governor described the conversation as \"substantive\" and \"positive.\" He said they discussed wildfire recovery and more contentious topics, including water policy.According to Emerson's latest poll, 62% think the California government should spend more on firefighter staffing and equipment, knowing increased funding may require a tax increase, while 35% think they should spend the same, and 3% think the state should spend less.\"Majorities of Democrats (68%), Republicans (61%), and independents (54%) support increased state spending on firefighter staffing and equipment, reflecting heightened concern amid wildfire threats,\" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.What People Are SayingTom Hogen-Esch, professor of political science at California State University Northridge, told Newsweek: \"If these numbers are correct they definitely represent a flashing red warning for the California Democratic Party. But the numbers seem to indicate a couple of opposing impulses from the electorate.\"First, the numbers suggest that Democratic voters are searching for a greater level of opposition to the Trump administration. But on the other hand, many voters seem to be pushing back against liberal policies in their recent shift in the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Nothing lasts forever.\"Democrats have had essentially unitary control over the California government for the last 20 or 25 years. At some point a shift is inevitable. The Democrats need to begin thinking about how to craft a political message that appeals to the large percentage of very liberal voters in California who live in major urban areas, but balance those messages with the growing influence of Hispanic voters in more inland counties who are traditional supporters of the Democratic coalition, but now seem to be open to voting Republican.\"But Republican politicians also need to be careful about how to craft their message. A pure MAGA strategy is probably not sellable to Californians in statewide offices. A more moderate message might be one that can garner sufficient appeal to once again become competitive in the state.\"I think it's unlikely that a recall effort against Newsom will be successful given that the wildfires were essentially entirely a local government responsibility. But the fact that Harris is in such a tight race with a Republican politician with far less name recognition would seem to suggest that Republicans may be competitive – really for the first time in a couple of decades – in upcoming races for statewide offices.\"What Happens NextCalifornia's political future remains uncertain. It is currently unclear how many signatures the recall petition against Gavin Newsom has. If organizers fail to gather the 1.2 million to 1.3 million signatures needed to put the petition on the ballot, the recall effort will fail.Newsom has faced several other unsuccessful recall attempts in the past. The most successful attempt to date came in 2021, when organizers collected enough signatures to place the recall on the ballot. However, Newsom managed to defeat the recall in September of that year, with 7.9 million voting against and 4.9 million voting for it.Meanwhile, Harris has not declared if she intends to run for governor in 2028, and Newsom has not declared if he intends to run for president in 2028. In November, Newsom had +550 odds of becoming the next president, according to SportsBettingDime, which amounts to a 15% chance. Harris had +2500 odds, or a 4% chance.","summary":"While it has historically been a firmly blue state, polls indicate the tide could be turning.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/california-polling-democratic-party-newsom-harris-2030573","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587711/harris-newsom.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 17:58:03","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":290211124,"title":"ISI Agent Ghulam Nabi Fai Planted Outside White House Again, This Time Masquerading As Khalistani","text":"Washington: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi -President Donald Trump 's high stakes meeting, ISI agent Ghulam Nabi Fai led a pro-Khalistan protest outside the White House on Thursday.

Back in 2021, when PM Modi had travelled to Washington, Fai resorted to the same tactics.Republic Media Network's Senior Executive Editor Abhishek Kapoor back then had confronted Ghulam Nabi Fai and asked him whether he was holding the protest for Pakistan.“Mr. Fai, Are you doing this for Pakistan… Mr. Fai, Are you doing this for Pakistan… Mr. Fai, Mr. Fai,” Republic repeatedly asked Ghulam Fai but he didn’t respond and kept on shouting pro-Khalistani slogans with his supporters.Speaking on the development, Major General (Retired) Rajan Kochhar in 2021 said, “Pakistan seems to be reaching a state of desperation as Khalistan is a non issue, it’s like flogging a dead horse. The kind of bonhomie PM Modi is enjoying in Untied States with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , the Pakistan is not able to digest this and has run of ideas.”“It’s becoming absolutely clear that Pakistan now is at the end of the road as it’s raising issues which have no relevance,” he said.","summary":"ISI Agent Ghulam Nabi Fai Planted Outside White House Again, This Time Masquerading As Khalistani","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/india/isi-agent-ghulam-nabi-fai-planted-outside-white-house-again-this-time-masquerading-as-khalistani","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/isi-agent-ghulam-nabi-fai-1739468172669-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 17:36:28","author":"Digital Desk","authors":["Digital Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":290195220,"title":"A Look Back At SNL Season 50’s Most Iconic Moments","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nEgo Nwodim, Kenan Thompson, Bowen Yang, Heidi Gardner, Sarah Sherman, Ashley Padilla, Marcello ... [+] Hernández, Colin Jost, and James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump during the \"SNL For Trump\" Cold Open\nWill Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nSaturday Night Live started its 50th season on September 28, 2024, with host Jean Smart and musical guest Jelly Roll. Since then, the season has chugged along with 12 episodes, and on February 16, 2025, SNL returns with the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special (a three-hour prime-time special with guests, former cast members and musical acts to celebrate the history of the long-running show.)\n\nWhile the special looks back on all 50 years of the show, there are plenty of iconic moments from season 50 that you may have missed.\n\nViral Moments\n\nThis season had several viral moments that hit big on social media.\n\nBridesmaid Speech\n\nThe biggest viral moment of season 50 is undoubtedly the sketch Bridesmaid Speech. The sketch appeared in the third episode of the season, hosted by Ariana Grande. It follows a group of bridesmaids who sing a parody of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Me Espresso” instead of a traditional toast. However, the speech goes off the rails as they introduce the mysterious Domingo, a man they met at the bachelorette party. The best part of this sketch is the purposely bad singing, which feels so right for a group of bridesmaids. Even Grande sings poorly, which is spellbinding. It wasn’t the only singing that Grande did on the episode; she also shined in a sketch about Italian castrati.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nRFK Jr.’s Health Secretary Confirmation Live Updates: Senate Confirms Trump’s Pick—McConnell Votes ‘No’\n\nNetflix’s Best New Show Is A Surefire Emmy Contender\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, February 13th\n\nHowever, Bridesmaid Speech is the obvious stand out viral moment from the episode. In November, the character of Domingo even appeared at Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet tour in Los Angeles. Hernández, in character as Domingo, ‘quoted’ the original sketch to Carpenter, saying, “Came all the way/Had to explain/Direct from Domingo/Sabrina’s a friend/She’s like my sis/But I would hook up though.”\n\nSNL brought the character back during the November 16 episode hosted by Charli XCX (this time for a parody of Chappell Roan’s “Hot to Go”); however, it didn’t capture the magic of the original.\n\nBowen Yang as Moo Deng\n\nBowen Yang stirred up some online chatter during the season premiere by playing Baby Hippo Moo Deng mixed with pop star Chappell Roan. While the sketch is very funny, some felt it was too mean to the up-and-coming pop star, which sparked controversy. However, all seemed to be forgiven by Roan, who appeared as the musical guest later in the season and even held Yang’s hand during goodbyes.\n\nWhile it was not as viral or controversial, Yang’s characters on Weekend Update have been strong this season, and his appearance as a New Jersey drone should not be missed.\n\nWashington’s Dream\n\nNate Bargatze hosted the second episode of the season and created a viral moment by reappearing as George Washington. He had previously played the character in an episode of season 49, and the second time was just as good as the original.\n\nKamala Harris Stops By\n\nSNL has become synonymous with political cold opens. While many of these feel long and tired, they are always full of excellent impressions (this season has featured especially great ones from Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff and Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris). However, during the November 2, 2024 episode during the lead-up to the election, Kamala Harris appeared as herself alongside Rudolph. The sketch isn’t the best Cold Open of the season, but it certainly stands out for its cameo.\n\nGreat Sketches\n\nThis season, SNL has had some great sketches. While they were not always the most viral, they delivered some iconic laughs.\n\nI Love Lucy\n\nThis sketch appeared at near the end of the season premiere. Jean Smart is fabulous in it, supported by an outstanding performance from Marcello Hernández as Desi Arnaz. Smart really shows off her acting skills, and it all works.\n\nSarah Sherman’s Weekend Updates\n\nSarah Sherman has appeared on many Weekend Updates this season and often steals the show. While sometimes she appears as herself and sometimes a character like Nosferatu, usually she devolves into sexual jokes surrounding Weekend Update host Colin Jost. While that might sound grating, weirdly, it always kind of works. She really commits and sells her performance every time.\n\nThe Janitor\n\nEpisode 6 with host Bill Burr had a lot of great sketches; one of the funniest is confusingly a Good Will Hunting Parody. While it doesn’t feel exactly timely in 2024, it is hilarious mostly due to its commitment and attention to detail. The comedy is a little gross, but the heightening, James Austin Johnson’s Robin Williams impression and physical comedy make this sketch great.\n\nSábado Gigante\n\nThis season saw two sketches based on Sábado Gigante starring Hernández and an unsuspecting white guest. The first of the two with Bargatze is a must-watch. It is a spot-on impression of the show, but more than that, it feels like a bit of a risk for SNL since it is mainly in Spanish.\n\nMusical Performances\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE — Episode 1869 — Pictured: Musical guest Chappell Roan performs on Saturday, ... [+] November 2, 2024\nWill Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nThere have been a couple of iconic musical performances this season. One of the most exciting was Chappell Roan’s debut of her new song “The Giver.” The song is one of the completed but unreleased songs on her highly anticipated second album, and her performance stole the show.\n\nHozier also stole focus with a performance of The Pogues’ “The Fairytale of New York.” His version is achingly wonderful and fits the December 21 Christmas show spirit.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE — Episode 1874 — Pictured: Musical guest Hozier performs \"Fairytale of New York\" ... [+] on Saturday, December 21, 2024\nWill Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nTrends of the Season\n\nStand-Up Comedian Hosts\n\nOne of the Biggest trends of the season was stand-up comedian hosts. Season 50 featured Nate Bargatze, John Mulaney, Bill Burr, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle and thus a lot of stand-up monologues. While not all of them are great, Chappelle’s is especially notable for being one of the longest in SNL history at over 16 minutes.\n\nGuest Stars and Cameos\n\nMany former cast members and other celebrities returned this season. Lin-Manuel Miranda stopped by for a Hamilton-inspired Cold Open.\n\nAdam Sandler, Donnell Rawlings, Paul Rudd, Trisha Paytas, Akiva Schaffer, Kyle Mooney, Dana Carvey, David Spade, Pete Davidson, Tim Kaine and many more cameoed on this season. Lucy Liu even appeared in a pre-tapped sketch that was cut for time.\n\nWhile the show has not confirmed any more regular episodes, the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special premieres February 16,\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nRosa Escandon\n\nEditorial Standards\n\nForbes Accolades","summary":"Season 50 was full of viral moments, cameos and not to be missed sketches.

While Joy Behar and Sara Haines laughed at her self-deprecating joke, Sunny Hostin and Whoopi Goldberg wore confused looks on their faces.\n\n“No, but seriously, I walk out and I know I’m gonna say something that a lot of the table disagrees with, a lot of the audience does, and I think it’s made me a better communicator in the sense that I don’t do it in a way — or I’m trying to — that ’s forcing it down someone’s throat and that’s acknowledging people might see things differently,” Griffin continued.\n\nThe former White House staffer said she “recommends” rejection therapy, noting that you have “to force yourself into uncomfortable places.”\n\nIt’s no secret that Griffin sometimes clashes with her co-hosts, none of whom personally identify with her Republican politics.

Mexico's president agrees to send 10,000 troops to the Southern border.\n\nDisney announces the abolishment of 'trigger warnings' put in place post-George Floyd, apologizing for the content of films made over 80 years ago.\n\nGoldman Sachs announces the end of their 'board diversity policy.' Zuckerberg's Meta fires 4,000 employees on Monday, citing his decision to 'raise the bar on performance management' — code for killing DEI.\n\nPBS fired two of their own DEI execs on Monday. And on Wednesday night, 75,000 federal workers, in the crosshairs of Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to cut bloating and waste, took buyouts.\n\nWe are, as Trump promised in his inaugural address, entering the 'golden age' of common sense. And there's no going back, not anytime soon. \n\nJust look at three of the biggest ads during the Super Bowl — an event at which Trump, as the first sitting US president to attend the game, was cheered, while Taylor Swift, who wholeheartedly endorsed Kamala Harris, was booed.\n\nThe culture has gone full MAGA.\n\nBrad Pitt starred in a nearly five-minute long ad for FOX Sports and the NFL, extolling national unity and pride. There was no irony, no winks to a liberal agenda or racism or the 'threats' to so-called marginalized communities.\n\nNope, just a full-on ad for American exceptionalism — a phrase and a concept that hasn't been part of the lexicon since the 1980s.\n\n'Think about it,' Pitt intones. 'When we are bound by a common goal, we've reached heights, authored achievements, pushed progress, not alone, but together.'\n\nPitt's narration accompanies reenactments of the Wright brothers designing the first airplane, working men building the first skyscrapers, US troops raising the flag at Iwo Jima, footage of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech and Neil Armstrong on the moon.\n\n'The huddle is a metaphor for our history,' Pitt says. 'How did we rise? The only way: Together.'\n\nNowhere do we see Colin Kaepernick and the bending of the knee, or the BLM riots, or the women's march on Washington or the January 6 riots or trans athletes beating biological women.\n\nIt's clear that America has turned the page when even Hollywood gets the message. When the NFL eradicates the slogan 'END RACISM' from the field days before the big game. When Amazon Prime spends $40 million to produce a documentary about Melania Trump.\n\nFor all those Dems who insist, still, that they just didn't get their message out this election: You did. America wants nothing to do with it.\n\nWe are done with DEI, open borders, and trans madness.\n\nWe are done with being told that America is the most racist and hopeless country in the Western world, that whites need to perpetually check their 'privilege' and police their speech, that we all need to state our pronouns, and that women and girls need to admit biological boys and men into their sports and private spaces.\n\nA relieved nation, finally, exhales.\n\nLook at the second big Super Bowl spot — a $2 million recruitment ad for the U.S. Secret Service, directed by Michael Bay using the cinematic language of patriotic 1980s blockbusters like 'Top Gun.'\n\nIt swells with national pride, valorizing the men and women of the Secret Service in actual footage, saving the lives of Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump from would-be assassins — and the image of Trump is a strong, defiant one, his fist in the air with blood coming down his face.\n\nThis is a Hollywood that has joined Silicon Valley in celebrating Trump and a return to traditional American stoicism. The voiceover in Bay's shot, deep and whisky-soaked:\n\n'Our heroes are humble. They have an inner pride . . . Protectors are born. They're not made.'\n\nCough-cough, DEI warriors.\n\n'America's Secret Service protecting this Super Bowl is asking a few more to step forward.'\n\nTonally on-point for this moment, in which military recruitment is up, while support for Trump's border policies (58%) and deportations (59%) is in the majority.\n\nSchools are abolishing boys in girls' sports and bathrooms to almost zero blowback. Sanctuary cities and the wokest Dem governors, California's Gavin Newsom among them, are happily working with the president.\n\nTrump is brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine and demanding that Hamas release the remaining hostages — no shame about 'colonization,' no prevarications, just a true threat: America, as it has before, will demolish evil.\n\nYes. This is us, back from the brink.\n\nNot that the left, in its graveyard spiral, will accept it.\n\nLiberal anchors are being fired or cut loose daily. Those who remain make fools of themselves.\n\nTwo days after the Super Bowl, CNN's Kaitlan Collins made herself a laughingstock, grimly declaring that Trump has put America 'dangerously close to a constitutional crisis.'\n\nAgain, Kaitlan: Check those approval numbers. Then check with a constitutional lawyer.\n\nThat same night, Anderson Cooper lost all intellectual and moral high ground when he pushed back, sans evidence, on Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, snapping at pro-Trump panelist and former New Hampshire Chris Sununu: 'Don't be a d**k.'\n\nSo much for Michelle Obama and her fatuousness.\n\n'When they go low, we go high,' indeed.\n\nThe left, truly, cannot help themselves. Their first bout of Trump Derangement Syndrome has not left them immunized.\n\nFor all their screaming about Donald Trump as our greatest 'threat to democracy' and the very reincarnation of Hitler, what are they doing?\n\nScreaming outside the offices of USAID — just revealed, thanks to Trump, to have funded the college tuition, at Colorado State University, for terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki — killed by President Obama in a drone strike in 2011.\n\nOh, how the self-appointed mighty have fallen.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris and disgraced hubby Doug Emhoff showed up at a Lakers game, in their hometown of L.A., days before the Super Bowl.\n\nWere they greeted like returning warriors, having fought the good fight, proudly seated courtside? Did liberal Angelenos line up for selfies? Were there breathless tweets about 'Mamala-Kamala' in the house?\n\nNo, no, and no. No one cared.\n\nYet Harris hasn't ruled out a run for California governor, or president in 2028. She, too, refuses to accept the message: America has moved on, quite happily, in this second go-round with Trump.\n\nDon't believe me? Ask no less a professional curmudgeon than Harrison Ford, who starred in the third biggest Super Bowl ad — this one for Jeep, but also, unequivocally, for patriotism, old-school masculinity, and freedom.\n\nThat is, the freedom to do your thing without treading on others.\n\nAn American flag blows on an empty plain before Ford rises from a fireside seat inside a cabin — shades of 'Yellowstone' — and declares:\n\n'Freedom is for everybody.'\n\nCut to black-and-white newsreel footage of Americans at war.\n\n'But it isn't free. It's earned. There are real heroes in the world, but not the ones in the movies. Real heroes are humble.'\n\nSame sentiment as the Bay ad — humility. Quite the broadside against the self-aggrandizing left, constantly praising themselves for patrolling their micro-aggressions.\n\nCut to a returning serviceman — true stakes, true sacrifice — hugging his small daughter.\n\n'They're not driven by pride,' Ford continues. 'Pride is a terrible driver. Freedom is the roar of one man's engine… The most sacred thing in life isn't the path. It's the freedom to choose it.'\n\nAmen. If the left wants to rouse itself, they should take these words to heart — because it's the so-called progressives, with their orthodoxy of intolerance, who have failed to recognize freedom.\n\nAnd to recognize, most crucially, America.","summary":"We are, as Trump promised in his inaugural address, entering the 'golden age' of common sense.

I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. We are just four weeks, four weeks, into the Trump administration here in the United States, but there has been so much news, some of which we've been breaking here at WIRED, so we wanted to get into that a little bit today on Uncanny Valley. I'm joined by senior editor Leah Feiger, who runs our politics coverage. Hi, Leah.\nLeah Feiger: Hey, Katie. Thanks for having me.\nKatie Drummond: Pretty special couple of weeks.\nLeah Feiger: Oh, it's been a fun one. Just so great.\nKatie Drummond: The team has been working relentlessly, very, very hard. I can personally attest to seeing some very late-night messages circulating among our staff.\nLeah Feiger: Yeah, sorry about that.\nKatie Drummond: No problem. All of the snacks that I had in my office have been eaten. I had to go buy more. That should give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening at WIRED. Leah, so much of our coverage has really centered on DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by, of course, Elon Musk, with the endorsement of President Trump. Catch us up just for starters on this week at DOGE. What's the latest? Because there's so much happening, it's really hard to keep up and keep track.\nLeah Feiger: There's a ton happening right now. Honestly, the last two weeks have felt like two years, just in terms of the news cycle. In the last 48 hours alone, President Trump put out his executive order to make pretty clear that DOGE continues to have his full support and would be able to continue commencing with large-scale workforce cuts across the board. Late last night, Makena Kelly, our senior politics reporter, reported that dozens of workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, were fired in an after-hours blitz. These things are happening really, really fast. Those employees, for example, the CFPB, they were notified with an email that addressed them as parentheses, employee first name dot employee last name, job title, division. This is not personal. This is just cutting, cutting, cutting.\nKatie Drummond: This is slash and burn.\nLeah Feiger: Yeah.\nKatie Drummond: This is straight out of the Musk playbook that we've seen at other companies.\nLeah Feiger: A hundred percent.\nKatie Drummond: Twitter being a prime and very recent example. That also brings to mind, to me, one of the stories that we just published, that Makena just published this morning, which was looking at sort of who is being installed in senior-level roles across these agencies that might actually give Musk and DOGE more power than they already have. Can you talk a little bit about that?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely. She found that former Palantir and Elon Musk associates are taking over key government IT roles. These are called chief information officers. If you haven't heard of them before, that's totally fine, but just know that they're incredibly important. They manage an agency's information technology, oversee sensitive databases, including classified ones. These are really important people that now have folks aligned with Musk or with Palantir, which as we know is tied to Peter Thiel, another Musk ally.\nKatie Drummond: Right. The concern among experts that Makena spoke to is that if individuals in these CIO roles are aligned with Musk, aligned with the efforts of DOGE, that that could actually make it easier for DOGE workers to gain access to really sensitive material, sensitive information.\nLeah Feiger: Sensitive systems.\nKatie Drummond: Now, let's back up a little bit, because we're talking about what DOGE is doing in the last 24 hours. It sort of feels like there are several news cycles happening around DOGE every 24 hours. We just sort of gave you the last day or so, but let's back way up and talk about DOGE, how it was created, and what we discovered earlier on in our reporting about this organization, about this group. Sort of who are these people and how did they end up in all of these federal agencies?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely, and you're going to have to help me fill in on all of these stories too.\nKatie Drummond: I would be happy to.\nLeah Feiger: Because you have been in the thick of it with us, but this Department of Government Efficiency, we are constantly putting the word so-called right in front of it with all of our reporting, because this isn't an actual department. That requires Congress. That requires a whole lot more than Trump or Musk going out and declaring on X that they now have a department. However, this so-called department is now within the Executive Office of the President. They were quite shrewd with its creation. They actually took over the USDS, the US Digital Service, which has led to some very interesting aftershocks here. Makena also reported last week that there has now been a firewall barrier between legacy USDS employees and new DOGE employees. When WIRED first started reporting on this, I think one of the reasons that we've really managed to be on top of this story is that we were able to see the forest amongst the trees, that we had to take them seriously and had to figure out where they would be going first and what that would look like.\nKatie Drummond: I think it's important to mention here, too, that last year when DOGE first sort of surfaced or was announced by candidate Trump, now President Trump, and Musk, the idea that was conveyed to the public was that this would be sort of an external consultancy, right?\nLeah Feiger: Right.\nKatie Drummond: That Musk and DOGE, whomever made up that group, would be consulting with Trump and with the federal government around potential cuts, potential changes.\nLeah Feiger: Right.\nKatie Drummond: What we're talking about now is essentially a co-opting, if I may use that term, of an existing agency, sidelining its employees in order to sort of run DOGE under somewhat official pretenses\nLeah Feiger: And then taking on more power than that original agency ever had.\nKatie Drummond: Exactly.\nLeah Feiger: But using that agency's access to other agencies.\nKatie Drummond: Now, we've learned a lot, and WIRED has broken a lot of this news, but so have other news organizations, about who actually is a participant in DOGE. Who are these people? Initially, about a week and a half ago, Tori Elliott, one of our fabulous politics reporters, another really dogged WIRED journalist, broke a story identifying six of these individuals. They are young men aged sort of 19 to 24. We named them. We shared any details we were able to glean about their backgrounds and about what they are doing inside of DOGE and across federal agencies. A few things really stood out to me from that reporting. One was that none of these young men have really any government experience at all.\nLeah Feiger: Oh God, no. No.\nKatie Drummond: The second being that all of them are somehow tied to either Elon Musk or Peter Thiel, who is of course a key Musk ally.\nLeah Feiger: These very young men have found themselves with the keys to so many different government agencies right now. We have tracked them through their work at USAID, at the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, at the General Services Administration, and TTS within that. They are all over the place right now, the Department of Education. There are also a lot of grown-ups in the room, too. Don't want to forget those. At the General Services Administration, we have Nicole Hollander, a former Twitter staffer, married to Steve Davis, who's very, very involved in DOGE everything right now. The two of them actually slept at the Twitter offices during Musk's takeover a couple of years ago. These are people who aren't just affiliated but have intimate knowledge as to how Musk operates.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: And how he could possibly continue planning to make these cuts and get DOGE everywhere he wants it to be.\nKatie Drummond: Not that I can sort of expect that you would be inside the psyche of one of these young men who raised a hand to participate in DOGE, but what do we know about how these people were recruited? What would be the incentive for them? What would inspire someone to raise a hand and say, \"Yes, I want to slash and burn my way through the federal government\"?\nLeah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. Vittoria Elliott and Tim Marchman our director of politics, security, and science, reported over the weekend about all of this recruitment, and how some of this recruitment actually went down, which included Discord chats and alumni groups for Palantir interns and the like. It's really well planned. These were people that already bought in, at least to a certain extent.\nKatie Drummond: Sure.\nLeah Feiger: And are finding themselves with the keys to the kingdom. Getting into the psyche is obviously so hard here, but I think something that I just want to make so, so clear is the US is so incredibly divided right now. Even if you're not consuming news or on social platforms that are celebrating Musk, perhaps you're talking to your friends right now who are all like, “I can't believe he's doing this.” There are so many people out there obsessed with what's happening, obsessed with him, lionize him. He is an idol to so many.\nKatie Drummond: Right, right. Particularly you would imagine young men of a certain background and a certain sort of professional set.\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: Technologists, people who work in the Valley. I think one thing that stood out to me too from that story about the recruiting tactics is, in some instances these were former interns or former employees at companies like Palantir dipping back into their networks to ask people to raise a hand. This isn't exactly Elon Musk going out and hand-selecting the best and brightest from his companies.\nLeah Feiger: No.\nKatie Drummond: This is sort of a spray-and-pray approach across several online communities where alumni of a handful of companies tend to congregate and tend to spend time.\nLeah Feiger: That's already led to a lot of controversy for them. Is this the moment where I say “big balls” in front of my boss on a podcast?\nKatie Drummond: Let's say “big balls,” Leah. Tell us a little bit. This is one particular individual, Edward Coristine, who has attracted I think more scrutiny than many of his peers within DOGE because his background is colorful, to say the least.\nLeah Feiger: His background is so colorful. This is a 19-year-old DOGE staffer who experts have told WIRED would probably not have passed a background check, typically required of all these sensitive US government systems that he now has access to. This staffer, Edward Coristine, goes by Big Balls online. He also owned Tesla.sexy LLC and worked at a startup that hired convicted hackers. Again, he's 19, so he's been busy. I was not doing nearly this much at age 19. That's who's in our government right now. Also, another one I just want to throw in that's drawn up a lot of controversy that WIRED also identified, Marko Elez.\nKatie Drummond: Marko.\nLeah Feiger: We got to talk about Marko. We figured out that Marko Elez, as part of DOGE, was given read and write access to really sensitive Treasury payment systems. After our reporting, The Wall Street Journal was able to confirm that Elez had actually ended up resigning, according to the White House, due to a flurry of racist social media posts that were discovered that he had links to. We're talking about the Big Balls controversy. We're talking about Elez. It's not that these people are getting found out and then running and hiding away. To a certain extent, right? Elez resigned, but as Elez resigns, and as that reporting comes out, Elon Musk, JD Vance, people from a lot of different corners of the Republican GOP spectrum, are all going online and attaching their names to this, which is so wild, calling for these people to be brought back, saying that these mistakes of childhood shouldn't be impactful. These mistakes were made several months ago. I am not sure what our timeline is here for this.\nKatie Drummond: Speaking of these young men and their online defenders, WIRED published that story naming six of them and sharing what we had learned about the access that they had and their backgrounds. Now, Leah, we got a lot of flack for that. We were not without criticism over that decision, which ultimately I own. It is a decision that we stand behind, but we're going to take a quick break and then let's talk about that.\n\nKatie Drummond: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's global editorial director, and we are here talking about the latest with DOGE. Now, Leah, let's get back to that decision we made, that WIRED made, to name six of these young men working at Musk's behest for DOGE within the federal government. What informed that decision to actually name names in the story?\nLeah Feiger: It's a decision that we didn't take lightly. These are young people who have been working for DOGE for a limited period of time, who have been in Elon Musk's orbit by virtue of their age for a limited period of time. Ultimately, it's actually a really simple answer, and that's that they're working in the government right now, and government employees need to be public to the American people.\nKatie Drummond: I could not agree more. It's a simple answer and it's a clear answer, and absolutely it was not a decision that we made lightly. We've been making a lot of decisions, not just going back the last few weeks, but actually the last many, many months. I remember in July of 2024 Donald Trump was shot in the ear. Obviously a massive story, a massive news event, and photos were released of him raising his fist.\nLeah Feiger: Saying, “Fight, fight, fight.”\nKatie Drummond: “Fight, fight.” A really iconic moment. I remember sitting there and thinking, “OK, he is going to win this election. He is going to be the president.”\nLeah Feiger: Oh, yeah.\nKatie Drummond: Obviously a lot transpired after that with Kamala Harris entering the race, and so on and so forth, but that really felt like a transformational moment for our newsroom in how we were thinking about the election. I remember talking to the newsroom the Monday after that happened, it was over a weekend, and saying, \"We need to start getting ready for what this looks like for us across everything that we cover.\" Tell us about how you and your team and the newsroom from that moment on started to get ready to cover this moment that we are now in.\nLeah Feiger: Well, to give you a little bit more credit first, I have a distinct memory, and not to reveal any private conversations, but I have a distinct memory after that weekend of talking with you and some of the other folks on the team. We were talking about the fact that Elon Musk had endorsed Trump and that was ... he'd been gearing up to that for many months, but this was his first big one. This was official. You said, \"It's different now,\" and you were right. We have continued to cover it through that lens. The addition of Musk to all of this was not like anything that anyone could have predicted. Our strategy ended up having to cover Musk fully almost as this political entity.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: With his relationship to Trump, but also his relationship to the campaign. I remember we broke a lot of news in the lead-up to the campaign about Elon Musk's America Pack and the really ridiculous things happening there, where he was outsourcing to campaign staffers who ended up getting shoved into U-Haul vans and driven around and given insane quotas and not paid. There was mess from the beginning, and his hands were in all of it.\nKatie Drummond: And his money too.\nLeah Feiger: And his money too.\nKatie Drummond: To the tune of I think $278 million in campaign contributions.\nLeah Feiger: And he's recouped all of that, and then some.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. This has been very good for Musk-owned entities.\nLeah Feiger: Very, very good. When we're thinking about how our coverage changed and became informed, it was taking him very seriously. I think that the mistake that ... How many journalists have relitigated the mistake of covering Trump from his first term in office, which was taking everything he said at face value.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: I'm going to deport every single person that I do not like, whatever. No, there's parts of that that are true and parts of that are not. Figuring out what that looked like. Musk entering this changed the entire game. Everything that he's saying and everything that he's talking about, we're taking incredibly seriously. Not literally, but seriously.\nKatie Drummond: I think too what's so interesting or sort of important for WIRED is that we have a lot of background on Musk, right? We understand how he operates within the companies that he owns. We have a director on staff, Zoë Schiffer, actually one of the hosts of Uncanny Valley, wrote the book Extremely Hardcore, a fantastic book about—\nLeah Feiger: Everyone go read it.\nKatie Drummond: Everyone go read Extremely Hardcore. It's such a good book. She really told the definitive story of that takeover.\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: We have this understanding of that playbook, right? His startup playbook, his Silicon Valley playbook, how he goes into companies and reshapes them in very, very drastic and often chaotic and legally dubious ways that we are now seeing play out in the government. I think that that insight and that background, to your point, allowed us to take him seriously and allowed us to contextualize a lot of this chaos that we are now seeing within the government.\nLeah Feiger: Right. Something that I always think about from Trump's first term is that it would be like, OK, we want to do X, Y, and Z, but it was very clear that they had no idea how to accomplish that. There is a clear difference this time around. Musk went into USDS and then immediately went after the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, basically the government's HR, and these key agencies that had access to other agencies and had access to just a ton of data and classified information and building records. Just so many things that are really core to how the US government ticks. Figuring out where to even enter the colossus that is the federal system, he figured that out.\nKatie Drummond: Right. There was a plan, there was a playbook.\nLeah Feiger: There was a plan. There was absolutely a plan. Being able to balance the chaos and planned chaos with also a very clear understanding of where to make the most impact. The treasury is such a good example of that. We're in this holding pattern right now. After our reporting that DOGE had read and write access, 18 attorneys general from around the country sued the Trump administration. There's now a temporary hold from a federal judge until Friday to say that not only can DOGE not have this access, they have to destroy anything they've taken out of these sensitive Treasury payment systems. Musk meanwhile is tweeting away and saying, \"We should have access. This is ridiculous. Why are you taking this from us? This is a breach of federal jurisdiction.\" Vance is getting in on it, too. Causing this chaos, causing this new cycle, but also knowing exactly what to target and exactly what will get him where he wants to go, it's wild to watch.\nKatie Drummond: It is wild. While all of that chaos plays out in front of the American people and sort of obfuscates and puts up some smoke around what's going on, I think what's important to know from WIRED is that we are really committed to just answering some very simple questions. I think that's what we set out to do with this DOGE reporting in the first place. It's what is this organization? What is it designed to do? Who works for it? What exactly are they doing inside of these agencies? That's all we're trying to figure out.\nLeah Feiger: Exactly.\nKatie Drummond: Those are the questions that our journalists have been trying to answer for the last several weeks and will continue trying to answer as we push forward with this reporting. We're going to take a short break and we'll be back in a minute.\n\nKatie Drummond: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. I'm here with Leah Feiger, our politics editor, and we are talking all things DOGE and federal government.\nNow, Leah, we talked right before we jumped into the studio. You are working on yet another scoop, and you have a look of panic in your eyes, so we do need to get moving soon. Before we leave the studio and you rush back to your desk, tell me what you and your team are keeping an eye on now. As you look ahead, I mean, it's hard to look past the next few days, but as you look to the next few days, and maybe the next few weeks, what stands out to you? What should people be paying attention to?\nLeah Feiger: A lot of people have been writing this over the last two days, and to echo so many who are much smarter than me, we're gearing up to a constitutional crisis right now. Musk, Vance, a number of people from the GOP, Trump administration have made it very clear that they're not actually that interested in abiding by these court orders, or even temporary court holds that we have, for example, right now with DOGE's access to the Treasury. What happens next? We're keeping a very close eye. As these court orders continue to come down, will DOGE's team be abiding by them? Is it just a lot of bluster saying, \"Oh, we don't think that you should be able to exercise this power over us.\" Are they actually abiding by them? If they don't abide by them, what happens next? This whole country is built on checks and balances, and not to go entirely Schoolhouse Rock, but we're about to enter some uncharted territory.\nKatie Drummond: It is very surreal. I remember just in the last few weeks talking to people about it's chaos, DOGE is doing all of these different things in all of these agencies. What's going to happen? My answer was they're moving very quickly. The courts move more slowly, but the courts will catch up to this. There are lawsuits being filed. There are individuals petitioning the courts for temporary—\nLeah Feiger: And so many have been. Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: So many have been, so my answer has been, this will go through court and it will churn through the legal system, and it will be slow and messy and painful, but that is what the legal system is here to protect and is here to safeguard is our democracy and these checks and balances. This is sort of the last stand, right?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: The courts are the last stand in terms of our democracy and constitutional integrity. What we are now looking at is the possibility that that may not hold. What would that even begin to look like if that came to pass? I know that you're not a legal expert in addition to being WIRED's politics editor, but what have you heard? What have experts told you in the course of your reporting?\nLeah Feiger: There's a lot of people that are saying, \"Look, these holds are going to come through. Musk and Trump are going to be appealing them, and then eventually this is going to end in the Supreme Court.\" A lot of people are actually taking solace with this. They're saying, \"Yes, the court may be leaning quite Republican ideologically, but these are trained professionals who will understand that these legal systems must be upheld and adhered to.\" I'm not as confident in that.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: I'll be totally honest. In terms of what happens next, I think that because of, in some ways, the slow march of these court systems, although decisions, even temporary ones, have been coming down really fast, there's a lot of room to move fast and break things from DOGE's side meanwhile.\nKatie Drummond: Yeah.\nLeah Feiger: A lot of these eggs can't get unscrambled. A lot of these layoffs and firings and foreclosures are ... It's going to be really hard to walk those back once a court is able to finally say, \"No, no, no, this just can't hold.\" And that's—\nKatie Drummond: If they can say that at all.\nLeah Feiger: If they can say that at all.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: We're hearing that concern from experts all across the board right now. We've never seen anything like this.\nKatie Drummond: We certainly haven't. Not here in the United States. No.\nLeah Feiger: Not here in the United States.\nKatie Drummond: Well, in the meantime, we hold our breath. We keep doing the work, and we will keep delivering to all of you, WIRED listeners and WIRED readers, our reporting, what we know as we know it. That is our commitment to you. You can read all the reporting that Leah and her team are doing at WIRED.com. Leah, thank you so much for taking the time to be here with me. I know how busy you are.\nLeah Feiger: Thank you so much. I love to talk about government takeovers with you, Katie.\nKatie Drummond: Well, now go get a granola bar from my office.\nLeah Feiger: About to go steal one immediately.\nKatie Drummond: That's our show for today.

Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., called the One Flag For All Act, after the now-gone administration of Joe Biden prominently featured the leftist ideology-advancing LGBT emblem on the White House in a place where the Stars and Stripes normally reigns.\n\nA report in the Washington Examiner said the congressional action comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s “One Flag Policy” that instructs the State Department to ban flags representing Black Lives Matter, LGBT pride, or any other emblems of leftist ideologies from flying over U.S. government buildings anywhere in the world.\n\nThat is an executive order that could be reversed by a future leftist occupant of the Oval Office. The congressional action would embed the standard into the federal law, which is more difficult to change.\n\nThe report explained, “Harshbarger’s bill, also supported by Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., in the Senate, has a higher probability of becoming law now that Trump is in the White House. The bill was not taken up for a vote during the 118th Congress, but the policy was tucked into appropriations legislation in March 2024 for State Department facilities.”\n\nThe report Harshbarger’s legislation is broader, and covers all federal buildings, banning most flags with exceptions for the National League of Families POW/MIA flag, member of Congress’s state flags, flags representing a branch of the armed forces, and flags representing a visiting diplomat’s or representative’s nation.\n\nTrump, during his first term, had declined requests from various embassies to prioritize the LGBT flag over the American flag, but Joe Biden promptly allowed those promotions to be done at taxpayer expense.\n\n“The Left is never going to stop at anything to do what they think is right,” Harshbarger said. “So if you get this codified into legislation, this bill will keep — the only thing you can fly on things like federal public buildings will be the American flag.”\n\nShe continued, “This flag represents our great nation’s core values of liberty, freedom, and patriotism, and it’s a symbol that everyone understands and they’re proud — if you’re an American, you should be proud when you see that flag.”\n\nNearly two dozen other representatives already have co-sponsored the plan.\n\nBiden had started promoting the LGBT flag over Old Glory almost as soon as he got into the White House. He boasted how “transgender Americans make our Nation more prosperous, vibrant, and strong.”\n\nKamala Harris joined in:\n\nTransgender rights are human rights. Today, in honor of transgender Americans everywhere, @POTUS signed a proclamation to recognize March 31st as #TransgenderDayofVisibility.\nWe see you, and we will always stand up for you.\n— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) March 31, 2021\n\nBiden, in fact, tried multiple times to simply redefine the word “sex” in existing non-discrimination laws to make it mean “gender identity” or “gender preference” to impose his pro-transgender beliefs. His claim was that lawmakers back in the 1960s and 1979s when many nondiscrimination requirements were created, specifically intended to include transgender protections under their idea of equal treatment for the sexes.\n\nAccording to the science, being male or female is embedded in the human body down to the DNA level, and does not change.\n\nTrump, on taking office, recognized that, stating that the federal government’s recognition now will be of two sexes, male and female.","summary":"Would halt use of taxpayers' assets to promote extremist ideologies","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/congress-considering-ban-on-pride-flags-on-federal-buildings/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LGBT-flags-gay-pride-white-house-building.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 17:08:18","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":290247336,"title":"Not cool anymore? Trump sees massive drop in young people support after riding them to an election win","text":"A new poll shows President Donald Trump’s much-vaunted success with younger voters seems to have stalled, as his approval rating among that demographic continues to fall.\n\nJust 39 percent of adults under 30-years-old who responded to the latest Economist/YouGov poll reported a favorable opinion of Trump. That number stood at 50 percent just two weeks ago. Adults in the 30- to 44-years-old bracket who view him favorably also dropped from 45 percent to 42 percent. \n\nOverall, 46 percent of respondents approve of Trump’s second presidency, according to this week’s poll, a drop of three percent compared to late last month. Similarly, just 46 percent of respondents view him favorably personally, a drop from last month’s 50 percent.\n\nThe increasing scepticism among young Americans comes after Trump won big with youth voters in his race against former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump won nearly 50 percent of voters 18- to 29-years-old in 2024, according to AP VoteCast. While youth voters make up just 15 percent of his coalition, AP VoteCast reports, he saw a massive increase in their support last year after winning just one-third of the demographic in 2020.\n\nBut the president has tried to inflate this win, claiming in December that he “won youth by 34 points.” While most reputable exit polls show Trump was up with youth voters, they also show him within just points of Harris — not 34 points above her. \n\nTrump reportedly worked the youth vote by consulting his 18-year-old son Barron Trump throughout his campaign. Barron, a first-year student at New York University, reportedly pitched and approved key media personalities popular among young men for his father to sit down with. These included YouTuber Logan Paul, comedian Theo Von and podcaster Joe Rogan.\n\nTrump’s drop is popularity is mirrored by his “first buddy” Elon Musk, the same Economist/YouGov poll shows. Some 44 percent of respondents had a “very unfavorable” view of the billionaire, drastically up from 36 percent last week.\n\nThis comes as the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency continues to wield massive power over the federal government. Voters are feeling DOGE’s effects too, with 63 percent of respondents believing that Musk has a lot of influence, an increase from 51 percent last week, the Economist/YouGov poll shows. \n\nTrump handed Musk and DOGE even more power this week, after he signed an executive order requiring agencies to cooperate with the agency.\n\nThose polled seemed to acknowledge, and largely disagree, Trump’s faith in Musk, with just 18 percent of respondents wanting X owner to have a lot of influence.\n\nWhen a reporter asked for Musk’s response to criticisms that his efforts constitute a “hostile takeover” of the executive branch, he responded: “The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get.”\n\nMany of Trump’s key policies are also proving incredibly unpopular, with only his ban on transgender women and girls participating in women’s sports gaining widespread support. \n\nBut the rest of his policies face low approval ratings. Just 36 percent of respondents approve of deporting U.S. citizens convicted of crimes to foreign prisons, while just 35 percent approve of ending humanitarian aid to foreign countries. \n\nHis worst-rated policies are abolishing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, with just 16 percent of respondents approving, while 58 percent of people disapprove of closing the Department of Education. His policy of ending a free online tax filing system run by the IRS has also proven to be massively unpopular, with just 15 percent of those asked approving. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.","summary":"Trump won nearly 50 percent of youth voters in the 2024 election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-youth-vote-approval-rating-b2697754.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/12/23/Trump_77695.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ifVcPamw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-13 16:52:10","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.112},{"id":290219138,"title":"How JB Pritzker has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal Democratic critics","text":"SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Gov.

Since Trump was sworn in, Pritzker has done two CNN interviews, an MSNBC Sunday show and a profile in Puck — a national political newsletter. He’s often asked in the interviews how Democrats can infiltrate a Trump-driven news cycle.\n\n“We need to make sure that we’re communicating properly,” Pritzker said in a CNN interview on Jan. 26. “I think that’s one of the big challenges that we had in the last election: our message wasn’t right.”\n\nPritzker helped organize a call at the end of January between some Democratic governors and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York to encourage Senate Democrats to more forcefully push back on Trump, according to The New York Times.\n\nStephen Maynard Caliendo, a political science professor at North Central College in Naperville, said while Pritzker has always been a vocal leader, it seems to have “ramped up” in Trump’s second term.\n\n“It appears to me that he sees an opportunity to capture the American imagination a bit,” Caliendo said in an interview.\n\nAsked Monday how he has sets himself apart from other Democrats in responding to Trump, Pritzker said he sees negative impacts already coming from Trump’s policies.\n\n“People have been promised something by this Trump administration that he is not delivering,” Pritzker said this week. “They’ve been promised lower prices. They’ve been promised lower grocery prices. They’ve been promised lower gas prices. They’ve been promised more affordability and that is precisely the opposite of what’s happening.”\n\nWeighing in \n\nJust about every major story coming out of the Trump White House has been fair game for Pritzker. That includes the president’s reaction to a crash between an American Airlines plane and Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C.\n\n“While times of tragedy should be focused on mourning the victims and getting answers to their loved ones, we face the unfortunate reality that we must be honest with the nation about: Donald Trump is unfit to lead during moments of crisis like this,” Pritzker said in a statement.\n\nTrump blamed the crash on efforts to hire a more diverse workforce, including people with disabilities, in the federal government.\n\nPritzker noted that he is governor of one of the busiest airspaces in the country around O’Hare and Midway airports and listed eight questions he wants the federal government to answer, including about staffing at the Federal Aviation Administration, Elon Musk’s role in personnel changes at federal agencies and if top Trump administration officials plan to cooperate in the investigation.\n\n“There’s no way to read that other than it’s an attempt to sort of gain national prominence,” Caliendo said, adding Trump gave Pritzker an opening to position himself as a progressive alternative to Trump.\n\nOther issues Pritzker has focused on directly affect Illinois. He’s defended the state’s “sanctuary” laws for immigrants, slammed Trump for proposing tariffs that would likely raise prices for Illinois consumers and quickly organized a news conference to explain the effects of a proposed federal spending freeze on Illinois.\n\n“I have to say that the last 48 hours have been among the most bizarre and terrible since I took office back in the middle of Trump’s first term,” Pritzker told CNN’s Anderson Cooper after the federal spending freeze was announced then rescinded.\n\nAmid all the criticism, Pritzker has said there’s been no communication between Illinois and Trump or the White House.\n\nLooking to 2028\n\nPritzker, who turned 60 in January, was vetted as a possible running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, but he wasn’t a well-known or popular choice among Democratic voters. A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll last July found just 7% of Democrats thought Pritzker should be Harris’ running mate.\n\nPritzker has downplayed any interest in running for president when asked by reporters but admitted last August he was “torn” about leaving Illinois to become vice president should he have been selected by Harris and won the election.\n\n“You don’t get on that list unless they think you actually could be president of the United States and do the job if you had to,” Pritzker told reporters in August.\n\nGovernors have good paths to the presidency because of their executive experience overseeing a state government, Caliendo said. If Pritzker is interested in running for president in 2028, there will be more obvious signs than him criticizing Trump, he added.\n\n“If he starts heading out to a lot of visits to South Carolina and Iowa and New Hampshire, that’s when you really start to get tipped off,” Caliendo said. “Right now, this could be laying the groundwork for that, but it isn’t that out of the ordinary that somebody who feels as protected, I think, as he does to make himself one of the chief critics of the president.”","summary":"Gov.

These include Patel’s reported role in a planned political purge of FBI agents and his apparent lies to the committee regarding that and other matters. And there’s much more. Patel has received payments from sources linked to Russia, China, Qatar, and other foreign interests that he has not explained, or, in one case, divested from. He has embraced false and dangerous conspiracy theories, including falsehoods about the 2020 election. He has endorsed using government power to seek revenge against his and Donald Trump’s political enemies. He has even seemingly encouraged violence against Trump critics.\n\nRepublicans don’t seem to care about any of this. In fact, they appear eager to confirm Patel before more damaging information about him emerges. Here is a rundown of some of the matters these Republicans are ignoring.\n\nOn January 30, the same day Patel appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing, news broke that Trump administration officials had ordered the firing of multiple senior FBI executives. The next day, reports emerged that Trump appointees were compiling a list of thousands of FBI agents who had worked on January 6 cases, with the possible aim of firing them.\n\nPatel told the Judiciary Committee—under oath—that he was not involved in personnel issues nor in touch with the White House about any such decisions. He further claimed he would protect FBI officials from political retribution for past work.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, accused Patel of lying about this. In a letter to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Durbin said he had learned from “multiple sources that Kash Patel has been personally directing the ongoing purge of career civil servants” at the FBI. In that letter and during a Senate floor speech, Durbin said whistleblowers told him that Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, a former personal lawyer for Trump, told top FBI officials in a January 29 meeting that Patel wanted the bureau to remove targeted employees quickly. “KP wants movement at FBI,” a person at the meeting wrote in notes that Durbin said he reviewed.\n\nDurbin also said his sources reported that Patel, as he has awaited confirmation, has been receiving information from an advisory team at the FBI and then passing on instructions to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, “who relays it to” Bove.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chair of the Judiciary Committee, dismissed Durbin’s new charges as “hearsay.” He expressed no interest in gathering more information and rejected Democrats’ call for a second confirmation hearing where they could ask Patel directly about the firings of FBI officials. \n\nResponding to Durbin’s letter and floor speech, a Patel spokesperson said, “The media is relying on anonymous sources and secondhand gossip to push a false narrative.” That was not a clear denial. When Mother Jones asked if Patel communicated with Miller about firing FBI personnel, neither Patel nor his spokesperson responded.\n\nPossible perjury\n\nDuring Patel’s confirmation hearing, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) asked, “Are you aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations?” Patel said he was “not aware of that” and added: “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there.”\n\nPatel made similar claims in written responses to questions that six Democratic senators sent to him after the hearing. Each of these senators submitted queries regarding whether Patel knew of plans to oust senior FBI officials and whether he was involved in that effort. He repeatedly answered that he could not recall any such conversations and claimed he was not involved in these decisions.\n\n“Did you approve or have any role in the decision to terminate these senior FBI employees?” Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) asked. “No,” Patel responded.\n\nThose replies, if Durbin is correct, were lies. But Grassley and other Republicans are unwilling to confront Patel about this possible perjury.\n\nOther possible lies\n\nAsked during his testimony about his promotion of a recording of a song performed by the so-called J6 Prison Choir, which was comprised of inmates at a DC jail who faced assorted charges for their participation in the January 6 insurrection, Patel said he was “not aware” that this group was composed of imprisoned rioters. He also testified that he “didn’t have anything to do with the recording.” In fact, Patel personally released the song on Steve Bannon’s War Room show, and told Bannon that he had overseen the song’s recording and mastering. And he hailed the J6 rioters as “political prisoners.”\n\nPatel has insisted that the money he raised from the recording went to the families of January 6 prisoners who were not convicted of any violent offenses. In his written responses, he claimed “the financial details” on his use of the funds were in his organization’s public disclosures. That’s not true. Patel’s nonprofit, the Kash Foundation, says in an IRS filing that it gave “direct cash assistance” totaling $167,821 to 50 people, but it does not identify them. That leaves Patel’s claim that he did not support families of violent attackers impossible to verify.\n\nPatel also said under oath that he was not familiar with Stew Peters, a far-right and antisemitic podcaster known for spreading false claims about Covid. Patel, however, has appeared at least eight times on Peters’ podcast. Following the hearing, Peters declared: “Clearly Kash Patel is lying.”\n\nTies to Russian propagandist\n\nAs Mother Jones first reported, Patel last year was paid $25,000 to appear in an anti-FBI documentary produced by a Ukrainian-American-Russian filmmaker with Kremlin ties. That filmmaker, Igor Lopatonok, worked on an overt Russian propaganda campaign funded by Vladimir Putin’s office, and in 2019 he produced a pro-Putin film partly financed by an Ukrainian oligarch and pro-Kremlin politician who had been sanctioned by the United States since 2014. Lopatonok also worked with an American who obtained political asylum in Russia and who has mounted extensive disinformation operations against the United States.\n\nPatel declared in the documentary that the Russians had not intervened in the 2016 election—despite multiple investigations confirming they did so to assist Trump—and Patel said that he hoped to “shut down the FBI headquarters building and open it up as a museum of the “Deep State.” Patel later said that remark was “hyperbole.” He has not explained whether he knew of the filmmaker’s background as a Russian propagandist.\n\nForeign ties\n\nIn the financial disclosure form Patel submitted to the Senate, he revealed that he was paid an unspecified amount in 2024 for “consulting services” for Qatar. That raised the question of why Patel did not register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Patel has not addressed that subject. But a “source close to Patel’s confirmation” told the far-right Federalist that “his work for Qatar was limited to securing the 2022 FIFA World Cup and other security measures” and that this did not require him to register as foreign agent.\n\nThe problem with that explanation is that Patel reported working for Qatar until November 2024. That was two years after the World Cup took place there. And it includes the time Patel spent working as a surrogate for Trump’s most recent presidential campaign. Patel’s disclosure form notes that he was paid by the Qatari embassy in Washington, which runs the Gulf state’s US lobbying efforts, not Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, which organized the nation’s World Cup effort and related programs. Spokespersons for Patel, the Supreme Committee, and the Qatari embassy did not answer questions regarding the details of Patel’s work for Qatar.\n\nPatel’s financial disclosure report also revealed he worked for the Czechoslovak Group, a Prague-based arms company, as it was buying Vista Outdoor, a US company that owns assorted ammunition brands, including Remington. Senate Republicans previously argued that the Vista Outdoor purchase was a threat to national security. But none have publicly asked Patel to explain what he did for the Czechoslovak firm.\n\nPatel also disclosed that he was given between $1 million and $5 million worth of unvested stock in Elite Depot Ltd. for consulting work he did not explain. Elite Deport is the Cayman Islands-based parent company of Shein, a Chinese fashion company. Patel has declined to divest his stake in the company—even as he prepares to oversee FBI counterintelligence operations against China. After Trump slapped a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, including Shein’s, Patel’s stake in the company means he has a personal interest aligned with Chinese business interests.\n\nIn a letter sent to Patel on Wednesday, five Democrats on the committee noted Shein has faced “criticism for its use of forced labor in China, including persecuted ethnic minorities and children.”\n\n“Continuing to profit from forced labor by refusing to divest your financial interest in this company,” they wrote, “demonstrates a callous disregard for forced labor victims and calls into question your judgment and ability to impartially lead the FBI’s efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking and the PRC’s foreign influence activities.”\n\nA few years ago GOP senators aggressively opposed some Biden administration nominees for perceived links to, or past work for, Chinese businesses. But no Republicans have publicly pressed Patel about his plan to retain an interest in a Chinese manufacturer.\n\nPatel has pushed far-right conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump; the baseless claim that the January 6 riot was instigated by the FBI; and the false notion that there was no Russian effort to help Trump win the 2016 election. But perhaps his looniest far-right flirtation has been his past support for QAnon, the movement that holds that a cabal of global, Satanic, cannibalistic elitists and pedophiles—which includes Democratic politicians, Hollywood celebrities, and business tycoons—has been operating a child sex trafficking operation as it vies for world domination, with Trump secretly battling against them. And QAnon is not just a kooky theory; it has sparked multiple acts of violence.\n\nPatel repeatedly has hailed QAnoners and promoted their unhinged narrative. On social media, he amplified QAnon messaging. He has been a guest on numerous QAnon-supporting shows to promote Trump’s Truth Social platform. On one show, Patel declared, “Whether it’s the Qs of the world, who I agree with some of what he does and I disagree with some of what he does, if it allows people to gather and focus on the truth and the facts, I’m all for it.” On another occasion, he agreed with a host who said Q had “been so right on so many things.” Patel chimed in: “There’s a lot of good to a lot of it.”\n\nWhen Democratic senators inquired about those comments, Patel insisted his remarks were “taken out of context.” He asserted, “I do not support or promote QAnon.” His past comments show he did precisely that.\n\nRetribution and violence\n\nPatel has long portrayed himself as an avenging angel for Trump who has battled the supposed Deep State on Trump’s behalf. Appearing on Bannon’s podcast in 2023, he proclaimed, “We will go and find the conspirators—not just in government, but in the media. Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens to help Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We’re going to come after you, whether its criminally or civilly.”\n\nIn his 2023 book Government Gangsters, Patel called for mounting “investigations” to “take on the Deep State.” In an appendix, Patel presented a list of 60 supposed members of the Deep State who were current or former executive branch officials and who presumably would be targeted. Patel listed names that would be the obvious purported cabalists for a MAGA activist, including Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Merrick Garland, Hillary Clinton, former CIA chief John Brennan, and former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. This line-up also included a number of Republicans and onetime Trump appointees: Bill Barr, who served as attorney general for Trump; John Bolton, one of Trump’s national security advisers during his first White House stint; and Mark Esper, a secretary of defense under Trump.\n\nThis roster has been characterized as Patel’s “enemies list” of people he might target for investigation or prosecution should he become FBI chief. During his confirmation hearing, Patel denied he had any intention of seeking revenge against Trump’s political foes. He referred to this list as merely a “glossary.”\n\nWhen Senate Democrats challenged him on this characterization in written questions—noting he had told Bannon that “Deep Staters” would “be held accountable and prosecuted, criminal prosecutions” during a second Trump presidency—Patel sidestepped. “This language is taken out of context and does not accurately or fully represent my prior statements or positions,” he wrote. No Republican Senator has publicly expressed concern over Patel’s demonstrated desire to use government power to extract revenge.\n\nOne of the most absurd moments of the hearing came when Patel was questioned about a 2022 social media post he had amplified that showed an AI-generated video of him using a chainsaw to attack various Trump critics, including former Rep. Liz Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff, and Anthony Fauci. He claimed this meme had been taken out of context—it hadn’t—and pointed out that he had not created it, as if that were mitigating. Asked about this meme in the written questions, Patel replied that he had reposted the “meme in question as a private citizen.” He added, “It was clearly intended as humor. A chainsaw as a symbol of government reform is not unusual.” He also stated that “reposting an individual’s perspective on a specific issue does not constitute my endorsement of how their views or other positions may be interpreted.”\n\nHere was a nominee to be FBI director both justifying and downplaying his dissemination of a meme that could be read as encouraging violence against his political enemies, including Schiff, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee overseeing his nomination. It was just one more troubling thing for Senate Republicans to ignore.","summary":"Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday morning to approve the nomination of Kash Patel to be FBI director, despite a host of issues that once would have sunk any nominee for this critical national security and law enforcement post.

The 71-year-old Kennedy Scion is a prominent lawyer and a vocal vaccine critic but he refuses to call him an anti-vaxxer as his family members are all vaccinated. RFK Jr was an independent presidential candidate against Kamala Harris and Donald Trump until he suspended his campaign to endorse Trump.\n\nKennedy Jr has been confirmed in 52--48 votes with every Democrat and McConnell voting against him. Republican Mitch McConnell who voted against defense secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard again voted against Kennedy Jr.\n\nAhead of the vote, minority leader Chuck Schumer said Kennedy is not remotely qualified for the job. “Robert F Kennedy Jr is not remotely qualified to become the next secretary of health and human services. In fact, I might go further. Robert F Kennedy Jr might be one of the least qualified people the president could have chosen for the job,” Schumer said.\n\n\"If the Senate had a secret ballot, I bet you that Robert F Kennedy Jr would never have come close to confirmation,\" Schumer said.\n\nWhat is Kennedy Jr's Make America Healthy Again?\n\nIn line with Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan, RFK Jr raised a Make America Healthy Again pledge in which he promised to cut out junk and ultra-processed food from the American diet and ban other harmful chemicals and additives. He said he would not ban junk food as his boss Donald Trump is a fan of them but would enforce healthier oil for frying.\n\nKennedy Jr's weird tryst with animals\n\nKennedy Jr acknowledged several incidents that involved wild animals mostly because he's very interested and experimental about them. Kennedy Jr once beheaded a dead whale that had washed up on the shores of Squaw Island as he wanted to study its skull. He then tied the whale to the top of his van and took it home. Another weird incident involved a dead bear and the Central Park of New York. He said he saw a bear get hit and killed by a car in front of him. He planned to take it home but as he got engaged in some other work and could not head home, he left the bear in Central Park.\n\nAbout the Author\nTOI World Desk\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Trump administration has rightly declared that DEI programs clearly violate civil rights laws by judging people on the basis of skin color.\n\nThe White House documents back up the administration’s previous claims that DOGE had unearthed large amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse. DOGE, a temporary agency headed by Elon Musk, aims to clean up the federal government ahead the July 4, 2026, deadline terminating the agency.\n\nThe documents include a $36,126 contract from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility training for leadership and supervisors who manage teams.” The document shows that, while the original contract only obligated USCIS to pay $12,000 for the DEI training, the “total contract value” reached three times that amount.\n\nAnother contract shows that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office paid $2.86 million for a “public relations firm contract” for the Council for Inclusive Innovation. The performance of the contract began in March 2023 and was scheduled to run into March 2026 before the Trump administration canceled it.\n\nAccording to the Patent and Trademark Office, the Council for Inclusive Innovation grew from a report finding that “women and minorities are underrepresented as inventors and as patentees named on U.S.-granted patents.” The council aimed to “support a national strategy for increased participation of underrepresented groups in innovation.”\n\nAnother contract revealed that the U.S. Forest Service paid $35,338.58 for “Sri Lanka climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience coordinator services.” The contract started in September 2023 and ran until Jan. 30.\n\nWhile it may be noble to pay for Sri Lanka, a country off the coast of India, to beef up its infrastructure to face natural disasters, this grant follows the logic of climate alarmism, which attributes any natural disaster to the supposed ill effects of human beings burning fossil fuels. Furthermore, Americans may be distraught to see their tax dollars funding such projects across the world, especially funds from the Forest Service, which should be taking care of America’s forests, not shoveling money to Sri Lanka.\n\nAnother contract revealed that the Department of Defense paid $2.3 million “to support its virtual reality training course featuring a DEI avatar” at Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n“In line with the command’s effort to incorporate digital-age technology across the command, the Leading Inclusively Virtual Experience, or LIVE, program is a modernized tool that consists of a mixed virtual reality experience that uses a combination of interactive scenarios with authentic, real-time dialogue to challenge individuals to engage in difficult diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) conversations,” the grant states.\n\nTwo million dollars for a virtual reality DEI avatar? Are you kidding me?\n\nAnother contract revealed that the Department of Labor paid $4.1 million for “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) consultation services and training for the Job Corps program.” The contract started in June 2022 and the Trump administration terminated it on Jan. 22.\n\nThese grants represent a few isolated examples of the waste and abuse in the federal government.\n\nDOGE has highlighted how one agency in particular, the U.S. Agency for International Development, has directed Americans’ tax dollars to promote “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and transgender orthodoxy internationally. USAID has often allied with the organization launched by notorious Hungarian American billionaire and left-wing donor George Soros, the Open Society Foundations. USAID has directed money to the same entities abroad that Open Society supports, and even feeds former USAID staff to the foundation. \n\nOpen Society, now run by Soros’ son Alex, is a major force in my book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government.” The book reveals how the Left’s dark money network funds a system of left-wing nonprofits that staffed and advised the Biden administration.\n\nAs the Capital Research Center’s Parker Thayer has revealed, USAID awarded more than $4.2 billion in grants to “miscellaneous foreign awardees.” USAID may censor the name of grant recipients for security purposes, but it strains credulity that the agency truly needs to hide the recipients of $4.2 billion of taxpayer funding.\n\nTrump and DOGE currently face lawsuits from some of the same organizations I exposed in “The Woketopus,” particularly unions like the AFL-CIO and its affiliate, the American Federation of Government Employees.\n\nMeanwhile, 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Kamala Harris say they won’t obey a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.","summary":"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the press Wednesday that the White House would provide screenshots of the contracts the Department of Government Efficiency...

This is a drop from the plus 19 favorable rating he scored among this demographic in the days following November's race.Newsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.Why It MattersTrump made significant gains among young and first-time voters in the 2024 election compared to 2020. This was cited as a potential ideological shift for the youth vote. The poll results suggest Republicans cannot rely on this historically Democratic-leaning voting bloc for support in future elections.What to KnowThe latest Economist/YouGov poll showed that a majority of U.S. adults have an unfavorable view of Trump (52 percent), while 46 percent hold a positive view of him, giving the president a net favorable score of minus 6.The survey was conducted between February 9 and 11 among 1,595 adults. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.When broken down further to 315 respondents aged 18-29, the poll finds that Trump has a 39 percent favorable rating, compared to 57 percent who said they have an unfavorable view of the Republican president.A previous Economist/YouGov survey conducted from November 17 to 19 produced almost the opposite results.Among 340 younger voters who participated in the November survey, 57 percent said they had a favorable view of the president, including 36 percent who said they had a \"very favorable\" view. And 38 percent of 18-29-year-olds previously said they had an unfavorable view of Trump.Prior to the 2024 election, Trump appeared on podcasts popular with younger audiences, such as The Joe Rogan Experience and This Past Weekend with Theo Von, in an effort to appeal to new voters.Trump went on to win 47 percent of the vote among the 18-29 demographic—a jump from about one-third in 2020—compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris' 51 percent, according to AP VoteCast analysis of more than 120,000 voters.The president was initially seen as having an easy win immediately after reentering office on January 20 by signing an executive order granting TikTok, the video-sharing platform hugely popular among young people, a 75-day reprieve from being shut down in the U.S.TikTok was set to be banned in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sold it off by January 19. The law banning the app over national security concerns was passed by Congress in April 2024 and later signed by then President Joe Biden.Trump's decline in favorability among younger voters follows the introduction of several policies and proposals that may be unpopular with younger demographics.These include his mass deportation plan, targeting of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and suggesting that the U.S. will \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and resettle Palestinians from the area while it is rebuilt.What People Are SayingRepublican strategist Brian Seitchik told The Hill on February 1 about Trump's TikTok deal: \"That is certainly very appealing to influencers and young voters, a demographic that Trump exceeded expectations with in the 2024 race—a group that has not been particularly favorable to Republicans in decades.\"The question for Republicans running nationally and statewide is often, 'How can we stem the bleeding on young voters?' And Trump has found a way to get to something that very much matters to these voters and impact the influencers that then affect these younger voters.\"David B. Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron in Ohio, told Newsweek shortly after 2024 Election Day: \"Young voters compose a crucial part of the Democratic base and if that is eroding, where do they make up for that? Going forward, Democrats will have to figure out how to bring young voters back to the fold—particularly young men—if they want to be competitive nationally.\"","summary":"A poll shows the president's net favorable rating among those aged 18-29 has fallen dramatically in the past three months.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-gen-z-popularity-favorable-rating-yougov-2030595","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587726/donald-trump-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 15:56:31","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":290167164,"title":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are 'taking a break from the spotlight'","text":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are taking a break from the spotlight.\n\nThe two wanted some down time after his crushing Super Bowl loss and her getting mercilessly booed at the big game, People claimed.\n\nSeveral fans think they will hide out on her very private $17M Rhode Island mansion.\n\n'A great place where no one can find them? Rhode Island,' shared a fan on X while another added, 'RI chill time on the schedule no doubt.'\n\nBut that home is under renovation until the end of 2025, so it is likely they will hide out at another one of her residences. Swift reportedly has homes in Los Angeles, New York City and Nashville. \n\nThey are planning to 'have a break together' after a being in the public eye for most of last year.\n\nThe source confirmed to People, 'Their lives have been a whirlwind since they first started dating. Things seem great between them, and they're incredibly happy together.'\n\nThey added that the Super Bowl, which the Chiefs lost, 'was upsetting for everyone.'\n\nThus comes after Travis said he is lucky: 'I have a beautiful life,'Travis told his brother during the latest episode of New Heights. \n\n'I have a beautiful life, man. I have loved ones. I have the most amazing family in the world that supports me in everything that I do, and they were all there, you know, cheering me on and hoping for the best on Sunday.'\n\nKelce is considering his future after losing the Super Bowl.\n\nThe 35-year-old sports star plans to take some time to consider his options before he decides whether to return to the NFL next season or not.\n\nTravis - who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs franchise - said on his New Heights podcast: 'I know everybody wants to know whether or not I'm playing next year, and right now, I'm just kicking everything down the road. I'm not making any crazy decisions.'\n\nThe sports star admitted that losing to the Philadelphia Eagles at the Super Bowl was a 'tough pill to swallow'.\n\nAnd Travis will only return next season if he's fully committed to the idea.\n\nHe explained: 'I'm gonna take some time to figure it out. And, I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back, it's a wholehearted decision. I'm not half-a**ing it, and I'm fully here for them.'\n\nMeanwhile, Travis recently admitted to being inspired by Taylor during her Eras Tour.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs star said during a pre-game press conference: 'What I saw on that tour last year was pretty remarkable.\n\n'To see the week-in, week-out travelling from one country to the next and how excruciating it is on her body and on her mind - and it's not just her. It was her entire tour. It was an absolute machine and it was something I could admire watching.'\n\nTravis - who began dating Taylor in 2023 - also revealed that he'd been focusing on his diet ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nHe said: 'I've been eating clean. I haven't been drinking as much, a little lower on the pounds this week. So, hopefully I can run away from some Eagles out there.'\n\nThis comes after Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley said he doesn't understand NFL fans booing Swift.\n\nThe Cruel Summer hitmaker was jeered by fans at the Super Bowl last weekend where she was attending in support of her boyfriend - Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce - and the Eagles running back was puzzled by the hostile reaction to the star's presence at the game.\n\nSaquon told Sirius XM's 'The Howard Stern Show': 'I remember they showed her on the jumbotron, and she got booed.\n\n'I don't get it. I don't get why she was getting hate there. She was there supporting her significant other.'\n\nTaylor's appearances at Chiefs games have earned significant attention in the press and Barkley argues that the pop star's presence has helped grow the sport's audience.\n\nThe 28-year-old NFL star said: 'She made the game bigger.\n\n'In football, we're all about, 'How can we expand the game and make it more international?'\n\n'We're travelling to Brazil, we're travelling to Mexico, apparently we're travelling to Australia soon. So we're trying to expand the game, and her being a part of it's only helping that. I don't get the slack that she's getting.'\n\nHowever, US president Donald Trump - who was in attendance at the Super Bowl - had a less sympathetic reaction to Taylor, being booed after she backed his presidential rival Kamala Harris in last year's election.\n\nPosting on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote after the game: 'The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!(sic)'\n\nThe 78-year-old politician also shared a screenshot from an account called Libs of TikTok which showed fan reactions to him and Taylor, along with the caption: 'Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed – The world is healing.","summary":"Several  fans think they will hide out on her very private $17M Rhode Island mansion.

Trump, however, carried on with the litigation that included then-Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey.\n\nMusk spent more than $250 million to help get Trump elected. \n\nIt comes after fellow billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and his company, Meta, agreed to pay $25 million to settle a similar suit filed by Trump against the company after it suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6 attacks.\n\nIt was the latest instance of a large corporation settling litigation with the president, who has threatened retribution on his critics and rivals. It came as Zuckerberg joined other large technology companies in trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration.\n\nPeople said terms of Meta’s agreement included $22 million going to the nonprofit that will become Trump’s future presidential library, according to The Associated Press. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said.\n\nX, Facebook and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.” The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.\n\nBut Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity — or at least have it curtailed.\n\nThe Meta settlement came after ABC News agreed in December to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nThe network also agreed to pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump’s attorney, Alejandro Brito.\n\nTrump also filed a lawsuit against CBS News over claims that the network aired a misleading interview with his 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on the program “60 Minutes” that amounted to “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales.” The program denied the claims.\n\nAnd he has a lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, the news outlet’s parent company, Gannett, and the Iowa newspaper’s pollster Ann Selzer, alleging they violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by releasing a poll days before the November election that significantly understated his support in the state.

The Republican won 47 percent of the vote among the 18-29 demographic—a jump from about one-third in 2020—compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris' 51 percent, according to AP VoteCast analysis of more than 120,000 voters.In the 2020 election, Joe Biden beat Trump among voters under 30 and by 24 percentage points (59 percent to 35 percent), according to the Pew Research Center.Trump's appearances on podcasts that appeal to younger audiences, such as The Joe Rogan Experience and This Past Weekend with Theo Von, ahead of the 2024 election were credited as pivotal in increasing his support among Gen Z and first-time voters.Anderson said the GOP now considers itself \"cool\" for the first time in a long time. She added that while the \"pendulum may yet swing again,\" having Vance eventually lead the party seems \"clearly to be what is next\" for Republicans.A recent poll shows Vance is the top candidate among Republicans to lead the GOP in the 2028 election.The McLaughlin & Associates survey conducted between January 22 and 27 among 453 Republican voters revealed Vance was topping the list of potential candidates at 27 percent. The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, came second with 21 percent and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis third at 8 percent.What People Are SayingKristen Soltis Anderson, writing in The New York Times: \"While it is understandable that Mr. Trump is focused on the here and now, not what comes after his presidency, it is hardly too early to see the obvious. Mr. Vance is the natural inheritor of the movement Mr. Trump has built, with a keen grasp on what binds many of Mr. Trump's supporters—especially his younger supporters—to him, both in style and in substance.\"As a younger American who also happens to be vice president, Mr. Vance has been able to fuse parts of Mr. Trump's stylistic approach and policy agenda with a sense of the future that is likely to have appeal and staying power with the next generation of Republican voters.\"Mr. Vance has displayed much of what Mr. Trump's core supporters love today—a thirst for combat, an indifference to criticism, a populist posture—with a clear ability to evolve into what the Republican Party will want after Mr. Trump leaves the stage.\"President Donald Trump, when asked about Vance succeeding him by Fox News' Bret Baier, in a clip released on Monday: \"No. He's capable. I think you have a lot of very capable people so far. I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early, we're just starting.\"What Happens NextThe 2028 GOP presidential primary will be an open field, setting up the possibility for Vance to launch his own White House bid with or without Trump's endorsement.","summary":"Kristen Soltis Anderson said she was \"surprised\" the president did not want to name Vance as his successor.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-jd-vance-successor-2028-kristen-soltis-anderson-2030496","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587599/donald-trump-jd-vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 13:28:38","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.055},{"id":290277324,"title":"Pinkerton: Trump’s Iron Dome Is About Defending the Homeland","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters \n\n BREITBART\n\nJust DOGE It\nL.A.

She claimed that Trump’s Secret Service or security team made her walk excessively, which led to her heels getting damaged.\nDuring the livestream, Cardi B showcased her spiked Louboutin shoes and said, “You know, Donald Trump was at the Super Bowl today, and they were giving us a hard time.” She blamed the security arrangements for disrupting the stadium’s flow, making it difficult for attendees to move around. Calling for someone off-camera to bring her pricey heels, she added, “They stopped all the little carts because Trump was there. Now I like him even less.

The Data Was Wrong.\" \"Many in Washington bristled at the public’s failure to register how strong the economy really was. They charged that right-wing echo chambers were conning voters into believing entirely preposterous narratives about America’s decline,\" he said. \"What they rarely considered was whether something else might be responsible for the disconnect — whether, for instance, government statistics were fundamentally flawed.\" POLITICO CLAIMS SLOWER WAGE GROWTH COULD BE 'A GOOD THING FOR WORKERS' Ludwig previously served as the former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency under President Bill Clinton, part of an independent bureau in the Department of the Treasury. After his move to the private sector, he became \"increasingly skeptical that the government’s measurements properly capture the realities defining unemployment, wage growth and the strength of the economy as a whole.\" Through research under his organization, the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity, he found \"for 20 years or more, including the months prior to the election, voter perception was more reflective of reality than the incumbent statistics.\" \"Democrats, on the whole, seemed much more inclined to believe what the economic indicators reported. Republicans, by contrast, seemed more inclined to believe what they were seeing with their own two eyes,\" Ludwig observed. Though Ludwig called the agency employees providing these statistics \"talented and well-intentioned,\" he said the filters they used were \"flawed\" and the resulting calculations were \"misleading.\" In one example, he said reports on unemployment often count people \"unwillingly under-employed\" as employed and disregard Americans \"discouraged\" enough to stop looking for a job. \"[T]he prevailing statistic does not account for the meagerness of any individual’s income,\" he added. \"Thus you could be homeless on the streets, making an intermittent income and functionally incapable of keeping your family fed, and the government would still count you as ‘employed.'\" Ludwig also took aim at the claims by Democrats that inflation had cooled from its record highs and that wages had risen at a faster rate. He wrote how this was usually based on numbers from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which tracks the prices of 80,000 goods and services across the economy. However, he warned that most modest-income Americans spend more on basic amenities like groceries and rent rather than the goods from the CPI, painting a vastly different picture. \"If prices for eggs, insurance premiums and studio apartment leases rise at a faster clip than those of luxury goods and second homes, the CPI underestimates the impact of inflation on the bulk of Americans. That, of course, is exactly what has happened,\" Ludwig said. He implored both Republicans and Democrats alike to take a more accurate view of the economy and government statistics. \"[I]f the prevailing indicators remain misleading, the facts don’t apply,\" he concluded. \"We have it in our grasp to cut through the mirage that led Democrats astray in 2024. The question now is whether we will correct course.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE On Wednesday, one day after his piece, another Politico article reported on comments from former Bureau of Labor Statistics workers worried DOGE would disrupt the accuracy of the very data Ludwig said was already inaccurate. Mainstream media outlets also attempted to defend former President Biden’s economy in the weeks and months leading up to the election.

One from the ground level came from Tina Nelson, an African American woman from Detroit who worked for the Democrats as a volunteer. Nelson said Harris lost because “she got thrown in” as a candidate when President Biden withdrew three months before the election. “She just didn’t get the full respect as a candidate from ground zero to build her own brand,” Nelson said. “Black folks show up when they want to, and they don’t show up when they don’t want to.” She theorized that some Black citizens voted for Trump because they knew him better from exposure on television. “Trump came from reality TV,” she said. “And what does the average, underprivileged, underserved community watch every day? Reality TV. His brand was built way before he became president. And he’s a man. And it’s a man’s world, to be honest. Unfortunate, but it is.”\n\nHer take—at least the part about Harris’s low public profile—echoes that of Representative Debbie Dingell, who knows well Wayne County’s “Downriver” industrial suburbs, the part of the county that includes many heavy industrial factories, although not as many as there used to be. It is near Detroit’s soon-to-open Gordie Howe International Bridge to Canada and alongside the Detroit River that flows south from Lake St. Clair into Lake Erie.\n\nAs Dingell begins her sixth term in the House, her turf has shifted westward because of redistricting, and her new constituency includes Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan—but also still a slice of western Wayne County. She knows the terrain because her late husband, John Dingell, represented these Downriver communities for 59 years until she replaced him in 2015. In 2016, when she was new to the House, Debbie Dingell famously predicted that Trump could defeat Hillary Clinton in the state, though her pessimism was a minority view. As for 2024, she said, “I was not surprised that the Democrats lost Michigan,” adding, “honestly, a lot of people didn’t feel like they knew Kamala Harris.”","summary":"Brian Pannebecker first drew Donald Trump’s fond gaze by wearing tight T-shirts to Trump rallies around the Detroit area.

He has argued for the deregulation of hospitals, doctors and drugmakers because, as he claimed, they work together to keep Americans sick. \n\nDespite their deep pockets and, often, bipartisan support, drugmakers and doctors’ organizations have largely remained silent.\n\nThe American Medical Association, the country’s most prominent professional society for doctors, has spoken on RFK Jr’s nomination. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America actively said it wants to work with the Trump administration. \n\nEven the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose members provide the childhood vaccines RFK Jr has claimed cause autism, isn’t publicly opposing him. \n\nIt’s not because they aren’t concerned. Nor do they think he is the right person for the job. \n\nIt’s because they don’t believe RFK Jr can be stopped, five people representing health groups told Politico under the conditions of anonymity. \n\n“With good respect to all my buddies, they’re making the false assumption that if they stay silent, they will get something in return,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, a group denouncing his bide, told the outlet. \n\nRFK Jr’s close confidants praised his ability to challenge, as his adviser Calley Means tweeted, “powerful industries in the country and are winning.” \n\nOther Republicans, including North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, who agreed to send Kennedy’s nomination to the floor in a Senate Finance Committee vote last week, said that he believes “that silence is consent”. \n\nSenate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a doctor who initially said he was “struggling” with RFK Jr’s stance on vaccination, was also vital in getting the Senate Finance Committee’s approval last week. \n\nThe congressman backed including a promise from Mr. Kennedy to give Congress advance notice of any vaccine policy changes.\n\nKentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the Upper Chamber’s lone polio survivor, voted in favor of moving ahead with the confirmation on Wednesday – though his final vote isn’t assured. \n\nIf confirmed, RFK Jr would likely have free rein to do “anything he wants” and “go wild” over health, as Trump stated in November. \n\nThe banning of fluoride from drinking water – which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously hailed as one of the 10 greatest public health achievements in the 20th century – “sounds OK to me,” the president said at the time. \n\nRFK Jr would head up 13 operating divisions including the CDC, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and the National Institute of Health, and oversee a budget of about $1.7 trillion.","summary":"The Kennedy scion faces little resistance in his final Senate confirmation test","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-health-senate-confirmation-trump-b2697490.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/13/9/10/SEI239673428.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eALtVFh9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-13 10:31:32","author":"James Liddell","authors":["James Liddell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.04},{"id":290060140,"title":"Saquon Barkley from the Philadelphia Eagles criticizes fans for booing Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl","text":"Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley wasn’t pleased with Taylor Swift getting booed by fans at the Super Bowl and has shared his thoughts about it.\n\nSwift received wide-ranging boos from fans after her face appeared on the jumbotron during the Super Bowl and looked confused afterward.\n\nThe singer’s boyfriend Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs, suffered a disappointing 22-40 defeat to Barkley’s Eagles, failing in their quest to win a third successive Vince Lombardi Trophy.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBarkley would have enjoyed every moment of the Eagles’ victory over the Chiefs, but one particular moment didn’t appeal to him during the game.\n\nSwift getting booed by fans is not something one hears every day, but she suffered that fate during the Super Bowl, and Barkley was displeased about it.\n\nIn an interview with Howard Stern, Barkley said, per NBC Sports, “I remember that they showed her on the jumbotron and she got booed. I don’t get it.

On the one hand, some fans speculated that the boos were from Eagles fans who were getting back at Swift for betraying them.\n\nThe “Blank Space” singer, a Pennsylvania native, has previously spoken of her support for the Eagles and even mentioned them in her song “Gold Rush.” However, she had to switch allegiances to the Chiefs after her romance with Kelce began.\n\nOn the other hand, there are theories that supporters of President Donald Trump were responsible for booing Swift.\n\nTrump has never hidden his dislike for Swift, and he once declared that he hated her while the singer endorsed Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.\n\nMeanwhile, another fan theory speculates that “insecure men with fragile egos” were behind the boos against Swift. The pop diva’s fans defended her by trending #WeLoveYouTaylor on X.\n\nMany slammed those behind the boos, claiming they were “threatened” by Swift’s presence. Supporters praised Swift, noting she has sold out stadiums worldwide and continues to anger critics simply by existing.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles star

planned extension to $18 million farmhouse","text":"The former TV host and her wife, 52, are understood to have purchased the home back in June, five months before news of their relocation plans were revealed—with sources alleging at the time that the pair would be settling down in the Cotswolds, a charming region located about two hours from London.\n\nHowever, it now seems their fresh start across the pond may have been dampened somewhat after three local councillors raised concerns that DeGeneres and de Rossi’s extension might “increase flood risk in the village” and “disturb Roman remains.”\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi are reported to have received several objections from their neighbors who have spoken out against their extension plan.\n\nCouncil documents seen by the Daily Mail reveal: “The onus is on the owner to report any historic remains uncovered.”\n\nMeanwhile, other residents expressed concern that the hedge and wire fence at the comedian’s home could lead to flooding if trash gets “caught in the fence” and limits the “flow across the field.”\n\nDespite the protests, a spokesperson for West Oxfordshire Direct Council insisted that the Roman remains sit over 200 yards from DeGeneres and de Rossi’s property and that the work was “completed to a high standard.”\n\n“The works at the property involved a single-story extension and garden landscaping,” the spokesperson told the New York Post. “Although the extension technically breached permitted development rights, it was considered acceptable in planning terms.\n\n“As the works were completed to a high standard with no impact on surrounding amenities or other planning concerns, no further enforcement action was necessary, and the case has been closed.\n\n“Regarding concerns about Roman remains on Akeman Street, the site is more than 200 meters away from the Roman road, and no interference was identified.\n\nInterestingly, the reports come just weeks after a piece was published in Vanity Fair in which several unnamed locals from DeGeneres’ former community of Montecito accused her—along with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle—of driving up house prices in the area.\n\n“[The Montecito locals] attribute the increase in housing prices to [Meghan and Harry] as much as DeGeneres and point to out-of-towners coming in, driving too fast, and taking up all the street parking by local trails like the one Meghan was photographed hiking on while Harry was in the U.K. for Charles’s coronation,” the outlet claimed.\n\nIn November, when news of DeGeneres and de Rossi’s move was first revealed, it was claimed by TMZ that their decision to “get the hell out” of the U.S. was cemented by Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election—despite the fact that they’d purchased their home months earlier.\n\nDeGeneres was an outspoken supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, publicly endorsing her in a post shared on Instagram back in August.\n\nAnother source told The Wrap that DeGeneres and de Rossi had made plans to part ways with their home in Santa Barbara, Calif., claiming the property has “been pocket-listed or will be listed soon.”\n\nLast month, the comedian—who has built a reputation for herself as an amateur property investor—cut yet another tie with the U.S. by listing one of her last remaining homes in Los Angeles at a highly discounted rate.\n\nThe former daytime TV host and her wife bought the five-bedroom, 6.5-bathroom home for $29 million back in November 2022 and quickly put it back on the market for $33.9 million just 18 months later.\n\nHowever, the property was not cut out for the quick flip that the pair seemed to have been hoping for—remaining on the market for close to 100 days, before its listing was removed in August 2024.\n\nIn January, DeGeneres and de Rossi decided to try their luck again, relisting the property for the discounted price of $29.99 million, reducing their potential profit on the home by a hefty amount.\n\nA sale would mark only the fourth time the property has changed hands since it was built in 1955 by famous architect Richard Neutra, having been owned by the same family for 40 years until being sold for the first time in 1994.\n\nThat owner, who purchased the modernist home for the bargain price of just $1.42 million, held on to the property for 25 years before putting it on the market in 2019, when it sold for $20 million.\n\nThree years later, DeGeneres and de Rossi added the elegant abode to their already-impressive property portfolio, paying out $29 million for the dwelling.\n\nThey have since renovated the home extensively, helping to restore Neutra’s “pioneering vision,” while also adding a host of modern-day amenities.\n\nPer the listing description, the home, which is widely known as “The Brown House,” has plenty to offer a potential buyer, not least the architectural caché that comes from owning a Neutra design.\n\nDuring the past decade, DeGeneres and de Rossi have made a name for themselves as talented real estate moguls, buying, flipping, and selling multiple homes in California—largely for a hefty profit.\n\nIn August, the comedian offloaded one of her most expensive properties to date, a $96 million estate in Carpinteria, Calif., which she and de Rossi purchased in two parts back in 2022.\n\nMore from Realtor.com: Top 5 States with the Most Expensive Property Taxes\n\nFirst, the couple snapped up the main property—a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom, Tuscan-style mansion that sits on a 3.44-acre plot—for $41.7 million. They then paid $28.2 million for a vacant, 6.58-acre plot of land that sits alongside the home, in order to create a jaw-dropping, 10-acre estate atop a bluff overlooking the ocean.\n\nThe sale came just months after DeGeneres and de Rossi offloaded another staggering piece of real estate: an enormous mansion in nearby Montecito, Calif., where the comedian lived within a stone’s throw of Meghan and Harry.\n\nDeGeneres offloaded that property for a relatively paltry $32 million in February of this year. It had been listed for sale in October 2023 for $46.5 million.\n\nThe home was, according to multiple reports, snapped up by billionaire mining tycoon Robert Friedland, the same man who is understood to be behind the purchase of DeGeneres’ Carpinteria property, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMore from Realtor.com: Can a Landlord Legally Lock Up Your Thermostat and Limit Your Hot Water?\n\nIn 2011, the comedian opened up about her love of real estate, explaining that her passion for homebuying began after she started making real money from her on-screen career.\n\n“We never had a house when I was growing up,” she told Architectural Digest at the time. “We always rented. But my father would dream, and we used to look at houses all the time. I’d pick out which bedroom would be mine and get all excited.\n\n“The first thing I did when I made money was buy a house. And then …” she went on, prompting her wife to jump in and quip: “Another one. And another one and another one and another one.”\n\nMore from Realtor.com: $10 Million Houston Mansion With an Enormous 50-Car Garage Finally Drives a Sale—After More Than a Year on the Market\n\nHaving called it quits on her popular daytime show in 2022, DeGeneres has certainly had more time on her hands to devote to flipping properties, purchasing four properties and selling three in 2022 alone.\n\nMany of the homes have been purchased in off-market deals via LLCs and trusts, making it nearly impossible to know just how many homes DeGeneres and de Rossi now own. Sources have not revealed whether the pair plan to retain any residences in the U.S. or if they want to sell them all and cut their ties with the country altogether.\n\nMore from Realtor.com: See Where Insurance Premiums Are Set To Rise—Including One Coastal City Where They Could Go Up by More Than 300%\n\nMultiple reports claimed that the home in Montecito that the pair are allegedly planning to sell is a stunning Bali-inspired mansion, which they purchased for $27 million back in 2019—however, they have already sold that, offloading it for $33 million in 2020.\n\nThis story originally ran on Realtor.com.","summary":"Neighbors have voiced concerns about the plans increasing flood risk and harming Roman ruins.","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ellen-degeneres-clashes-with-new-british-neighbors-over-planned-extension-to-18-million-farmhouse-a67d4c9f?mod=mw_rss_topstories","image":"https://images.mktw.net/im-92082741/social","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 10:03:00","author":"Kelsi Karruli","authors":["Kelsi Karruli"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":290023930,"title":"Settlement Reached in Donald Trump’s Lawsuit Over January 6th Twitter Ban","text":"Elon Musk’s company, X, has reached an agreement to pay approximately $10 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against Twitter, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.
