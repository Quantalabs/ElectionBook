I think it’s just a collection of people that don’t like Trump right now, right? And that’s served them well in ‘20, but imagine trying to create a big tent that had AOC and John Kasich in it, right? You know? Or Liz Cheney and AOC. You sort of got to rip a hole in the middle, right, as you’re trying to stretch that tent,\" Todd told disgraced former CBS News anchor Charlie Rose. Todd and Rose discussed Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayor primary win and more during the conversation. \"It feels like they’re way too poll-tested. It feels like that they’re trying so hard to sort of keep their suburban voters, and that’s been part of their problem. The growth in the Democratic electorate is in the suburbs, wealthy suburbs, and so the growth of the Republican electorate has been in the working-class exurbs and actually, even in working-class urban areas. And, I think that that’s been their disconnect, is that their voters are in one place, their messaging is in another, but when they try to message to their suburban voters, they've sort of lost touch with their working-class roots,\" Todd continued. DEMOCRATS' MAJOR MESSAGING CRISIS: THE PARTY OF OPPOSITION WITHOUT SOLUTIONS Todd said both parties' coalitions were too big and added, \"we would probably be a better democracy if we could have 4 major parties.\" The ex-NBC \"Meet the Press\" moderator has been critical of the party in the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Trump. He questioned whether the public was sold a \"40-year bill of goods\" with regard to former President Joe Biden's family-man image during a conversation with CNN host Jake Tapper on the \"Chuck Toddcast.\" \"You and I covered, for most of our professional lives, the story of Joe Biden was: This guy cared about his family so much he commuted home every night from Washington,\" Todd said. \"You know what else you could say is, this man was so ambitious that after his family went through that tragedy, he commuted every day to work, like it's the same story. I sit here, I look at this, and I think, were we sold a 40-year bill of goods?\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' Todd said in March that Democratic leadership, specifically House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, were feeling \"paralyzed\" by the two different constituencies within the Democratic Party. \"Jeffries and Schumer are acting paralyzed because they have two different constituencies. They have ones who are worried about a left-wing tea party, and they should be worried about that, because I do think this anger inside the base is real,\" Todd said. \"Then you have others who are like, hey, I won, and Trump carried my state. So I’ve got to do this. So, I think that’s why Jeffries and Schumer come across as paralyzed, because they’re trying to placate a coalition party that doesn’t know which direction to go to.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Todd suggested during his conversation with Rose that the Republicans might not have stuck with Trump as their nominee if Biden didn't run for re-election at all.

Trump teases 'very wealthy' group will purchase Chinese app in matter of weeks","text":"Donald Trump revealed a 'very wealthy' group of buyers is set to purchase TikTok in the upcoming weeks - following years of battles with the Chinese-owned app. \n\nThe president made the shock announcement in an interview on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.\n\n'We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,' Trump declared without giving away many details or revealing where the proposal was coming from. \n\n'I think I'll need, probably China approval, but President Xi will probably do it.' \n\nBartiromo asked who the buyer is, to which Trump responded they will be revealed in just two weeks. \n\n'They're very, very wealthy people. It's a group of wealthy people,' he bluntly said.\n\nThis tease at new TikTok owners comes Trump's stance on the popular app has drastically shifted over the years. \n\nDuring his first term, Trump was determined to take down the video-sharing application - calling for a total ban in the US. \n\nTikTok is owned by China-based company ByteDance, which has raised concerns about privacy and security. \n\nA federal law to ban TikTok for being a threat to national security briefly went into effect the day before Trump was sworn in for his second term in January. \n\nUnder the Biden administration, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA) called for ByteDance to sell TikTok by the deadline or the app would be barred from the US.\n\nThe company did not sell the social media platform, meaning the banning it was the only remaining option. \n\nBut in an unexpected turn of events, one of TikTok's fiercest adversaries became its unlikely savior - issuing an executive order to postpone the ban by 75 days on January 20 as one of his first presidential acts. \n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew had even attended Trump's inauguration. \n\n'Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?' Trump said in a Truth Social post on January 16. \n\nHis change of heart was reportedly due to the massive amount of support he garnered for his White House run through the campaign.\n\n'I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,' Trump told NBC in May. \n\nTikToks by ratings-obsessed Trump and his team had amassed more than 4 billion views - more than popstar Taylor Swift or political rival Kamala Harris.\n\nHe believes his TikTok presence helped him garner support specifically from younger voters. \n\nIn April, Trump extended the postponement another 75 days to work out a deal with the Chinese-run company that would ultimately lead to the platform being taken over by an American-approved buyer. \n\n'My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,' he wrote on Truth Social at the time.\n\n'The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.' \n\nAt the time, White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with US ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.\n\nTrump saved TikTok for a third time on June 19, issuing another 90 days to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.\n\n'As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \n\n'This extension will last 90 days, which the administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.","summary":"Donald Trump revealed a 'very wealthy' group of buyers is set to purchase TikTok in the upcoming weeks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14858763/tiktok-bought-sold-trump-wealthy-group-weeks.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/29/21/99838731-0-image-m-11_1751228555937.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/09/3393517041277095451/1024x576_MP4_3393517041277095451.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-29 20:33:37","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":336510200,"title":"Nepo baby daughter of Oscar-winning actress makes red carpet debut with boyfriend...can you guess who she is?","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jun 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos rumoured to be setting sail for 'the White Lotus Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Sicily' after their £40m three-day wedding celebrations in Venice\n\nSchoolboy, 12, dies in West Yorkshire after trying social media challenge as family warn of dangers\n\nThe VERY different childhoods of two boys raised just four miles apart - and how a single punch after a chance encounter on a Tube escalator ended in tragedy\n\nThe gangster guide to Dubai: The criminals from Manchester, Liverpool and beyond who call it home - and the tricks they use to live it up... without alerting authorities\n\nWhen I started balding in my teens I was so insecure.

The deal reportedly includes a $17 million donation to Trump’s future presidential library, along with millions for legal fees and airtime on Paramount-owned networks to run public service announcements condemning antisemitism.\n\nBut the negotiations haven’t progressed yet, and they might not.

Settlement talks remain uncertain, and a resolution is still elusive.\n\nNevertheless, it raises an urgent question: In an era of media retreat and Trump appeasement, will CBS News be the next to give in? \n\nAt the core of the legal dispute is an October 2024 interview that CBS aired with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump accused the network of editing the segment to make Harris look better, which CBS outright denies, stating that it simply aired a shortened version of her remarks. But that didn’t stop Trump’s Federal Communications Commission from reopening an investigation into the network—a clear intrusion into editorial judgment with serious implications for press freedom.\n\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr cited a third-party news distortion complaint as the basis to scrutinize CBS’ editing. He’s demanded the raw footage and full transcript, which CBS released earlier this year. Meanwhile, Trump has filed a separate $20 billion defamation lawsuit against the network.\n\nParamount, CBS’ parent company, reportedly offered Trump $15 million to settle, but he countered with $25 million. The ongoing exchange has put Paramount executives in a tough spot, with internal divisions over how to settle without risking shareholder lawsuits or future legal issues. \n\nTo evaluate their legal risks, Paramount consulted Gibson Dunn, a top-tier law firm, which concluded that a $20 million settlement would likely avert criminal or civil repercussions and fall within the range of what other companies have paid to settle Trump’s lawsuits.\n\nAnd those payments have accumulated.\n\nIn December, Disney quietly settled a defamation case involving ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos by paying $15 million to Trump’s presidential foundation and $1 million in legal fees. And in January, Meta paid $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit after suspending Trump’s accounts following the Jan. 6 insurrection. X settled a similar claim for $10 million.\n\nMeanwhile, other outlets have shifted their stance to appease Trump—just look at The Washington Post under Jeff Bezos.\n\nTrump already has loyalty from Fox News and One America News, but CBS’ situation is unique: Its lawsuit affects the network’s planned merger with Skydance Media, and insiders say pressure to settle has caused significant internal tensions.\n\nIn fact, Wendy McMahon left her role as CEO and president of CBS News last month, partly because she disagreed with how the company was handling the lawsuit. It was the second major leadership exit from the network this year.\n\nThe FCC has authority over the Paramount-Skydance merger because it involves broadcast license transfers, meaning Carr could delay or block the merger entirely to give Trump more leverage.\n\nBut for now, signs suggest that CBS might stand firm. In a filing Monday responding to Trump’s latest legal motion, Paramount and CBS jointly called the case “a meritless lawsuit.”\n\n“President Trump and Representative [Ronny] Jackson attempt to evade bedrock First Amendment principles establishing that public officials like themselves cannot hold news organizations like CBS liable for the exercise of editorial judgment,” they wrote. \n\nLet’s hope they stay firm—because few outlets will.","summary":"Want to be on good terms with President Donald Trump?

Notably, the rapper clarified that he had avoided endorsing presidential candidates over the years, as he took to the comments section of one of The Shade Room’s Instagram posts on Saturday, June 28, to react to the criticism aimed at the performance.The Shade Room also shared glimpses of Nelly’s comment through their X (formerly Twitter) account on Sunday, June 29, where the artist was spotted expressing his love for the country. The singer and actor wrote:“I reiterate, I did not campaign for anyone. I do not tell people who to vote for. I respect and love our country from top to bottom good and bad… and I am very aware that it’s a lot of things in this country that we need to work on the right is too far right and the left is too far left.”Born Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., he further wrote that it would be an honor for him if he were contacted by the president's office for any reason, irrespective of who the president was. The Snipes star mentioned that he won’t care about money or race in such situations.Well-known for his appearance on season 29 of Dancing with the Stars, Nelly seemingly referred to those who were criticizing him and Snoop Dogg, as he stated:“Nothing to do with race but if you wanna make it about race, then let’s goooooooooooooo I find it very interesting. That’s so many of you would dump on the two black men that’s married to black women that has black children because the “ “ woman of color with the white husband and white kids.

While he clarified that he does not campaign for any presidential candidate, Nelly claimed that he had done a lot of things for the Black community over the last 20 years, along with fellow rapper Snoop Dogg.The Dillemma singer referred to the help that he and Snoop provided throughout their career, and stated:“From the black families that we employ to the black children that we help every day and all year through our nonprofits, whether we’re sending kids to schools on scholarships to HBCU or helping young black boys in la “gang central” with his junior football programs which many players have went on to go to the NFL and live their dreams.”He further wrote that he and Snoop were also the fathers of “black children,” adding that it should have been an inspiration to a lot of people. Nelly also opened up on why people might have an issue with the same, as he seemingly referred to Kamala Harris, who also participated in the presidential election last year. He wrote:“Some of y’all have a problem with because the “prosecutor who has probably locked up more black men that we’ve helped woman of color with the white husband and white kids. Did not win the election.”In other news, while Nelly has not announced a new album for almost four years, he recently appeared on the Peacock documentary series, Nelly & Ashanti: We Belong Together, which premiered on June 26, 2025.","summary":"Nelly has once again defended his performance at Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, which took place on January 20, 2025.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/news-i-tell-people-vote-for-nelly-doubles-performance-donald-trump-inauguration-event","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/709c0-17512176697848-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 18:23:41","author":"Anupal Sraban Neog","authors":["Anupal Sraban Neog"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":336497430,"title":"Politico: Donors Not Enthused About Potential Kamala Harris Run for California Governor","text":"Kamala Harris for California governor? Not so fast, said top Democrat donors who are still recovering from the former vice president’s failed presidential campaign.\n\nSo reports Politico in a stinging series of interviews with Democrat funders who remain troubled about Harris’s billion-dollar campaign, which not only failed badly but ended in debt and left lingering questions about her role in the coverup of President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline.\n\nWATCH — Stephen Miller: It Would Have Been the End of the American Republic if Kamala Harris Won:\n\nSaid one unnamed, six-figure California donor in the report, “Kamala just reminds you we are in this complete shit storm. With Biden, we got bamboozled … I think she did the best she could in that situation, but obviously she knew about the cognitive decline too.”\n\nHe added, “I’ve written so many checks because I knew the Trump administration would be horrible, but we’re living in a nightmare because of the Democrats. I’m furious at them, truly.”\n\nOthers said on the record to the influential, left-leaning news outlet that what seemed a good idea at first now was being questioned.\n\n“There was more enthusiasm at first,” said Mather Martin, a San Francisco-based fundraiser who has worked for Harris campaigns. “I think it waned a bit.\n\nPolitico wrote:\n\nSome party funders have privately shared that ambivalence with each other as Harris has embarked on a quiet schedule of thank you visits, catch-up calls and listening sessions, touching base with her most trusted supporters as she weighs her options. The former vice president has tasked aides with exploring several paths, including not just a campaign for political office but also a philanthropic venture.\n\nWhile Harris has kept a low public profile since leaving office, according to Politico she held private meetings when she was in the Bay Area in June to headline a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. It also reported she was seeking the input of loyalists who have backed her campaigns since she ran to be San Francisco’s district attorney more than 20 years ago.\n\nClearly, according to the interviews, the former vice president’s role in asserting President Joe Biden’s mental fitness in the latter years of his presidency is weighing on the minds of many.\n\nHarris has yet to answer to that issue, causing former Democrat Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to criticize Harris as well as former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, tearing into the pair in late May on X. Villaraigosa is running for governor.\n\n“For me it’s the consequences of their failure to say anything,” he said in an interview featured in the X post. “That somehow the president was ready for another four years. And the consequences of that is what I’m focused on”:\n\nOne Southern California fundraiser, who spoke to Politico anonymously, agreed.\n\nDonors “realize it’s just going to bring up the whole pathetic last presidential, which no one wants to hear about again,” he said. “And then it’s the whole ‘Did you know Joe Biden?’ thing. She still would probably lead, but honestly, no one is incredibly pumped.”\n\nRepublicans, Politico reported in a story last week, were hoping Harris would run, writing:\n\nConservative pundit Steve Hilton and firebrand Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco have launched campaigns focused on what they call failed Democratic governance — a point they’ve both hammered in Fox News appearances — and are holding up Harris as a prime example.\n\nWATCH — Patrick Bet-David: Kamala and the Left Lost Because They “Showed Fear” to America:\n\nHarris reportedly has given herself until late summer to decide whether or not to launch a gubernatorial bid. According to Politico:\n\nThe reality, according to people who know her well, is that Harris is keeping all of her options on the table. She has tasked aides with delving deeper into three possible routes: running for governor in 2026, running for president in 2028 or exploring a role outside of elected office where she can still have an impact on civic life.\n\nIf she chooses to run, the former VP will have to address not only her record in the White House but high-profile problems plaguing the state, including the fallout from devastating wildfires and Trump administration immigration enforcement, which has led to social unrest.\n\n“She is talking to people around the state about whether she is going to run,” Joe Cotchett, a San Francisco trial lawyer and longtime Democrat donor, told Politico. “If she does, she’s going to have very difficult problems.”\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of the Los Angeles-based novel Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

Skrmetti, the Department of Health and Human Services released a four-hundred-and-nine-page document casting doubt on the safety of gender-affirming care for children. The report attempts to undermine the idea that it is safe for trans children to receive hormone-replacement therapy and puberty blockers, the treatment course established by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and which is currently endorsed by all major medical associations in the U.S. (Despite conservative fearmongering about young trans people undergoing radical medical procedures, the WPATH guidelines generally recommend that only those above the age of eighteen should receive genital reconstructive surgery.)\nAccording to the H.H.S. report, for the vast majority of people, gender dysphoria is simply a temporary discomfort. Perhaps, with proper care, such as counselling, they would come to terms with the “reality” of their biological gender. The report begins with explanations of various medical maxims: one is Primum non nocere—“First, do no harm.” But counselling can sometimes be a thinly veiled disguise for conversion therapy, and conversion therapy is harm at the highest level—I know this from experience. The report technically calls for “gender exploratory therapy,” noting that “being labeled a ‘conversion therapist’ ” is a “damaging accusation given the profession’s mistreatment of gay people.” But such a claim fails to acknowledge the possibility that gender-exploratory therapists may be perpetuating the same kind of mistreatment.\nThe H.H.S. report contradicts a previous assertion from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a subset of H.H.S., which has written that no research has displayed convincing evidence that therapy can alter a patient’s gender or sexual identity. It also contradicts guidance from medical authorities such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the latter of which has called the H.H.S. report “inaccurate.” These authorities stand by the recommended treatment protocols established by WPATH, an organization of physicians, surgeons, and mental-health professionals that emerged from an attempt to standardize care in 1979. Trump has derided WPATH for conducting “junk science,” and the organization has been accused of selectively publishing research regarding the effectiveness of pediatric trans care on mental health. But the H.H.S. report, which Trump ordered as a corrective, does not represent a good-faith effort to engage on the question of when and how young people suffering from gender dysphoria should be treated. Rather, in its reliance “on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,” in the words of the American Academy of Pediatrics, it engages in the same kind of cherry-picking that WPATH has been accused of. After enacting a ban on pediatric trans care, in 2023, Utah lawmakers commissioned an assessment of the safety of puberty blockers and H.R.T. The study recently found that these treatments are both safe and effective. But, as Chase Strangio, a trans lawyer at the A.C.L.U., pointed out in an Instagram video, the report got little mainstream-news coverage. The H.H.S., and the political right at large, have instead focussed on detransitioners. If trans people comprise a small community—an estimated 0.6 per cent of the population—then the detrans community is even smaller. Yet the right loves to platform their stories; the H.H.S. report describes these individuals as “brave whistleblowers.”\nFor trans children caught in these political crosswinds, the stakes are high. “Being called your correct name and pronouns, being on HRT, that can be the difference between life and death,” Zelda, a seventeen-year-old trans boy from Louisiana, recently told the Cut. More than forty per cent of trans adults have attempted suicide, according to the Williams Institute at U.C.L.A. While the H.H.S. report does raise the alarm on trans suicide, at times it suggests the blame is on hormones, more so than a culture rife with violent transphobia. This is despite the fact that numerous reports have found that those who undergo conversion therapy are far more likely to die by suicide than their peers. In states where anti-trans legislation passed, suicide attempts by trans teens subsequently went up by seventy-two per cent, according to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focussed on crisis prevention for L.G.B.T.Q. youth. Some have argued that the studies have yet to directly link access to trans health care with lower youth-suicide rates, but medical care is not the only factor influencing mental health—discrimination, job security, stigma, and harassment also play key roles. Still, as Strangio, who represented the plaintiffs in the Skrmetti case, told the Supreme Court during oral arguments, “There are multiple studies, long-term, longitudinal studies that do show that there is a reduction in suicidality, which I think is a positive outcome to this treatment.”\nChildren are often caught at the center of the moral panic around transness. They are the testing ground for the erosion of trans rights, which conservatives often frame as a defense of parents’ rights. This thinking, too, is reflected in the way that the media often spotlights the voices of parents of trans kids rather than the children themselves. Right-wing stories that aim to whip up panic about an alleged “trans boom” tend to interview parents, infantilizing the kids as unreliable narrators. Even on the left, the voices of parents are often prioritized, ranging from spokesperson or advocate to the central narrator of their trans child’s story, in a way that goes beyond the standard journalistic practice of protecting minors, given that these trans kids are often in their teens. (A rare exception is “Just Kids”—a recent documentary directed by Gianna Toboni about the great lengths that trans kids must go to in order to receive care—which interviews a number of trans children and allows them to speak for themselves about the criminalization of their care.)\nIt is easy to deprive children of trans rights because our society generally functions as if children don’t have any rights at all. We struggle to believe that these little humans are capable of making their own decisions, much less of telling us who they are. But, although conservatives might focus their public messaging around trans children, it’s naïve to think that trans adults will be any safer from the Administration’s ire. The age at which someone should be “allowed” to transition keeps moving: Trump recently said nineteen; other conservative critics have suggested waiting until people are in their twenties. (Of course, this would mean that no one is allowed access to puberty blockers.) But the White House’s goal isn’t just no new trans kids; it’s no trans people, period. This is the clear takeaway from Trump’s executive order “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” which declares that sex is immutable, and withdraws all federal recognition for trans people.\nTrans kids are often used as a Trojan horse. An early version of the House Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill” proposed eliminating Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care solely for minors; a later version of the bill struck the phrase “for minors.” Curtailing care for trans adults was always part of the larger conservative plan. In addition to stripping away coverage for trans health care, the bill also sets stricter work requirements for Medicaid—another dangerous prospect for trans people, who face significantly higher unemployment rates. When I started transitioning, I was unemployed and reliant on Medicaid coverage. Many trans people have expressed outrage at the proposed bill: “Being covered by Medicaid has given me medical support I never thought possible,” the comedian Marley Gotterer told me. “ ‘Lifesaving’ doesn’t even come close to describing it.” Health care, she continued, “shouldn’t be about luck.”\nIn her recent book “Aggregated Discontent,” Harron Walker writes about Amida Care, a Medicaid health plan in New York specifically designed to help low-income trans people. “They paid for my hormones during two significant periods of my life when I couldn’t get insurance through work, because no employers with those kinds of jobs would hire me,” Walker told me over the phone. “It’s why so many of us don’t have to stress about paying for hormones every month, much less other bills, and why we’re able to focus on our art, our work, whatever else makes up our life—because we’re not funnelling all of our attention and resources into figuring out how to get health care.”\nThe Trump Administration is “using every mechanism at their disposal to try to decrease access,” Strangio, the A.C.L.U. lawyer, has said. He has suggested that, in order to build a “trans liberatory project,” the left must embrace a “politics of solidarity.” This is more than just a catchy slogan; the idea is a coalition focussed on securing material rights for the various groups struggling to safeguard bodily autonomy in our current moment—immigrants, women seeking abortions, disabled people. (As part of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Republicans have also been seeking to deny Medicaid coverage for abortion and for DACA recipients.) The same executive order meant to strip government protections from trans people has recently been applied by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a way that affects a broad swath of cisgender individuals as well, owing to the removal of language that explicitly prohibits doctors from discriminating against patients for their marital status or political beliefs. “Under Trump’s new rules, veterans can be blocked from getting care, and doctors can be barred from working at V.A. hospitals for the sole reason that they may be unmarried, belong to a union, are registered Democrats, or identify as gay or trans,” Senator Patty Murray, the former chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, wrote in a statement.\n“I want people to fight for others and others will fight for us,” Strangio said. Still, it is easy to feel pessimistic. While there are occasional victories—a federal district judge recently ruled against the Trump’s Administration’s anti-trans passport policies—it is hard to know whether the White House will comply, even when it loses in court. The “Big Beautiful Bill” may still be in flux, with federally funded trans health care hanging in the balance, but protections continue to be dismantled at the state level; there are two bills in Texas, for instance, that seek to prohibit trans health care and insurance protections, and which are already under way. Democrats, meanwhile, seem all too willing to compromise, having turned their attention to less “controversial” battles. Zohran Mamdani and Tim Walz are some of the rare politicians who have continued to champion gender-affirming care, whereas many other prominent members of their party, such as Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris, have backed down on their previous support of trans issues. Trans participation in sports is often a particular point of contention on the left. Last year, Massachusetts representative Seth Moulton told the Times: “I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete.” By shifting the conversation to sports, Democrats obscure larger issues like the assault on trans health care. Trans people are not just a cultural war issue. They deserve material rights.\nLast September, I “got” a vaginoplasty. Though it was before Trump was reëlected, I was not the only one to joke that perhaps my procedure was among the last that this country would offer. What’s perhaps more noteworthy is how few of these surgeries occur, even in an environment that’s not openly hostile to trans people. In 2020, just over nine hundred vaginoplasties were performed in the U.S., according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. The worldwide figure is around three thousand annually. (Phalloplasties are even rarer; only about three per cent of trans men have received such a surgery.) For the past few years, right-wing politicians and pundits have written about trans surgeries as if they are offered for free at drive-ins. The numbers tell a different story.\nA larger number of trans people utilize hormones, which are life-altering but not as drastic as surgical intervention. When I go to get my hormone-replacement-therapy (H.R.T.) prescription, I sit in a waiting room next to post-menopausal women seeking the same medication. Many cis women also take spironolactone, the foul-smelling little pills that I once took as a part of H.R.T., in order to get rid of their acne. Trans people, often forced to do their own research, are more likely to understand the risks, side effects, and joys of estrogen and testosterone. Cis people, on the other hand, usually trust their doctors implicitly in regard to these medications because they’ve typically been able to.\nThe regret rate for kids who transition is far lower than Republican lawmakers would like us to believe, not even rising above one per cent, according to a 2021 collection of studies published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Global Open. Kristina Olson, the lead author of a 2024 JAMA Pediatrics study, told NPR that only four per cent of participants expressed regret with some aspect of their care: “Often the regrets they were expressing had to do with [wishing] they hadn’t done blockers and they’d gone straight to hormones, or they maybe had a negative side effect related to the blockers,” such as an implant getting irritated. Regret is a phantom frequently leveraged against trans people, especially children.\nRepublicans claim they are protecting children, in particular, from making choices that the kids will later wish they could undo, the kind that will scar them and limit their ability to have fulfilling, reproductively healthy lives. It’s a modern twist on an age-old fear. In his book “Kids These Days” (2017), Malcolm Harris chronicles parents’ growing intolerance for risk, often because they see their children as an economic investment. Harris cites an article in the American Journal of Play by Peter Gray, about adolescents’ declining ability to self-direct their leisure time:\n\nEven casual observations of children playing outdoors confirm that these youngsters, like other young mammals, deliberately put themselves into moderately fear-inducing conditions in play. . . . If too little fear is induced, the activity is boring; if too much is induced, it becomes no longer play but terror. Nobody but the child himself or herself knows the right dose, which is why all such play must be self-directed and self-controlled.\n\nThe task, for all of us, is to become autonomous, capable of managing our own lives—understanding work and play, danger and reward, fantasy and reality. Trans people are all too aware of such dichotomies. Happiness is never far from risk. But some things are perhaps worth doing even if they do not come with a guarantee. ♦","summary":"With the “Big Beautiful Bill” in flux, and federal funds for gender-affirming care hanging in the balance, protections for trans children and adults continue to be dismantled at the state level.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-grim-state-of-trans-health-care","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/685eb6ee7636510b4f194605/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Byron-Trans-rights.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 16:53:15","author":"Grace Byron","authors":["Grace Byron"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":336468424,"title":"Trump reveals who should testify on Biden administration's alleged cover-up","text":"President Donald Trump revealed who he would like to see testify regarding the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline and potentially unauthorized executive actions, telling Fox News' Maria Bartiromo he believes the Biden autopen scandal will go down as one of the \"biggest\" in history. \"Lisa Monaco, who was a big supporter of Andrew Weissmann [should testify].

'You can't even make this stuff up,' he scoffed. \n\nThe governor was then asked if he had a readout of his June 6 conversation with the president. \n\n'Oh I would love to share the readout, but I revere the office of presidency, so I'll keep it in confidence,' Newsom said. \n\n'He has quite literally made up components of that conversation, he has been a stone-cold liar about what he said we talked about. He never discussed the National Guard. Period full-stop,' the California governor continued. \n\n'I would love to share with you what he actually talked about. It would send shivers up your spine,' Newsom added. \n\nOf windmills and whales \n\nThe Democrats' No. 2 in the Senate, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, also took a crack at Trump's age last week during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that was dedicated to focusing on Biden's cognitive decline. \n\n'Now, I'd like you to see a short video that includes some other examples of cognitive ability,' Durbin told attendees. \n\nDurbin then rolled clips of some of Trump's greatest hits.\n\nThere was the GOP nominee claiming Haitian immigrants were 'eating the dogs' during his debate with Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThere was a trademark Trump rant about windmills: 'The windmills are driving the whales crazy obviously.' \n\nLater in the hearing, Durbin pointed to a fresher example, when Trump confused the U.K. and the E.U. standing alongside Starmer last week. \n\nTrump did so as pages of the newly-signed trade deal with the U.K. were falling out of his folder, with the president quickly making a crack about the wind and Starmer leaning down to fetch them.\n\nThe president then answered some questions - and did so again, later in the day.\n\nWhy Newsom's hit likely won't land\n\nThat, argued former first lady Jill Biden's ex-press secretary Michael LaRosa, is why Democrats' attacks on Trump's fitness will fall flat. \n\n'President Trump doesn't miss the opportunity to engage the media and through the press, communicate directly and often with the country. Trump drives the public's perception about his age and health because he confronts any perceived weakness,' LaRosa told the Daily Mail. \n\nOnce LaRosa left the East Wing, he was critical that Biden's aides kept the aging Democratic president hidden away. \n\n'Much to my disappointment, President Biden and his team did not do anything to dispel the public's poor impression of his challenges or vulnerabilities as it related to his age and condition,' LaRosa recalled. 'President Biden and his team decided to avoid media interviews, network town halls, frequent press avails, and any environment that was organic and unscripted.'\n\nThat led to Biden's debate performance - which happened a year ago Friday - being what ended his presidential campaign. \n\n'Ultimately, Biden's under communication was his kryptonite and Trump's overcommunication is his superpower,' LaRosa noted. \n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye was also skeptical that Democrats could get age-related attacks on Trump to land. \n\n'Even if Democrats are right - and Trump being a ball of energy, even at 79, makes that a weak hand to play - it only highlights how Democrats never said anything about Biden's age and even stood behind him after a debate performance that, to anyone with two eyes and intellectual honesty - was not just a one-off disaster,' Heye told the Daily Mail. \n\nAsked if the messenger matters - and if Newsom could land a better age-related attack on Trump because he wasn't part of the Biden administration, Heye was still dubious. \n\n'Unless Newsom didn't have a TV, he saw what we all saw,' Heye said.","summary":"He's stumbled up the stairs of Air Force One, confused names and made gaffes - and his name isn't President Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14818241/gavin-newsom-leads-plot-donald-trump-senile.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/27/17/99795859-0-image-a-78_1751040675677.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/09/6303185507884221458/1024x576_MP4_6303185507884221458.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-29 15:02:03","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.075},{"id":336439518,"title":"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Hold Hands During Funeral Service for Minnesota Rep.

It is all or nothing,\" Knowles told the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"For the good of society, and especially for the good of the poor people who have fallen victim to this confusion, transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely: the whole preposterous ideology, at every level.\"\n\nTo Isabella, who is trans, this declaration was a clear sign of the Republican Party's increasing embrace of hardcore anti-trans politics — and a potential harbinger of \"genocidal action.\" This spring, after years of preparation, she moved to Chile. \n\nShe is not alone. In the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decision in US v Skrmetti, which upheld Tennessee and other red states' rights to ban transition healthcare for minors, four trans people told The Independent that the case had solidified their plans to escape the USA.\n\nLike every single person interviewed for this story, Isabella would only speak under a pseudonym out for fear of reprisals from far-right extremist groups, or perhaps even government officials. \n\nAnd while the Skrmetti decision only concerned trans children, those who spoke to The Independent feared that the Court's reasoning could make it easier to restrict trans healthcare for adults too — as Republicans are already trying to do nationally.\n\n\"Before the 2024 election, my timeline for relocating abroad was more like five to ten years out, if at all. Before today, I was considering sometime within the next year or two. But now, I am thinking of moving by the end of the summer,\" said Wayne, a trans man in his late forties in Washington state, on the day the Skrmetti ruling came down.\n\nThough he also has personal reasons to leave the country, he said the Skrmetti ruling was \"another falling domino.\"\n\n\"I don't want to leave my country, but things have been on a downward trajectory for trans rights for the past several years,\" he said. \"We have transitioned from a system of democracy into an electoral autocracy... no one is coming to save us.\"\n\nIn the past few years, 25 U.S. states have passed laws restricting banning transition healthcare for minors, according to the pro-LGBT+ Movement Advancement Project — covering an estimated 37 percent of all trans under-18s. \n\nSome states have also enacted restrictions on adult care, and Republicans in Congress have made repeated attempts to defund or limit access at the federal level. \n\nMeanwhile, conservative rhetoric about trans people has become ever more venomous. Knowles likened them to \"demons.\" One Republican candidate claimed pro-trans teachers should be \"executed.\" Multiple serving GOP legislators have falsely claimed that random mass shooting suspects are trans, while Donald Trump Jr has alleged — contrary to all available evidence — that trans people are \"the most violent domestic terror threat\" in the country.\n\nThen came Donald Trump's second inauguration, and his blitzkrieg effort to centralize federal power under the office of the president. Since then migration has become a regular topic among trans people both online and in person, along with acidic social media debates about the ethics and class politics of fleeing one’s country.\n\n\"My plans for emigration have been in a holding pattern,” said one trans lawyer in her forties, who began transitioning roughly 25 years ago and is now considering leaving the country.\n\n\"Getting all the documents and background checks and apostilles to be able to move, and contacting contractors... but not making any decisions yet in the increasingly vain hope that abandoning my family and home country won’t become a necessity,” she said.\n\n\"This [Skrmetti] decision definitely made me get back into planning mode. I had begun to build up some steely resolve about fighting for my country... but days like this really suck out all the air.\n\n\"When you find yourself crying at random songs, no matter how limited their emotional appeal would be in any other situation, it’s hard not to look at your hands and then up and the sky and say 'where do I go now?'\n\n\"I won’t accept being a pariah, or being denied hormones despite being post-[surgery]. I won’t accept second or third class status.\"\n\nThe lawyer also argues that the SCOTUS ruling may be widened, since there is \"nothing in the decision that indicates it will remain confined to pediatric care questions.\"\n\nStacy Davis, a 42-year-old Nashville realtor who has a trans child, told The Independent that her family will stay in Tennessee as long as they possibly can, even if it means traveling regularly for medical care at great expense.\n\nBut if they are forced to move, it would probably be abroad. “I think it would have been easier to move from Tennessee to a blue state if [Kamala Harris] would have won, because at least then we would have had some reassurances that on a federal level we would be more protected,” she said. But now, “it almost feels like a blue state can’t save us.”\n\nMultiple groups have sprung up to help trans people migrate, either within the U.S. or internationally. Some are open and legally incorporated, such as the Denver-based non-profit Trans Continental Pipeline. \"At the heart of it, we’re glorified movers, trying to help people get where they want to go and out of traumatic situations,\" founder Keira Richards told Mother Jones last year.\n\nOther groups are more secretive and ad-hoc, fearful of attacks and harassment by anti-trans extremists. \n\n\"We’ve had a few people today contact us and/or announce their desire to emigrate faster from the USA, considering the broader implications of this ruling,\" a member of one such group told The Independent.\n\n\"People of course are stockpiling hormones and getting passports in order if they can... I can tell you our top destinations are Canada, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Thailand, and the Netherlands in particular.\"\n\nThe group includes trans people in countries across the world, this person said, including some lawyers who help people understand the implications of new U.S. anti-trans policies. In some places, they have contacts who can help trans immigrants get settled in and find community. \n\nGroup members gather and share information on immigration pathways, visa requirements, and the level of freedom and protection available to trans people in various countries.\n\nThe story of one trans woman we’ll call Rachel illustrates how individual areas and then the entire USA have become progressively more hostile to trans people. Back in 2023, having already moved from the Tennessee countryside where she grew up to the big city of Nashville, she felt forced to flee her home state entirely. \n\n\"At that time I was highly skeptical that it would ever get to the point where I had to emigrate,\" Rachel told The Independent. \"I have to say that I completely stand corrected.\"\n\nInitially, Nashville had felt safe enough for her to finally transition. But beginning in around 2020, when conservative news site The Daily Wire moved its headquarters to Nashville, she felt a major \"tonal shift.\"\n\nRelatives who'd once been supportive began to turn against her. Nazi flyers were stuffed into her mailbox. She received \"direct threats\" from people she believes were probably her neighbors, and suffered repeated housing discrimination despite having a steady income. Daily Wire host Matt Walsh, a prominent anti-trans activist, held a \"rally to end child mutilation\" at the state capitol.\n\nIn March 2023, on the same day Tennessee's Republican governor Bill Lee signed the healthcare ban at the heart of the Skrmetti case, someone draped a huge swastika-emblazoned banner from a Nashville bridge thanking him for \"tirelessly working to fight trannies and fags.\" At another point, Rachel recalls, someone projected the words \"TRANS-FREE TENNESSEE\" on a local building. \n\nRachel even had a brush with Skrmetti himself: that is, Tennessee's attorney general Jonathan Skrmetti, against whom the Supreme Court lawsuit was filed. In 2022 he demanded detailed patient records from Rachel's trans healthcare provider Vanderbilt University, leading to accusations that he was trying to compile a \"list\" of trans people.\n\n\"Skrmetti seems like the ghost that will hound me for the rest of my life,\" complained Rachel. \"It's always Tennessee! It’s a state out of which the current manifestation of conservative politics has grown. And I was there to witness it.”\n\nNow those politics have taken root in the White House, and Rachel is applying for citizenship in the foreign country where one of her parents was born — something she's always been eligible for, but only recently started seriously working on.\n\nFor her, the new Supreme Court decision changed nothing. But listening to the oral arguments before Trump’s inauguration, and anticipating which way the case would go, was part of what made her plan to leave in the first place.\n\nEven though she isn't totally sure whether she’ll go, Rachel wants to be ready at short notice. She keeps many of her belongings in storage, and has abandoned some of her hobbies for fear that the equipment would weigh her down.\n\n\"I think that everything is on the table at this point,\" she said. \"The same rhetorical patterns, in some cases precisely the same accusations, that are being levied at trans people were being levied at the Jewish population [in Nazi Germany].\n\n\"We've read our history books. We know the outcome of that is... I think it's naive to think that it's impossible in the United States.\"\n\n(Knowles, for his part, has insisted that his 2023 CPAC speech was not a call for cultural genocide against trans people because they are not a group with shared genetics, and also because they are \"not a legitimate category of being.\") \n\nTo Isabella, living in Chile has been both a challenge and a relief. She's still figuring out her medical care, still learning Spanish, still trying to meet new friends. \"Winter and summer are flipped, which is so weird to me,\" she said.\n\nNot everyone could have made the move, she notes. She was lucky enough to have some local contacts and a job that she could keep doing from her new country, as well as the financial resources necessary to uproot her life.\n\nBut she no longer has to deal with the daily drumbeat of assaults on her rights and unashamed demonization of her identity. \"You feel like you can breathe better, and you're not worried that you're gonna be the victim of some terrible attack,\" she said.\n\nEven so, she can't completely stop worrying. Conservative politicians across the world have found trans people a tempting punchbag, including in nearby Argentina. The feminist philosopher Judith Butler has argued that transphobia is a central element of modern fascism, from to Hungary to Brazil to the USA and beyond.\n\n\"You never know, these days, because transphobia is global,\" said Isabella. \"The question is, is it going to come to Chile? That's always a fear. So I'm always keeping my eyes open.\"","summary":"Conservatives’ increasingly frenzied attacks on trans rights have made many people feel the USA is no longer safe for them — and the Court’s ruling in US v Skrmetti is just the latest ‘domino’, Io Dodds reports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/transgender-emigration-supreme-court-b2774317.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/21/7/24/GettyImages-2220333509.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 12:09:28","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":336418462,"title":"Do the Democrats need Barack Obama? It’s complicated","text":"“The Audacity of Hope” leader has largely remained on the sidelines since President Donald Trump took office in January, opting for the calm of semiretirement over a return to the political front lines.\n\nIn March, Obama posted his annual NCAA basketball bracket, celebrated the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, and wished his wife a happy 61st birthday. He also sent out some music and movie recommendations, reposted a promotional spot for a documentary his production company is making on Thunderbirds, and highlighted a few articles about artificial intelligence.\n\nAll in all, pretty tame stuff.\n\nProtecting his legacy\n\nMore recently, Obama appeared before a civic group in Hartford, Connecticut, and offered a winding explanation about the threats facing the country and democracy as a whole. He said the United States is “dangerously close” to allowing its government officials to act in a way “consistent with autocracies,” but did not mention Trump directly. He also discussed the erosion of traditional U.S. values such as the rule of law, freedom of the press, and the right to protest.\n\n“If you follow regularly what is said by those who are in charge of the federal government right now, there is a weak commitment to what we understood — and not just in my generation, at least since World War II — our understanding of how a liberal democracy is supposed to work,” Obama said. \n\nObama’s careful comments left many wondering why he didn’t name-check Trump, who has been taking shots at him and his political achievements as well as testing the limits of presidential power. \n\n“There are many grandmas and Rachel Maddow viewers who have been more vocal in this moment than Barack Obama has,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute, told The Atlantic. “It’s heartbreaking to see him sacrificing that megaphone when nobody else quite has it.”\n\nThose close to Obama said he doesn’t want to overshadow the next generation of Democratic superstars but acknowledge that a new national sensation has yet to emerge.\n\n“Too many hopefuls are chasing the idea of being ‘the next Obama’ rather than leading with vision and authenticity, speaking to the hearts of the American public,” Democratic strategist Alyssa Batchelor-Causey told the Washington Examiner. “Democrats do not need a replica; they need a successor. Someone who can build upon Obama’s legacy while bridging the growing divide between progressives and the party establishment and recognizing the needs of the country at this very moment.”\n\nParty popularity at record lows\n\nFor better or worse, Obama has remained the most popular Democrat in the country despite it being a historically unpopular time for his party.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released in June showed approval for Democrats in Congress at just 21% — the lowest level since 2009. A separate CNN/SSRS poll put the party’s favorability at 29%, marking a record low not seen since 1992. The bleak numbers have sparked concern among Democrats who worry they may signal more trouble ahead.\n\nAmid sinking approval ratings, the Democratic National Committee is grappling with mounting challenges under its chairman, Ken Martin. Tensions in the party have intensified partly due to former Vice Chairman David Hogg’s push to back primary challengers against incumbent Democrats. A June 19 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 62% of self-identified Democrats believe the party should replace its current leaders.\n\nAt the same time, a reported dip in donor funding and shrinking cash reserves in 2025 are raising concerns about the DNC’s ability to sustain any type of electoral momentum.\n\nThe party has also been searching for a clear-cut identity that resonates with young and old voters alike. \n\nHowever, Tuesday’s results in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary threw a wrench in the plans.\n\nMamdani win causes split on party messaging \n\nNew York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a far-left Democratic nominee, beat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a well-funded, familiar face largely seen as a mainstream candidate. Instead of an easy win for Cuomo, voters came out for Mamdani, who embraced a progressive economic agenda and broke with the party’s dominant position on the Middle East. Mamdani’s win reverberated across the nation and left the party, which has been struggling to unify its base, on shaky ground.\n\nThough Mamdani’s win generated excitement among younger voters, his message missed the mark among traditional Democratic voter coalitions.\n\nDemocratic leaders want to win back young voters and minority groups, two groups they have struggled and failed to mobilize since Obama was in office. But they also need centrist Democrats and independents, who aren’t on board with left-wing positions, to show up and vote.\n\nNeed for change \n\n“Certainly the party needs a new cadre of leaders who can inspire a beaten-down base and offer a vision or competing visions for the future that resonates with Americans who don’t follow politics closely and who decided the 2024 campaign,” Donald Nieman, a professor of history at Binghamton University, told the Washington Examiner. “It would be foolish to think the party can or should move on from Obama. He’s articulate, pithy, and telegenic, and he still gets the blood flowing among most of the Democratic base, centrists, as well as progressives. So Democrats should be happy he’s out there using his star power to call out Trump moves a lot of Americans, not just Democrats, find scary.”\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n“Barack Obama, and even Bill Clinton, today have about as much gravitas in influencing or leading tomorrow’s Democratic party as the hood ornament on your father’s old car,” political expert Sam Waltz told the Washington Examiner. “Barack Obama’s moment in the sun has come and gone, and with it his meaningful leverage. The same certainly might be said for even Bill Clinton. Yes, even Hillary Clinton, the party’s 2016 nominee, and, too, most likely even Kamala Harris.”\n\nIt’s not that they don’t have influence over the party but “it’s a different kind of influence,” Waltz said, adding that Obama and Clinton “still will draw an approving crowd, and of course few would openly criticize either,” but said that’s not what the party needs now.\n\nThe phenomenon is not unique to Democrats.\n\n“Neither of the George Bushes could win the nomination today in this Republican Party, much less unite it,” he said.\n\n‘Humpty Dumpty’ moment \n\nFor Democrats, Waltz called it a “Humpty Dumpty” moment.\n\n“They’ll never be able to put Humpty back together again in order to leverage [Obama’s] influence,” he said. “It’s time for them to move on, in a way that observes and respects the inevitable changes of political calculus.”\n\nMatt Watkins, a policy analyst and founder of Watkins Public Affairs, believes that while Obama’s “moral clarity, personal discipline, and rhetorical power still resonate,” Americans are no longer living in the conditions that made his presidency possible.\n\n“The current moment is not one of slow erosion, it is one of open collapse,” Watkins told the Washington Examiner. “Leaders like [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom, [Pennsylvania Gov.] Josh Shapiro, and [former Vice President] Kamala Harris bring experience and competence, but they represent an ideological continuation of the Obama-era worldview. That worldview is institutionally loyal, message-disciplined, and rooted in a version of liberalism that feels increasingly disconnected from people’s lived reality. That framework had already failed to stop Trump. Democrats cannot lead with nostalgia. The next leader must bring forward something structurally different, focused on building new systems that actually work for the people left behind.”\n\nWatkins said for many voters, the current Democratic Party feels hollow and abstract.\n\n“When rent is unmanageable, when childcare costs are more than wages cover, when healthcare remains out of reach, the idea of saving the system does not feel urgent. It feels irrelevant,” he said. “Democrats must move from symbolic defense to tangible results.”\n\nWaiting in the wings \n\nWatkins gave Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) credit for changing the political conversation but said the “energy” they have created doesn’t necessarily translate into broad, effective leadership.\n\n“The next Democratic leader must carry the core of progressive ideals — economic dignity, labor rights, climate action — and translate them into language and strategy that feels pragmatic and reachable,” he said. “This is not about watering down values. It is about making the agenda clear, grounded, and broadly accessible. We cannot keep building campaigns that feel righteous to some and alienating to others. The goal is not moral purity. The goal is delivery.”\n\nNieman also believes it’s time to move on, but warned about doing it haphazardly. \n\n“Democrats shouldn’t be in a hurry to anoint a new savior,” he said. “What the party needs is competition among a half dozen or so people — Josh Shapiro, [New Jersey Sen.] Cory Booker, [New Jersey Rep.] Mikie Sherrill, [Michigan Sen.] Elissa Slotkin — who can develop an authentic voice and vision that energizes Democrats and reaches the middle.”\n\nPolitical expert Jamie Wright was more blunt in his assessment to the Washington Examiner.\n\nCUOMO CAMP DISMISSES REPORT THAT EX-GOVERNOR IS DROPPING OUT OF NYC MAYORAL RACE \n\n“Democrats need someone who can step into the storm now and not just narrate it,” he said. “Is it time for new leadership? Absolutely. But don’t mistake volume for vision. Gavin Newsom has the media polish and battlefield instincts, but he hasn’t galvanized the base beyond California. Josh Shapiro? Smart, steady, and appealing in the heartland, but still building his national identity.”\n\nHe continued, “Until someone can command the stage the way Obama did with intellect, grace, and guts, he’ll remain the voice people default to. But let’s be clear: a party that keeps looking backward for guidance is a party that risks losing the fight that’s right in front of it.”","summary":"The Democratic Party&#8216;s leadership vacuum has left many wondering who can unify its ranks. With no clear leader stepping forward, some are hoping former President Barack Obama can fill the void.

However, he admitted to 'regretting' some of the posts, revealing 'they went too far'.\n\nAfter seemingly being on the down-low for a few weeks, Musk took to Twitter to discuss politics on Saturday (June 28), which marked his 54th birthday.\n\nHe expressed his anger at Trump's proposed bill ahead of a critical vote that will determine whether it comes to fruition.\n\n\"The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk wrote.\n\n\"Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\"\n\nMusk then added in a follow-up post: \"Polls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate moved 51-49 to open debate on the bill - a move Trump called a 'great victory'.\n\nWhile Musk and Trump have been involved in a very public spat as of late, the POTUS insisted there were 'no hard feelings' between the pair.\n\n\"I guess I could [patch things up with him] but we have to straighten out the country.

But, none to heights of these two: At the top is Sacco and Vanzetti of 1920 and the other criminal case just reached its second outcome. Let’s take a look at the parallels of the two cases. They both took place in Norfolk County at its Superior Court in the Town of Dedham. Murder charges were involved, and a Massachusetts State Police officer with the last name Proctor playing a significant role in the case. The pair’s actions and testimony plus evidence became subjects of scrutiny and controversy. There was overwhelming coverage by the media.\n\nThe similarities end there: in Sacco and Vanzetti they were both found guilty in the deaths of Frederick Parmenter, a paymaster, and Alessandro Berardelli, a security guard during a robbery. They were electrocuted at Charlestown State Prison on Aug. 23, 1927.\n\nThe widespread perception, at the state, national, and international levels, was that a miscarriage of justice had occurred considering the death penalty. In 1977, on the 50th anniversary, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation stating that Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti had not received a fair trial and that “any stigma should be forever removed from their names”\n\nIn the Karen Read trial she was found not guilty in the death of her boyfriend Boston police officer John O’Keefe.

The president did not attend the funeral and did not comment on it. \n\nThe funeral on Saturday followed a service on Friday where Hortman and her husband lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda, where they were placed alongside their golden retriever Gilbert, who was also shot two weeks ago. \n\nThe man accused of killing Hortman and her husband Mark, Vance Boelter, 57, was appointed by Walz the Governor’s Workforce Development Board twice, from June 2016 to June 2018 and from December 2019 to January 2023. \n\nThere is no evidence that Walz and Boelter had ever met. \n\nBoelter also allegedly shot Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who were both critically wounded but survived the horror assassination spree. \n\nAt Hortman's funeral on Saturday, Walz described her as a powerful but compassionate lawmaker in the Minnesota legislature. \n\n'She certainly knew how to get her way. No doubt about that,' Walz said. \n\n'But she never made anyone feel that they´d gotten rolled at a negotiating table. That wasn´t part of it for her, or a part of who she was. She didn´t need somebody else to lose to win for her.' \n\nHortman, who was first elected in 2004, helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives like free lunches for public school students during the momentous 2023 session as the chamber´s speaker, along with expanded protections for abortion and trans rights. \n\nWith the House split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita, and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government. \n\nThe Rev. Daniel Griffith, who led the service, alluded to Boelter's alleged political motivations for Hortman's slaying in his remarks, saying the nation is in need of deep healing. \n\nHe said it seems as if the country is living in a 'dystopian reality' and cited the death of George Floyd in his speech. \n\n'Here in Minnesota, we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice,' he said. \n\n'The killing of George Floyd just miles from our church today. And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed, our democracy.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden appeared emotional as he was reunited with Kamala Harris at the funeral of slain former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14857647/Biden-Harris-Tim-Walz-Minnesota-House-Speaker-Hortman-funeral.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/29/05/99827643-0-image-m-63_1751173154940.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 05:11:18","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":336305878,"title":"Is the Trump 2.0 agenda deliberately aimed at companies’ bottom line?","text":"AgenciesDonald Trump\n\nCorporate America’s profits are slipping. Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis confirmed that corporate post-tax profits dropped in the first quarter by 3.3% — by far their biggest fall since the pandemic. When companies make less money, it’s often a harbinger of an economic slowdown. In this case, it also raises the more profound question of whether the Trump 2.0 agenda is deliberately aimed at companies’ bottom line.This sounds outlandish. The S&P 500 just hit an all-time high, so Corporate USA is worth more than ever. But it makes sense. After-tax profits account for an unprecedented 10.7% of gross domestic product, when in the last 50 years of the 20th century, they never exceeded 8%. The only time approaching their current share of the economy was in 1929 on the eve of the Great Crash. If the nation is to deal with inequality, money must be redistributed from somewhere; corporate profits are an obvious source of funds.Republicans Turn on the CorporationElements in the Trump coalition have long held an anti-corporate agenda. A few months ago, Adrian Wooldridge argued in this space that MAGA wanted to “end capitalism as we know it.” Specifically, he contended that many leaders in the Trump coalition wanted to “deconstruct the great workhorse of American capitalism: the publicly owned and professionally managed corporation.”Live EventsThese are strong words, but sound understated compared to the writings of Kevin Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation and a lead creator of Project 2025, an ambitious and radical agenda for Trump 2.0. He argues that BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager and a pillar of contemporary US capitalism, is “decadent and rootless” and should be burned to the ground — a fate it should share with the Boy Scouts of America and the Chinese Communist Party.For Marjorie Taylor Greene, an outspoken Trump supporter in Congress, “the way corporations have conducted themselves, I’ve always called it corporate communism.” She has urged government investigations of companies that stopped donations to Republicans after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress.Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign chief in 2016, complained to Semafor that only $500 billion of the US government’s $4.5 trillion came from corporate taxes. “Since 2008, $200 billion has gone into stock repurchases. If that had gone into plants and equipment, think what that would have done for the country.”He advocated a “dramatic increase” in taxes on corporations and the wealthy. “For getting our guys’ taxes cut, we’ve got to cut spending, which they’re gonna resist. Where does the tax revenue come from? Corporations and the wealthy.” MAGA Versus CompaniesSeveral current policies are not explicitly anti-corporate, but more or less guaranteed to have that effect. Michel Lerner, head of the HOLT analytical service at UBS, points out that in data going back to 1870, the correlation between tariffs and companies’ earnings yield (a measure of their core profitability) has been consistent. Tariffs hurt companies. Looking at the cash flow return on investment since 1950, it has risen (meaning companies grew more profitable) directly in line with rises in imports as a proportion of GDP. Research done jointly by Societe Generale Cross-Asset and Bernstein demonstrates that globalization has benefited US companies not only through international sales (40% of revenues for S&P 500 companies) but also through lower costs. In 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, the S&P’s cost of goods sold accounted for 70% of the revenues generated by selling them. It had been around this level for many years. That has now dropped to 63% — a massive improvement of 7 percentage points in this basic margin. Technology, consumer and industrial firms have gained the most — and stand to lose the most from deglobalization. Trump 2.0 policies so far have redistributed from shareholders to workers. Vincent Deluard, macro strategist at StoneX Financial, points out that the only tax not cut by the One Big Beautiful Bill currently before Congress is corporate income tax. “The grand bargain of the Big Beautiful Bill is to compensate for the tariffs’ inflationary shock with personal income tax cuts,” he says. “If exchange-rate adjustments, foreigners, and consumers do not pay for tariffs, corporate profits will.”Beyond that, eliminating illegal immigration and restricting foreign students raises labor costs. Threats to tax foreign investments in section 899 of the bill — which now appear likely to be withdrawn — risked reducing capital inflows and make it harder to raise finance.The Case Corporates Must AnswerCorporations’ own behavior has contributed to these trends. Over history, their share of GDP has tended to oscillate with the economy, rising when labor organizations’ negotiating power is weak. But in this century, their profits grew less susceptible to the economic cycle, surging higher after the pandemic. Albert Edwards, a macro strategist for SocGen, argues that they pushed through margin-expanding price increases “under the cover of two key events, namely 1) supply constraints in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, and 2) commodity cost-push pressures after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”Margins matter more in an environment where people are conscious of the damage inflation can do to their standard of living. That gave rise to the concept of “greedflation” — which Edwards thinks is deserved. Politicians have increasingly felt emboldened to intervene in companies’ pricing decisions, something that’s been off-limits since Richard Nixon’s ill-fated price controls in the early 1970s. Kamala Harris proposed “anti-gouging” policies in her unsuccessful presidential campaign; more recently, Trump forced a climbdown by companies like Amazon that proposed to itemize the impact of tariffs on the prices they charged.Rising to the top of a company never used to be a ladder to mega-wealth. That was reserved for entrepreneurs who founded their own firms. Modern executive pay has changed that and allowed CEOs to become billionaires by meeting unchallenging targets for their share price. The gulf between their pay and workers’ wages shrieks of injustice; according to the Economic Policy Institute, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio reached 399-1 in 2021; in 1965, it was only 20-1. From 2019 to 2021, CEO pay rose 30.3% while those workers who kept their jobs through the pandemic got a raise of 3.9%.This can easily be dismissed as the politics of envy, but executive compensation now arguably skews the entire economy. Andrew Smithers, a veteran London-based fund manager and economist, and nobody’s idea of a leftist, has long inveighed against the bonus culture, which he holds responsible for a disastrous misallocation of capital.Smithers argued that America’s problem was “two decades of underinvestment”:The major cause has been a change in the way company managements are paid. The 1990s saw the arrival of the bonus culture, which massively shifted management incentives and thus changed management behavior. Sadly, the change did immense damage to the economy. Managements were encouraged to invest less and, with lower investment, growth faltered.He argues that companies increased their investment in response to corporate tax cuts in earlier generations, but stopped doing this once executives were paid to prioritize their share price. That led them to cut back on investment, spending money on acquisitions and share buybacks. That dampened growth, but also ensured better returns in the short run for shareholders. As investing in stocks is still primarily a game for those who are already wealthy, this stoked inequality still further. Opposition to high executive pay is often couched as a populist class-warrior position, but there is far more to it than that. The Politics of ProfitsThe Trump coalition always had anti-corporate elements, but this didn’t stop his first administration from delivering for the private sector in a big way. In 2024, Trump added the support of Silicon Valley, and took the oath of office for the second time in front of a serried rank of billionaires. But he’s also losing old corporate supporters. Charles Koch, the industrialist hated by Democrats as the architect of libertarian Republican policies, has lost patience. After funding Nikki Haley’s run against Trump in last year’s Republican primaries, he told the Cato Institute earlier this year that too many institutions had lost their libertarian principles, and “people have forgotten that when principles are lost, so are freedoms.” How will people like Koch respond if the administration clamps down on companies?America’s key political developments tend to happen within parties, not between them. The current Republican coalition is no stranger in concept than Lyndon Johnson’s Democratic Party of the 1960s, the New Deal coalition that combined multi-racial liberals from the North and West with pro-segregationist whites from the South. Once Johnson decided to choose one wing over the other, with his civil rights acts, that alliance disintegrated.For now, the MAGA coalition includes both America’s largest corporations and their most trenchant critics. The policy choices of the next few months, and their effects, will determine whether that can continue.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpworld trade organizationubsmagacorporate usa\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

I’m furious at them, truly.' \n\nHarris has not publicly said she will enter the race, but sources told The Hill this week that she is 'leaning toward' entering the Democratic primary, saying the chance to get back in the spotlight has given her 'a glimmer in her eyes.' \n\nBut while Harris is said to be excited by the prospect of re-entering public office, many of the donors who supported her last run for the White House say they are less enthused. \n\n'There was more enthusiasm at first,' Mather Martin, a San Francisco-based fundraiser who has worked for past Harris campaigns, told Politico. 'I think it waned a bit.' \n\nOne California donor who contributed six-figures to Harris' run against Donald Trump said they fear a comeback campaign would only remind Democrats of how 'traumatizing' her loss to Trump was. \n\nHarris reportedly held several meetings in the Bay Area this month to feel out a possible run for governor, and believes she would have an advantage in the field as she remains a big name in a Democratic Party that has not found a new leader following Trump's landslide in November. \n\nShe was reportedly considering another run for the presidency in 2028, but is leaning toward California Governor. \n\nOne insider told The Hill: 'She has a lot of people in her ear telling her that it makes the most sense and she can do the most good.' \n\nOne key sticking point looming over any potential run appears to be the reported cognitive decline of former President Joe Biden, raising questions over whether Harris was privy to his struggles in office. \n\nOne of Harris' would-be opponents in the race, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, used this as ammunition in a recent X post last month. \n\n'Voters deserve to know the truth, what did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out?' he wrote - also referencing former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was also a member of the Biden administration as secretary of Health and Human Services. \n\n'This cover up directly led to a second Donald Trump term.' \n\nAs one Democrat donor put it to Politico, fundraisers 'realize it’s just going to bring up the whole pathetic last presidential, which no one wants to hear about again. And then it’s the whole ‘Did you know Joe Biden?’ thing.'\n\nThey concluded: 'She still would probably lead, but honestly, no one is incredibly pumped.","summary":"Kamala Harris ' potential comeback bid for California 's gubernatorial race is falling flat as the state's liberal donors say they are still 'traumatized' from her loss to Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14857479/Kamala-Harris-California-Governor-comeback-donors-Joe-Biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/29/03/99826757-0-image-a-44_1751165381700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 03:12:20","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":336284546,"title":"Biden, Harris, and Walz Pay Respects at Funeral of Ex-Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman","text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was celebrated for her legislative achievements and compassion during a funeral on Saturday, where former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined over 1,000 mourners.\n\nHortman was tragically shot two weeks prior by an individual pretending to be a police officer in what Minnesota’s chief federal prosecutor has described as an assassination. The incident, along with another shooting, also resulted in the death of her husband, Mark, and left a state senator and his wife seriously injured.\n\n“Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history. I get to remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I have ever known,” Gov. Tim Walz said in his eulogy. “For seven years, I have had the privilege of signing her agenda into law. I know millions of Minnesotans get to live their lives better because she and Mark chose public service and politics.”\n\nThe service\n\nNeither Biden nor Harris spoke, but they sat in the front row with the governor, who was Harris’ running mate in 2024. Biden and Harris held hands during the Lord’s Prayer, a common practice, before embracing during the passing of the peace. Biden and then Harris then reached over to shake Walz’s hand.\n\nBiden was also one of more than 7,500 people who paid their respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. Biden also visited the wounded senator in a hospital. \n\nDozens of current and former state legislators from both parties and other elected officials who worked with Hortman also attended.\n\nHortman, who was first elected in 2004, helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives like free lunches for public school students during the momentous 2023 session as the chamber’s speaker, along with expanded protections for abortion and trans rights. With the House split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita, and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government.\n\nThe governor’s eulogy\n\nWalz said Hortman saw her mission as “to get as much good done for as many people as possible.” And he said her focus on people was what made her so effective.\n\n“She certainly knew how to get her way. No doubt about that,” Walz said. “But she never made anyone feel that they’d gotten rolled at a negotiating table. That wasn’t part of it for her, or a part of who she was. She didn’t need somebody else to lose to win for her.”\n\nThe governor said the best way to honor the Hortmans would be by following their example.\n\n“Maybe it is this moment where each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for things we care about,” Walz said. “A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did — fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity.”\n\nThe Rev. Daniel Griffith, pastor and rector of the Basilica, who led the service, said the country is in need of deep healing. He said it seems as if the U.S. is living in the “dystopian reality” described at the beginning of William Butler Yeats’ poem, “The Second Coming.”\n\n“Here in Minnesota, we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice,” Griffith said. “The killing of George Floyd just miles from our church today. And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed, our democracy.”\n\nBut the priest also said Minnesota could also be “a ground zero place for restoration and justice and healing.” He added that the presence of so many people was a sign that that work can succeed.\n\nArchbishop Bernard Hebda of the Saint Paul and Minneapolis Archdiocese offered his condolences to the Hortman family.\n\nA private burial will be held at a later date.\n\nThe Hortman family\n\nThe Hortmans were proud of their adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, and the lawmaker often spoke of them. \n\nIn a voice choked with emotion, Colin said his parents embodied the Golden Rule, and he read the Prayer of St. Francis, which his mother always kept in her wallet. He said it captures her essence. It starts, “Lord make me an instrument of your peace.”\n\nAfter the service, Walz presented the children with U.S. and Minnesota flags that flew over the Capitol on the day their parents were killed.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park on June 14, and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a brief court appearance Friday. He’s due back in court Thursday.\n\nVance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.\n\nBoelter remains jailed and has not entered a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty.\n\nFriends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was celebrated&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden, Harris, and Walz Pay Respects at Funeral of Ex-Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/biden-harris-and-walz-pay-respects-at-funeral-of-ex-minnesota-house-speaker-melissa-hortman/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Biden-Harris-and-Walz-attend-funeral-for-former-Minnesota-House.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 02:14:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.12},{"id":336436472,"title":"Former chief of staff to late Rep.

This year she was bumped up to the Other Stage and strategically placed at the same time as Doechii (who has a similarly young, feral fan base) and Neil Young, the headliner, who had a depressingly small crowd for a Saturday night headliner. \n\nBut it wouldn’t have been out of the question to have bumped Charli all the way up to the Pyramid. It will be widely accepted that she should have replaced Olivia Rodrigo this year, and that Glastonbury *still* doesn’t quite get the pull of electronic music, as much as they keep trying,\n\nOpening with 365, the tone was set from the outset. Eyes widened, jaws unhinged, arms raised, the crowd literally went wild. Aitchison then led the crowd through a number of other Brat hits such as 360, Club Classics and Apple — wise, considering that most of the people there probably became fans in 2024. But she played to the fans too — Charli Stan favourites like Unlock It and Vroom Vroom were peppered throughout. \n\nSlower moments of the set were less saggy and more cathartic, like a breath of fresh air during a come up, with newly minted fan favourite Party 4 U taking fans from mad, feverish rapping to pure emotion in mere seconds. Track 10, which Aitchison has described as a rite of passage song that she must perform every single time she’s on stage, gave everyone a moment to catch their breath and count themselves lucky to be there.\n\nTowards the end of the set, Charli once declared brat summer a “forever thing” not just a seasonal thing. And it was understood. It’s not a seasonal thing. It’s a Charli thing.It’s the kind of show people will brag about attending for years. It just should have been on the Pyramid stage.","summary":"Should Charli have headlined the Pyramid Stage?

But their legacy lived on Saturday inside the basilica as people celebrated their contributions to the state and remembered their love of billiards, baking, sitting on their porch and having friends over for dinner.\n\n“It’s easy sometimes to forget that, for all its significance, politics is made up of people. That’s all it is. Just a bunch of human beings doing their best,” Walz said.\n\nThe basilica was filled with lush bouquets and greenery, a nod to Melissa’s love for gardening. Lawmakers past and present, GOP and DFL, filed into the church in the morning drizzle and fastened buttons, decorated with plants and trees, to their shirts.

And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed, our democracy.”\n\nBut the priest also said Minnesota could also be “a ground zero place for restoration and justice and healing.” He added that the presence of so many people was a sign that that work can succeed.\n\nArchbishop Bernard Hebda of the Saint Paul and Minneapolis Archdiocese offered his condolences to the Hortman family.\n\nA private burial will be held at a later date.\n\nThe Hortman family\n\nThe Hortmans were proud of their adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, and the lawmaker often spoke of them.\n\nIn a voice choked with emotion, Colin said his parents embodied the Golden Rule, and he read the Prayer of St. Francis, which his mother always kept in her wallet.

In 1976, at the height of Cronkite’s reign as “the most trusted man in America,” CBS News president Richard Salant penned a 76-page document outlining CBS News standards.\n\nPage 58 is focused on editing and suggests the “60 Minutes” interview at the center of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News would have been frowned upon during the Cronkite era.\n\n“The objective of the editing process is to produce a clear and succinct statement which reflects fairly, honestly and without distortion what was seen and heard by our reporters, cameras and microphones,” Salant wrote in the 1976 document, which has come to the attention of the Trump legal team.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t “listening” to the Biden administration. Harris was criticized for the “word salad” answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on “Face the Nation.”\n\nHowever, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, she gave a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing her answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day.\n\nThe raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris’ comments came from the same lengthy response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the “Face the Nation” preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.\n\nCBS News, which has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital when asked if the Cronkite-era standards have changed.\n\n“If more than one excerpt from a speech or statement is included in a documentary broadcast, the order of their inclusion in the broadcast will be the same as the order of their inclusion in the speech or statement, unless the broadcast specifically indicates otherwise,” Salant wrote in the 1976 CBS News Standards guide.\n\nWhen Cronkite died in 2009 at age 92, his Associated Press obituary said the famed anchor “valued accuracy, objectivity and understated compassion” and “always aimed to be fair and professional in his judgments” regardless of personal views on a topic.\n\nTwo polls pronounced Cronkite the “most trusted man in America”: a 1972 “trust index” survey in which he finished No. 1, about 15 points higher than leading politicians, and a 1974 survey in which people chose him as the most trusted television newscaster, according to the AP.\n\nSalant, who was running CBS News when “60 Minutes” was launched, was lauded by The New York Times when he died in 1993.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

The mediator recently proposed the network end the president’s $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLast month, Trump rejected Paramount’s $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology.

The 33-year-old is the son of noted postcolonial theorist and academic Mahmood Mamdani, who has written extensively on the legacy of colonialism in Africa, and acclaimed film director Mira Nair. His middle name is, of course, a reference to Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanaian Pan-Africanist revolutionary leader. But now the younger Mamdani has become a name to be reckoned with on his own accord.\n\nBy defeating a formidable establishment figure — former Governor Andrew Cuomo — in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary race, Mr. Mamdani has catalysed sharp discourse within the fractured and soul-searching Democratic Party, still reeling from stinging defeats in the presidential and Congressional races in 2024 that heralded the Trump 2.0 era. New York is largely a Democratic stronghold, and the winner of the primary typically goes on to win the mayoral race. In the November Mayoral election, Mr. Mamdani will take on the incumbent, the unpopular Eric Adams, who is expected to run as an independent.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s political career is relatively short — he was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020. In the State capital of Albany, he joined a small group of lawmakers affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a progressive and socialist organisation that was formed in 1982 but truly took flight during Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2016. Since then, it has emerged as a major leftist pressure group operating both within and outside the Democratic Party. Mr. Mamdani’s victory is reminiscent of a similar triumph in New York when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (fondly known as AOC) won a Congressional election in the city’s 14th district in 2018.\n\nWhile Mr. Mamdani’s legislative record is relatively modest in terms of Bills passed, his colleagues acknowledge that his work helped shift the Assembly’s ideological emphasis to the left. If elected, Mr. Mamdani would be the city’s youngest Mayor since 1917 and the first Muslim to hold the post.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s victory was no mean feat. He had to overcome the challenge posed by a candidate with extensive political experience — former two-term New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo has deep establishment ties and was endorsed by multi-billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, among others. He was also backed by a super Political Action Committee that raised $25 million to bankroll his candidacy. The fact that Mr. Cuomo had resigned from his gubernatorial duties a few years ago after being embroiled in sexual harassment cases did not deter him from attempting to obscure this record while running a conventional campaign that featured attack ads targeting Mr. Mamdani’s identity and views.\n\nGrassroots mobilisation\n\nMr. Mamdani overcame these challenges by relying on massive grassroots mobilisation — reportedly 50,000 volunteers organised by the DSA’s New York Chapter conducted a door-to-door campaign that reached an astounding 1.5 million doors. Focusing on one key issue — “affordability” in New York’s high-cost economy — Mr. Mamdani pledged to address this through a series of concrete measures. These included freezing rents for nearly a million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised apartments, providing free city buses (based on a pilot programme he had helped start as a lawmaker), creating city-owned grocery stores that would keep food costs low by buying wholesale and operating on city land, and providing childcare for infants and toddlers.\n\nThe focus on livelihood-based “bread-and-butter economic issues” helped his campaign build a broad coalition of support, including in neighbourhoods that were won by Donald Trump in the 2024 elections. Notably, Mr. Mamdani’s message was tailored to redirect working-class frustration away from the Right’s targets — immigrants and marginalised groups — toward a different culprit: billionaires. The endorsements by the doyen of the American democratic Left, Bernie Sanders, and its key public figure, AOC, also bolstered his candidacy.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Mamdani managed to register a strong win while unapologetically taking a pro-Palestine position, accusing Israel of committing “apartheid and genocide in Gaza”, supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and openly embracing his Muslim identity. This stood in sharp contrast to the Democratic Presidential campaign in 2024, where candidate Kamala Harris tacked to the right of centre, refused to halt arms sales to Israel, and did not allow a Palestinian voice to speak at the Democratic Convention. In many ways, Mr. Mamdani’s campaign — focused on welfare issues while celebrating his identity as the son of immigrant parents and a practising Muslim — represented everything the Trump administration has demonised during its current tenure.\n\nSeen in this light, Mr. Mamdani’s victory could possibly be the biggest win for the democratic socialist movement that has taken root in U.S. cities since Mr. Sanders’s national campaign. It offers a boost to a demoralised American Left caught between the right-wing populism of Mr. Trump (which has attracted segments of the traditional working class) and what critics see as the vapid centrism of the Democratic Party establishment that refuses to change course, particularly on foreign policy.\n\nInevitably, the question arises: Is Mr. Mamdani’s win a blueprint for future success for the beleaguered Democratic Party? His campaign — combining modern social media tools with traditional door-to-door campaigning — managed to generate broad support across a sprawling urban metropolis, offering lessons for other Democratic mobilisations in similar environments across the U.S. A freewheeling, accessible style is clearly a more effective approach than the carefully scripted strategy that cost Democrats in 2024.\n\n\n\nYet, challenges remain. Republicans are already working to brand Mr. Mamdani as the radical face of the Democratic Party, while the media establishment that supports the GOP has sought to use his identity to tarnish his record, with one Republican Congress representative’s fundraising appeal branding him as a “Hamas Terrorist sympathiser”. His brand of democratic socialism may indeed prove a difficult sell in the small towns and red bastions of middle America.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Mamdani’s victory may be less a simple blueprint to be copied and more a mirror held up to the Democratic Party. It has forced a reckoning, proving that a campaign centred on economic justice and unapologetic principles can generate a powerful movement. The question for party leadership is not whether they can perfectly replicate a New York City race, but whether they are willing to embrace the grassroots energy, class-based populism, and bold vision that this stunning victory represents. The future of the party may well depend on their answer.","summary":"The Democrat ran a grassroots campaign focusing on livelihood-based ‘bread-and-butter economic issues’ and upholding principled positions, such as his strong opposition to Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza, to take lead in the New York mayoral primary","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zohran-mamdani-manhattans-progressive-man/article69749418.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/o7kd1i/article69749419.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Zohran%20Mamdani_Art.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 20:10:00","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.188},{"id":336313784,"title":"Biden, Harris and Walz attend funeral for slain Minnesota state legislator","text":"Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was honored for her legislative accomplishments and her humanity during a funeral Saturday where former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the over 1,000 mourners.\n\nHortman was shot to death in a pair of attacks two weeks earlier by a man posing as a police officer that Minnesota’s chief federal prosecutor has called an assassination.

(Photo by Andrew ... More Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nI didn’t think I’d be back writing about the troubles at The Washington Post so soon, following my last piece from just a few days ago, but here we are.\n\nThat earlier piece, which you can read here, focused on the Post having lost tens of thousands of subscribers over the last several years, with the paper’s current average daily paid subscriptions now at a new low. Despite the financial backing of owner Jeff Bezos, the reality is that Post hasn’t been able to convert fleeting interest from readers into long-term loyalty; worse still, internal dysfunction and shifting editorial strategies continue to cloud the Post’s identity and future.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, two new developments suggest the challenges aren’t letting up anytime soon.\n\nAnother misstep at The Washington Post\n\nLet’s start with a newsroom experiment that executive editor Matt Murray detailed in a company memo. It’s a new initiative that will allow individuals mentioned in the Post’s stories to annotate those articles directly on the site. The movie is being framed as a way to “deepen the conversation” and keep reader engagement on the Post’s platform, rather than that discussion migrating away to X, Reddit, or elsewhere. But, come on: It’s an absolute certainty that this is going to end up backfiring in spectacular fashion.\n\nThis initiative is the kind of idea that looks fantastic on a whiteboard: Start letting some of the sources who are quoted in articles add annotations to the articles they’re mentioned in. More engagement = everybody wins. Or something like that.\n\nIn reality, the idea of real-time rebuttals next to reported journalism opens up an unnecessary Pandora’s box. What happens when a powerful figure – or anyone, really – uses the feature in bad faith to undermine verified facts? Or tries to insert spin into the conversation? Will readers trust the original reporting, or will the very presence of a sidebar reply create the illusion of “two sides” to a matter of fact? Reporters will technically be able to respond, but as I see it this risks adding “debate monitor” to their job description.\n\nThat the paper’s management decided to embark on such an initiative at all, meanwhile, should also put this next bit of negative news into context.\n\nA rebuke of The Washington Post’s Bezos era\n\nPamela Alma Weymouth, granddaughter of the late Post publisher Katharine Graham, has written a personal and extremely scathing commentary in The Nation about the situation at the Post — among other things, accusing Bezos of systematically dismantling the institution her grandmother once protected.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nShe lays the blame for much of the Post’s woes at the feet of the Amazon founder. “In the face of a more tyrannical Trump,” she writes, “Bezos has retreated. He’s muzzled his editorial page. Exceptional writers, editors, cartoonists have fled. Eight days before the election, the Post canceled a scheduled endorsement of Kamala Harris — breaking with decades of precedent. Four hundred Post journalists signed a protest letter. Two hundred and fifty thousand readers canceled their subscriptions.”\n\nThings got worse earlier this year, she continued, when Bezos dictated that Opinion writers would be expected to align with “personal liberties and free markets,” leaving little or even no room for dissenting views. Editor David Shipley and others resigned, and another wave of subscription cancellations followed. Weymouth continues: “If the free press can be manipulated by politicians, if truth is viewed as optional, if The Washington Post goes dark under Bezos, then we lose more than a legend. We lose the very thing that makes America a democracy.”\n\nWeymouth’s commentary is particularly damning in light of recent revelations about Bezos' companies engaging with Trumpworld while the Post, at the same time, shifted its own editorial voice. It’s the kind of rebuke that ought to cut deep, given that it’s rooted in the legacy of the family that once owned The Washington Post — their ownership now relegated to a bygone era of journalism.\n\nTo be sure, none of this means the Post is finished. There are still plenty of talented reporters who fill its newsroom, but decisions from the leadership have nonetheless put the paper in a precarious spot. Legacy isn’t a business model. Without a clear editorial mission and a bold plan to rebuild reader loyalty, the fact of the matter is that even a paper as storied as The Washington Post won’t be able to successfully right the ship — and avoid the inevitable.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"From a new newsroom experiment to a blistering family takedown, The Washington Post's identity crisis under Jeff Bezos keeps getting worse.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/06/28/why-the-washington-post-is-drowning-in-bad-headlines/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6860417b21d8640582196108/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 19:44:22","author":"Andy Meek,Senior Contributor","authors":["Andy Meek","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.112},{"id":336247732,"title":"Biden, Harris and Walz attend funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman","text":"Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was honored for her legislative accomplishments and her humanity during a funeral Saturday, where former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the over 1,000 mourners.Hortman was shot to death in a pair of attacks two weeks earlier by a man posing as a police officer that Minnesota's chief federal prosecutor has called an assassination.

It's about the hope that we have … that people can win elections, not just money,\" said celebrity Emily Ratajkowski as she endorsed Mamdani.\n\nVoters opted for the man with the shorter resume over someone with a problematic one. Cuomo had been backed by billionaires and as a former governor Cuomo had name recognition, but New Yorkers also could not forget the sexual harassment allegations levelled at him. \n\nMamdani's victory has energised the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. They've seized on his success as evidence that a bold left-wing platform can be electorally successful.\n\nBut that narrative is already being contested by centrist and moderate members of the party who argue a campaign like Mamdani's might work in inner cities, but will not translate to the suburbs of middle America which determine elections. \n\nEither way, Mamdani's win does a few things. \n\nIt gives progressives momentum, rattles the party establishment and presents an opportunity to Donald Trump and his Republican army. \n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n\nA few short months ago, you would have struggled to find anyone who had heard of Zohran Mamdani outside of local politics and now he is being lionised and pilloried by some of America's biggest political players.\n\nHis life story became a big part of his campaign. He was born in Kampala in Uganda to a family of Indian ancestry before he moved to New York at age seven. \n\nHis mother, Mira Nair, is a well-known film director and his father is Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University, specialising in the study of colonialism.\n\nMamdani is married to artist and ceramicist Rama Duwaji who was attacked online by right-wing trolls throughout the campaign. The couple met on Hinge. \n\nIf the people of New York back Mamdani at the general election, he'd be the first South Asian and first Muslim mayor.\n\nHe would also be an anti-capitalism mayor in a city that was arguably the birthplace of the United States free market-loving economy. \n\nBefore his political career, Mamdani worked in film and as a writer. \n\nHe even had his own short-lived hip hop career as Mr Cardamom, with lyrics like: \"I'm your boss, I'm your f**king Nani. Got a doctorate bitch, so don't f**king try me.\"\n\nMamdani ran on a hyper progressive agenda. He has been promising free buses, rent freezes, tripling the production of rent stabilised housing and to develop a chain of city-owned grocery stores to bring down the prices of basics.\n\nBut perhaps the most contentious issue in this campaign was his position on Israel and Palestine, despite the New York mayor not having any foreign policy responsibilities.\n\nMamdani's long standing activism on behalf of Palestinians and staunch criticism of Israel was seized upon by his opponents. \n\nMamdani has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and practising apartheid. He's even said he'd arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, if the Israeli prime minister was to visit New York while he was mayor.\n\nNew York City, with an estimated 1.5 to 2 million Jews, is often considered to be the second largest Jewish city in the world, after Tel Aviv. \n\nThe conventional political view has been, until now, that to be successful in New York, a candidate needed to be pro-Israel.\n\nThat was the track Cuomo was running, describing himself as a \"hyper supporter of Israel and proud of it\". \n\nAndrew Cuomo came to this race with heavy baggage, which weighed down his popularity. He stood down as governor of New York state in 2021 after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women.\n\nThe Justice Department found Cuomo had repeatedly subjected women in his office to non-consensual sexual contact. Cuomo continues to deny he did anything illegal. \n\nBut Cuomo was well supported by the Democratic establishment. \n\nAnd he was backed by billionaires like former mayor Michael Bloomberg and investor Bill Ackman.\n\nBill Clinton also backed Cuomo, who'd once served as his secretary of housing urban development, with the former president saying: \"It is imperative that New York chooses a mayor who has the ability, talent, and experience to do the job.\"\n\nWhile Cuomo's campaign did its best to paint Mamdani as ill-equipped for the job of running a city with a $115 billion budget and that employs about 300,000 workers, the voters were not swayed.\n\nTrump's people see a political play\n\nRepublicans seem to think Mamdani's win and the Democrats that delivered it have handed them a major advantage in other races.\n\nThey are doing their best to elevate Mamdani to national prominence. \n\nVice President JD Vance has been calling him \"the new leader of the Democratic Party\".\n\nWhile President Trump has been calling Mamdani a \"100% Communist Lunatic\". \n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee labelled him as an \"antisemitic socialist radical\". \n\nWhile Mamdani rejects any claim he's an antisemite, he embraces the term socialist.\n\nBasil Smikle, a political analyst and professor at Columbia University’s School of Professional Studies, said heavy-handed attacks on Mamdani could backfire by energising \"a lot of the Democratic voters to want to push more against Trump\". \n\nMamdani has paid credit to another high-profile \"Democratic socialist\", Vermont senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, calling him \"the single most influential political figure\" in his life.\n\nSanders said Mamdani's victory was due to a \"brilliant campaign\" and claims Kamala Harris would be president today if she had followed the Mamdani playbook.\n\nIn addition to Sanders, perhaps Mamdani's most important endorsement came from Congressional representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , more commonly known as AOC.\n\nShe threw her weight behind his bid in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\n\"Assemblymember Mamdani has demonstrated a real ability on the ground to put together a coalition of working-class New Yorkers that is strongest to lead the pack,\" she said.\n\nAOC is the most high-profile member of the progressive wing of the party. She's been suggested as potential president candidate in 2028 or may launch a bid to unseat the long serving senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nBut while the progressive wing is basking in the glow of the unexpected New York victory, the party is split on what the win means.\n\nDemocratic strategist Tim Lim told Politico: \"For moderates and wealthy Democratic donors, the reaction is, this is horrible and it's going to ruin us.\"\n\n\"For centre-line Democrats who don't necessarily support Mamdani's policies, the reaction is, this is a rejection of the Democratic establishment and Mamdani ran a great campaign against a sex offender.\n\n\"And for progressives, they believe this is what happens when you listen to voters.\"\n\nFor his part, Mamdani seemed ready to embrace any role as a party leader, telling supporters in his victory speech that he would govern the city \"as a model for the Democratic Party – a party where we fight for working people with no apology\". \n\nHe vowed to use his mayoral power to \"reject Donald Trump's fascism\".\n\nThe November battles \n\nMamdani will go to the general election in the mayoral race this November. Next November, the United States will vote in midterm elections, which will be the first real test of national sentiment towards the second Trump presidency. \n\nBy November 2028, the Democratic Party will have to have figured out how to defeat whoever takes over the MAGA mission. \n\nWhile Mamdani's primary victory was a seismic shock to the party, it will be but a blip if he doesn't become mayor in November and that is by no means a lock. \n\nIt's a crowded field. He'll be facing the current Mayor Eric Adams who previously won as a Democrat before leaving the party when it was clear he would not win the primary. \n\nAndrew Cuomo is also leaving the door open to a run as an independent and there will also be a Republican flag-bearer.\n\nIt is also likely to be a well-financed contest. \n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman has already promised to bankroll a rival. He has claimed he and his allies are willing to spend \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to ensure Mamdani does not emerge victorious.\n\nWhile Mamdani's pledges to hike taxes and expand services won over New York's Democrats, it might be a different matter once Republicans and independents are given their chance to make a pledge to voters. \n\nThe ranked choice system New York uses for its elections, which is similar to Australia's preferential system, also rewards moderation so it is possible it will work against him when there are more centrist candidates competing.\n\nBut win or lose in November, Mamdani has delivered a message to the party's most powerful at a time when there is a vacuum of strategy and direction.\n\nBy running on a platform that represents, not the top 1 per cent, but the other 99, Mamdani pulled off a monumental political upset. \n\n\"Cost of living is the issue of our time,\" Neera Tanden, the chief executive of Democratic think tank Center for American Progress wrote on X in response to Mamdani's win. \n\nABC/Reuters","summary":"It was a primary race that pitted competing visions for the Democratic Party against one another, and in the end, the New York progressives emerged victorious.

Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen, and numerous other politicians, along with family, friends and community members.\n\nThe Hortmans were slain on June 14 at their home in Brooklyn Park in an attack believed to be politically motivated. The Hortmans were among four shot by a suspected assassin now facing federal and state murder charges. Vance Boelter, 57, is also accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman, a fellow Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. Both survived the attack at their Champlin home. Prosecutors allege Boelter also visited the homes of two other state lawmakers he had planned to shoot.\n\n“Two lights guided their life: service and community,” said the Rev. Daniel Griffith, who presided over the Mass for the Hortmans. “Melissa manifested a servant’s heart in her work as a legislator.”\n\nThe couple lived a life devoted to community, he said. They loved having visitors to their home, which was jokingly called “The Hortman Hotel,” he said, because everybody was welcome. They hosted monthly gourmet dinner groups with their law school friends and Mark held monthly card games. The couple also loved sitting on the deck of their home together for happy hour, he said.\n\n“They shared a love for travel,” Griffith said. “Mark was a hobbyist with a curious mind” who loved mountain biking and making furniture.\n\n“His children talked of his big smile, cheesy dad jokes, and having an indomitable spirit.”\n\nGriffith also talked about Gilbert, a dog the couple had taken in to train as a service dog, but the golden retriever became very attached to Melissa.\n\nWhen it came time for him to become a service dog and leave the family, “Melissa was wrecked and emotional,” Griffith said. “The family wonders if maybe Gilbert failed the assignment on purpose so he could head back to the Hortman house.”\n\nGilbert was euthanized after also being shot in the attack.\n\nIn speaking of the Hortmans’ children, Colin and Sophie, Griffith called them a “beautiful reflection of their humanity, compassion and their sense of justice in every way, in their intelligence.”\n\nHe spoke about the statement that Sophie and Colin Hortman released after their parents were killed:\n\n“Plant a tree, pet a dog, try a new hobby like Mark would have, stand up for justice and peace. The best way to honor their parents is to do something to make our community just a little better for someone else,” he said. “Mark and Melissa lived this reality.”\n\n‘She saw the humanity in every single person she worked with’\n\nWalz gave a eulogy after the Mass, listing some of the ways that the couple made the state of Minnesota better, saying Melissa Hortman was the most consequential House speaker in Minnesota history, a close friend, a mentor to him and the most talented lawmaker he had ever met.\n\nHortman, who was first elected in 2004, helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives during the momentous 2023 session as the chamber’s speaker. With the House split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita, and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government.\n\nMillions of Minnesotans now have better lives because Melissa and Mark Hortman chose public service and politics, Walz said.\n\n“More kids in pre-K. Fewer in poverty. More kids in schools with the tools and teachers they need. Fewer with hungry students. More trees in the ground and clean energy coursing through the grid. Fewer roads and bridges at risk of failure,” Walz said. “More people in safe and secure housing. Fewer worrying about managing how to care for their loved ones. That’s the legacy that Mark and Melissa will leave behind for all Minnesotans.”\n\nWalz painted a picture of the domestic life the couple led, mentioning Mark’s love of shooting pool and Melissa’s love of her garden where she “fussed over her lilies like they were a wayward member of that caucus,” he joked, eliciting laughter from the pews.\n\nTheir life outside of politics and public service took place in their kitchen, where Mark “fed his sourdough starter, Melissa mixed the margaritas and baked the cakes, and Gilbert sat there begging for scraps, and the sound of that kitchen filled with laughter.”\n\nWalz said Mark was proud of Melissa and her biggest supporter.\n\nHe said that the couple were an example of how people were at the heart of all politics.\n\n“It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all its significance, that politics is just people,” he said. “That’s all it is. Just a bunch of human beings trying to do the best they can. Melissa understood that better than anybody I knew. She saw the humanity in every single person she worked with. And she kept things focused on the people she served. Her mission was to get as much good done for as many people as possible. It was the Golden Rule instilled in her by her father and the passion to serve she learned from her mother.”\n\nMark’s focus was people, too, Walz said, and he was a beloved colleague and friend to so many people.\n\nThe governor said the best way to honor the Hortmans would be by following their example.\n\n“Maybe it is this moment where each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for things we care about,” Walz said. “A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did — fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity.”\n\n‘There is much more work to be done’\n\nGriffith said that the Hortmans’ children gave him permission to speak about how the guiding principles the Hortmans lived by were “antidotes to our present afflictions” as a state and nation.\n\n“Here in Minnesota, we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice, the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church today,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms as they are a threat to human dignity and, indeed, our democracy.\n\n“Sadly, racial disparity, some of the most acute in the country, persists here in Minnesota with modest gains in some areas and widening gaps in others over the last five years. But friends, Minnesotans, this can be the ground zero place for restoration and justice and healing, but we must work together and there is much more work to be done. Your presence here is a sign that we can do that work,” he said.\n\nOn Friday, thousands of mourners streamed through the state Capitol in St. Paul to pay their respects to the Hortmans and Gilbert as they lay in state. Melissa Hortman is the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol. It was also the first time a couple has lain in state there, and the first time for a dog.\n\nBefore the Hortmans, 19 people had been accorded the honor. The first was Civil War veteran William Colvill in 1905.\n\nAfter the service, Walz presented the Hortman children with U.S. and Minnesota flags that flew over the Capitol on the day their parents were killed. A private burial will be held.\n\nAlex Derosier contributed to this report, which includes information from the Associated Press.","summary":"Millions of Minnesotans now have better lives because Melissa and Mark chose public service and politics, Gov.

Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home two weeks ago by a man posing as a police officer that Minnesota's chief federal prosecutor has called an assassination. The assailant also shot and seriously wounded a Democratic state senator and his wife at their home. “Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history. I get to remember her as a close friend, a mentor and the most talented legislator I have ever known,” Gov. Tim Walz said in his eulogy at the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis. ”For seven years, I have had the privilege of signing her agenda into law. I know millions of Minnesotans get to live their lives better because she and Mark chose public service and politics.” Neither Biden nor Harris spoke, but they sat in the front row with the governor and his wife, Gwen. Biden also paid his respects Friday as the Hortmans and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda in St. Paul. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. Biden also visited the wounded senator, John Hoffman, in a hospital. Dozens of current and former state legislators from both parties and other elected officials who worked with Hortman also attended. Hortman, who was first elected in 2004, helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives including free lunches for public school students during a momentous 2023 session as the chamber’s speaker, along with expanded protections for abortion and trans rights. With the House split 67 to 67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government. Walz said Hortman saw her mission as “to get as much good done for as many people as possible.” He said her focus on people was what made her so effective. “She certainly knew how to get her way. No doubt about that,” Walz said. “But she never made anyone feel that they’d gotten rolled at a negotiating table. That wasn’t part of it for her, or a part of who she was. She didn’t need somebody else to lose\" for her to win, he said. The governor said the best way to honor the Hortmans would be by following their example. “Maybe it is this moment where each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for things we care about,\" Walz said. \"A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did — fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity.” The Rev. Daniel Griffith, pastor and rector of the Basilica of St. Mary, who led the service, said the country is in need of deep healing. He said it seems as if the U.S. is living in the “dystopian reality” described at the beginning of William Butler Yeats' poem “The Second Coming.” “Here in Minnesota, we have been the ground-zero place, sadly, for racial injustice,\" Griffith said. \"The killing of George Floyd just miles from our church today. And now we are the ground-zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed, our democracy.” But the priest also said Minnesota could also be “a ground-zero place for restoration and justice and healing.” He added that the presence of so many people was a sign that that work can succeed. Archbishop Bernard Hebda of the Saint Paul and Minneapolis Archdiocese offered his condolences to the Hortman family. A private burial will be held at a later date. The Hortmans were proud of their adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, and the lawmaker often spoke of them. In a voice choked with emotion, Colin said his parents embodied the Golden Rule, and he read the Prayer of St. Francis, which his mother always kept in her wallet. He said it captures her essence. It starts, “Lord make me an instrument of your peace.” After the service, Walz presented the children with U.S. and Minnesota flags that flew over the Capitol on the day their parents were killed. The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park and wounding Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin on June 14 made a brief court appearance Friday. He's due back in court Thursday. Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, Minn., surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest manhunt in Minnesota history. Boelter has not entered a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views and a supporter of President Trump. Prosecutors have declined to speculate on a motive.

Voters Who Re-Elected Donald Trump Now Sound the AlarmOne of the main concerns is deep cuts to Medicaid that many Trump voters say could cost them their homes, their health care, and even their loved ones, according to the Stitch Snitches report.Among those voicing out their concerns is Courtney Leader, a 36-year-old mother from Missouri, a deep-red state where Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris by 18 points, according to the report. Leader isn’t a political operative or an activist, but she's just a mom trying to keep her daughter, Cyrina, alive, as per the Stitch Snitches report.ALSO READ: California’s AB5 Law under fire, nail techs sue state over worker classification – what the law states?A Missouri Mother’s Plea: “This Isn’t a Luxury”She explained that, “This is not a luxury,” adding, “I do not have my daughter enrolled on Medicaid so we can have fancy things. I have her enrolled so we can keep her alive and keep her at home, which I think is the best option for her,” as quoted in the report.Live EventsCyrina relies on a specialised feeding formula that costs over $1,500 a month, which is more than the family’s mortgage and grocery bills combined, and without Medicaid, Leader says there’s no way they could cover the cost, according to the Stitch Snitches report. Leader asked, “Who’s going to protect us when they can’t get paperwork done in time and we lose coverage for a month or two?,\" and added, \"I’m worried that the red tape is going to affect our Medicaid because of just the oversight burdens. And that as a result, I’m going to lose my daughter, because she’s lost coverage before,” as quoted in the report.She has even written a letter to communicated about her concerns to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), a Trump supporter and key defender of the bill, she pleaded with him to consider the human cost, saying, “Without Medicaid, we would lose everything — our home, our vehicles, and eventually, our daughter,” quoted Stitch Snitches.ALSO READ: Pokrovsk in peril?

While Trump and Republican leaders insist the cuts only target “waste, fraud, and abuse,” the CBO’s analysis highlighted that the vulnerable populations—including children, seniors, and people with disabilities, will be directly impacted if the bill becomes law in its current form, according to the report.Some Republicans Express Quiet ConcernAccording to the Stitch Snitches report, the proposed Medicaid cuts have also led to concern among some GOP senators, who fear that millions of constituents could lose coverage.

Cronkite, who was the face of \"CBS Evening News\" from 1962 to 1981, was the premier anchorman of America’s golden age of network news. In 1976, at the height of Cronkite’s reign as \"the most trusted man in America,\" CBS News president Richard Salant penned a 76-page document outlining CBS News standards. Page 58 is focused on editing and suggests the \"60 Minutes\" interview at the center of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News would have been frowned upon during the Cronkite era. \"The objective of the editing process is to produce a clear and succinct statement which reflects fairly, honestly and without distortion what was seen and heard by our reporters, cameras and microphones,\" Salant wrote in the 1976 document, which has come to the attention of the Trump legal team. MEDIATOR IN TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST PARAMOUNT, CBS NEWS PROPOSES $20 MILLION SETTLEMENT Trump’s lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was criticized for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, she gave a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing her answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. The raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same lengthy response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. CBS BLASTS TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER CBS News, which has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital when asked if the Cronkite-era standards have changed. \"If more than one excerpt from a speech or statement is included in a documentary broadcast, the order of their inclusion in the broadcast will be the same as the order of their inclusion in the speech or statement, unless the broadcast specifically indicates otherwise,\" Salant wrote in the 1976 CBS News Standards guide. When Cronkite died in 2009 at age 92, his Associated Press obituary said the famed anchor \"valued accuracy, objectivity and understated compassion\" and \"always aimed to be fair and professional in his judgments\" regardless of personal views on a topic. Two polls pronounced Cronkite the \"most trusted man in America\": a 1972 \"trust index\" survey in which he finished No. 1, about 15 points higher than leading politicians, and a 1974 survey in which people chose him as the most trusted television newscaster, according to the AP. ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCERS RAIL AGAINST TRUMP'S ‘BULLS---’ LAWSUIT, DREAD PROSPECTS OF PARAMOUNT MAKING SETTLEMENT Salant, who was running CBS News when \"60 Minutes\" was launched, was lauded by The New York Times when he died in 1993. \"He was credited with raising professional standards and expanding news programming at CBS,\" the Times wrote. CBS News, along with parent company Paramount, are currently in mediation with hopes of settling with Trump. The mediator recently proposed the network end the president's $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal. Last month, Trump rejected Paramount's $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology. According to the Wall Street Journal, Paramount \"isn’t prepared\" to give one. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Joseph A.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Former President Joe Biden joined thousands of mourners Friday as former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda while the man charged with killing her and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.\n\nHortman, a Democrat, is the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans accorded the honor. She lay in state with her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert. Her husband was also killed in the June 14 attack, and Gilbert was seriously wounded and had to be euthanized. It was the first time a couple has lain in state at the Capitol, and the first time for a dog.\n\nThe scene at the Capitol\n\nThe Hortmans’ caskets and the dog’s urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch on either side as thousands of people who lined up filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.\n\nAmong the first to pay their respects were Gov. Tim Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross, and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again, and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.\n\nThe Capitol was open for the public from noon to 5 p.m. Friday, but officials said anyone waiting in line at 5 would be let in. House TV livestreamed the viewing. A private funeral is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday and will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety’s YouTube channel.\n\nBiden will attend the funeral, a spokesperson said. So will former Vice President Kamala Harris, though neither is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman’s adult children, and spoke with Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.\n\nLisa Greene, who lives in Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.\n\n“She was just amazing. Amazing woman. “And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,” Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. “She was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.” But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also “a boss. She just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen.”\n\nA hearing takes a twist\n\nThe man accused of killing the Hortmans and wounding another Democratic lawmaker and his wife made a short court appearance Friday to face charges for what the chief federal prosecutor for Minnesota has called “a political assassination.” Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities have called the largest search in Minnesota history.\n\nAn unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.\n\n“Your honor, I haven’t really slept in about 12 to 14 days,” Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. “I’ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.”\n\nRelated: Minnesota likely knew nothing of Boelter’s gun arsenal, and that’s the law\n\nAtwal told the court that Boelter had been in what’s known as a “Gumby suit,” without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls, and the smell drifts to Boelter’s cell.\n\nThe attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge agreed.\n\nProsecutors did not object to the delay and said they also had concerns about the jail conditions.\n\nThe acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, told reporters afterward that he did not think Boelter had attempted to kill himself.\n\nThe case continues\n\nBoelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.\n\nAccording to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans’ home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers’ homes dressed as a police officer.\n\nRelated: Pizza terrorism, online vitriol and now murder: Lawmakers fear for their safety and don’t know how to change that\n\nHis lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. The Death Penalty Information Center says a federal death penalty case hasn’t been prosecuted in Minnesota in the modern era, as best as it can tell.\n\nBoelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole, assuming that county prosecutors get their own indictment for first-degree murder. But federal authorities intend to use their power to try Boelter first.\n\nOther victims and alleged targets\n\nAuthorities say Boelter shot and wounded Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin before shooting and killing the Hortmans in their home in the northern Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, a few miles away.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. Prosecutors also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.","summary":"Thousands of mourners filed past the caskets for the Hortmans, the first couple to lie in state at the Capitol.\n\n\nThe post Biden pays respects as former Minnesota House Speaker Hortman, killed in shooting, lies in state appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2025/06/biden-pays-respects-as-former-minnesota-house-speaker-hortman-killed-in-shooting-lies-in-state/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hortman1-e1751123607603.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 16:04:57","author":"Associated Press,Steve Karnowski","authors":["Associated Press","Steve Karnowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.053},{"id":336195730,"title":"Live: Biden and Harris attend funeral service for Melissa and Mark Hortman in Minneapolis","text":"Funeral services for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were held Saturday morning at the Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis, after the couple was killed in what officials have described as a politically motivated assassination.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris attended the services and sat next to Gov.

Whether Trump will ultimately be able to repeal the longstanding legal precedent that grants citizenship to all children born on American soil is unclear.\n\nHere are some well-known actors and politicians who would not have been American citizens when they were born if birthright had not existed.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, 54, is the son of Cuban immigrants who did not become naturalized U.S. citizens until 1975, years after their son was born.\n\nRubio has previously said he does not agree with repealing birthright citizenship.\n\nDiane Guerrero\n\nActress Diane Guerrero, who starred in the hit television show \"Orange is the New Black,” was born to undocumented immigrants from Columbia who were deported when she was 14, she toldNPR in 2019.\n\nIn an interview with the outlet, she said, “This is a country of immigrants. People forget – they like to forget that their ancestors came here with the same dream, with the same hopes, with the same fears. And it's unfair to say that because people are coming later that they don't deserve to be here.”\n\nNikki Haley\n\nNikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2024, was born in South Carolina to immigrants from the Punjab region of India, according to her autobiography.\n\nIn 2015, she told The State news outlet that her parents were in the United States legally but did not become naturalized citizens until after her birth, and the non-partisan American Immigration Council considers her a U.S. citizen because of her place of birth.\n\nBruce Lee, the martial arts icon who starred in films such as \"Enter the Dragon\" and \"Fists of Fury,\" was born in San Francisco while his parents were traveling with the Chinese Opera.\n\nThe National Archives notes that under birthright citizenship he was considered a citizen ‒ though he would not be under Trump's revision to the law. \"Lee’s parents filed for a Return Certificate on his behalf … enabling him to return to the United States if he later wished to do so. Lee did return at the age of 18 and grew into the iconic martial artist and film star known across the world.\"\n\nKamala Harris\n\nTrump's executive order ending birthright citizenship may have been designed explicitly against his November rival for the presidency, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDavid Bier, of the Libertarian Cato Institute, posted on X the day Trump signed the order: \"As I predicted, Trump's birthright citizenship EO includes a Kamala Harris clause, specifically designed to deny the legitimacy of her US citizenship as the child of someone with a temporary status.\"\n\nTrump's order specifies that someone wouldn't be entitled to birthright if their mother was on a temporary visa ‒ like the student visa Harris' mother was on at the time of her birth ‒ and their father wasn't a citizen, as hers wasn't.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, the tech billionaire and 2024 Republican presidential candidate, told NBC News in 2023 that his father never became a U.S. citizen and his mother only naturalized after he was born.\n\nRamaswamy, who Trump endorsed in next year's Ohio gubernatorial race, has repeatedly called for an end to birthright citizenship.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, Eduardo Cuevas, Sara Chernikoff, Ramon Padilla and Bart Jansen, USA TODAY","summary":"From Bruce Lee to Marco Rubio: A list of celebrity birthright citizens  USA Today","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/28/birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-celebrities/84387876007/","image":"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/11/13/NOKL/76258878007-usatsi-23281090.jpg?crop=6670,3753,x0,y634&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 15:28:14","author":"Christopher Cann","authors":["Christopher Cann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211}]}
