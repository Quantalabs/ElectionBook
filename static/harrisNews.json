However, a series of impressive results in special legislative elections this year — significantly surpassing the performance of the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in each — has sparked hope that the party might secure some significant Republican-held offices in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nExcitement was already brewing among Democrats about their chances in the forthcoming governor’s race, the U.S. Senate, and a couple of competitive House contests.\n\nIn the meantime, Democratic contenders in four off-cycle, special legislative contests demonstrated double-digit improvements compared to Harris’ 2024 vote share, the latest political benchmarks in those areas. As of Tuesday night, this streak includes a victory that transformed a Republican seat and disrupted the GOP supermajority in the Iowa Senate. Party members are keen to link the stretch to public sentiment regarding President Donald Trump and their general prospects in what was once a swing state but has leaned decidedly red during the Trump era.\n\n“Iowa voters have seen Trump’s tariff tax blunders negatively impact farmers, and the GOP’s Medicaid cuts threaten their local hospitals — all while Iowa Republicans remain oblivious,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, shared with NBC News. “Working families across the Hawkeye state recognize they deserve more, which is why they’re gravitating towards state Democrats ready to oppose Trump’s disastrous policies, even in red districts he captured by large margins last November.”\n\nRepublicans argue that these predictions are easily dismissible, pointing to the very low turnout in these quiet off-year, down-ballot special elections.\n\nThey also highlighted how much effort and investment Democrats made in these races — and how strongly Republican the state has become over the past two decades, evidenced during regular campaigns when full electorates turn out to vote.\n\n“I think it’s a mistake to read too much into these special elections, because the turnout is so low — and when the Democrats are particularly motivated,” said David Kochel, a Republican strategist in Iowa. “I would caution anyone who tries to read too much into any of these special elections. They’re so poorly representative of what the overall vote in Iowa might look like in 2026.\n\n“Iowa is still a Republican state. It’s going to be a Republican state,” he added.\n\nIn Tuesday’s special election victory, Democrat Catelin Drey won a Sioux City-area district with 55% of the vote to Republican Christopher Prosch’s 45%, according to unofficial results with all precincts reporting. That’s a 22-point shift from the margin the presidential election last year, when Harris lost the district by 12 percentage points, according to data crunched by The Downballot, a left-leaning political site.\n\nDemocrats recorded double-digit improvements in three other special legislative elections in Iowa earlier this year. In April, Democrats held a seat in a special legislative election in a reliably blue Cedar Rapids district but expanded on Harris’ margin of victory by 26 percentage points, according to The Downballot’s analysis. \n\nIn March, Democrats lost a special legislative race in a safe GOP district in southeastern Iowa — but by only 3 percentage points in a district that Trump carried by 27 percentage points last year, that analysis showed.\n\nAnd in a January special Senate election, Democrats flipped an eastern Iowa district by 4 points, after Trump won it by 21 percentage points, according to The Downballot.\n\nThe special elections precede a busy midterm year in 2026. Next year, there is an open race for governor, with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds not seeking a third full term. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates the contest “Lean Republican.”\n\nMultiple candidates are running in the primaries on both sides. Iowa Auditor of State Rob Sand is seen as the Democratic front-runner. On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is seen as the front-runner, having outraised all of his opponents in the first half of the year. Feenstra hasn’t formally launched his campaign, but he has formed an exploratory committee and said he would formally announce in September.\n\nIowans haven’t elected a Democratic governor since 2006.\n\nThere are also two House races that are expected to be competitive. \n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, which encompasses a southeastern chunk of the state, Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks faces a competitive road to re-election. Miller-Meeks won her 2024 race over Democrat Christina Bohannan by just under 800 votes, and Bohannan is among the Democrats running for the seat next year. Cook rates the 2026 race as a “toss-up.”\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, centered on Des Moines, Republican Rep. Zach Nunn could also face a competitive race. Nunn won his race last year by 3.8 percentage points after having flipped the seat in the 2022 midterms. Several Democrats have already jumped into the race or have signaled they will. Cook rates the 2026 race as “Lean Republican.”\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is up for re-election next year, too, though she hasn’t yet announced whether she is running again. Cook rates her race as “Likely Republican.” \n\nIowa hasn’t sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.\n\nTrump won Iowa last year by more than 13 percentage points and by more than 8 percentage points in 2020. \n\nDespite that recent record, several Democratic candidates were eager to say their gains in the recent slate of special elections were part of a broader trend in the state that they said was feeding their optimism.\n\n“It really confirms what we’ve been seeing and feeling on the ground here for the last couple of months,” Bohannan said. “Iowans are ready for change. They are absolutely fed up with the status quo.”\n\nState Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, who is running in the 3rd District, said Democrats’ gains are “a really great sign that Iowans are fed up and they’re ready for something better and something different.” \n\nBut only a slice of the voters who participate in national elections showed up for the recent races.\n\nFor example, just 7,600 voters cast ballots in Drey’s race, according to the unofficial results — only 24% of all eligible voters. That’s compared with the more than 14,000 who voted in the last regular general election for the state Senate seat, in November 2022.\n\nRepublicans also pointed to the great lengths — with regard to volunteers and door-knockers — that Democrats went to to help turn out their voters.\n\n“A special election doesn’t necessarily indicate anything for the next election cycle, because voter turnout is so different in a special election,” a national Republican operative familiar with Iowa politics told NBC News. “Democrats spent a ton of money, they flew in volunteers, they rushed the gates on this just to try and make a point.”\n\nJeff Kaufmann, the Iowa GOP chair, said, “National Democrats were so desperate for a win that they activated 30,000 volunteers and a flood of national money to win a state Senate special election by a few hundred votes.”\n\nMany Democrats also acknowledged that they would have to do more to continue their successful streak into the midterms.\n\n“It’s a snapshot in time. I don’t think we should put all of our stock in it,” said Debbie Cox Bultan, the CEO of NewDEAL, a left-leaning political strategy firm. “It’s encouraging, but absolutely we cannot rest on our laurels and think we’re going to get there only by people voting against Trump. We’ve got to give them something to vote for.”\n\nA Democratic strategist in Iowa attributed the party’s gains in recent local special elections to the fact that “people are not happy with the direction that the state is going” while it’s under GOP control — but added that Democrats’ overperformance in recent state legislative elections are “not necessarily indicative of the national environment.” \n\nBut Drey’s win Tuesday “signals the fact that Iowans are looking around” for change, the strategist said. The strategist noted that the recent special election wins were all in places that aren’t traditional Democratic strongholds — and noted the crowds that Sand, the gubernatorial candidate, has been getting.\n\nSand has notched rare statewide wins for his party in recent years. But claiming the governorship — and making other gains in the state — would need another level of shift in Iowa.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIowa Democrats have faced tough times recently.

Misdemeanors, perhaps? \n\nRemember: The DSA’s not a political party like the Democrats or Republicans — it’s a membership organization of staunch ideologues who require purity tests to remain a member in good standing.\n\nIt unendorsed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year because, among other things, she signed onto a statement that supported strengthening Israel’s Iron Dome, and DSA members called for Rep. Jamaal Bowman to be booted out for visiting Israel in 2021. \n\nFriendly advice, Zohran: Having staffers simply announce in your name that you no longer hold a position you took publicly just a year or three ago didn’t work for Kamala Harris last year, and it won’t do well for you now.\n\nIf you disagree with the clearly stated positions of an organization you’re a member of, say so yourself — and show you really mean it, by explaining in your own words why that position is wrong, not just inconvenient.\n\nOr are you just hiding your true agenda until you get elected, then it’s DSA-endorsed policies all the way?","summary":"A challenge to mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani: If you disagree with the Democratic Socialist of America's call to end all misdemeanor offenses, say it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/27/opinion/if-zohran-disagrees-with-the-dsa-on-misdemeanors-he-needs-to-say-that/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/RC287GAH05DO-1076066810-3-e1756335485645.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:20:36","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":354967490,"title":"Democratic leaders still support arming Israel. Their voters largely do not, citing Gaza ‘genocide’","text":"This past week, the global community largely condemned the Israeli government for a strike on a hospital in Gaza that killed 20 people. Israel’s strike killed five journalists, including Maryam Abu Daqqa, who worked for The Independent’s sister site Independent Arabia. \n\nEver since the Israeli government began its Gaza-based response to the October 7th terrorist attack in Israel — where Hamas invaders killed more than 1,100 people and took some 200 hostages — the issue has threatened to split the Democratic Party. \n\nThis week, the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting became the latest battleground for the party’s split on Israel. Progressive activists had wanted to put forward a resolution to withhold military aid to Israel, while DNC Chairman Ken Martin put forward a resolution calling for humanitarian aid to Gaza and an end to the war. \n\nMartin's resolution passed while the one put forth by progressives failed. Then Martin did the most Democratic Party thing possible: he retracted his resolution and announced the creation of a task force.\n\nBut if Democratic elected leaders and party officials still remain largely supportive of Israel, their voters are moving away from them on the issue. \n\nOn Wednesday, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that 50 percent of Americans think Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza. \n\nBut the divide is even more stark along party lines: While only 20 percent of Republicans think that Israel is committing a genocide, a whopping 77 percent of Democrats say the Jewish State is. \n\nThe poll also showed that while Americans are roughly split on which side they sympathize more with, 63 percent of Democrats said their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians than Israelis. It also found that 63 percent of Democrats think the United States is too supportive of Israel and 75 percent of Democrats oppose sending more military aid to Israel. \n\nThe numbers paint a fairly clear picture. And even Democratic senators, members of that stodgy old bastion of conventional wisdom and hawkish foreign policy, have had enough. Last month, 26 Democratic senators joined Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to withhold the sales of certain arms to Israel. \n\nEven moderates like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, joined the resolution. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), the freshman former CIA analyst, missed the vote for an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. When The Independent asked her about it, she said she put out a statement on the matter.\n\n“I just put out a giant statement, two pages long,” Slotkin said, adding she would have voted for the resolution. When The Independent followed up last month, she again referred to the same “statement.”\n\nLest anyone think the Quinnipiac poll is an outlier, YouGov and The Economist also commissioned a poll and found that U.S. adult citizens’ sympathies are about split between Israelis and Palestinians, a plurality of 44 percent of Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians. \n\nAnd lest anyone think that number is padded by people who did not turn out last year, 45 percent of people who said they voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 said they sympathized more with the Palestinians. \n\nThe Democratic Party’s relationship with Israel and Palestine reflects its big-tent nature. The party has been the political home of a majority of Jewish Americans since the turn of the 20th century as it championed itself as representing the downtrodden and the excluded. Harry Truman recognized the state of Israel in 1948.\n\nBut many Democratic voters, including many Jews, now see Palestinians as victims of a right-wing ultra-nationalist government in Israel that seeks to remove them from a land they consider their home. And it looks like their sympathies have aligned as much. \n\nMartin’s initial resolution and then subsequent formation of a subcommittee will likely be seen as delaying an inevitable tide shift that occurred in the Democratic Party on guns and abortion. \n\nA perfect example? Prior to his job as DNC chairman, Martin led Minnesota’s state party. And both of his senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, joined Sanders’ resolution.","summary":"An internal DNC dispute about withholding weapons sales to Israel reflects a larger truth: Democratic support for Israel is dwindling the longer the war in Gaza goes on, Eric Garcia writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democratic-leaders-still-support-arming-israel-their-voters-largely-do-not-citing-gaza-genocide-b2815308.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/24/22/Democrats_16372.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qG18CyG5-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 22:35:11","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":354954254,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: DC Crime Crackdown","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) on Wednesday brushed aside questions about whether he might jump into California's 2026 governor's race, but declined to rule out the idea. Padilla instead said he was wholly focused on promoting the special election in November when voters will be asked to redraw California's congressional districts to counter efforts by President Trump and other GOP leaders to keep Republicans in control of Congress. \"I'm focused and I'd encourage everybody to focus on this Nov. 4 special election,\" Padilla said during an interview at a political summit in Sacramento sponsored by Politico. The 52-year-old added that the effort to redraw congressional districts, championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to similar efforts in GOP-led states, is not solely about the arcane process known as redistricting. \"My Republican colleagues and especially the White House know how unpopular and damaging what they're doing is, from gutting Medicare, nutrition assistance programs, really all these other areas of budget cuts to underwrite tax breaks for billionaires,\" Padilla said. \"So their only hope of staying in power beyond next November is to rig the system.\" In recent days, Padilla's name has emerged as a possible candidate to replace Newsom, who cannot run for another term. The field is unsettled, with independent polling conducted after former Vice President Kamala Harris opted not to run for governor showing large numbers of voters are undecided and with no clear front-runner. Padilla pointed to his more than quarter-century history of serving Californians at every level of government when asked what might be appealing about the job. \"I love California, right?\" he said. \"And I've had the privilege and the honor of serving in so many different capacities.\" In 1999, the then-26-year-old was elected to Los Angeles City Council. At the time, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology grad still lived with his parents — a Mexican-born housekeeper and a short-order cook — in Pacoima. Padilla continued his steady climb through the state's political ranks in the decades that followed, serving in the state Senate and as California secretary of state. Newsom appointed him to fill Harris' Senate seat in 2020, making him the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, and Padilla was elected to fill a full term in 2022. His current Senate term doesn't end until 2029, meaning he wouldn't have to risk his seat to run for governor.","summary":"U.S. Sen.

There has been no official confirmation of the reports from either the Indian or the American side.Officials who served in the White House during Trump 1.0 traced mutual misgivings to July 22, 2019, when the US President, a novice in issues relating to the subcontinent, told Pakistan's then PM Imran Khan during his visit to the White House that he was willing to mediate in the Kashmir issue if both countries agreed, claiming that Modi had asked him to play a role.The remark shocked New Delhi, which said there was no such request from Modi in keeping with India's long held stand that it is a bilateral issue that brooks no third-party mediation.According to White House insiders, Trump's flub came despite a 45-minute briefing by senior officials well-versed in the region in which they explained the intricacies -- for which he apparently had no bandwidth. His mediation offer could also have been based on a misunderstanding of a private phone conversation with Modi in which the Indian PM may have suggested he temper Pakistan's approach to the issue. In either case, Trump was nonplussed why anyone would reject his offer for mediation, the sources said.A rousing visit to India for the Namaste Trump rally, just days before the Covid shutdown, papered over this glitch. The second snafu came in September 2024 when Modi was visiting the US to attend the UN General Assembly and the Quad summit hosted by President Biden. Indian interlocutors reached out to Trump, who was campaigning for a second term, to set up a meeting, while also reaching out to his rival Kamala Harris. While Trump readily agreed to see the Indian PM and even announced at a campaign event in Michigan that he was meeting Modi, Harris' campaign balked.The Indian side backed out of the Trump meeting since it did not want to meet only one candidate. This did not go down well with Trump, since he had already announced he was meeting Modi.Still, the two principals appeared to have overcome the wrinkles when Modi became one of the first foreign leaders to meet Trump in the White House after he won a second term, the US President hosting him for a working visit on February 13 this year. But by this time, Trump had worked himself into a rage over the tariff issue, not just at India (although he had begun to call it the tariff king), but the world at large. Although officials from both sides put together a grand COMPACT (\"Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) for the 21st Century”), Trump had little bandwidth for pages and pages of fact sheets and joint statement loaded with Modi's favored acronyms. He wanted headline-making big ticket announcements. He got little for his MAGA faithful beyond projections and promises on the trade front.Moreover, when Trump spoke of MAGA, Modi responded that it could co-exist with his own idea of MIGA aka Viksit Bharat. And then there was the small matter of Elon Musk calling on Modi at Blair House before the Oval Office meeting. By then Trump had begun to sour on Tesla and Apple's plans in India.The fourth episode came during the four-day India-Pakistan conflict, which Trump fervently believes he brought to an end. While New Delhi says there was no phone conversation between Trump and Modi during the clash, in the US President's mind, he got Vance to make the call (after possibly failing to reach Modi). Modi himself has said he missed several calls from Vance before he could be reached.Trump's latest comments -- sketchy and disjointed -- suggests he talked the Pakistani leadership (not clear who) and warned them they would not get a trade deal if they did not stop the fighting. India says it only responded to the Pakistani overtures for a truce, which New Delhi agreed to. Repudiating his role in dousing a war that he believes would have gone nuclear has clearly miffed Trump, who has been fairly transparent in his quest for a Nobel Peace Prize.The final straw came when Modi declined Trump's invitation to stop by at the White House on his way back from G-20 in Canada, on the same day the US President had invited Pakistan's de facto military ruler Asim Munir. The Indian side feared a photo-op ambush. By this time, bilateral negotiations on trade were drawing to a conclusion with negotiating teams from both sides so close to a deal that top US officials said it was imminent. But peeved over what he possibly saw as multiple slights, Trump torpedoed it, using India's Russian oil purchase as a ruse.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search","summary":"The Trump-Modi friendship, once hailed as a 'bromance,' faced several challenges during Trump's presidency.

Here's why","text":"The GOP’s Senate campaign arm is warning that a coming update to Apple’s iOS could cost the committee more than $25 million in lost fundraising\n\nAn upcoming iPhone update from Apple has raised an alarm among Republicans fundraisers in the United States, who fear it could block key voter outreach and fundraising messages. Tech giant's new filtration system, due for rollout in September, may disproportionately impact Republican campaigns that rely heavily on text-based outreach, Fox News reported.According to a report in Campaigns and Elections, the GOP’s Senate campaign arm is warning that a coming update to Apple’s iOS could cost the committee more than $25 million in lost fundraising. The National Republican Senatorial Committee sounded an alarm over a July 2024 memo that the new spam filters for text messages which Apple is set to roll out as part of iOS 26. Those filters will send messages from numbers that are not in a users’ contacts to a separate folder for unknown senders. iPhone users will then have the chance to mark the number as known, reply to the message or delete it altogether. That creates a headache for political fundraisers, according to the NRSC’s memo, because iPhone users aren’t likely to check their unknown senders folder. Consequently, it argues, a large swath of political outreach, including GOTV messages to fundraising texts, will go unnoticed. Text messages from known numbers saved on an individual's phone are expected to continue alerting recipients and sending the messages to their typical text app.ALSO READ: 'No murders in North Korea too': CNN brutally bashes Trump claims about DC crime and murder-free streak Live EventsApple's new update is headache for RepublicansSean Dollman, founding partner of American Made Media Company, which was the parent firm of Launchpad Strategies and was the exclusive digital agency for Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, said that the move was no surprise.\"It’s no surprise that Big Tech wants to stop Donald Trump and other Republicans from communicating with people, because they’ve tried every other method to interfere already,\" Sean Dollman, founding partner of American Made Media Company, the parent company of Launchpad Strategies, which was the exclusive digital firm for Trump 2024, told Fox News Digital. \"Big Tech has suppressed him, suspended him, and banned him outright.

The iPhone user will then be able to choose whether to take the call or decline it.Launchpad Strategies acted as the exclusive digital firm for Trump’s 2024 campaign, managing online advertising and strategic consulting during his decisive victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris. According to its website, the firm continues to operate as a “full-service Republican digital agency committed to helping campaigns win.”Fox Digital reported that Launchpad raised an astonishing $509 million for Trump’s 2024 campaign, alongside an additional $18 million from 40 other clients during the record-breaking election year.ALSO READ: Self-driving cars and automated warehouses? Nvidia's Jetson Thor is powerful robot brain for next-gen AI robots Why is it important?Data from the 2024 election cycle shows that Republicans relied on text messaging twice as much as Democrats, leaving them particularly exposed if Apple’s new filter takes effect this September. The timing is especially crucial with the midterms approaching, as Democrats see an opportunity to regain control of both the House and Senate.Screenshots of recent fundraising texts, reviewed by a US-based news outlet, highlight how central Donald Trump remains to the strategy. Supporters are encouraged to save his number in their contacts or reply directly to build a message history. The texts are crafted to feel personal and interactive: one reads, “From Trump: Did you save my number yet?” Another urges, “Download the Trump Contact Card to add me to your address book.” Some go even further, prompting recipients with messages like, “Trump: If you had 5 minutes with me, what would you say? No links. I just want your reply below.”ALSO READ: US' fastest train is here: Amtrak's NextGen Acela to launch service between DC, Boston and NYC.

During the 2020 election cycle alone, GOP candidates raised $737 million through the WinRed platform—but only 32% of their emails reached supporters, leading the party to estimate a staggering $1.5 billion in missed contributions.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onfox newsiPhone updateRepublican fundraisersApple iOS 26text message spam filtersNational Republican Senatorial Committeepolitical fundraisingapple update republican fundraisersapple update IOS 26GOP fundraising apple update\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Gavin Newsom during a three-hour-plus cabinet meeting, remarking that the telegenic Democrat — for years talked about as a potential presidential candidate — is “nice guy, good-looking” but “has some hand action going on.”\n\n“There’s something going on there,” Trump added of Newsom’s hands.\n\nThe bizarre remark appeared to be an allusion to attacks leveled at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during last year’s presidential campaign. After the genial Gopher State executive was tapped as then-vice president Kamala Harris’ running mate, Trump’s campaign and many of his allies used video of Walz waving and gesturing during public appearances to falsely imply that he was secretly gay. \n\nBut Newsom, who in recent weeks has been aggressively using social media to mock and attack the president, hit back on X with a simple question: “You really want to have the conversation about hands?”\n\nThe remark could be a callback to a couple of Trump issues involving his hands — one tied to recent health concerns and another over their size, first raised by a then-rival on the 2016 campaign trail.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican primary Trump got into a debate stage argument with then-Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — now his secretary of state — over the respective sizes of their hands (a metric often used in popular culture as an indicator of a male’s physical endowment) with Trump telling the Floridian: “I guarantee you there's no problem” after Rubio implied that Trump had diminutive hands.\n\nBut Newsom’s timely clap-back also alluded to recent speculation over the condition of Trump’s hands stemming from a series of appearances during which the president showed either visible bruising or heavy, poorly-applied makeup that was attempting to cover the large black-and-blue marks on his right hand.\n\nThe dark marks have been visible on his hands since last summer, at which point then-campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt — now White House press secretary — said they were the result of Trump “constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day” amidst the rigors of a presidential run.\n\nBut last month, after reporters pressed Leavitt about both the bruising and a series of photographs showing Trump’s ankles to be very swollen, she released a memorandum from Physician to the President Dr. Sean Barbabella that attributed the “minor bruising on the back of his hand” to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,” a pain reliever and blood thinner that is often taken as a preventative.\n\nBarbabella, a U.S. Navy physician who holds the rank of Captain, also said Trump’s swollen legs were a result of “chronic venous insufficiency,” which he called a “benign and common condition” for someone at the age of the 79-year-old former real estate developer. \n\nYet that explanation hasn’t stopped liberal commentators from suggesting more is afoot.\n\nOn Tuesday, YouTuber Keith Edwards — a former staffer for the anti-Trump Lincoln Project — posted a side-by-side comparison of Trump’s hand during a Monday event and the hand of the late Queen Elizabeth II during an audience with then-prime minister Liz Truss.\n\nEdwards noted that the photograph of the late Queen with Truss was taken just two days before she passed, ending more than 70 years on the British throne.","summary":"Trump has sported a prominent bruise on his right hand for several months and attenpted to cover it up with makeup to no avail","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-trump-hand-bruise-b2815067.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/25/17/05/South-Korean-President-Lee-Jae-Myung-visits-Washington-q9cpmaed.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1qHw7Zg4-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 15:35:31","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":354893666,"title":"Of course conservatives are being weird about Taylor Swift’s engagement","text":"Megastar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement on Tuesday, and conservatives from President Donald Trump on down are being weird about it.\n\nThe couple made their announcement on Instagram, quickly becoming one of the most talked-about entertainment stories.

In a post to her hundreds of millions of followers, Swift said she came to her decision due to conservatives’ attacks on abortion rights—Trump installed half of the justices that killed Roe v. Wade—as well as her support for access to in vitro fertilization and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nSwift’s backing for Harris was underscored after she described herself as a “childless cat lady,” a direct rebuke of now-Vice President JD Vance’s attacks on women who choose not to have children.\n\nRight-wing influencer Charlie Kirk had weird “advice” for the couple, saying, “Submit to your husband, Taylor. You're not in charge.” Kirk, who leads the racism-plagued group Turning Point USA, also insisted that Swift should “have a ton of children.”\n\nIn a 2019 red-carpet appearance, Swift pointed out the sexism in comments like this, noting that while women are often asked about wanting children, “I don't really think men are asked that question when they turn 30, so I'm not going to answer that now.”\n\nIn another strange reaction, conservative influencer Matt Van Swol argued that the engagement announcement was “a huge blow to the woke movement.”\n\nThe bizarre takes from right-wing men to a celebrity engagement announcement makes it clear they need to take Swift’s advice and “calm down.”","summary":"Megastar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement on Tuesday, and conservatives from President Donald Trump on down are being weird about it.\n\n\n\nThe couple made their announcement on Instagram, quickly becoming one of the most talked-about entertainment stories.

In May, I followed corporate lawyers in dark suits into Courtroom 22A on the second floor and took a seat. On my left sat Meta’s legal team; on my right were lawyers from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the agency founded in 1914 to break up monopolies and keep the economy competitive. The FTC was suing Meta, Facebook’s parent company, for buying Instagram and WhatsApp in the early 2010s allegedly to smother competition. I then took the elevator up to the fourth floor. Down the corridor on the right, a judge was deciding how to enforce his ruling that Google had an illegal monopoly over search engines.\n\nWhat is decided inside this nondescript building matters more than most congressional budgets. That’s if you think the structure of the economy is more important than the money which flows around it. This is the front line in the fight against monopolistic power: an insidious but ever-present fact of the US economy.\n\nSince the late-19th century, in various guises, the antitrust movement has challenged this kind of corporate tyranny. The British-born, 36-year-old Lina Khan is now the leading antitrust voice in America. She served as the FTC chair under Joe Biden and relitigated the case against Meta. When we met recently, she told me, “We can’t view these firms as being stewards of the public good, right? They’re looking out for their own interests, and that’s why we need the government to have a real seat at the table.”\n\nKhan’s theory is that these companies have squashed competition and acquired insurmountable market share by absorbing suppliers and competitors. In practice, this has meant that Amazon could own the predominant online marketplace and sell its products there. For years, Google blocked companies from selling adverts next to its search bar, even though it was a player in the very marketplace it controlled. Or consider the false choice that awaits you in supermarkets: a vast variety of brands, all owned by a few huge conglomerates, such as Unilever, Mars and Nestlé. Why is Boeing the only major aircraft manufacturer left in America?\n\nCorporate tyranny used to be seen as much as a threat to democracy as political despotism. On the Senate floor in 1890, senator John Sherman said: “If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade.” The Sherman Antitrust Act, named after the Senator, was used to break up robber-baron fiefdoms, such as Standard Oil, marking the end of what Mark Twain called the Gilded Age. During the New Deal, in the 1930s, Congressman Wright Patman tried to impeach the former treasury secretary Andrew Mellon.\n\nBut, as Matt Stoller chronicles in Goliath: The 100-year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, memories of the tyranny of corporate power faded after the war and the antitrust movement was attacked from the left and the right. Neoliberals promoted the financialisation of the economy in the name of the free market, spawning vast conglomerates. Meanwhile, liberal intellectuals such as John Kenneth Galbraith and Richard Hofstadter saw populism as a threat to technocratic rule, scoffing at the idea that small business owners might know more than elites about how the economy should be run. Politics became about distribution and consumerism. As Khan said, “There was an effort to try to place antitrust as a domain outside the reach of members of Congress [and] relegate it much more to the technocrats.”\n\nIn 1978, Robert Bork, a professor at Yale Law School published The Antitrust Paradox, which argues that monopolies should only be broken up when consumers are charged higher prices, not merely when competition is threatened. By 1982, the Reagan administration had published rules applying that principle to mergers. A new consensus emerged: regulators stood by as airlines, technology companies and pharmaceuticals went on rampant acquisition sprees. The resulting lower prices were celebrated, while the negative impact on employee rights, wages, offshoring and innovation were ignored.\n\nThe economy was removed from the public square and handed to technocrats. Financialisation and corporate power were presented as immutable facts, rather than policy choices that could be contested. “It is part of the vanity of modern man that he can decide the character of his economic system,” Galbraith wrote. Economics became the preserve of economists, certain truths became unquestionable. Why query the power of Silicon Valley when the price to scroll is zero?\n\nThis consensus was upended by the great financial crash, progressives’ desire to blame their 2016 loss on Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Donald Trump’s subsequent anti-globalisation crusade. The new scepticism towards corporate power created space for the antitrust movement to reignite. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders said the wall between investment and commercial banks should be restored. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the Big Tech companies to be broken up. That same year, Warren had dinner in her Senate office with Barry Lynn, a godfather figure in the modern anti-trust movement, and a rising antitrust researcher named Lina Khan.\n\nKhan soon published a paper called Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox, a twist on the title of Bork’s influential book. It argued Amazon sustained large losses to gain market share and expand into all areas of its business, from warehousing to delivery vans. Within a year, the paper was read around 150,000 times. When Jon Stewart had her on The Daily Show last year, he said Apple had told him not have her on his podcast. He wasn’t joking. \n\nWe met on Capitol Hill in late April for 45 minutes just after she’d got off the train from New York, where she lives. Two members of her staff perched in the corner, anxious to whisk her away to meetings that afternoon. She was reluctant to talk about herself, rarely dropping the lawyer’s predilection for answering in neat, logical and cautious paragraphs. She skirted around partisan attacks and withheld her blows. Her reserved manner seemed more a mark of steeliness than a lack of confidence.\n\nKhan was born in London and grew up in Golders Green before moving to New York at age 11. Her time at Williams College was broken up by a year at Exeter College, Oxford, where she took papers in the politics, philosophy and economics course. When asked by the New Yorker what had politicised her, she replied, “Most kids are aware of bullies, and of who has power and who doesn’t have power.”\n\nWhat did this British-born antitrust leader think of Labour? In January, Rachel Reeves appointed a former Amazon executive as interim chair of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain’s version of the FTC. The CMA was once seen as a leader in antitrust by populists in Washington. When I suggested Labour was cowing to Big Tech, Khan said: “I think there are a lot of cautionary tales about what happens when you try to hitch national sovereign goals to a private tech company, and what they do with that power.”\n\nAfter a stint at the Open Markets Foundation under Barry Lynn, she had to choose between a reporting job at the Wall Street Journal and a law degree at Yale. She chose the latter. In her classroom, a portrait of Robert Bork watched over her, and the main antitrust professor was George L Priest, an old friend of the price-theory proponent. The paucity of antitrust acolytes at Yale did not stop her from eventually acceding to the FTC chair.\n\nAt the FTC, she had started to undo the “extreme consolidation crisis” which had festered for decades. But she thinks she has only dented the well-armoured status quo. “There is only so much you can undo in three and a half years against a 40-year backdrop,” she said between bites of her Cava salad.\n\n“There is generally an effort right now to privatise what had previously been public,” she warned, “and people’s personal data is a core part of that. Some of what we’re seeing with AI is certainly going to accelerate it.”\n\nAt times like these, when technology sprints forward, tech evangelists speak of an “inevitable march of progress”. But Khan thinks this is a “real misconception”. Progress, she argues, is not inevitable – “we as a public have the ability to actually steer what direction we go in.” Concentrating control of core technologies in the hands of a few means “you are effectively going to have a handful of companies, if not a handful of individual executives, with outsized power”.\n\nAntitrust now marks a core dividing line within the Democratic Party. On one side are the “abundantists”; on the other, the left populists who champion curtailing monopolies. The abundantists’ manifesto is Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s Abundance, which argues that over-regulation – especially by Democrats – has made building infrastructure, including housing, nearly impossible. One claims state overreach blocks economic fairness; the other sees growth-choking monopolies as the true culprit.\n\nKhan thinks any analysis of the economy that “entirely omits a diagnosis of the role of unchecked corporate power is pretty surprising, striking, and at odds with the reality of what’s happening.”\n\nThat corporate power is excessive and the state has created a web of impassable regulations are not mutually incompatible. But the factions have taken root. Broadly speaking, left populists are more likely to think woke was a mistake, immigration was too high under Biden and the rich should contribute more to state coffers. The abundance bros are more likely to dream of an Obama third term that builds high-speed rail lines.\n\nAntitrust is an obscure and technical facet of left populism, but it is also one of the most powerful tools for dismantling the neoliberal scaffolding that has directed wealth to the top and concentrated economic power in the hands of a few. Khan’s appearance on The Daily Show speaks to her rising influence within the party. Her presence at Zohran Mamdani’s victory party after he won the Democratic nomination for New York mayor points to her sympathies. (Mamdani has promised to challenge the market power of New York’s major utility provider, Con Edison.)\n\nThe split, she believes, is not irreconcilable. “Antitrust is entirely pro-growth, right? It is identifying what are the private choke points and bottlenecks to greater production.” She said a string of lawsuits had shown cartels formed in the housing supply chain led to fixed prices, for instance. “People across the full spectrum of the party are identifying specific ways that unchecked corporate power is making life worse for people.”\n\nThe movement has supporters on both sides of the aisle. Populist nationalists such as Steve Bannon see antitrust as a key tool to break up the “globalist” economic establishment. Khan and Bannon were photographed together at a conference in April. She was careful to distance herself from Bannon, albeit with a dose of intrigue. “Well, look, he clearly has views that I fiercely disagree with,” she told me, adding that he’s “calling out the oligarchs and what he sees as potential corruption, which is interesting”.\n\nWhen I profiled Bannon back in February we argued about whether Trump would back antitrust legislation. The phalanx of tech billionaires over Trump’s shoulder at the inauguration, his decades-long affection for the wealthy and his amenability to flattery gave me pause. Bannon, a nationalist populist who accused Silicon Valley of presiding over an “apartheid state”, thought Trump would prise open monopolists’ hold on America. He had been encouraged by Trump’s appointment of Gail Slater, a monopoly sceptic at the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, and Andrew Ferguson, whose previous critique of Big Tech pivoted around censorship, at the FTC. Bannon would be sorely disappointed.\n\nIn July, two senior antitrust lawyers were fired after the Department of Justice allowed the large technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprise to buy a major competitor, Juniper Networks, fusing the second and third largest providers of wireless networking. The Wall Street Journal reported that Slater did not support the final deal. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s team pushed it through after aggressive lobbying.\n\nTrump’s deal-making style means that corporations are splurging on lobbyists to cultivate relationships with senior administration officials. He was elected by a working-class coalition in order to rebalance the economy away from the oligarchs. But antitrust, which requires a strong Congress and independent federal agencies, is impossible under Trump’s power grab. On 13 August, Trump revoked a Biden-era executive order instructing the federal government to make the economy more competitive. For now, the oligarchs are winning.\n\nThe hope for breaking up corporate power therefore lies with the Democrats. The abundantists’ increasing grip on the party should worry anyone who wants power to be dispersed. The question, as Stoller suggests, is not whether a market is regulated or not. The question is whether markets are regulated by the government or by big business. Abundantism is an easy way out for corporatist Democrats who don’t want to stand up to their donors. Kamala Harris surrounded herself with billionaires during her 2024 presidential campaign. Under pressure from her donors, she refused to say whether she would keep Khan on as FTC chair, opting for a substanceless campaign centred around identity politics and what she called the “opportunity economy”. That did not work.\n\nThe risk now is that Trump’s assault on democracy means Democrats forget that old truth that political tyranny has a corporate twin. As Khan said, Trump’s attack on the rule of law and federal agencies is “totally antithetical” to the government holding “private power to account”. Forgetting the connection between the two would mean, once again, that the Democrats become the defenders of the status quo.\n\n[See also: The Bedouins exiled in Palestine]","summary":"The former chair of the Federal Trade Commission on the war against corporate power.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/economy-international-politics/2025/08/lina-khan-interview-you-can-only-undo-so-much-in-three-and-a-half-years","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/08/27/202535-Lina-Khan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 14:14:24","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.13},{"id":354851416,"title":"Trump ally Charlie Kirk tells Taylor Swift, ‘Submit to Your Husband,’ claims marriage will make her conservative","text":"Trump ally Charlie Kirk tells Taylor Swift, ‘Submit to Your Husband,’ claims marriage will make her conservative (Image: Instagram/Taylor Swift)\n\nRight-wing commentator Charlie Kirk has waded into pop culture again, suggesting that Taylor Swift’s engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce could shift her political outlook. Kirk, a vocal supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, argued that marriage would make the global pop icon “more conservative,” a claim that has sparked widespread debate online, as per a report by The Independent.The remarks came shortly after Taylor Swift, one of the most influential celebrities in the world, announced her engagement to Kelce in a social media post that amassed over 16 million likes within three hours. The development was greeted with excitement from fans but also seized upon by political pundits, with Kirk offering a particularly provocative take.Kirk urges Swift to ‘reject feminism’Speaking on his program on Real America’s Voice network, Kirk congratulated Swift in what many perceived as a half-hearted manner. He suggested that Swift’s past criticism of conservative politics and her vocal support for progressive causes stemmed from her unmarried status.“This is something that I hope will make Taylor Swift more conservative. Engage in reality more… Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge,” Kirk said.Kirk argued that marriage and motherhood could “de-radicalize” the 34-year-old singer-songwriter, whom he has repeatedly criticized for being “annoyingly liberal.” He even expressed hope that Swift would go on to have “a ton of children,” framing family life as a corrective to what he views as her left-leaning activism.Live EventsTaylor Swift engagement: Linking Kelce to conservative valuesKirk also pointed to Kelce’s past remarks praising Donald Trump’s attendance at the Super Bowl, describing it as an “honor.” In Kirk’s view, marrying Kelce could influence Swift’s worldview and align her more closely with conservative circles.“Taylor might go from a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter… and I think we should celebrate that. She should have more children than she has houses,” Kirk remarked, further claiming that Swift had not been a “great role model for young women” because she prioritized her career before marriage.Taylor Swift engaged to Travis Kelce: Swift’s fans push back onlineKirk’s commentary quickly triggered an outpouring of reactions on social media. Many Swift fans accused him of projecting outdated and misogynistic views onto the singer’s personal life.“Why is a grown man spending his day thinking about this?” wrote one user. Another added: “This dude is so weird.”Others criticized the remarks as an attempt to undermine Swift’s independence and professional achievements. “Charlie Kirk is an ignorant, bigoted dogmatist. Powerful women scare weak men like him,” one comment read.Some users pointed out that Kirk’s comments overshadowed what should have been a moment of joy for Swift and Kelce, suggesting that political figures should refrain from inserting themselves into celebrity milestones.Taylor Swift engaged to Travis Kelce: Trump adopts a softer toneInterestingly, not all conservative voices shared Kirk’s approach. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has often sparred with Swift, particularly after her endorsement of Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, offered a more diplomatic response.Asked about the engagement at a press interaction, Trump said: “Well, I wish them a lot of luck. I think he’s a great player, I think he’s a great guy and I think that she’s a terrific person… So I wish them a lot of luck.”His remarks contrasted sharply with Kirk’s rhetoric, underlining divisions within conservative circles over how to respond to cultural figures like Swift.Taylor Swift engaged to Travis Kelce: Celebrity, politics, and cultural influenceTaylor Swift’s engagement has once again highlighted the intersection of celebrity culture and politics in the United States. While for many fans the news is simply a personal milestone in the singer’s life, for commentators like Charlie Kirk it has become a lens through which to discuss broader ideological battles.FAQsWhat did Charlie Kirk say about Taylor Swift’s engagement? Kirk claimed that Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce could make her “more conservative,” urging her to “reject feminism” and “submit to her husband.” He argued that marriage and motherhood would shift her political leanings away from liberal positions.How did fans respond to Kirk’s remarks? Swift’s fans widely criticized Kirk’s comments, calling them misogynistic and outdated. Many pointed out that his remarks overshadowed a celebratory moment for the singer, while others mocked him for obsessing over her personal life.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTaylor Swift engagementCharlie Kirk Taylor Swift engagementTaylor Swift political viewsTravis Kelce Taylor Swift marriageTaylor Swift fans reactionsTaylor Swift Travis Kelce engaged\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

While nobody has formally announced their candidacy, the next leader will have to heal divisions between moderates and progressives in the party.In the last few years, a Johnson presidency has been mulled on several occasions. A poll published in April 2021 found that 46 percent of Americans would support a White House bid by Johnson. In the same year, he expressed interest in the role in an interview with USA Today and in 2023 said multiple political parties had approached him about running, but in 2024 he said it was not his intention to run.What To KnowAccording to the betting odds at the time of writing, Harris has a 5 percent chance of winning the 2028 nomination, while Johnson has a 5.6 percent chance.California Governor Gavin Newsom is leading with a 32 percent chance. Next is New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with 11 percent. Pete Buttigieg, President Joe Biden's transportation secretary, has a 6 percent, just 1 percent more than Johnson, and earlier in the day, Johnson was ahead of Buttigieg.What People Are SayingHeath Brown an associate professor of public policy at City University of New York, told Newsweek: \"Name recognition goes a long way in politics, and Dwayne Johnson surely has a lot of it. There are several other qualities which also make for a good candidate, and there are numerous candidates with many of those presidential qualities who we will see as prime contenders in 2028.\"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a May interview that he was \"assessing the office and what it calls for.\" He added: \"The other thing you're mapping against all of that is...your life. I mean the stakes are always high for somebody thinking about running for visible political office, but they're fundamentally different when you've got a spouse and kids. Having kids can motivate you to run, but it can also motivate you to spend more time at home.\"What Happens NextCandidates traditionally announce their presidential runs after the midterm elections, which will take place in November 2026.","summary":"According to online betting website Polymarket, the wrestler turned actor is beating the former vice president.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/2028-presidential-betting-odds-dwayne-johnson-harris-buttigieg-2120008","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2710447/johnson-harris.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5a660d917ae6dae25e9f18761ec46281","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 14:04:54","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":354851904,"title":"Donald Trump vs Taylor Swift: A Bad Blood timeline","text":"Of all the kind and gushing reactions to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s headline-dominating engagement, the last one we expected was Donald Trump’s out-of-character well wishes.The US President was asked about the news during a cabinet meeting and he told reporters: “Well, I wish them a lot of luck. I think it’s - I think he’s a great player, I think he’s a great guy and I think that she’s a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck.”Quite the change of tune, as Trump has publicly bashed the pop megastar on numerous occasions, revealing a long and somewhat troubling fixation with Swift.Trump has repeatedly attacked Swift, with his most recent outbursts on Truth Social saying that he “HATES” her and that she is “no longer HOT”.Here’s a chronological – but by no means extensive - look back at some of the pettiest, most aggressive and frequently inconsistent comments Trump has made about Taylor Swift.2009: The “Imma Let You Finish” Era When Taylor Swift received the Best Female Video award at the MTV Video Music Awards for ‘You Belong With Me’ on 13 September 2009, Kanye West interrupted her acceptance speech - a notorious moment which has gone down in pop culture history. At the time, Barack Obama called West a “jackass” and even Trump defended Swift, telling TMZ that Kanye should be boycotted “so this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.”So far, so good.2012: The Swiftie Era When news broke in 2012 that Taylor Swift would be co-hosting the 2013 Grammy nominations broadcast, Trump posted on Twitter: \"Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5. Taylor is terrific!\" Still civil.2018: The Percentage Era Swift made headlines in 2018 by openly endorsing a candidate for the first time: Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen.Trump told reporters outside the White House: “Marsha Blackburn (Bredesen’s opponent) is doing a very good job in Tennessee. She’s leading now substantially, which she should. She’s a tremendous woman. I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. And let’s say that I like Taylor’s music about 25 per cent less now, OK?”That’s still a 75 per cent approval rating...2023: The Musically Challenged Era Things get competitive, as Trump was celebrating his very own music career in 2023.A single had been released by a choir of men in prison for their participation in the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. The track by the J6 Prison Choir, titled ‘Justice for All’, featured a recording by Trump as the backing track.Once released, Trump claimed that the song was outperforming Taylor Swift in the charts. \"It beat Taylor Swift, it beat Miley Cyrus, who was number one and two,” he said at a rally.Pettiness levels rising...2024: The HATE Era 2024 was the year Trump’s Swift obsession fully bloomed, leading him to publicly declare his hatred for Swift.The year didn’t start off too badly. Creepily, though. At the start of the election year, Trump said Swift would be “disloyal” to him if she were to endorse Joe Biden. Then, in June, he commented on Swift’s appearance during a Variety interview with author Ramin Setoodeh, who wrote the book \"Apprentice In Wonderland: How Donald Trump And Mark Burnett Took America Through The Looking Glass\". He told Setoodeh: “I think she’s beautiful - very beautiful!” He followed that comment with a more dubious compliment, calling Swift “unusually beautiful.” During the same interview, Trump also questioned whether the singer was \"legitimately liberal.\"Trump then posted AI-generated images suggesting Swift had endorsed him, clearly showing that he coveted her endorsement.However, when Swift hit back at the fake images and endorsed Kamala Harris, Trump very presidentially posted on his Truth Social media account, in all-caps: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Clearly riled by her allegiance to Harris, he added that Swift would “probably pay a price” for her support of the Democratic candidate. Trump’s outburst led to the trending phrase “I love Taylor Swift”. 2025: The Violent Flip-Flop Era Strap in for this one.During the 2025 Super Bowl, Swift appeared on screen and boos could be heard in the crowd. Trump didn’t skip a beat and immediately posted on Truth Social: \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\"In May, and without any discernable reason or prompt, he lashed out on Truth Social, writing: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” This month, Trump took the time to share his thoughts about the Sydney Sweeney / American Eagle controversy, and decided to drag Swift’s name into the debate. He wrote: “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”A sizeable U-turn when taking into consideration his previous “beautiful” comments.But just when the whiplash hadn’t settled came Trump's engagement reaction: “I think that she’s a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck.\"Has Trump secretly joined ranks with former FBI chief James Comey, who controversially confessed last week that he was a massive Swiftie? Was it a classy move on his part to put the bad blood behind him once and for all? Or did he simply forget he \"HATES\" Taylor Swift, meaning we will probably be treated to another Truth Social rant soon?Whatever the reason for this sudden change of heart, we’re betting that this isn’t the end of Trump’s obsession with Swift – or any celebrity who doesn’t side with him. We've still got four more months in this era.","summary":"Everyone’s talking about pop culture’s most famous couple getting engaged.

She defended The View’s role in that effort:\n\nSMITH: [Y]ou're talking about what he's doing. But before you brought that up you brought up the message that the Democratic Party was disseminating.

And now they’re trying to make it so he can’t text anybody either. But MAGA won’t be stopped, and MAGA will always find a way.\" Apple is expected to roll out its latest update, iOS 26, in September, which will include an updated text filtration system that siphons text messages from unknown numbers that have no chat history with the recipient to a separate message folder that will not generate an alert to the recipient, leaders from American Made Media Company and Launchpad explained to Fox News Digital of the upcoming update. Text messages from known numbers saved on an individual's phone are expected to continue alerting recipients and sending the messages to their typical text app. GOOGLE'S GMAIL CENSORSHIP COST GOP CANDIDATES $2B SINCE 2019, REPUBLICANS SAY, CITING NEW STUDY Launchpad Strategies served as the Trump 2024 campaign's exclusive digital firm handling online advertising and consulting during Trump's decisive victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris, and continues operating as a \"full-service Republican digital agency dedicated to helping campaigns win,\" according to its website. Launchpad raised $509 million for the Trump campaign in 2024 and an additional $18 million in funds from 40 other clients during the massive 2024 election year, Fox Digital learned. JASON CHAFFETZ: TEN SNEAKY WAYS THE DEEP STATE STEALS YOUR DATA AND HOW TRUMP CAN HELP YOU STOP IT The update could affect election cycles themselves, as text messages concerning voter registration and campaign rallies are expected to also be punted to this new folder, according to fundraisers. Data from the 2024 election cycle showed Republicans leveraged text campaigns two-to-one compared to Democrats, putting them directly in the line of fire when the expected update takes effect in September — ahead of the midterms hitting a fever pitch as Democrats look to flip the House and Senate from Republican control. The text filtration's scope is expected to extend far beyond just politics, including potentially siphoning texts concerning real-life issues such as doctor appointments from a number not saved in a person's phone. The National Republican Senate Committee, which serves as the Senate Republican's campaigning arm, circulated an internal memo in July sounding the alarm that the iOS update could cost Republicans more than $25 million in revenue, Punchbowl News reported at the time. Apple filtering texts from unknown numbers is not new, with such a program already used within the current iOS 18 systems. The current filtration system is by default not activated until a user toggles a button within the \"settings\" app. The iOS 26 update is also currently available to the public for beta testing, the outlet Fast Company reported in July. Under the new update, the filtration system will be renamed to \"Screen Unknown Senders,\" but will use ongoing criteria to kick text messages to another folder, specifically: if the iPhone owner does not have a contact saved in their phone and if the user has never interacted with the unknown phone number trying to contact them, according to Fast Company. The visibility of texts from unknown senders will get a facelift under the new update, with the filtered messages from unknown senders made more easily seen by users with a new filtration button at the top of Apple's Messages app that will display a blue badge noting how many unread texts an iPhone user has received from unknown numbers, according to the Fast Company report, which sought to quell Republican fundraising concerns over the update. Fox News Digital reached out to Apple for comment Monday. History repeating itself is of top concern to Republican fundraisers, who pointed to a seemingly similar filtration system with Gmail messages that first hit the public's radar in 2022. Studies at the time found Gmail allowed the vast majority of emails from left-wing politicians to land in a user’s inbox, while more than two-thirds of messages from conservative candidates were marked as spam, according to data from North Carolina State University’s Department of Computer Science that was previously reported by Fox News Digital. The Gmail filtration system resulted in a $2 billion loss for Republican candidates between 2019 and 2022, Fox News Digital reported in April 2022, citing research from the Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senate Committee. \"Big Tech has been silencing conservative voices and actively working against Republicans for multiple cycles. Google’s e-mail suppression – which affects the GOP’s fundraising and GOTV efforts – is another egregious example. Silicon Valley oligarchs are suppressing free political speech,\" then-RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, then-NRSC Chairman Senator Rick Scott and then-NRCC Chairman Congressman Tom Emmer said in a joint statement back in 2022, Fox News Digital reported at the time. GOOGLE'S GMAIL FAVORS LEFT-WING CANDIDATES, SENDS FAR MORE EMAILS FROM CONSERVATIVES TO SPAM: STUDY The research found that between 2019 and 2020, conservative candidates raised $737 million on Republican fundraising platform WinRed from Gmail. The data found that just 32% of fundraising emails actually reached recipients, with Republicans estimating they missed out on $1.5 billion in contributions during the 2020 election cycle alone. The update comes as the Democratic Party is in turmoil following the 2024 race, which saw former President Joe Biden drop out of the election cycle with just more than 100 days to go before passing the proverbial mantle to Harris before the loss to Trump. The party has since attempted to find its political footing after an exodus of the working-class vote to the GOP in 2024 and voters rejecting left-wing policies, most notably surrounding social issues. Republican fundraisers already are working on workarounds for the expected update, including having recipients add fundraising numbers to their phones.

That used to be the eventual question for most administrations. When it comes to former President Joe Biden, however, the question is: Did the president know much of anything?\n\nThe GOP-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been trying to answer that question with a series of behind-closed-doors interviews with former Biden staffers. The transcripts aren’t out yet, but after the interviews, Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has been happy to share his observations with the press corps.\n\nIan Sams, the Biden White House press guy who dealt with the sticky stuff, appeared before the committee Thursday. Afterward, Comer told reporters that his big takeaway from Sams’ turn in the hot seat was the revelation that he spoke with Biden face-to-face only twice during the two-plus years he served in the Biden White House. There was also a virtual meeting and a phone call.\n\nThat was news because Sams was the guy responsible for jumping all over those who questioned Biden’s mental acuity.\n\nWhen former special counsel Robert Hur famously opined that Biden’s mishandling of classified material would be difficult to use in court because a jury might hesitate to convict a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Sams slammed the Hur report as “false” and inappropriately personal.\n\nThat, of course, was before Biden stumbled during the June 27, 2024, Biden-Trump debate so spectacularly that he had to get out of the race and announce that Vice President Kamala Harris would head the ticket.\n\nSams left the White House to work for the Harris campaign.\n\nThe takeaway from Sams’ testimony, as filtered by Comer, is that a tight cabal of handlers successfully siloed Biden so completely that Biden barely spoke to one of his fiercest defenders.\n\n“In fact, Robert Hur spent more time with Joe Biden than Ian Sams,” Comer concluded.\n\nComer also offered that he interacted with Biden more than the former Biden spox.\n\nAnd Sams never even flew on Air Force One with the former president.\n\nThat’s so wrong. Even Comer flew on AF1 with Biden, he told reporters.\n\nThree former Biden White House staffers—senior adviser Annie Tomasini, Jill Biden top aide Anthony Bernal, and Physician to the President Kevin O’Connor—invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and declined to answer questions.\n\nNothing to see here.\n\nLast month, Axios reported that top Biden whisperer Mike Donilon told committee staffers that he had negotiated a $4 million payday for running the Biden 2024 campaign, with the sweetener of a $4 million bonus if Biden won—a revelation that pointed to the greed that greased a Biden candidacy and doomed the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to Comer, Sams didn’t have much of a recollection of his face time with Biden. Which is strange because usually staffers who finally have a chance to talk with the big guy have a good story to tell about it. It seems a faulty memory is part of the Biden administration experience.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

This Missouri congressman is doing 15 of them","text":"BOLIVAR, Mo. — A crowd of about 50 people are already seated with omelets and biscuits and gravy at a diner in Nevada, Mo., when GOP Rep. Mark Alford walks in. He smiles as he recognizes two constituents from a town hall earlier in the day who aren't his biggest fans.\n\n\"Hey, you guys are my roadies!\" he said as he stopped by their table to shake their hands.\n\nAugust is when Congress trades the swampy D.C. summer with time back home. It's typically when lawmakers host town halls, forums that have become increasingly less popular with Republican members.\n\nBut Alford is bucking that trend, hosting not one, but 15 town halls over four days.\n\n\"I love interacting with people,\" the former broadcast news journalist told NPR after day one of his tour wrapped Monday. \"I actually like arguing with people, which I've kind of had to moderate a little bit — not be argumentative but try to get what someone's saying.\"\n\nStill, he admitted some apprehension about how his town hall tour would go.\n\n\"I was a little bit anxious and nervous about what it would be like because I had seen the video of Mike Flood,\" he said, nodding to his Nebraska colleague's raucous town hall earlier this month.\n\nAnd while there were some heated moments, they were a far cry from Flood's experience or the contentious crowd Alford himself faced in February.\n\nHe said he treats these events as listening sessions. On Monday, they ranged from a stop at an American Legion post to an ice cream parlor and then a more formal town hall at Southwest Baptist University. \n\n\"This is why we get elected every two years — that we're in the district, that we're taking the tough questions, and maybe we're changing the way we think to reflect the attitudes and the will of the constituents who sent us there,\" he said.\n\nHe talked to constituents about his work on the Small Business and Appropriations committees and answered questions about the tax and spending bill Congress passed this summer. Alford voted for the bill and said he tries to refer to it as H.R. 1 \"because I want people to listen to what I'm saying, and once they hear 'one big, beautiful bill', they stop listening.\"\n\n\"It would have prevented the largest tax increase in U.S. history,\" he told constituents, while acknowledging a tricky political reality. \"It's kind of hard to sing the praises of something that would have happened but didn't happen because we did something.\"\n\nWhen anger did bubble up over cuts to the Medicaid program and President Trump himself, Alford deescalated, thanking attendees by name for their \"passion.\" \n\n\"If you're here, especially if you don't agree with me, thank you for coming,\" he said in Bolivar to a crowd of about 100, who were evenly split by a show of hands in whether they supported Trump or Kamala Harris. \"I want to know deep down in my heart what I believe and why I believe it, and you challenging me tonight is going to help me refine those commitments, values and those beliefs.\"\n\nConstituents navigating Trump's new administration\n\nWhile national politics is never far away, these smaller events allow constituents to ask direct questions about specific issues they're facing.\n\nJeff Droz, who owns a solar energy company, told Alford his health and business is suffering because of the White House halting funding for previously approved projects. Droz bought $100,000 of solar equipment after getting funding approved for a USDA project, but said it's sitting in the shop after he was told the administration hit pause.\n\n\"I'm sorry that has happened to you – that's wrong,\" Alford said. \"Our staff will work with you personally to try to get this money and to try to get some answers at a minimum for you because you deserve that.\"\n\nJeff Carneal, an Air Force veteran, told Alford how the hiring freeze at the VA Hospital affected his care at the Kansas City VA.\n\n\"That left me, and hundreds of others that utilize the spinal cord and brain injury unit, without care. That's unacceptable,\" he said.\n\nCarneal is an independent and has voted for Alford in the past.\n\n\"My concern is that Mr. Alford let Donald Trump and Elon Musk go in there with a sledgehammer and take out funding,\" he said in an interview, adding he fears further cuts.\n\n\"The VA is doing clinical trials on a basically a jumper wire, so I might get ability back. I might be able to walk,\" he said. \"Well, I'm scared that they're going to cut more funding and that won't get funded because of [Health and Human Services Secretary] Bobby Kennedy. I'm hoping Mr. Alford will go to Kennedy and say, leave things alone, let's put more money into clinical research.\"\n\nHe wants to see Alford stand up to Trump and what he calls executive overreach.\n\n\"[Alford] seems very nice. I like him,\" he said. \"I'm still deciding [on next year's election]. If things change, yes, I will vote for him. If he stands up to Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe subject of standing up to Trump persisted throughout the town halls.\n\n\"You follow Trump like he's Jesus,\" someone shouted at the first stop.\n\nWhile Alford at times praised Trump for his leadership, he pushed back at the idea he has sway over the president.\n\n\"I don't have his number in my phone,\" he said. \"I don't have a close personal relationship\" with Trump.\n\nNational guard in D.C. top of mind\n\nAn area where Alford opened the door to disagreeing with the president is whether the National Guard should be deployed to other cities, in the wake of being sent to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Trump has threatened to deploy the force to other blue cities, including Baltimore and Chicago.\n\nAlford said he supported the D.C. and Los Angeles deployments (\"ICE agents were in fear of their lives and federal buildings were being targeted\") but questions sending them to other cities.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in states' rights and local control and local authority,\" he said. \"But I'm also a believer in making America safe again.\"\n\nMax Reynolds, 72, attended an event in Bolivar and said he's worried blue cities in Missouri are next, and wants Alford to publicly say he's opposed.\n\n\"The military has no business being armed in the cities, period. Not even close,\" he said in an interview. \"Didn't [Trump] have his buddies come to Washington, D.C.? If he's worried about crime in D.C., where was he when they were tearing the hell out of the Capitol?\"\n\nPotential redistricting hovers over everything\n\nAlford's west-central district is considered a safe GOP seat.\n\nJust how safe depends on whether the state's governor and legislature decide to pursue mid-decade redistricting, following Trump asking Texas Republicans to draw five more congressional seats for the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. That's prompted leaders in at least seven other states to signal a willingness to adjust their maps as well.\n\nShould state lawmakers redraw Missouri's congressional districts, it's likely the GOP's power in the fourth district would be diluted. New maps would likely target Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Attempts to remake the district into a GOP-leaning seat could come at the expense of making Alford's district more competitive.\n\nFor his part, Alford said he's staying out of the redistricting fight.\n\nBut his constituents on all sides are concerned. Republicans don't want to see the stronghold diminished and Democrats don't want to risk losing the few Democratic seats they have. \n\n\"Since Missouri already has such a limited number of blue districts, the fact that they want to turn those few into additional red districts is just unfair,\" Darwina Stewart told NPR in Bolivar.\n\nHer friend Carla Berg agreed.\n\n\"It's no different than when [Trump] called Georgia and said, find me 11,500 votes or whatever the number was. I mean, it's just as blatant — it's a power grab,\" she said, referencing Trump's 2021 call with Georgia's Republican secretary of state demanding he \"find\" enough votes to overturn the state's election result.","summary":"At a time when Congressional Republicans are generally opting against town halls, Missouri Rep.

Before that, he served in the Vietnam War. Williams was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2015, he suspects, because of his exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used by the U.S. military to reduce enemy cover in the Vietnamese jungle. That diagnosis came just six years after Williams underwent open-heart surgery in 2009 to treat ischemic heart disease, which has also been linked to Agent Orange.\n\nMedical care for those serious conditions is expensive, and could have bankrupted someone with inadequate insurance. But because of the coverage he and other miners won through the United Mine Workers of America, Williams told Salon, he didn’t have to pay a dime. He gives much of the credit to support from former Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who served three terms in Washington before his defeat in 2024.\n\n“We fought tooth and nail to retain those benefits,” said Williams, who is president of UMW Local 1188 in Coshocton County, in central Ohio’s Appalachian region. He told Salon that Brown had helped secure health care and pension benefits for retired coal miners through working to pass the Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019.\n\n“I just feel that Sen. Brown has always had our back where a lot of these other guys haven’t,” Williams said. “With the way our politics are going right now, we need people like Sen. Brown in there, so that’s why I’m really supporting him.”\n\nLess than a year after losing his seat to Republican Bernie Moreno, the 72-year-old Brown announced on Monday that he will run for Ohio’s other U.S. Senate seat in 2026 against incumbent Sen. John Husted, the Republican appointed to replace JD Vance after the latter was elected vice president.\n\nIf Democrats are to have any chance of claiming a Senate majority, winning Ohio’s seat is essential. Brown gives them a name-brand candidate with a history of bipartisan accomplishment in a largely red state. His announcement ended months of speculation about whether Brown might run for Senate again, take on likely GOP nominee Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio governor’s race or leave politics behind for good. It has been met with excitement from union workers across the state, who view Brown as a decades-long champion of workers’ rights.\n\nWilliams said he has met Brown “several different times,” adding, “When you talk to him, you always get the feeling that he is actually listening to you. He’s just a good man for Ohio. He’s a good voice for us.”\n\nBrown was effectively the last prominent Democrat to hold statewide office in Ohio before his defeat last November. Since Barack Obama carried the state in both 2008 and 2012, Ohio has trended increasingly red. Donald Trump won Ohio relatively easily in the last three presidential elections, and Brown lost to Moreno last year by a margin of 3.6 percentage points, or just over 200,000 votes.\n\nIn interviews with Ohio news outlets last week, Brown said that he decided to run for office again after witnessing the first eight months of Trump’s second administration and its effects on working people. He singled out Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill, enacted in early July, along with continuing inflation in grocery prices.\n\n“There’s not one senator of the 100 on the Senate floor that is fighting for Ohio workers. Zero,” Brown told Signal Akron. He and his wife Connie “thought we’d never run” again, he said. “But we can’t stay on the sidelines when we see these kinds of things happening.”\n\nMark Henderson, acting president of United Steelworkers of America Local 169 in Mansfield, Ohio, told Salon that he’d been hoping Brown would run a comeback campaign for the Senate. Henderson and his family have had to cut back on spending due to high prices, he said, and expect they’ll have to tighten their belts further as the budget bill’s provisions roll out over the next two years. Henderson, a 59-year-old electric technician, added that his family is better off than most because of his longtime union membership. That’s why he’s thankful Brown is running.\n\n“He don’t forget where he came from,” Henderson said of the former senator. “He comes from Mansfield, right here, from my hometown. One of his first stops was our local hall, and he’s been back numerous times. He was there for our lockout, he sent letters, he showed up at our rallies.” That reference was to a famous local event of 1999, AK Steel’s 39-month lockout of 620 USWA workers after contract negotiations stalled.\n\nBrown, Henderson said, “is just a big proponent of people being treated fairly, just giving people like me a shot.”\n\nSteve Ackerman, a USWA staff representative for nearly 1,500 employees, described Brown as an “open ear” who would hear out union officials, do what he could to help and even, in moments of disagreement, provide further context and understanding.\n\n“That’s the difference with Sherrod Brown [and] most senators,” Ackerman said. “If there’s a dispute, he’s reaching out to you wanting to know, ‘What do you need? What can I do to help you?’ Usually it’s the other way around. We have to beg them to even hear our side of things.”\n\nKelsey Gray, a member of the Columbus Education Association, a chapter of the Ohio Education Association, was more skeptical about Brown’s newly launched campaign. She isn’t convinced that Brown, or any other career politician, is the best candidate for working Ohioans or their unions. Brown’s campaign website, she said, didn’t list any issues or mention any labor unions when she viewed it this past week.\n\nIf Brown is “feeling some kind of fighting energy or passion, it is not coming through,” she said, “and he would really have to sell it in order for that to work.” Gray is disappointed, she told Salon, that the Democratic Party couldn’t find a better candidate than someone who just lost his seat. “I don’t want to be sold anything else.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nGray agreed that Brown had scored some wins for workers during his time in D.C., such as the Social Security Fairness Act, which ensures that former government workers like teachers and police can collect full retirement benefits. That legislation will clearly help some teachers, she said, but given the current climate that’s not nearly enough.\n\n“Things have been horrific in the past eight months,” Gray said, with the Trump administration’s attacks coming at “warp speed” and worsening by the day. But “things have been horrific for a lot longer than that,” she cautioned. “This is not the first go-around with oppression in America coming from the White House.”\n\nMarty Perlaky, president of the Springfield Education Association in Holland, Ohio, agreed that the Democrats lack strong candidates and need to unify their message. But Brown’s return to politics, he said, couldn’t have happened soon enough.\n\n“We need somebody who has a proven Democratic track record” to run against Husted, he said. “I don’t know another person in the state of Ohio who has more of a résumé to help the little guy than Sherrod Brown has,” Perlaky added, pointing to the Social Security Fairness Act as just one of many examples of Brown’s accomplishments for the working class.\n\n“We have a large number of middle-of-the-road people who are out there looking for someone to sing their song,” Perlaky said. “If nobody does, they’re going to keep voting Republican just because.”\n\nBrown’s 2024 campaign against Moreno, a political newcomer and former Cleveland-area car dealer, became the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history as crypto investors flooded it with tens of millions of dollars. Given Ohio’s rightward political lurch over the last decade, Brown’s campaign hoped to rely on independent and moderate voters, including “ticket-splitters” who might vote for Trump and a Democratic senator.\n\nDespite his defeat, Brown outperformed the top of the Democratic ticket as Ohio voters favored Trump over Kamala Harris by an eight-point margin. While it’s too early for opinion polling to be meaningful, an Emerson College survey published last week showed Brown trailing Husted by 6 percent.\n\nUnion members mostly told Salon that they recognize Brown’s odds next year are slim. But they hold out hope. For John Esterly, state legislative board chairman for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, Brown’s candidacy presents an opportunity for Ohioans to return to common sense and elect a politician who he believes actually cares about his constituents.\n\nEsterly remembered Brown holding a speaking tour at his union’s local chapters around Ohio about the need for rail safety reform after the derailment of a freight train transporting hazardous materials in East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023. When Lou Shuster, a BLET local president and train conductor, died after his train collided with a dump truck a month later, Brown traveled to Cleveland to meet with union members. After another union member named Fred Anderson was struck and killed by a remote-controlled train near Toledo that September, Brown reached out to Esterly personally and asked to pass along his regrets to Anderson’s family.\n\nBrown became “an outspoken advocate for common-sense rail safety” after the East Palestine tragedy, Esterly said, praising Brown for championing the unsuccessful Rail Safety Act of 2023, along with then-Sen. JD Vance.\n\n“We feel so comfortable and positive about Sherrod getting back in that race,” he said. “We know he’s going to pick up the torch and continue to carry it.”","summary":"He lost his Senate seat last year, but union members are all-in on veteran Democrat's new campaign","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/27/union-workers-welcome-sherrod-browns-2026-ohio-comeback-but-can-he-win/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2181251134-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 10:30:20","author":"Tatyana Tandanpolie","authors":["Tatyana Tandanpolie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":354890038,"title":"French Proposes Democrats Fight Trump On Crime By Blaming Him For 2020 Crime Spree","text":"Hypocrisy was on full display on Wednesday’s Morning Joe as New York Times columnist David French joined the MSNBC show to discuss how Democrats should respond to President Trump on crime.

We're not going to have troops walking down the streets of Baltimore and Chicago and Los Angeles.'”\n\nFrench began, “I mean, you have to use the truth to blow up his narrative.”\n\nAccording to French, the very same people who accuse Trump of acting like a king or a fascist dictator should also attack him for not micromanaging cities in 2020, “And the truth is this: that people forget he was president in 2020. And when crime really exploded, when violent crime really exploded in a way that was terrifying and dangerous, it happened in 2020, in his presidency, his first term.”\n\nIt’s probably not the best idea for Democrats to remind voters of 2020, when left-wing Black Lives Matter activists rioted in the streets and looted department stores in the name of “social justice,” but French suggested Democrats could still declare victory:\n\nEver since 2020, I think Democrats could say we've been dealing with the fallout, and we've been trying to wrestle and bring this under control and have had a lot of success. You can look at declining crime rates in the Biden term. You can—these declines have continued in this year. So there has been a story of success to say, ‘He was in charge when this blew up. And we've been dealing with the fallout ever since.’\n\nIn addition to being hypocritical, French’s urgings are not actually truthful. Blue city mayors and blue state governors own their responses to the 2020 crime wave. It’s not Trump’s fault that former Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz waited to deploy Minnesota’s National Guard, the mayor fiddled while Portland burned, Seattle let a bunch of left-wingers occupy parts of the city with their so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or any other number of examples.\n\nHere is a transcript for the August 27 show:\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe\n\nWILLIE GEIST: So, David French, the question is then for Democrats, and you can offer some free political advice, too, if you'd like to.

Earlier in July, Paramount announced it had reached a $16 million settlement with Trump to resolve a lawsuit he filed against the network over a CBS News 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired last year. A few weeks after the settlement and the Colbert cancellation announcement, Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance was approved by the FCC.\n\nGot a tip?

Among other issues, it mandated extensive secrecy about disclosing their payments and had restrictions on what sort of political content the creators could produce.\nIn their group chat, influencers debated the details.\n“Should we send a joint email (with all of our email addresses) … or, are we just going to send things separately and hope they change everything for everyone?” Laurenzo, a nonbinary creator in Columbus, Ohio, with over 884,000 TikTok followers, asked the group. Some joked about collective bargaining. “Any Newsies fans here?” Eliza Orlins, a public defender and reality TV star known for her appearances on Survivor, posted in the group. “‘We’re a union just by sayin’ so!’”\nThe influencers in the chat collectively had at least 13 million followers across social platforms. They represented some of the most well-known voices online posting in support of Democrats, and they’re key to wherever the party moves next. But ultimately, the group didn’t make much progress.\n“Reading through this revised Chorus contract like: you win some, you lose some,” a reproductive justice influencer named Pari, who posts under the handle @womeninamerica, responded later in the thread. “I also think there’s at least 4 other things that should change 🤣but the vibe I got from their email was that there would be minimal, if any, changes.” (Laurenzo, Orlins, and Pari did not reply to requests for comment.)\n“I don’t feel strongly about pushing tbh,” Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z news influencer who has been called the Gen Z Walter Cronkite and has been lauded in legacy media outlets, posted to the chat. “They aren’t going to modify it anymore. Seems like a take it or leave it.” (Parnas declined to comment.)\n“I believe we are in Stage 5: Acceptance,” Pari responded. Creators began signing on to the deal.\nAfter the Democrats lost in November, they faced a reckoning. It was clear that the party had failed to successfully navigate the new media landscape. While Republicans spent decades building a powerful and robust independent media infrastructure, maximizing controversy to drive attention and maintaining tight relationships with creators despite their small disagreements with Trump, the Democrats have largely relied on outdated strategies and traditional media to get their message out.\nNow, Democrats hope that the secretive Chorus Creator Incubator Program, funded by a powerful liberal dark money group called The Sixteen Thirty Fund, might tip the scales. The program kicked off last month, and creators involved were told by Chorus that over 90 influencers were set to take part. Creators told WIRED that the contract stipulated they’d be kicked out and essentially cut off financially if they even so much as acknowledged that they were part of the program. Some creators also raised concerns about a slew of restrictive clauses in the contract.\nInfluencers included in communication about the program, and in some cases an onboarding session for those receiving payments from The Sixteen Thirty Fund, include Olivia Julianna, the centrist Gen Z influencer who spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention; Loren Piretra, a former Playboy executive turned political influencer who hosts a podcast for Occupy Democrats; Barrett Adair, a content creator who runs an American Girl Doll–themed pro-DNC meme account; Suzanne Lambert, who has called herself a “Regina George liberal;” Arielle Fodor, an education creator with 1.4 million followers on TikTok; Sander Jennings, a former TLC reality star and older brother of trans influencer Jazz Jennings; David Pakman, who hosts an independent progressive show on YouTube covering news and politics; Leigh McGowan, who goes by the online moniker “Politics Girl”; and dozens of others. (The first two declined to comment; the rest did not respond to requests for comment.)\nAccording to copies of the contract viewed by WIRED that creators signed, the influencers are not allowed to disclose their relationship with Chorus or The Sixteen Thirty Fund—or functionally, that they’re being paid at all.\nDozens of liberal influencers are believed to have been approached by Chorus about The Sixteen Thirty Fund financing opportunity this spring. They were told that Chorus appreciated the work they were doing online and were asked if they’d be interested in being part of the first cohort of a new program that Chorus was running to help “expand their reach and impact,” creators tell WIRED.\nBut following the initial outreach, many creators expressed concern about some stipulations. According to copies of the contract viewed by WIRED, creators in the program must funnel all bookings with lawmakers and political leaders through Chorus. Creators also have to loop Chorus in on any independently organized engagements with government officials or political leaders.\n“If I want to work with another politician, I have to fully collaborate with them,” said one creator who was offered the contract but ultimately declined to take it and asked not to be named. “If I get Zohran and he wants to [do an] interview with me, I don’t want to give that to them.”\nCreators in the program are not allowed to use any funds or resources that they receive as part of the program to make content that supports or opposes any political candidate or campaign without express authorization from Chorus in advance and in writing, per the contract.\nThe contracts reviewed by WIRED prohibit standard partnership disclosures, declaring that creators will “not publicize” their relationship with Chorus or tell others that they’re members of the program “without Chorus’s prior express consent.” They also forbid creators from “disclos[ing] the identity of any Funder” and give Chorus the ability to force creators to remove or correct content based solely on the organization’s discretion if that content was made at a Chorus-organized event.\n“There are some real great advantages to … housing this program in a nonprofit,” Graham Wilson, a lawyer working with Chorus, said to creators on a Zoom call reviewed by WIRED. “It gives us the ability to raise money from donors. It also, with this structure, it avoids a lot of the public disclosure or public disclaimers—you know, ‘Paid for by blah blah blah blah’—that you see on political ads. We don’t need to deal with any of that. Your names aren’t showing up on, like, reports filed with the FEC.” (Wilson did not reply to a request for comment.)\nThe Federal Election Commission declined to comment.\nThe goal of Chorus, according to a fundraising deck obtained by WIRED, is to “build new infrastructure to fund independent progressive voices online at scale.” The creators who joined the incubator are expected to attend regular advocacy trainings and daily messaging check-ins. Those messaging check-ins are led by Cohen on “rapid response days.” The creators also have to attend at least two Chorus “newsroom” events per month, which are events Chorus plans, often with lawmakers.\nElizabeth Dubois, an assistant professor and university research chair in politics, communication, and technology at the University of Ottawa who has researched the ways influencers are reshaping the US political system, says that “we are seeing influencers being pulled into these dark campaigns or shadow campaigns, where the legal aspect is murky at best.”\n“Sometimes it is actually clear that influencers are being used to, for example, evade spending limits,” she says. “I think that we need to remember that for democracy to thrive, we do need transparency around who is paying for political messages.”\nDon Heider, the chief executive of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, says that the outlined restrictions violate ethical norms. “If the contract for getting money from a particular interest group says you can’t disclose it, then it’s pretty simple, you can’t take the money,” he says. “We’re living in an era where a lot of powerful people have basically taken the rule book and thrown it out the window.”\nKeith Edwards, a Democratic content creator who has skyrocketed to fame on YouTube since starting his channel last year, was not invited to be part of the program but believes that the way it was structured seemed “predatory.” He says that he would never agree to take part in a program that was run in secret or wouldn’t allow him to disclose funding.\n“What I don’t understand is, why wouldn’t you just donate to creators directly who have already built something and just need to put gasoline on the fire?” says Edwards. “Democrats at least understand that the internet exists now, so that’s good. But they still think influencers are just there to do a terrible direct-to-camera interview that no one watches rather than just treating us like another form of media.”\nThe influencers offered the funding were given just days to sign the contract, which was essentially presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. At least one cohort was specifically told they could not have their lawyers redline it. In the group chat formed to discuss contract negotiations, some creators discussed a clause prohibiting the disparagement of other creators. Not being able to criticize anyone else affiliated with Chorus felt restrictive to some, according to text messages posted to the chat.\nEventually, the creators in the group chat agreed to drop the issues they had. “I don’t think [Chorus is] out to screw us,” Orlins, a creator who was offered $8,000 per month, said in the group chat. (Some influencers for Chorus Creator Incubator Program were offered as little as $250 per month, according to one creator who declined to accept the deal, while others were offered membership into the “amplifier” cohort, which provides up to $8,000 per month.)\nIn 2018, The Sixteen Thirty Fund provided $141 million to more than 100 left-leaning causes in order to bolster Democratic support during the midterms, according to a tax filing obtained by Politico. In 2020, the fund distributed more than $400 million, according to the organization’s public tax filing, which Politico said was used in “efforts to unseat then-president Donald Trump and Republicans’ Senate majority.” In 2022, The Sixteen Thirty Fund spent $196 million backing state ballot measures on abortion rights heading into the midterms, according to NBC. Just four donors accounted for close to two-thirds of the fund’s revenue in 2023, according to its tax filing. The largest donor gave the group $50.5 million, with others donating $31.4 million, $21.8 million, and $13.6 million.\n“The Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is not required to disclose its contributors, has for years been a major funding source for liberal and progressive causes and groups, including those that spend in elections,” says Walker Davis, a research director for the open-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Though their recent tax returns indicate that they have pulled back from the eye-popping sums they raised and spent in 2020, the organization is still one of the top-spending politically oriented nonprofits in the country.”\nChorus, which is described in contracts reviewed by WIRED as a “project of” The Sixteen Thirty Fund that handles operations for the creator program, launched in November 2024 as a nonprofit arm of Good Influence, a for-profit influencer marketing agency aimed at helping content creators connect with social-good campaigns. Good Influence was founded in October 2020 by Stuart Perelmuter, the former communications director for representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky. Seeing an opportunity after Kamala Harris’ loss last November, Perelmuter cofounded Chorus with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen, who has over 4.6 million subscribers on YouTube and leads messaging check-ins for the creator cohort on “rapid response days.” According to records reviewed by WIRED, Chorus claims that its initial creator cohort has a collective audience of more than 40 million followers with more than 100 million weekly viewers and that the organization has “hundreds of creators signed up” and “ready to amplify” messaging.\n“I’ve spent most of my career researching right-wing media and sounding the alarms about the collapse of our old information environment,” Ellie Langford, the director of programming at Chorus, said on a Zoom call with dozens of creators in June. “Our political systems haven’t been able to figure out a real solution, and I’ve been really excited to see you all treading the path forward. I deeply, deeply believe that the work you all are doing is what’s going to make the difference in supporting and frankly resuscitating our democracy.”\nAlready, creators in the program are creating content together. In a new weekly series titled “Good News in Politics,” six creators in the program shared a collaborative video running through political wins. “Follow these creators bringing you hope instead of doomscrolling: @sander_jennings, @eorlins, @jesscraven101, @tono.latino, @gemma_talks, @thezactivist,” they posted.\nWhile some creators have been eager to work with Chorus, others distrust the organization. This spring, Chorus faced a wave of backlash from prominent content creators whose images were included in the firm’s fundraising decks without permission. “I was included on some [of Chorus’] decks like, ‘We have access to V,’ when you do not,” said V Spehar, a liberal content creator with over 3.5 million followers on TikTok.\nThe faces of several well-known influencers were featured prominently on the Chorus website beneath a giant DONATE button. However, users who clicked the button were taken to a fundraising page for Chorus instead of anywhere their dollars would go directly to the creators featured.\nProgressive YouTuber and former Media Matters staffer Kat Abughazaleh, who’s running for Congress in Illinois, was pictured on Chorus’ website and included in fundraising decks without her consent. She asked that her image and name be removed and no longer used for fundraising purposes.\nSpehar and other content creators have accused Chorus of attempting to establish themselves as a gatekeeper to Democratic political leaders. “What we need is for people to invest in independent media, and that doesn’t necessarily mean investing in a consulting group that is going to become a middleman for independent media,” says Spehar.\nSeveral influencers who doggedly defended Chorus throughout that controversy, including Elizabeth Booker Houston, a Democratic comedian and content creator on Instagram, and Allie O’Brien, a progressive creator with more than 600,000 followers on TikTok, were involved in membership talks for the highest-paid tier in Chorus’ new creator incubator program. (Houston did not respond to requests for comment; O’Brien declined to comment.)\nStill, some creators heard about The Sixteen Thirty Fund and Chorus funding initiative and applied to join.\nOne creator named Chesko, who goes by @thespeechprof online, applied to join the program because he viewed it as an “opportunity to get access to people that have funding or backing and actual research that I could use,” he says.\nUltimately, he wasn’t accepted and received an email on June 26 rejecting his application. “We are planning to bring more creators into the Incubator program in the near future,” Chorus wrote.\nThe structure of the program highlights the vast differences between how Democrats and Republicans attempt to amass online influence. Republicans have spent decades building up a powerful independent media ecosystem, though the right-wing influencer world is far from transparent. In September 2024, a federal indictment alleged that the Russian state-sponsored network RT was covertly providing millions in funding to Tenet Media, a company working with major right-wing influencers including Benny Johnson, Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, and Lauren Southern. In 2024, the National Republican Congressional Committee spent nearly $500,000 on work with Creator Grid, an influencer marketing company whose website says it “connects Republican candidates with the internet’s most powerful conservative influencers,” according to analysis of campaign finance filings from The Washington Post.\nSteven Buckley, a digital media sociologist at City St. George’s, University of London, says that these sorts of programs have been “happening in the right wing for ages.” But Heider said that the structure of The Sixteen Thirty Fund deal raises the question, “Is it ethical to match the tactics of your opponents?”\nThe Democrats appear to have no real counter to this system. “Democrats missed the next generation of media,” says Brendan Gahan, cofounder of influencer marketing agency Creator Authority. “Historically they owned Hollywood, but this next generation of influence is digital, and they’ve miscalculated that. I don’t think they feel comfortable in arenas where they lack control.”","summary":"An initiative aimed at boosting Democrats online offers influencers up to $8,000 a month to push the party line.

But throughout Trump’s first term, as he claimed the U.S. was being “invaded” by foreign criminals, Republican support for building more border walls rose, while Democratic support fell. When Trump was out of office, Republican faith in an expanded border wall softened a bit, with 72 percent of Republicans in 2024 saying that it would improve the border situation. But in the 2024 election, which came after a multi-year spike in migration to the U.S. under Biden, immigration was a bigger driver of support for Trump than in 2016.\n\n Please don’t yell at me data nerds: I know that correlation does not equal causation. But I am also a voter who lives in Trump country, and has for most of the past decade. I hear the way my fellow voters talk about immigration. They’ve begun to adopt the kind of rhetoric Trump has used. At the same time, real-world events have conspired to bring unprecedented numbers of migrants seeking refuge in the U.S., and a compliant right-wing press has helped spread Trump’s anti-immigrant propaganda. Much of the rest of the Republican Party has jumped on board. Trump wouldn’t have been able to do it alone, but he has helped shape his party’s views on immigration, period.\n\n You don’t need to dig too far into the data to determine that these views aren’t very deeply held. While many voters were persuaded by Trump’s rhetoric on immigration and said they supported his policies, they were less keen on his ideas when those issues were framed in a different way, highlighting the economic and social destructiveness of mass deportations. In fairness, Vice President Kamala Harris did warn that these things would happen, as Levitz pointed out, but she also stressed her support for a bipartisan bill—which the GOP blocked—that would have secured the border. “And let me be clear, after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border,” she said in her convention speech. “Last year, Joe [Biden] and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The border patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.”","summary":"Democratic leaders who want a winning message against Donald Trump’s military occupation of Washington, D.C., should accuse the president of orchestrating “a stunt to distract from the pain his tariffs are causing families” and of “creating fear to distract” from his Republican Party’s cuts to Medicaid.

That's how it works in 1973.\"\n\nDuring her appearance on his podcast earlier this month – which saw her announce her upcoming album The Life Of A Showgirl, which will be released in October – Swift described Kelce as a \"vibe booster\".\n\nHe appeared at one of Swift's Eras Tour shows at London's Wembley Stadium on June 23 last year, where he arrived on stage as she prepared to perform the The Tortured Poets Department section of the show, wearing a top hat and tails, and helped to prepare her to sing I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.\n\nSwift made history last summer when the tour became the highest-grossing of all time, and she became the first solo artist to perform at Wembley eight times on a single tour.\n\nThe singer has had four UK number one singles and 13 UK number one albums, and some of her best-known songs include Blank Space, Shake It Off and 22.\n\nLast September, President Donald Trump started a one-sided feud with Swift, writing on Truth Social, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” after she endorsed his Democrat rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBut it seems Trump may be changing his tune after all.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump said of Swift and Kelce, “I wish them a lot of luck.”\n\n“I think it’s— I think he’s a great player, I think he’s a great guy and I think that she’s a terrific person, “ he added. “So I wish them a lot of luck.”","summary":"Taylor Swift’s engagement ring is believed to be a yellow-gold antique diamond, of approximately five to six carats, according to a top jeweller in the US.","url":"https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-engagement-expert-jeweller-shares-insight-on-diamond-ring/a1410068389.html","image":"https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/CSG_8t0HI3HwrDblO7R2BVqTMFM=/60x0:735x450/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/801fbea7-da39-4322-a82e-aa40c05796cb/8356390d-ef22-46ff-8f01-82dfa78e36fe/video/video.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 08:02:54","author":"Casey Cooper-Fiske And Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Casey Cooper-Fiske And Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.318},{"id":354730966,"title":"Kamala Harris should fight or quit | Letter","text":"During the presidential campaign, Kamala Harris and Gov.

The couple, who have been together since 2023, officially confirmed their engagement last night (CET) on Instagram, posting a carousel of photos of the pop superstar, 35, and the Kansas City player, also 35, embracing in a rather lush garden. There was also a photo featuring a close-up of her engagement ring - a round diamond on a gold band. According to US reports, Kelce worked with Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry to design the ring.The post was captioned: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”Swift and Kelce’s joint Instagram post has been liked more than 26 million times at the time of writing. As you can imagine, Swifties have been flooding social media with frenzied and gushing messages of good wishes, the hashtag “TAYVIS” has been trending, and more information has come to light, as Travis Kelce apparently asked Scott Swift for permission to marry his daughter about a month ago. It was also revealed that Swift and Kelce got engaged two weeks ago in Missouri, according to Ed Kelce – Travis' father. On the celebrity front, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and the official Instagram account for the Prince and Princess of Wales were among those who liked the post. Other celebs who liked and shared posts about the happy news include Sabrina Carpenter, The National’s Aaron Dessner and Selena Gomez. Then came a rather bizarre reaction from none other than Donald Trump, one of Swift’s most vocal critics... He was asked about the news during a cabinet meeting and he told reporters: “Well, I wish them a lot of luck. I think it’s - I think he’s a great player, I think he’s a great guy and I think that she’s a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck.” Watch the moment below. Colour us confused, as Trump has not been shy when it comes to bashing Swift. He publicly declared his hatred for the musician last year after she endorsed Kamala Harris, very presidentially posting on his Truth Social media account, in all-caps, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” and stating that Swift would “probably pay a price” for her support of Harris. This led to the trending phrase “I love Taylor Swift”. Trump had also posted AI images suggesting Swift had endorsed him, clearly showing that he coveted her endorsement. In June 2024, he commented on Swift’s appearance in the book titled \"Apprentice In Wonderland: How Donald Trump And Mark Burnett Took America Through The Looking Glass\", calling her “unusually beautiful” and questioning whether she was \"legitimately liberal.\"Earlier this month, Trump took the time to share his thoughts about the Sydney Sweeney / American Eagle controversy, and decided to hit out at Swift, describing her in his Truth Social post as “no longer hot.” He wrote: “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”So, has Trump joined ranks with former FBI chief James Comey, who confessed last week that he was a massive Swiftie? Was it a classy move on his part to put the hatred to bed once and for all? Or was he simply confused regarding who he was talking about and will we be treated to a Truth Social rant about the engagement soon?Either way, fans can’t be bogged down...The news of Swift and Kelce’s engagement comes hot off the heals of Swift announcing the release of her new album, 'The Life of a Showgirl', which hits shelves on 3 October. The album is widely expected to be inspired by her experience of her record-breaking Eras Tour and by her romance with Kelce.Many brands and major companies jumped on the Swift marketing bandwagon following the announcement of the album, and you can bet more businesses will also be keen to get in on the engagement action.It has already started with Duolingo posting “But when will it be your Spanish teacher’s turn”, Buffalo Wild Wings offering to cater the wedding, and Panera posting: “It’s a loaf story baby just say yeast” - a reference to Swift’s 2008 hit song ‘Love Story’.Expect more of the same – click here to find out why.No official date for the wedding has been announced.","summary":"It's all everyone is talking about: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have announced their engagement.

So I wish them a lot of luck.”— ShanghaiEye (@ShanghaiEye) This softer tone contrasts sharply with his recent posts online where he had attacked the pop star.From public taunts to praiseEarlier this month, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Look at woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”It was not an isolated remark. Trump has regularly criticised Swift since she began endorsing Democratic candidates, most recently Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election. Soon after Swift declared on Instagram, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,” Trump responded with “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on Truth Social.Live EventsHe mocked her again in February when she appeared at the Super Bowl in support of Kelce, writing: “Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed – The world is healing!” In another post, he added: “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”Sydney Sweeney and the ‘hotness’ rowTrump’s hostility toward Swift was heightened during the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle campaign. Praising the actress, whom he described as a “registered Republican,” Trump contrasted her with Swift. He posted: “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves’. Go get ‘em Sydney. Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”He concluded with, “The tide has seriously turned – Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s announcementAgainst this backdrop, Swift and Kelce’s announcement took social media by storm. On Tuesday, the pair shared a joint Instagram post with photos of a rose garden proposal and a close-up of the ring. Their caption read: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”Kelce’s father has since revealed that the proposal had actually taken place weeks earlier. The Kansas City Chiefs also welcomed Swift to the team family, posting: “Congrats to Travis and Taylor – we’re excited to have you as a permanent member of the Chiefs Kingdom family!” with the added line, “Today is a fairytale.” View this post on Instagram A relationship in the spotlightSwift and Kelce first became linked in 2023 when he reached out during her Eras Tour. By autumn of that year, she was spotted at a Chiefs game and the relationship quickly became headline news. Swift has since been a regular at games, while Kelce appeared with her in podcast episodes and public events.Earlier this month, Swift joined Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast to promote her twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. The episode set a Guinness World Record for live podcast viewership on YouTube, underscoring their combined influence across sport and music.Swift’s open support for Democrats has often put her at odds with Trump. In a 2020 Fox & Friends interview, he remarked: “I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time. She couldn’t possibly endorse Biden… But she’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”Despite this history, Trump’s reaction to the engagement marks a rare moment of goodwill.

Submit to your husband, Taylor. You're not in charge.”\n\nKirk mused that one of the reasons Swift had been so “annoyingly liberal over the last couple of years” was the fact that she was not yet married, and at multiple points repeated that he would love to see her have a “ton of children.”\n\nMarrying Kelce – who previously said that having Donald Trump attend this year’s Super Bowl was an “honor” – would potentially “de-radicalize” her, he said.\n\nKirk added that Swift \"might go from a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter… and I think we should celebrate that. She should have more children than she has houses.” He added, \"Up until this point, that's not a great role model for young women to wait all the way until you're 35 and just put your career first.”\n\nKirk’s comments sparked disbelief on social media, with one user writing: “why is a grown man spending his day thinking about this,” with another adding “this dude is so weird.”\n\n“Can’t they just be normal for one freaking day,” wrote a third, with a fourth adding, “he's just jealous, that Swift makes people happier than he does.”\n\n“​​Charlie Kirk is an ignorant, bigoted dogmatist.

Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!),” Trump continued. “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”","summary":"Trump was in a cabinet meeting when engagement was announced","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/trump-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engagment-b2814715.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/26/17/21/Trump-iazn7oaw.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/23KWKj8e-APg7GJgG.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 03:26:56","author":"Caitlin Hornik","authors":["Caitlin Hornik"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.347},{"id":354656990,"title":"‘They’re All Dead!’: Watters Slams ‘White Dudes For Harris’ Guest After He Says National Guard’s Not Needed In Chicago","text":"Fox News’ Jesse Watters halted former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Senior Adviser Mike Nellis on Tuesday after he claimed that the National Guard would not be needed in Chicago to halt crime.\n\nWhile speaking with the press on Friday, President Donald Trump said he was considering sending National Guard troops to Chicago after deploying them in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 11. With Democrats increasingly pushing back on the National Guard being sent to address crime, Watters asked Nellis on “Jesse Watters Primetime” if he believes Chicago should be open to help from the White House. (RELATED: Watch As Chicago Resident Refuses To Co-Sign Dems’ Preferred Narrative On Crime)\n\n“No, look, I think Chicago needs to do a better job of dealing with crime. Our local leaders need to do a better job of dealing with crime, but the city of Chicago has had a chance to vote for Donald Trump three times, and he lost by 80% each of the three times that he was on the ballot. I think if Donald Trump wants to get involved heavily in issues somewhere else, he should go look at red states, because Donald Trump doesn’t have any urgency to deal with Louisiana, which is the murder capital of the United States. He doesn’t have anything to say about Oklahoma, which has the worst schools in the nation. Doesn’t have anything to say about Arkansas, which has the highest teen pregnancy rate — ” Nellis said before Watters jumped in.\n\n“Those are crime ridden too! And if the mayor wants to invite Donald Trump to go in there and do it,” Watters said. “Chicago’s a little bigger than Baton Rouge, Mike, OK? You live in Chicago, and you should care. Did you hear my friend out there in the monologue talking about her cousin, her uncle, her niece. They’re all dead, Mike! Do you care about that at all? Your mayor doesn’t care. Your mayor doesn’t want any backup. They’re offering them more cops, more guards. And he says, ‘No, more housing.’ What the hell’s wrong with him?”\n\nDemocrat Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson held a press conference Monday telling the president to not come, with Johnson touting what he said were lowered crime statistics.\n\nChicago Police Department data through Aug. 16 reportedly shows homicides in the city trending down 25% over the last 12 months compared to 2023. The frequency of killings remains higher than it was before the pandemic, according to ABC7 Chicago. Data from the outlet reports that in the last 12 months through Aug. 16, there have been 474 homicides, with an average yearly homicide rate of 722 between 2021 and 2023.\n\nAccording to a White House press release, the city has had the highest “murder rate among U.S. cities with more than one million people” for seven consecutive years, with Chicago also labeled as having the “most murders of any U.S. city” for 13 consecutive years.\n\nNellis pushed back against Watters.\n\n“I know I’m not going to feel safe when I take him to a ball game. I’m going to see armed military members. There’s a way to do this,” Nellis said. “I’m happy to support having more police on the streets of Chicago to help keep us safe. The problem is in Donald Trump’s budget that he signed by the Republicans, he cut community police funding by $2 billion, which means there’ll be fewer police on the streets.”\n\nWatters hit back,\n\n“All right, Mike, you guys defunded the police. So don’t talk about cutting funding, OK? Everybody knows the Democrats defunded. They defunded all over the country, Mike,’ Watters said. “I don’t have time to debate that. But I respect that you are from Chicago, and you want to be safe. But we are all in agreement that Chicago needs to do a lot better. You and I will agree on that.”\n\nTrump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and invoke Section 40 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act followed after a slew of crimes in Washington, D.C. drew national attention. Among some were the brutal attack against a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer and the fatal June 30 shooting of Republican intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym.\n\nDemocrats and legacy media pundits have said Washington, D.C.’s crime dropped 35% in 2024, citing local police data. The statistics left out crimes such as felony and aggravated assault. In July, the Metropolitan Police Department said an investigation was opened against D.C. police Commander Michael Pulliam for allegedly altering crime statistics in his district, according to NBC Washington.\n\nDespite the pushback from Democrats, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released Monday reported that 54% of registered voters said Trump’s crime-fighting efforts in the nation’s capital are “justified and necessary.” According to U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro on Monday, the federal takeover in the nation’s capital has led to 1,007 arrests and 111 illegal firearm confiscations.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Just so happy for these two'\n\nThat was an exaggeration, but the NFL's Instagram account did have no fewer than four Kelce-Swift posts as of Tuesday afternoon on the East Coast.\nFor critics, that response from the league is further proof that the ubiquitous Kelce-Swift coverage of the last few years will only continue for the foreseeable future.\n'Can we just watch football?' one fan asked. 'Serious question.'\n'Nobody hopes he retires soon more then NFL fans,' another added.\nThere were some 'heart' emojis and other attempts at humanity, but those messages were diminished by the wave of kvetching among football diehards.\n'Bruh stop with this s***,' wrote one critic.\nAnother added: 'The world kept spinning.'\nEven President Trump reacted to the news, telling reporters, 'Well I wish them a lot of luck.'\n'I think he's a great player and a great guy and I think she's a terrific person so I wish them a lot of luck.'\nTrump has previously notoriously trolled the legendary singer after she endorsed his political rival Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections.\nSwift and Kelce announced their engagement on Tuesday via social media after a secret proposal two weeks ago.\nThe pop icon and the NFL star have been dating for two years.\nSwift captioned her engagement post: 'Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.'\n\nThe pop icon and the NFL star have been dating for two years, and went public with their relationship in September 2023; Pictured 2024 in New York City\n\nThe Grammy winner also revealed her mammoth diamond engagement ring in the post - the stunning band is an Old Mine Brilliant Cut and appears to be from Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry.

In an appearance on “The Ingraham Angle,” Kirk said President Donald Trump dictates the Democratic Party’s agenda because “everything the Democrat Party says is just against Trump,” comparing that dynamic to Cracker Barrel’s failed logo rollout that sparked backlash and forced a retreat.\n\n“President Trump, he runs both the Democrat Party because basically everything the Democrat Party says is just against Trump. So he gets to determine the entire agenda of the Democrat Party and now runs Cracker Barrel all from the Oval Office on Truth Social,” Kirk said. “It’s an amazing test case to show the similarities between the two.”\n\nKirk said that pandering to narrow, out-of-touch opinions shows contempt for the very Americans whose votes or dollars ultimately decide success. (RELATED: Democrats Are Shocked They Agree With Conservatives On Cracker Barrel Neutering)\n\n“Both the Democrat Party and their attempted rebrand and Cracker Barrel, it shows that when you market test in Brooklyn, you lose in Birmingham, Alabama,” Kirk said. “When you try to just always pander towards a small subset of elite opinion of out-of-touch actors and then you have contempt and bitterness for the very country that you either wish that they want to buy your products from or to vote for you.”\n\nKirk said Cracker Barrel’s logo fiasco is part of a broader pattern. The same elites who pushed the rebrand, he said, also believed Pennsylvania voters would rally behind former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“So there is this very interesting connective tissue here. It’s not worth overthinking. By the way you look at the ridiculous logo that Cracker Barrel thought was a good idea. Those are the same people who thought a bunch of people in Pennsylvania were going to come out in a lot of numbers for Kamala Harris. Yeah, they are going to be super excited for it,” Kirk said.\n\nCracker Barrel attempted a rebrand by unveiling a stripped-down logo that featured only the words “Cracker Barrel,” dropping its signature “old timer” Uncle Herschel. The company announced in a press release that the new design, anchored in its trademark gold and brown colors, would appear across menus and marketing materials.\n\nThe rollout backfired almost immediately as CBS News reported that Cracker Barrel’s market value plunged by nearly $100 million after the announcement, with shares falling $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday’s trading. Online critics blasted the change as unnecessary.\n\nTrump criticized the move on Truth Social Tuesday, urging the restaurant chain to reverse course.\n\n“Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again,” Trump wrote. “Remember, in just a short period of time I made the United States of America the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. One year ago, it was ‘DEAD.’ Good luck!”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Any flag is just a piece of cloth, but the flag of Spain, the flag of the United States, or the flag of Italy is much more than that. These banners hold within them nothing less than the history of a nation: all its past and present citizens, its struggles, its sorrows, the joys of the families that have built it, its culture, its victories, its sovereignty, its faith, its hard-won independence, its great enterprises and inventions, its laws, its books and songs, its freedoms and its lands, its great national deeds and its small local stories.\n\nThe American flag represents all Americans — the living and the dead, those who remained at home and those who traveled the world, those born on U.S. soil and those who later found refuge there. And here’s a crucial point that liberals should understand once and for all: the flag is a national symbol before it is a government emblem.\n\nBurning the flag is dumb. Burning the flag means burning everything I just listed and much more. Burning the flag should be a crime — just like burning down the Capitol or tearing down the Statue of Liberty. Burning the flag is what the enemies of the United States do. And enemies of the United States are not welcomed, not excused, not loved — they are fought. A nation that does not fight its enemies is a dead nation. (RELATED: The Two Americas)\n\nRussell Kirk embraced T.S. Eliot’s idea of what endures through time. “By ‘the Permanent Things,’ [T. S. Eliot] meant those elements in the human condition that give us our nature, without which we are as the beasts that perish,” Kirk wrote. “They work upon us all in the sense that both they and we are bound up in that continuity of belief and institution called the great mysterious incorporation of the human race.”\n\nThe flag is one of those unchanging symbols, one of those permanent things. It represents that continued and shared belief that unites cultures and generations under a single homeland.\n\nDonald Trump wants the American flag to be respected. The majority of American citizens want the flag to be respected. In Europe, there are nations that pioneered allowing attacks on their own flags, symbols, and institutions. Sadly, my country is one of them — and we are still paying the price. The left, allied with foolish secessionists, is the main enemy of the Spanish nation, and together they have allowed — or even encouraged — outrages against the flag. And I fear that the progressives now pretending to defend freedom of expression in order to oppose Trump’s plan to protect the flag are, in truth, only one step away from declaring themselves enemies of the United States. (RELATED: Spain’s Far‑Left Dictatorship Has Become a Reality)\n\nNo flag should ever be burned — neither your own, out of gratitude, nor those of other nations, out of the basic respect owed to the history and people they represent. I’ve read about the legal controversy over the flag and the 1989 Supreme Court ruling. I am the first to defend freedom of expression. But burning the flag cannot, in any sense, be considered freedom of expression. It strikes me as a dumb and self-destructive twisting of words. If freedom of expression protects burning flags, then it protects everything — and therefore, it protects nothing.\n\nI find it ironic that liberals now try to present themselves as the great defenders of free speech, when for years they have practiced the most atrocious censorship through their totalitarian cancellation tactics. It’s as if they take an almost perverse pleasure in always finding themselves on the wrong side of history. The flag is untouchable. (RELATED: The Global Censorship Cancer)\n\nThe worst president Spain ever had was José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. His great international gesture was to remain seated while the U.S. flag passed during the Columbus Day military parade, in protest of the Iraq War. It was an international disgrace, something that still pains me today, because that clown wasn’t there as Zapatero, but as prime minister, representing all Spaniards. That attempt to insult the flag of one of our greatest allies was simply appalling — intellectually shallow and strategically suicidal. The guy didn’t realize that the flag did not represent Bush, but the United States of America, one of the most beloved and respected nations in the world.\n\nThat is why it is important to understand what the flag really is before engaging in absurd debates about whether it should be burned or not. In fact, I see nothing there worth debating. If we allow that debate, I could just as well raise another: should we pull Kamala Harris’s ears every time we see her?\n\nREAD MORE from Itxu Díaz:\n\nA Case of Happy Inefficiency: Accidental 911 Calls\n\nProfessional Protesters Don’t Even Know What They’re Protesting\n\nHoliday at War: My Week Fighting an Ant Invasion","summary":"Symbols are important, not for themselves, but for what they represent.
