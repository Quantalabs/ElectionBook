Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Obama. \n\nIn the end, Allen and Parnes suggested whether Harris won or lost in her race against Trump 'she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him' as Biden staffers remained with her campaign.\n\nAt one point, the authors claim, Sean Clegg - a Harris advisor who was not trusted by the Biden staffers - was helping the vice president prepare for a joint appearance with her running mate Tim Walz, when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished.\n\nClegg quickly stopped her, according to the book. \n\n'Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,' Clegg said, according to an excerpt previously published by The Hill.\n\nFor the remark, Clegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides have also claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out.\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe for her loss because he refused to drop out of the race sooner.\n\nHe had claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called 'the cardinal sin' of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as 'catastrophic.'\n\n'When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,' he told The Atlantic. \n\nIn the end, Harris and Walz lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout.\n\nIt marked the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Democrats had been secretly planning for former President Joe Biden to either drop out of the presidential race or even 'die in office' as far back as 2023, a damning new book claims.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14545359/Democrats-secretly-planning-Biden-withdraw-die-office.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/00/96655227-0-image-m-21_1743122087627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:44:06","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":304950890,"title":"Donald Trump's Own Appointees Reject His Washington Post Complaint","text":"The Federal Election Commission (FEC), which has two commissioners previously nominated by President Donald Trump, dismissed a complaint by Trump's 2024 presidential campaign alleging that The Washington Post made \"illegal corporate in-kind contributions\" to then-Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.The ruling was decided in late-February, with the filing made public on Thursday.Newsweek has reached out to the legal team representing Trump's presidential campaign for comment via email on Thursday.Why It MattersTwo of the commissioners who rejected the Trump presidential campaign's claim were nominated to the post by Trump during his first term.The bipartisan ruling comes as Trump has implemented media changes affecting the press pool and access.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ... More Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe president called NPR and PBS “two horrible and completely biased platforms” in a Truth Social post Wednesday night, renewing a call to defund public media in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s latest criticism came hours after the heads of NPR and PBS testified in a congressional subcommittee hearing about their reporting practices, facing criticism from figures such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who called NPR and PBS “radical, left-wing echo chambers.”\n\nRepublicans called for an end to public funding for broadcasters during the hearing and repeatedly cited an essay from former NPR business editor Uri Berliner criticizing the outlet’s news coverage and an “absence of viewpoint diversity.”\n\nNPR was pressed over its coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop controversy, with Greene asserting the topic was underplayed by the outlet and NPR CEO Katherine Maher, who did not lead NPR at the time, saying “our current editorial leadership thinks that was a mistake, as do I.”\n\nPBS was accused by Greene of featuring a drag performer during one of its kid shows, though CEO Paula Kerger said the video clip at the center of Greene’s claim was not shown on children's programming and instead mistakenly published to and quickly removed from a website of one of PBS’ New York City affiliate stations.\n\nKerger and Maher defended their outlets’ value to the American public, also lauding the news and educational programming they provide to smaller communities where few broadcasters exist.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nHow Much Of Npr And Pbs’ Budgets Come From The Federal Government?\n\nPBS receives about 16% of its funding directly from the federal government, while NPR receives about 1%, according to NPR, which says most of its money comes from corporate sponsorships and fees from NPR member organizations.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is the primary vehicle for government-funded broadcasting, receives about $500 million in congressional appropriations each year, PBS reported. The publicly funded corporation says it allocates over 70% of its federal appropriation to local public media stations while a much smaller portion goes to NPR and PBS. NPR’s member stations, which are independently owned public radio stations, receive an average of 10% of their funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with rural stations particularly dependent on the money.\n\nHow Can Trump Defund Npr And Pbs?\n\nThe president would need to go through the Republican-controlled Congress to defund the media outlets. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who has repeatedly pushed forward legislation targeting NPR and PBS, reintroduced a bill Thursday to remove government funding for the outlets, according to Fox News.\n\n43%. That is the share of Americans who believe NPR and PBS should continue receiving federal funding, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Meanwhile, 24% of Americans say Congress should remove funding as 33% of U.S. adults remain unsure.\n\nWhat Has Elon Musk Said About Npr And Pbs?\n\nDepartment of Government Efficiency head and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has a close relationship with the president, has repeatedly bashed the press during Trump’s presidential campaign and subsequent second term. Musk has targeted journalists by name, has been accused of suspending prominent journalists from X who reported on him and called popular news outlets such as the Associated Press “propaganda,” all while propping up his social media platform as a more legitimate source of news. He has also said NPR is “extremely biased,” calling for its defunding and separately claiming PBS “is the far left.”\n\nKey Background\n\nRepublicans have long pushed for reducing or eliminating government funding to public media. Former President George W. Bush’s proposed cuts to public media were rejected by Congress each year of his term, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sought to completely defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the 1990s. Trump also pushed to defund public media in his first term but was unsuccessful in trying to fully eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Trump renewed his attacks on the press in the run-up to his second term. ABC settled a defamation lawsuit levied by Trump for $16 million last year, while CBS continues fighting a $20 billion lawsuit from Trump accusing the network’s “60 Minutes” show of election interference through the editing of an interview with former Vice President and then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe president has barred the Associated Press from the White House press pool after the news outlet did not follow Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr is investigating NPR and PBS over allegations the nonprofit outlets are airing commercials. Maher and Kerger both rejected claims their outlets have violated FCC regulations, with Maher saying NPR is “confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR's adherence to these rules.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRepublicans accuse NPR, PBS of bias at House hearing; Democrats rebuke it as a partisan attack (ABC)\n\nPublic Radio Finances (NPR)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Support (PBS News)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

And he left the spreadsheet with another Harris aide.’ \n\nBiden, at 81, was the oldest person ever to be sworn in as president. Donald Trump railed against his rival’s age and questioned Biden’s mental abilities, referring to him as ‘Sleepy Joe.’\n\nDemocrats publicly defended Biden but, it turns out, they were privately preparing to replace him.\n\nHarris’ Chief of Staff Lorraine Voles had been working on a contingency plan since November 19, 2021. That was the day Biden temporarily signed over presidential power to Harris when he underwent a colonoscopy.\n\nThe vice president’s team launched a stealth operation to have a plan ready in case they needed to take over, author Chris Whipple reveals in his upcoming book ‘Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds,’ which is out next month.\n\nA Democratic operative told Whipple: ‘We just feel like we should put a plan in place. Maybe something happens,’ according to an excerpt of the book in Vanity Fair.\n\nBiden dropped out of the presidential race on July 21, 2024 following his disastrous debate with Trump. \n\nBut Parnes and Allen reveal in their book their were questions about Biden’s fitness from Democrats leading up to that point.\n\n‘A handful of Democratic National Committee officials already had considered contingency plans,’ Allen and Parnes write. ‘In hush-hush talks starting in 2023, these officials gamed out Biden-withdrawal scenarios, according to two people familiar with them.\n\n‘They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance: if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue. If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination.’\n\nBiden stubbornly remained in the race, encouraged to do so by first lady Jill Biden and their son Hunter Biden.\n\nHe was so stubborn it took a month after the debate – and an intense pressure campaign from Democratic officials – to get him to step aside. \n\nBecause in the days after the debate, the worries continued.\n\nTwo days after Biden fumbled on the Atlanta debate stage, he was in New Jersey for a fundraiser with Gov. Phil Murphy. \n\nHe needed to have florescent tape on the carpet, ‘colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk’.\n\n‘He knows to look for that,’ an aide said.\n\nAt the event, Biden spoke haltingly when he answered questions and needed cues for his remarks.\n\nThat wasn’t the only fundraiser that sparked concern. Those closed door events are filled with loyal Democrats whose financial support is critical to winning elections. It’s a chance for candidates to make a lasting impression.\n\nBiden was not doing that. \n\nActor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling for Biden to leave the race just weeks after he and other Hollywood stars helped raise $30 million for Biden at a Los Angeles fundraiser. \n\n‘I was raised to tell the truth,’ Clooney told ’60 Minutes’ Sunday of his piece. \n\n‘I had seen the president up close for his fundraiser, and I was surprised, and so I feel as if there were a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that, and I also believed I had to tell the truth.’ \n\nClooney’s essay sent shock waves through the public and led to a pile on of voices calling for Biden to step aside.\n\nHe did so, after repeated urging and a call from Nancy Pelosi, as DailyMail.com previously reported.\n\nBiden promptly endorsed Harris but the vice president was not the top choice of everyone.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Barack Obama wanted a primary. And Obama favored having a governor, not Harris, as the nominee, Whipple reported in his book.\n\nHarris, however, quickly garnered support among the party faithful and locked up the nomination within a week.\n\nA Democratic operative told Parnes and Allen of their worry they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: ‘Well, at least she has a pulse.’ \n\nHarris suffered a massive loss to Trump despite spending billions of dollars on her presidential campaign.","summary":"Democrats close to Kamala Harris established a secret &#8216;death pool&#8217; in case&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/democratic-partys-private-discussions-on-potential-contingencies-in-case-of-bidens-death-in-2023/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 22:09:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":304934196,"title":"Opinion: Why Tim Walz Has a Bad Case of ‘Main Character’ Syndrome","text":"Tim Walz was a dud as vice presidential pick. He added zero to the ticket. In his one big moment—the vice-presidential debate with J.D. Vance—he got beat. Badly. And looked hopelessly out of his depth.\n\nNone of this is to say that if Kamala Harris had picked someone other than Walz she would be president right now. History tells us that VP picks almost never make any real difference. And I think that’s true this time too. Had Harris picked, say, Josh Shapiro, she still would have lost.\n\nTo my mind then, Walz was a sort of historical blip. Plucked from relative obscurity and then, after losing, sent back to that relative obscurity. Which isn’t nothing! Being a governor of a state is a big deal! Being the VP nominee is a huge deal!\n\nBut, in politics, water usually finds its level. And Walz’s level was not—and is not—national politics.\n\nThis is obvious to anyone who has spent any amount of time covering or watching politics. It is not obvious, however, to Tim Walz.\n\nSince the election loss, Walz has slowly but surely tried to fashion a narrative that he was under-utilized during the campaign. And that had he been properly deployed a) he would have shined and b) Harris might have won. Witness this recent story from CNN on Walz—and this line in particular:\n\nA few things:\n\n1. The job of the VP nominee is literally to be a team player. Like, that’s the gig.\n\n2. If you think that the answer to Democrats’ problems in the 2024 election was “more Tim Walz,” I have a terrific up-and coming-video company named Blockbuster you might be interested in.\n\nThis is not the first time that Walz has done some backseat driving about what went wrong in 2024. Or the first time he has concluded that the solution to what ailed the campaign was MORE TIM WALZ.\n\nHere’s Walz diagnosing the problems with the campaign earlier this month in an interview with Politico:\n\nI actually think he’s right about that. But, the problem is that the risk-averse strategy Walz is decrying is the only reason he was picked as VP! Harris wanted someone who wouldn’t overshadow her didn’t have national political ambitions of his own. \n\nOf course, every politician who has had a taste of being a candidate for national office wants more of it. Walz is no exception. Hence his decision to embark on a tour of Republican-friendly congressional districts this year. Again, CNN:\n\nHere’s my guess: Walz probably runs for a third term as governor next year. Because why not? It’s a midterm year with a likely unpopular incumbent Republican president and in a Democratic-leaning state, he likely wins. At which point, he will offer some blandly vague answers about running for president in 2028. And then admit he is, yes, thinking about it because so many people—eye roll—are asking him to consider it.\n\nI could also see Walz deciding against a third term in 2026 but trying to emerge as one of the voices filling the current leadership void within the party—he’s already sort of doing that now—and, when asked, offer some blandly vague answers about running for president in 2028. And then admit he is, yes, thinking about it because so many people —eye roll—are asking him to consider it.\n\nTo be clear: I am extremely skeptical that Walz is a real player come 2028. Nothing I saw during the campaign—or after it—suggests to me he is that guy.\n\nBut Walz absolutely has caught a case of “main character” syndrome. He seems to have convinced himself that he is a major player. That the Democratic party is clamoring for what he is selling. And that if only he had been unleashed—or something—on the campaign trail in 2024, things would have been different.\n\nIt reminds me a little bit of Uncle Rico.\n\nWalz is, of course, entitled to his own opinion. But not to his own facts. And the facts of the 2024 race are these:\n\n1. He was picked as VP because of a single viral TV clip—the whole “weird” thing—and because he offered no threat to Harris.\n\n2. Once the initial hype machine efforts—he’s a football coach! he’s a normal guy!—wore off, Walz was beset by a number of negative stories including that he had misremembered whether he had been in Tiananmen Square during the massacre in 1989.\n\n3. His performance in the VP debate with Vance was mediocre at best.\n\n4. The Harris campaign realized that he was not an asset, and largely hid him from view in the final weeks of the race.\n\nAgain, Walz may run for president in 2028! It’s a wide-open field. And he clearly thinks the public is longing for him. But, objectively, they aren’t. Walz is a supporting actor. Not a lead guy. \n\nHe’s just the last guy to realize it.\n\nWant more ball and strike calling—no matter what uniform the batter at the plate is wearing?

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. Have you heard this word lately that’s been bandied about, “oligarchs,” “autocrats,” “dictators,” but mostly, “aristocrats”? In other words, that, supposedly, a small cabal of very wealthy people have snatched control of the government. And the Democrats, as the loyal opposition of the fighting middle class, is trying to stop it.\n\nThey use the word “plutocrats.” Oligarch, just from the Greek word, the rule by the few. Plutocrat means the rule by the wealthy. Aristocrat means ruled by the so-called best—or those people who claim they’re better born. But they’re using all of these terms to castigate, apparently, the relationship between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.\n\nBut here’s what’s ironic. We didn’t hear any of this during the Obama years, during the Clinton years, or during the Biden years. In other words, for 20 years, no one made mention that the country was controlled by oligarchs. \n\nLet me just look at the list for you of the 10 wealthiest people in the United States: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, Mike Bloomberg. They all have one thing in common, they’re all worth over $100 billion. And until recently, I would say the 2024 election, they were all against the Republican Party and were lavish donors for the Democrats.\n\nWhy they’re angry now is because Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post—which was a vehicle, a money-losing, but still influential, vehicle for leftist and Democratic agendas—decided not to endorse either Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump. \n\nElon Musk—who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 when he was beloved by the Left because of Tesla, because of SpaceX, because of Neuralink, because of Starlink. Also, according to what he said, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. \n\nMark Zuckerberg, remember, put $419 million in his various PACs to absorb the work of registrars to great effect in the 2020 election. \n\nMike Bloomberg probably has the record, single record. He used $1 billion to try to capture the 2020 Democratic primary nomination—$1 billion.\n\nSo why are they so angry at the oligarchs when the oligarchs were synonymous with Democrats? \n\nAnd I should point out that George Soros put in $125 million in the 2022 midterms. He has the all-time record. It’s assumed that he has spent $22 billion for left-wing candidates and left-wing PACs and left-wing foundations.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the felon, he put over $100 million from 2020 to 2022, all on the side of Democrats and left-wing candidates. His mother was a bundler, a stealthy bundler for billionaires in Silicon Valley.\n\nSo, what’s going on? \n\nOne last data point, in the 2024 election cycle, the Biden campaign, the Harris campaign, and the Trump campaign together raised $4.7 billion. But guess what? The Democrats raised $1 billion more than did Trump. \n\nSo, what is going on? There is an anger now that for the first time in 20 years, over three administrations—Clinton, Obama, and Biden—for the first time there are multibillionaires who are starting to question their Democratic loyalty: Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, perhaps even Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost billionaires are still on the side of the Left, but they don’t tolerate any apostates. So they’re angry they don’t have a lock on the oligarch, so to speak. \n\nI’ll just finish with one reflection. Why did they start to bolt? Because the Democratic Party was so sure of the support of billionaires, they started making demands upon them and saying: \n\nYou’re going to give this amount of money. And if you want to play ball with us, this is the monopoly that will control artificial intelligence. You are included. You’re not. We’re going to get the FBI to partner with you, Mark Zuckerberg, and Meta, Facebook, to make sure you ban information injurious to the Biden campaign. You, Twitter, the old Twitter, you’re going to have FBI. \n\nAnd they revolted. And Donald Trump came along and said: \n\nI welcome all of you because I’m not gonna tell you who to vote for or what to do, but I’m going to look at you in a nationalist-populist manner. You are the William Knudsens, the Henry Fords, the Henry Kaisers of the War Production Board. In other words, I’m gonna go to bat for you so that you do not have your wealth confiscated in China, so that people in Europe do not impose special taxes on you just because you’re making too much money or try to censor your news. In other words, I’m going to try to enlist you on behalf of the country in a patriotic, nationalist fashion.\n\nAnd they found that argument more persuasive than they did, “You better give to us and this is what you’re going to do.” And as a result, 30% of the billionaires bolted and are either now neutral or they favor the Republicans. The vast majority, to repeat, still favor Democrats. \n\nThe Democratic Party is the party of the very wealthy, plutocracy, and the billionaire class, but they demand absolute loyalty and solidarity. And any defections or apostates then cause them to go—I don’t know what the word is—ballistic that anybody would doubt their ability to control the big money in the United States. Big money in the United States is a Democratic phenomenon.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Throughout the 2010s, it drifted toward Democrats as Republicans lost voters in suburban areas around Austin, Dallas and Houston.But in 2024, it shifted firmly back to Republicans, with Trump winning it by nearly 14 points. This was in part due to his strength with Hispanic voters in South Texas border counties, which were once Democratic strongholds that flipped to him.Texas, with its 40 Electoral College votes, becoming competitive for Democrats would upend politics if it happens in the coming election cycles. However, the 2024 results have called into question whether it will actually become a battleground state in the near future.What to KnowA new survey from the polling firm Texas Public Opinion Research (TPOR) suggests Trump's favorability in Texas is dropping, as it has nationwide amid growing concerns about the economy and tariffs.His favorability in the latest poll is -3, with 50 percent of Texans viewing him unfavorably compared to 47 percent who view him favorably. This is down from a positive 12 favorability rating after the November presidential election.That amounts to a 15 point shift away from the Republican president.The poll also found that national conservative figures like Vice President JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are underwater by three points and 10 points respectively.Senator John Cornyn, a Republican up for reelection in 2026, has a favorability rating of -22, with only 21 percent of respondents saying they view him favorably. Attorney General Ken Paxton, floated as a potential conservative primary challenger to Cornyn, has a favorability rating of -5.Conversely, former Democratic Representative Colin Allred has a favorability rating of +7. He challenged GOP Senator Ted Cruz in the Senate race last year. Although he lost by 8.4 points, he notably performed better than Vice President Kamala Harris in the southwestern state.What People Are SayingTPOR in a poll write-up: \"The data shows a significant decline in President Donald Trump's favorability ratings between November and March. From November to March, Trump's favorability rating dropped from 55% favorable, 43% unfavorable (+12) to 47% favorable, 50% unfavorable (-3)—a 15-point swing. Additionally, the president's 'very favorable' rating dropped from 42% in November 2024 to 37% in March 2025.\"CNN Data analyst Harry Enten on March 25: \"All we talk about is how unpopular Donald Trump is, but in reality, he's basically more popular than he was at any point in term number one, and more popular than he was when he won [the] election back in November 2024.\"What Happens NextHow Trump's approval rating will shift over the coming weeks and months will be determined by a number of factors ranging from tariffs, foreign policy moves and the economy. Democrats will continue to aim to flip Texas, but it's unclear whether their dream will become a reality in the near future.","summary":"The president's favorability is now underwater in the Lone Star State, according to new polling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-favorability-plunges-texas-2051729","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2616258/donald-trump-texas-favorability-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 20:54:06","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":304907812,"title":"Pro Wrestling Notes: Saraya Leaves AEW, Ric Flair Calls Out John Cena, More","text":"Professional wrestling is a business, and that unfortunately means that sometimes wrestlers or backstage personnel move on or are released from a company.Such was the case this past week when all of the major news was focused on multiple beloved wrestlers leaving their respected promotions.So, let's take a look at those stories as well as the other major stories that have been the focus for the pro wrestling world.Saraya Announces Departure From AEWDuring an episode of her podcast, Rule Breakers with Saraya, Saraya (formerly Paige in WWE) announced that she was leaving AEW, noting that her tenure with the company was great but she just felt that her time was up there.Saraya is one of the most beloved female wrestlers in the history of professional wrestling.

Jasmine Crockett was accused of using Botham Jean's death for political gain by his family","text":"Democratic firebrand Jasmine Crockett was accused of using the police shooting death of an unarmed black man for political gain, DailyMail.com can reveal. \n\nRep. Crockett – who found herself in hot water this week for calling wheelchair-bound Texas Governor Greg Abbot 'Hot Wheels' – was hit with a cease-and-desist order in 2022 by the family of 26-year-old accountant Botham Jean, who was shot dead in his apartment by an off-duty police officer in 2018. \n\nAt the time, Crockett was a state representative running for her first term in Congress to succeed retiring Democratic US Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson for the District 30 congressional seat later that year.\n\nShe went on to win that race, and has faced no serious challenges since then in her deeply-Democratic Dallas-area district.\n\n'She's now trying to raise her profile by saying all these sensational and inflammatory things, and she probably believes she can say whatever she wants because she's insulated in her deep blue district,' Republican James Rodgers, who she trounced in the general election, told DailyMail.com on Wednesday.\n\nBut the 2022 controversy nearly derailed her.\n\nAnd unlike this week, when she refused to apologize to Governor Abbott, Crockett was pressured into admitting she was wrong at the time. \n\nJean's family accused Crockett of misrepresenting herself as their attorney on her website in a bid to further her political career. \n\n'Botham's name is not an endorsement you can parade, and his legacy is not a sound bite you can use to garner media coverage,' the family wrote in a scathing open letter to Crockett in March 2022. \n\n'For you to misrepresent yourself as one of our attorneys is absolutely disgusting,' the letter added.\n\nJean was fatally shot while eating ice cream in his Dallas apartment in September 2018. Amber Guyger, a 30-year-old Dallas police officer who said she mistook his apartment for her own, was convicted in the killing and sentenced to 10 years in prison. She will be eligible for parole next year.\n\nJean's mother Allison Jean told the Dallas Morning News that Crockett's own campaign website promoted the false narrative.\n\n'I don't like politicians misrepresenting my family, especially my son, who is not here to defend himself, for political mileage,' the mom stated.\n\nAfter being called out for her misrepresentation, Crockett called it a mistake and had the reference removed from her website.\n\nShe issued a statement to the media that 'as a civil rights attorney, I'd never intentionally inflict additional distress upon any family. There may have been confusion about some information on our website which was remedied as quickly as it was brought to our attention.'\n\nBut Botham Jean's mom went further in her interview with the paper, expressing disgust that in a 2020 podcast, Crockett called Botham Jean's father one of her greatest admirers.\n\n'She indicated in her video that my husband is one of her huge fans,' the mom told the publication. \n\n'But that is not true. My husband is not on social media. He doesn't know Jasmine currently, so I don't know how you can be a fan of somebody that he doesn't know.'\n\nThe paper reported that Crockett has had conversations with the father and that they posed together for at least one picture. But the family didn't make any endorsements in the race.\n\nIn the end, the controversy didn't make a difference. \n\nCrockett went on to win a crowded primary race after a runoff against former congressional chief of staff Jane Hamilton, bolstered by a $2million donation from two super PACs affiliated with convicted cryptocurrency king Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nShe then coasted to victory over Rodgers.\n\n'She claimed false glory in a legal case she had nothing to do with, then took $2million in Ponzi scheme money from Sam Bankman-Fried, and that was the end of her primary,' Rodgers told DailyMail.com Wednesday. \n\n'And once you buy the primary in the 30th District, you've pretty much just bought yourself a congressional seat for life.'\n\nCrockett was speaking last weekend at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Los Angeles when she referred to Abbott, who uses a wheel chair, as 'Governor Hot Wheels' – attracting shocked laughter from the crowd.\n\n'Y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there, c'mon now, and the only thing hot about him is that he's a hot a** mess, honey,' she told the cheering audience. \n\nFacing backlash, she later denied she was mocking his disability.\n\n'I wasn't thinking about the governor's condition,' she posted Tuesday on social media.\n\n'I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable,' she wrote.\n\n'Literally, the next line I said was that he was a 'Hot A** Mess,' referencing his terrible policies. 'At no point did I mention or allude to his condition,' she stated.\n\nAbbott said Crockett's comments highlighted the depth of the problems Democrats are facing.\n\n'It's another day and another disaster by the Democrats,' he told Fox's Hannity.\n\n'The reality is they have no vision, no policy. They have nothing to sell but hate, and Americans are not buying it.'\n\nAbbott said it was comments like these which would hold Democrats back as they look to reinvent themselves following Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump.\n\nRepublican Representative Randy Weber was among critics who did not buy Crockett's justification for her words.\n\nHe intends to introduce a censure resolution against Crockett for her 'venomous rhetoric,' he told Fox.\n\nAbbott was left paralyzed from the waist down when he was just 26 years old after a tree fell on him as he was jogging. At the time, he was a recent law school graduate and studying to take the bar exam.\n\nHe is not the only person who has been colorfully insulted by Crockett.\n\nShe referred to Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor-Green as having a 'bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body' and called President Donald Trump 'a vindictive vile villain.","summary":"Democratic firebrand Jasmine Crockett was accused of using the police-involved  death of an unarmed black man for political gain by the victim's family, DailyMail.com can reveal. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14543093/Rep-Jasmine-Crockett-Botham-Jean-death-political-gain-family.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/27/16/96639127-0-image-m-10_1743091894665.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 20:05:05","author":"Editor,Shawn Cohen","authors":["Editor","Shawn Cohen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":304908766,"title":"Trump furthers podcast presidency by inviting hosts to the White House","text":"As the 2024 election drew to a close, Trump dedicated much of his campaign time to podcasting.

He told the Daily Mail he felt Stern long ago abandoned his signature everyman comedy and suburban lifestyle to cozy up to the show business elites from Montauk to Malibu.\n\nThe Mail has spoken to a number of former Stern associates who now believe the star’s ‘Long Island everyman’ shtick was always an act – and one he found easy to shed once celebrities began to show him love. \n\nHere, we track how the radio star’s career fell from having 20 million listeners a day to to figures fans believe are as low as 125,000. \n\n The Daily Mail reached out to Howard Stern’s rep Leslee Dart for comment, as well as SiriusXM for official ratings numbers for the Stern Show. \n\nOne of the King of All Media’s Stern’s fiercest radio rivals, Gregg ‘Opie’ Hughes, claimed he’d be surprised if 200,000 listened to Stern on a regular basis now podcasts dominate. \n\n Hughes, who runs the podcast Opie Radio, said Stern ‘always wanted to be accepted by the Hollywood elite’ and he now firmly believes it was all an ‘act’ when for years he portrayed himself as a Long Island everyman. \n\n‘I believed he lied to his audience all these years and when he felt like he had nothing to lose, finally chose to show his true self,’ he said. \n\nHughes – who Stern reportedly once muzzled from mentioning his name in the early 2000s on the Opie and Anthony show – explained Stern ‘was a fake rebel by convenience because no one wanted him around until he became famous and wealthy’.\n\n‘Stuttering’ John Melendez worked on The Howard Stern Show from 1988 until leaving in 2004 when he took an announcing job on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. \n\nMelendez was best known on the show for asking celebrities humiliating and personal questions (penned by Stern, Jackie ‘The Jokeman’ Martling and Fred Norris) at red carpets, with marketers even showcasing him in materials to promote Stern’s early 90s variety show on WWOR-TV.\n\nMelendez parlayed the clout he got from Stern’s massively popular show in the 90s into a record contract and reality TV stint on ‘I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!’ before landing a spot with Leno. \n\nMelendez’s last days at the show were marked by Stern and his staff ironically labeling him a ‘sellout,’ and mocking his audition tape, despite Stern repeatedly bashing him on the air in a cruel and personal manner, and not paying him a fraction of what NBC and Leno were offering. \n\n‘Howard Stern always wanted to be loved by celebrities,’ said Melendez, who made political headlines in 2018 with a prank call to President Donald Trump that went viral after the Daily Mail was first to publish the shocking story. \n\nHe said Stern – who gave gushing interviews to former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris last year during the election cycle – was never too far in one direction politically, by design. \n\nWhile most in the industry now are aware of Stern’s fixation with the famous, at least one outspoken personality associated with the Stern Show noticed his burning desire to be admired by Hollywood’s elites.\n\nIn November 1994, late comedian and regular guest Pat Cooper launched a tirade where he accused Stern of being blinded by the light of A-list celebrities. \n\nStern made his name as a counterculture show business rebel, but quickly changed his positions when the celebrities he badmouthed accepted him. \n\nCooper cited the late Jackie Mason, Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold as examples of celebs he ended up befriending – a trend that’s continued with Jennifer Aniston, Kathy Lee Gifford, Rosie O’Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres in later years.\n\nIn the 1994 appearance, Cooper went off on Stern after he learned he was set up in a toxic trap during which a trio of listeners would ambush him with accusations of badmouthing Stern while out in New York City.\n\n‘I will not let anyone take my dignity or my pride away – you gotta be in A-company – don’t put me in B-company, I’m A-crowd!’ said Cooper, who died aged 93 in July 2023. Imitating Stern, Cooper said, ‘Roseanne, ‘I hate her, I want her to die’ – now you’re up her a**! Now you’re up her a**! Now you’re up her a**!’\n\nCooper, who made a memorable appearance on Seinfeld in a 1996 episode titled The Friar’s Club, also cited his frustration at Stern’s swelling ego on his rocket ride to fame.\n\nThe outspoken comedian, who appeared on Stern for years before an eventual falling-out, thought it was arrogant for the radio host to pass on late night appearances unless he was the first guest to appear. \n\nCooper in later years said he thought Stern was out of line for allegedly forcing his bosses to impose a gag order on Opie and Anthony.\n\nThe funnyman said it turned out to be a lucrative arrangement for the shock jock pair, who benefitted from the publicity they received as Stern’s most hated rivals.\n\nClark Griswold’s revenge \n\nTwo years before Cooper’s tirade, it was SNL alum Chevy Chase, who found himself in Stern‘s crosshairs, after he badmouthed him in a 1992 Larry King appearance\n\nStern obtained audio of the satellite feed from a listener during a commercial break, as the actor, who played the iconic comedic character Clark Griswold in the National Lampoon‘s Vacation films, said he found the radio host unfunny and obnoxious.\n\nChase called Stern an a**, said he had the ‘brain of an egg timer’ and compared him to media personalities Morton Downey Jr. and Dr. Joyce Brothers.\n\nThe radio star, who had already topped the New York and Philadelphia markets, began trashing Chase on his show and encouraged his listeners to harass him in public by yelling ‘Howard Stern’ at him.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the 1992 incarnation of Stern said that the original SNL cast had turned ‘into a bunch of Hollywood jerks – fat and old and not funny or on the edge or anything. \n\n‘Chevy, be prepared to have your life become very miserable – you have no idea the hornet’s nest you just stepped into,’ Stern said after Chase ripped him. \n\nLegendary late comedian Richard Belzer during an appearance provided Stern with Chase‘s home number, leading to a hysterical confrontation between the stalwart comedy leading man and rising radio superstar, with Chase bluntly telling Stern he didn’t like him and not to call his house again.\n\nStern admitted later on his 2009 SiriusXM special The History of Howard Stern that he was hurt the comedic staple hadn’t accepted him as the hot new player in the world of comedy. \n\n‘It set me off, it made me uncontrollably mad,’ Stern said in the special. ‘I was pissed, here was Chevy Chase sating something really bad about me … I want to be accepted, I want him to say what a great comedian I am – and he wasn’t saying that. \n\nStern continued pestering Chase for years through proxies such as fans and Melendez until the two celebrities found common ground, with Chase making an appearance on the satellite show in September 2008.\n\nStern, comfortable with the détente and impressed by Chase’s fame, invited him to his wedding at New York City’s Le Cirque, which turned out to be a who’s who of New York celebrities.\n\nThey included now-President Donald Trump, John Stamos, Billy Joel and the late Barbara Walters, with Kelly Ripa’s husband Mark Consuelos marrying Howard and Beth. \n\nNot all of Stern’s associates past and present made the cut for the A-list wedding: Both Stern’s longtime head writer Jackie Martling and one-time friend, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider, publicly spoke about their disappointment of being overlooked in favor of more famous faces.\n\nStern might have regretted that when it comes to Chase, who delivered a filthy monologue with graphic sex jokes as a way to get back at Stern for all of the years of harassment. \n\nWhile other guests such as Bubba The Love Sponge were publicly critical of Chevy’s foul conduct, Stern played it off as Hollywood gag between old friends, even though it was clear, Chase was fully getting retribution. \n\nStern said after the wedding, that he and Chase were not ‘great friends,’ but that Chase offered to attend after his appearance on the show and ‘it was fun to have famous guys there too’. \n\nStern later said that Chase ‘didn’t read the room correctly’ – though fans on online forums such as Radio Gunk and Reddit believed Chase knew exactly what he was doing in hijacking the proceedings with his foul-mouthed diatribe. \n\n‘Howard tried hard to get as many A-list people to his wedding as possible,’ said one Reddit user. ‘He doesn’t really have many close friends so this was his way of looking like a big shot. Bit him in the a**!’\n\nStern has used his show to coax other guests, such as SNL lothario Pete Davidson, to badmouth Chase and call him a racist and a bad person.\n\n‘One obvious way to see that Howard is no fan of Chevys is by the fact that Howard has never defended him when he was being attacked in the media & on social media,’ another Reddit user said\n\nThe user added, ‘When Pete Davidson was on, he said something like “f*** Chevy Chase, he’s a racist piece of s***” & Howard didn’t even question that statement.’\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Chase and his reps for further comment. \n\nA listener’s perspective \n\nAn X/Twitter user under the handle @bringbackjackie, who liveblogs The Howard Stern Show as it airs, explained to the Daily Mail how he feels Stern has often ditched the loyal people in his inner circle to rub elbows with the Hollywood and Hamptons elites.\n\n‘Ronnie Mund was a part of Howard’s life for almost 40 years and Stern couldn’t make it to Ronnie’s destination wedding in Vegas, but Hollywood Stern had no issue traveling to Mexico for Justin Theroux’s wedding,’ @bringbackjackie said.\n\nThe social media user noted that while ‘Howard used Covid as an excuse to avoid seeing his co-host Robin Quivers for four years … [he] had no problem meeting up with Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Jon Hamm, and Justin Theroux in some trendy restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn’ called Laser Wolf ‘back in 2022.’\n\nIn the outing, an eyewitness told Page Six, ‘Howard was there without even a mask’ and ‘they all sat at a large table, [as] Howard was seated next to Jimmy and also at one point seemed to be in deep conversation with Jon Hamm.’\n\nThe X/Twitter user said that ‘Howard Stern insisting that he hasn’t gone Hollywood is as believable as his claims that he doesn’t have a hair system, or his insistence that the Stern Show broadcast from his home studio is a radio show and not a podcast.’\n\nDespite the maskless celeb dinner months before, Stern again cited his fear of COVID-19 as reason to not go to the March 2023 wedding of longtime limo driver and security head Mund.\n\nWhen the show’s Chris Wilding asked him if he would attend the event – which was not expected to have an amplified celebrity presence – Stern said, ‘Probably not – I’m worried about Covid.’\n\nBut just a few months later, in July of 2023, Howard’s Covid concerns appeared to dissipate when the people involved were fellow celebrities.\n\nIn pictures posted on Beth Stern’s Instagram, maskless celebs including Brooke Shields, Ali Wentworth, Mary McCormack, Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Bon Jovi gathered in Stern’s Hamptons house. \n\nStern at the time put on a special show from his home, where he has predominantly broadcast from the past five years due to what he claims are Covid concerns.","summary":"Howard Stern is facing fresh criticism from former staff who say the radio&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/howard-sterns-decline-to-unimportant-elderly-figure-influenced-by-the-hollywood-celebrities-he-is-fixated-on/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 19:41:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.354},{"id":304899090,"title":"Friday essay: from Watergate to Zippergate to Pussygate – how a shameless Trump has reshaped the US presidential sex scandal","text":"In modern times, who was the first presidential candidate to have their campaign almost destroyed by a sex scandal? \n\nThe answer, surprisingly, is Jimmy Carter, probably the most pious of all recent presidents. In 1976, when ahead in the polls, Carter gave an interview to Playboy magazine. He said he had looked on a lot of women with lust, “committed adultery in [his] heart many times”, and he would not be condescending to someone who had “screwed” around.\n\nSupport among evangelical Christians immediately eroded. Prominent Christian evangelist Jerry Falwell said, “four months ago most of the people I know were pro-Carter. Today that has totally reversed.” Fortunately for Carter, after an intense week or so, the scandal faded.\n\nMorality was much more explicitly an issue in the 1976 election than previously. It was the first election since the Watergate scandal had forced Richard Nixon to become the first president in American history to resign in 1974. It was also the year after America’s long and contentious war in Vietnam had finished in defeat, with many Americans feeling they had been lied to by presidents Nixon and Lyndon Johnson.\n\nAn ironic after-effect of Watergate was belated attention to President John F. Kennedy’s sex scandals. Until then, for many decades, American presidents’ private lives had been off limits. Franklin D. Roosevelt had two long-term lovers and his wife Eleanor probably had a live-in lesbian lover. Roosevelt used a wheelchair, due to polio-related paralysis. Yet of 35,000 photos of him, only two showed his wheelchair. Most of the American public were ignorant of his condition.\n\nNeither Kennedy nor Johnson were probed during their presidencies. (One night on Johnson’s ranch a female aide was woken by a man standing at the foot of the bed: “Move over, this is your president.”) \n\nOne source of the new attention was a tragedy involving Senator Edward Kennedy. In July 1969, Kennedy drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. He swam to safety but his companion, young staffer Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. He immediately made many phone calls, but only called the police the next day. Many journalists knew of Kennedy’s affairs, drunkenness, tendency to speed and general recklessness, but nothing had been published.\n\nA few years later, a decade after his death, President John F. Kennedy himself was in the public spotlight. After Watergate and defeat in Vietnam, a Senate committee under Frank Church was tasked to investigate American security agencies’ involvement in the assassination and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders. This revealed that Kennedy and Chicago Mafia boss, Sam Giancana, had the same mistress, Judith Campbell. Moreover, Giancana had been hired by the CIA in an assassination plot against Cuban president Fidel Castro.\n\nAt first, Church, a Democrat and friend of the Kennedys, treated the revelations with as much discretion as he could. But a New York Times columnist, ex-Nixon speechwriter William Safire, waged a campaign that argued journalists were pro-Democrat and went softer on Democrat scandals than on Republican ones. It was the opening of the floodgates. Over many years, more and more revelations of Kennedy’s sexual exploits were revealed. Indeed his relentless promiscuity makes Bill Clinton look like a choirboy.\n\nThe next time a sex scandal figured prominently was the 1988 presidential contest. Gary Hart already had a reputation for “womanising”, and at one stage challenged journalists to follow him. Unfortunately for him, they did. He and a young woman, Donna Rice, spent a night aboard the inauspiciously named yacht Monkey Business. Hart went from Democratic front runner to ex-candidate in less than a week.\n\nA Bush denial and ‘bimbo eruptions’\n\nBill Clinton’s 1992 election campaign brought a huge escalation in attention to a candidate’s private life. It was the first time a person had publicly claimed to have had an affair with a presidential candidate. Gennifer Flowers said she had had a 12-years-long affair with Clinton. Flowers admitted she had been paid more than US$100,000 to go public, and her account included many lurid details.\n\nClinton denied the affair but his recall of events seemed uncharacteristically hazy. (And six years later, he would admit they had a sexual encounter.) He was greatly helped by the prominent role his wife Hillary played. They admitted without giving any specifics that there had been difficulties in their marriage but stressed how these were all in the past. Eventually, in the absence of new developments, the scandal ran out of steam.\n\nNevertheless, throughout the campaign, the Clinton team had a “bimbo eruption watch”, and although several claims arose and Clinton often seemed evasive, he won the election relatively easily.\n\nSome Democrats in 1992 thought there had been a double standard with intense attention to Clinton’s sexual escapades contrasting with the lack of media attention to allegations of George H.W. Bush having had an affair, rumours that had been around since the early 1980s.\n\nBut the two were very different – there was no publicity-seeking by an ex-lover or admissions by the Bushes. When the rumours began to circulate in 1988, George Junior asked his father about them and then issued a short statement: “The answer to the Big A [ie adultery] question is NO”. Although his father was apparently angered by this public intervention, it effectively killed the issue.\n\nLikewise later there were rumours that the Republican candidate in 1996, Bob Dole, had had an affair, but it was a long time in the past, and received minimal coverage. \n\nIn 2008, it was known that John McCain, a war hero, and his wife lived largely separate lives. But his opponent Barack Obama did not seek to make it an issue, and again there was almost no coverage. While it is often argued that the media have salacious appetites for sex scandals, cases like these also show the media is reluctant to push allegations where there is not clear evidence, and no public interest or political dimension.\n\nNothing thus far had prepared anyone for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Lewinsky had been an intern in the White House and had had consensual sexual relations with Clinton. She confided in a colleague, Linda Tripp, who then started taping their telephone calls. \n\nLater Tripp gave the tapes to special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Whitewater property deals by the Clintons in Arkansas. He found no evidence of wrongdoing in that case, and now broadened his scope to include perjury, finding that Clinton had lied about his relations with Lewinsky. Thanks to Tripp’s tape and Starr’s investigations, the public were treated to details such as Lewinsky’s stained dress.\n\nThe story broke in early 1998 and the Zippergate scandal as it was dubbed, received intense news coverage for most of the year. Clinton gave a series of misleading denials, and eventually confessed. It led to an impeachment by the House of Representatives but the motion failed in the Senate, and Clinton survived.\n\nThe scandal may have had an effect on the extremely close 2000 presidential election. The Democrat candidate Al Gore, who had been Clinton’s vice-president, sought to distance himself from the Clintons. Even after all that had happened, though, the Clintons were still fairly popular, and were an electoral asset Gore could have used more.\n\nThe two Obama elections were broadly scandal free, but this was the quiet before the storm.\n\nHow Trump rewrote conventional wisdom\n\nDonald Trump has rewritten the conventional wisdom of American presidential sex scandals. Most importantly, Trump is the first president where sexual harassment and assault have been so central. Whereas Kennedy’s affairs, for instance, seem to have been overwhelmingly consensual, in a “hot mic” from 2005 (released during his 2016 presidential campaign), Trump was heard saying “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything […] Grab ‘em by the pussy.”\n\nWhat became known as Pussygate looked as if it might sink Trump’s candidacy, but for a variety of reasons, not least the FBI’s public announcement that it was investigating more possible email offences by Clinton, eventually Trump triumphed.\n\nThe second notable feature of the Trump sex scandals is their sheer number. In October 2019, a book All the President’s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy contained allegations by 43 women of sexual misconduct by Trump.\n\nTrump is the first presidential candidate to be convicted in a civil court of sexual assault. The writer E. Jean Carroll testified – and a jury unanimously agreed – that Trump pushed her up against a wall and assaulted her.\n\nTrump is also the first presidential candidate in modern times to be associated with paying hush money to cover up sexual relationships, most famously to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, and also to a lift attendant in the Trump Tower.\n\nFinally – despite or because of all this – he is the first presidential candidate in modern times to directly accuse his opponents of immoral sexual behaviour. Speaking of his two female opponents, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, he said, “Funny how blow jobs impacted both their careers differently”. His supporters had banners saying “Say No to the Hoe”. (Earlier in 2024 Trump and his supporters had been spreading the claim that Biden was “all jacked up” on drugs, and demanded a drug test before the first debate.)\n\nTrump’s verbal attacks on women often have a particularly bitter edge, but they are part of the new coarseness and violence that mark his rhetoric from his predecessors, as are the vituperative personal attacks on whomever his opponent is – judge, prosecutor, journalist, bureaucrat or political opponent.\n\nTrump’s shamelessness was on display days after the “Pussygate” revelations in 2016. For the second presidential debate, he wanted to have in his “family box” three women who had made accusations against Bill Clinton, and one who was sexually assaulted as a 12-year-old, with Hillary Clinton as the public defender representing the suspect. The idea was to throw Hillary off her stride and damage her performance. The debate organisers stopped the move. As a fallback an hour before the debate, Trump had a media conference with the four, attacking the Clintons. \n\nAn evangelical about face\n\nWhat a wondrous trajectory America’s white evangelical Christians have been on. In 1976, they were shocked that a candidate had lust in his heart. In 2024, around 80% of them voted for a serial sexual predator, a liar and fraudster. \n\nAt one rally, a donor told the crowd, “Donald J. Trump is the person that God has chosen.” The evangelicals have indeed shown Trump amazing grace.\n\nOne reason Trump was able to survive this surfeit of potential scandals is because of the much more polarised media environment now. Much of Trump’s base consume media such as Fox News, which is willing to ignore or downplay his outrages. \n\nIn addition, podcasts played a bigger role in 2024 than in any previous election, and some of these, such as Joe Rogan’s, have audiences that are overwhelmingly young males, perhaps helping Trump mobilise the “bro vote”. In 2000 against Biden, 41% of young men aged 18–29 voted for Trump; in 2024 against Harris, 49% did; an eight-point gain for Trump.\n\nRecently, Trump joked with an audience:\n\nyou used to be able to say a young beautiful waitress but […] if you call a woman beautiful today, it is the end of your political career, so I will not do it.\n\nIn fact, his career shows the exact opposite. He has survived all sorts of moral transgressions, which earlier would have been politically fatal.\n\nGiven Trump’s invulnerability despite his multiple and serious transgressions, does this mark the end of presidential sexual scandals having a dramatic impact? \n\nThere has never been a direct, simple or logical relationship in political scandals between the seriousness of the alleged offence, the amount of media attention and the severity of the political consequences. However, we’re now post-Trump: what might a presidential sex scandal look like in 2028 and beyond?","summary":"In 1976, America’s white evangelical Christians were shocked a candidate had lust in his heart.

Firm lawyers were barred from meeting with government employees or entering government buildings; firm clients were at risk of having their government contracts revoked. If the edict stood, Karp believed it would destroy the hundred-and-fifty-year-old firm, an enterprise that Karp had helped build into a behemoth with $2.6 billion in annual revenue, more than a thousand lawyers, and hefty profits per partner of $7.5 million. In an attempt to find an entrée to the White House, he had enlisted Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a close friend of Trump’s, to secure a Presidential audience. After Kraft assured the President that Paul, Weiss was willing to pledge millions in pro-bono legal work and to make other concessions, Trump was prepared to grant the meeting. He invited Karp to the White House.\nAnd so ensued a remarkable session in the Oval Office. For more than ninety minutes, beginning around 8:30 A.M. on Wednesday, Karp met with the President of the United States; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; Steven Witkoff, the President’s Middle East envoy; and Boris Epshteyn, Trump’s outside legal counsel. Patched into the meeting by phone from New York was Robert Giuffra, the co-chair of Sullivan & Cromwell, one of Paul, Weiss’s major competitors. Giuffra had been recently hired by Trump to represent him in the appeal of his conviction on thirty-four counts of falsifying business records. Now Giuffra was drafted to help negotiate the terms of an agreement.\nTrump was friendly toward Karp, effusive even, saying that he had heard “nice things” about the lawyer. There were fifteen minutes of golf talk, with the President reminiscing about playing with Tiger Woods and Gary Player, and musing about how his Turnberry course, in Scotland, should host the British Open. Trump then launched into a lengthy soliloquy about how the law had been weaponized against him and the role of law firms in that unfair treatment. He complained, in particular, about Mark Pomerantz, a former Paul, Weiss partner who at one point led the Manhattan District Attorney’s criminal investigation of Trump—and who was cited by name in the executive order. “Work this out,” Trump instructed the group as the session concluded. “Let’s get a deal done.”\nBy the end of the day on Thursday, the parties, negotiating back and forth by e-mail, had reached what was, for Paul, Weiss, the equivalent of a plea bargain;\nTrump posted what he said were its terms on his Truth Social website. But this was a deal without an underlying offense: the firm had done nothing wrong, except in Trump’s mind. Even worse, it was a deal to undo a flagrantly unconstitutional order, one that punished the firm for taking legal positions hostile to Trump and for representing clients he did not like. Swallowing it should go down like acid. A spokesperson for Paul, Weiss declined to comment. The White House, when asked for comment, defended the order. The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote, “President Trump is delivering on his promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence.”\nThe stakes here are bigger than the survival of a single firm, even one as iconic as Paul, Weiss. Trump and his allies are engaged in a methodical war against the legal profession, from law schools to the private bar, from the Justice Department to the federal judiciary. Their goal is not only to exact retribution against perceived enemies—although, for Trump, vengeance is never far from top of mind—but to intimidate others who might dare to resist. The Paul, Weiss deal—and the studied silence of other law firms who have refused to speak out against other recent orders—offers an alarming illustration of how impressively the campaign is succeeding. “If law firms can be cowed this easily, then they don’t deserve to be law firms,” John Keker, a veteran San Francisco lawyer whose firm has been one of the few willing to publicly denounce the executive orders, told me. “I can understand why people would be scared of losing clients,” Keker added. “What I don’t understand is why they think putting their heads in the sand is going to be better in the long run.”\nSome of Karp’s counterparts at other firms are sympathetic to this position. Many more, based on conversations I’ve had with dozens of lawyers in the past several days, are livid at what they see as a craven sellout—one that is particularly galling given the firm’s comfortable position near the top of the heap of Big Law profitability. Clients might leave and lucrative practice groups defect to rival firms, this argument goes, but surely Paul, Weiss could survive a few lean years—its profits per partner, say, plummeting to a mere two million dollars—in the service of standing up to Trump. “There’s no way that Paul, Weiss would have gone under,” one former partner told me.\nFor many attorneys, the episode encapsulates a lamentable shift in their roles, in which a profession that once embraced the lofty obligation to do good for society has degraded into another grubby enterprise focussed on profits. A letter signed by ninety former Paul, Weiss associates and other employees deplored the “permanent stain on the face of a great firm that sought to gain a profit by forfeiting its soul.” (I was a summer associate there in 1983.)\nWhether the Paul, Weiss agreement was a wise compromise or shameful capitulation, the lesson is unavoidable: if a powerhouse like Paul, Weiss cannot, or will not, stand up to Trump, then no firm can. And, if there was any hope that subduing Paul, Weiss might have slaked Trump’s desire to punish firms, it was quickly extinguished with a new order directing the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to pursue sanctions “against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.” (This is rich coming from the man who has perfected the art of vexatious litigation; in 2023, a federal judge called Trump “the mastermind of strategic abuse of the judicial process.”) Trump followed up, on Tuesday, with an order against another firm that drew his ire, the Chicago-based firm Jenner & Block.\nNo firm weighing whether to represent a client that has crossed Trump or whether to file a lawsuit against the Administration can afford to ignore these developments. Even before the spate of executive orders, firms were skittish about finding themselves at odds with the new Administration. Now they are terrified, and lining up their own outside counsel. Trump could be coming for them next. On Monday, when the President was asked about his orders against law firms, he made his position clear: firms were to submit to his will. “I just think the law firms have to behave themselves,” he said.\nThe next firm targeted was Perkins Coie, based in Seattle and with a long history of representing Democratic Party entities and candidates. In 2016, as part of its work for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign, the firm commissioned what came to be known as the Steele dossier, an opposition-research report into the then candidate Trump’s ties to Russia. Trump sued Perkins Coie over the Steele dossier, in 2022, and lost, but he is not one to drop a grudge. The Perkins executive order, issued on March 6th, claimed that “the dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm . . . has affected this country for decades,” and went on to invoke the dossier.\nThe Perkins Coie executive order was far more egregious than the one directed against Covington. It not only suspended security clearances for the firm’s lawyers but also barred Perkins Coie employees from entering government buildings or meeting with government officials “when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.” Even more draconian, it instructed agencies to terminate contracts held by Perkins Coie clients.\n“The Order is not just an attempt to constrain or weaken Perkins Coie; its objective is to destroy the Firm,” its lawyers argued in a request for an emergency order suspending most of the edict. “Unless restrained, the Order realistically might succeed in that objective within days.” Perkins Coie’s fifteen highest-billing clients or their affiliates all regularly bid for government contracts. In an affidavit, the partner David Burman said that a major government contractor had already withdrawn its work from Perkins Coie, and that a federal official had informed a client that its Perkins Coie lawyers should not attend a meeting. “The client,” Burman wrote, “after expressing great reluctance and regret, said it was forced to hire other law firms to represent it before the federal government.”\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell quickly blocked the order from taking effect, concluding that it appeared to violate a suite of constitutional protections, including free speech, due process, and the right to counsel. The Administration’s arguments that the President can take action against any entity he deems to be acting against the national interest “sends little chills down my spine,” Howell told Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff to Attorney General Bondi, who had been dispatched to argue the case, a remarkable use of a senior official’s time. Trump, she said, appeared to be “using taxpayer dollars and government resources . . . to pursue what is a wholly personal vendetta.” (The Trump Justice Department has demanded that Howell step aside from the case, saying she “repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the president.” Howell refused.)\nAs the lawsuit proceeds, it is hard to imagine appellate judges—even the Supreme Court’s current conservative super-majority—concluding that the order passes constitutional muster. But it is also difficult to see how Perkins Coie does not emerge grievously damaged. Some clients, new and existing, may be steering business its way in appalled solidarity. Still, clients with issues before the government have to think twice before hiring Perkins Coie. Any corporate general counsel would have a difficult time explaining why retaining Perkins Coie would be in the best interest of shareholders. (A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment.)\n“Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles,” the order stated. “Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly ‘for the public good’—potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.”\nThis argument turns the concept of pro-bono work on its head. A law firm taking on pro-bono representation of a criminal defendant, or a migrant on the verge of being deported, reflects attorneys fulfilling their professional responsibility to represent those unable to pay; in Trump’s reductionist universe, it is making communities less safe. When a firm helps challenge a law that curtails voting rights, it is adhering to the American Bar Association’s advice that firms should represent those “seeking to secure or protect civil rights”; for Trump, it is helping to rig elections.\nAs always with Trump, there were specific, grudge-based grievances. The Paul, Weiss order noted, although it did not cite her by name, that the partner Jeannie Rhee—perhaps not coincidentally, a top prosecutor in the office of the special counsel Robert Mueller—had provided pro-bono help to the D.C. attorney general in a civil lawsuit against the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and others involved in the January 6th insurrection. (The lawsuit was dropped a few days after Trump issued the Paul, Weiss order.)\nThe order also singled out Pomerantz, the former Paul, Weiss partner who joined the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, in late 2020, to help oversee the criminal investigation into Trump’s business dealings and personal finances. He quit a little over a year later in frustration, asserting that it was a “grave failure of justice” not to charge Trump, and wrote a book laying out the case against him. (Trump ultimately was indicted and convicted, although on a different theory than the one that Pomerantz had endorsed.) In short, Trump went after Paul, Weiss for a prosecution that a lawyer who was no longer with the firm had never brought.\nPaul, Weiss presented a juicy target for Trump. Of the major New York firms, its profile was the most decidedly Democratic. A history on the firm’s website notes that it was “the first major New York City firm to break down the barrier of Jews practicing with Gentiles, the first to hire a Black associate, the first to hire a Black female associate, the first to make a woman a partner.” The Democratic Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson was a firm lawyer, as was John F. Kennedy’s adviser Theodore Sorensen. Current partners include two leading members of the Obama Administration: the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.\nThe firm has a rich tradition of pro-bono work—from helping overturn the convictions of several of the Scottsboro Boys to representing McCarthy-era targets such as J. Robert Oppenheimer to bringing a landmark case that helped establish the right to same-sex marriage. During Trump’s first term, Paul, Weiss proudly joined litigation to combat the Administration’s family-separation policies. Karp co-wrote an opinion piece in the Times decrying the cruel policy and trumpeting the role of lawyers in fighting it. “We’re reuniting families destroyed by the administration,” Karp told the Times for a separate article, which reported that around seventy-five lawyers at the firm were working on that project.\nIn 2024, Paul Weiss didn’t soft-pedal its liberal leanings. Karen Dunn, the co-chair of the litigation department, oversaw debate preparation for the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Karp became a leader of Harris’s fund-raising efforts, waving off concerns about a backlash if Trump were to win. “Each of us needs to do what we believe is right, whatever the consequences,” Karp said. “That has always been my mantra in leading Paul, Weiss.”\nThen came Trump’s Inauguration, and a torrent of executive orders. Public-interest groups challenging these orders found that private firms that were eager to sign on to pro-bono litigation during the first term were reluctant this time around. Paying clients knew how vindictive Trump could be and didn’t want to antagonize him, even if no one imagined that a tactic quite as effective as the executive orders would soon be deployed.\nIt quickly became clear that the firms would not be willing to protect one another, either, against an Administration determined to terrorize Big Law. Ultimately, Williams & Connolly—a Washington firm whose practice is heavy on litigation rather than corporate transactions—agreed to take Perkins Coie’s case. In a sign of the wary times, Howell, the U.S. district judge, went out of her way at the hearing in which she froze the order to praise Williams & Connolly as “a very brave law firm, to take this on.”\nMeanwhile, an effort to recruit firms to join a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Perkins Coie confronted a collective-action problem. Leading law firms, including Paul, Weiss, expressed tentative willingness to sign on to the brief—but only if enough of their peers agreed to put themselves out there, as well, and few were willing to make a definitive commitment. These delicate negotiations were already faltering when Paul, Weiss reached its separate agreement with the Administration.\nOnce, firms had been small and clubby, a place where partners practiced together for life. Now they were behemoths, with partners flitting from firm to firm, and taking clients along with them. If anyone understood the economic realities of a twenty-first-century law firm, it was Karp. Since becoming chairman of Paul, Weiss, in 2008, he had presided over its transformation, shifting the firm’s focus from litigation to the constant stream of revenue produced by corporate dealmaking. “In order for us to make sure that we will endure . . . we had to increase our transactional footprint,” Karp told colleagues at his first “state of the union” address as chair. That was not going to happen “organically,” with homegrown talent, Karp said on a legal podcast last year. He needed to go shopping, poaching lawyers from rivals such as Kirkland & Ellis and Cravath, Swaine & Moore.\nThe hiring spree paid off, with a surge in the firm’s revenue and in profits per partner—even as the new cadre of rainmakers took home salaries in the range of twenty million dollars. But with that came a discernible shift in the firm’s culture, and in the balance of power between the corporate and litigation departments. In 2024, the firm shifted to a “black box” compensation system, in which partners no longer know what their colleagues are making, on the theory that less transparency will reduce tension. Likewise, the firm, following the lead of many others, created a new, lesser tier of partner—so-called non-equity partners. This metamorphosis may have been good for the bottom line, but in the view of many Paul, Weiss veterans it took a toll on culture. This was less a partnership than a business, and the corporate lawyers held the reins.\nKarp called an emergency Zoom meeting of the partners for Saturday morning. Clients were already starting to worry—and flee. Steven Schwartz, a New Jersey technology-company executive accused of paying bribes in India, had fired the firm, which had represented him for years, because, as Paul, Weiss lawyers told the judge in the case, Schwartz was “concerned that Paul, Weiss’s ongoing involvement in the matter could in and of itself prejudice the review of his case.” (Schwartz has pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges.)\nThe partner Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate specialist in the Washington office, started drafting a lawsuit. But litigation was only the fallback, in case the firm failed to find a way to get Trump’s attention. Karp also brought in Quinn Emanuel—a firm that, like Williams & Connolly, is famed for its hard-charging litigation. Quinn Emanuel also had something Williams & Connolly didn’t: ties to Trumpworld. Its co-managing partner, William Burck, who agreed to represent Paul, Weiss, was brought in by Eric Trump at the start of Trump’s second term to be the ethics adviser to the President’s company, and he has represented others close to Trump, including Steve Bannon. Burck and his partner Alex Spiro have represented New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams. While Kraft, the Patriots owner, reached out to the President, Burck touched base with people in the offices of the chief of staff and the White House counsel.\nAfter the Oval Office session, the lawyers got to work, trading draft terms by e-mail, text, and telephone. They dickered over the size of the pro-bono commitment, an effort to insert what one source familiar with the negotiations described as “Trumpy language,” and whether the order would be suspended, as the White House team wanted, or rescinded, as Paul, Weiss preferred. (It was rescinded.) The eventual agreement consisted, in part, of innocuous boilerplate. “Paul, Weiss agrees that the bedrock principle of American Justice is that it must be fair and nonpartisan for all,” one such section read.\nOther aspects were more disconcerting, implying that the Administration would have a role in overseeing firm affairs. “Paul, Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, and will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies,” the White House version of the agreement read. “As part of its commitment, it will engage experts, to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days, to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.” (The Paul, Weiss summary of the agreement omitted any outright renunciation of D.E.I.) The firm’s promise to finance pro-bono activities specified that it would “support the Administration’s initiatives, including: assisting our Nation’s veterans, fairness in the Justice System, the President’s Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.” To read this was to wonder: When did the President become the boss of Paul, Weiss?\nBut the most appalling aspect of the episode involved the treatment of Pomerantz, the well-liked former partner who’d had the brass to investigate Trump. In his Truth Social post—and, more significant, in his official order revoking the decree—the President asserted that Karp “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of Pomerantz. Whether Karp made such an acknowledgment is the subject of intense dispute. The Paul, Weiss summary of the agreement did not contain any such admission of “wrongdoing,” and Karp insisted to a person who was not present at the meeting that he did nothing to denigrate Pomerantz or to indicate acceptance of Trump’s criticism. Still, a person familiar with the meeting said that Karp pointed out to the President that Pomerantz had not been formally associated with the firm for years. (He didn’t note that Paul, Weiss was representing Pomerantz in matters relating to his work for the Manhattan District Attorney and his book on Trump.) A second person familiar with the meeting insisted, “Everything in the President’s statement is completely and totally factual.” Certainly, Karp, in the context of pleading for his law firm’s life, was not about to defend Pomerantz and antagonize the President.\nWhen the Truth Social post came out, Paul, Weiss registered its objections to the White House, only to be told there was nothing to be done. The firm made no public comment—and Pomerantz’s peers were furious. “Are we in effect now muzzled, and we’re not going to be saying anything for fear that we’ll be targeted once again?” one former partner asked. “I’m assuming they just want to keep their heads down. I think it’s quite troubling. I wonder if the Paul, Weiss of ten years ago would have done this, and I want to believe the answer is no.”\nPomerantz, for his part, took the high road. “I do not believe that Brad Karp or Paul, Weiss ‘acknowledged’ any ‘wrongdoing’ on my part,” he said in a statement provided to The New Yorker. “They know, and I know, that my efforts to prosecute Donald Trump were entirely lawful. What matters is not what the President is saying about me, but what he is doing to crush opposition from anyone who disagrees with him about anything.”\nAnother potential problem for the firm surfaced on Tuesday, when Isaac Stanley-Becker, of The Atlantic, reported that Paul, Weiss “severed ties with the nation’s oldest and largest Latino civil-rights organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens.” LULAC’s C.E.O., Juan Proaño, told me that he received a call this past Thursday morning from a Paul, Weiss lawyer, informing him that the firm, which had previously done pro-bono work for LULAC, could no longer represent the organization, which has challenged Trump’s attempt to revoke birthright citizenship. “Clearly, looking at it, they were basically under some pressure to disengage from certain types of representation,” Proaño said, of Paul, Weiss. After the Atlantic article appeared, Paul, Weiss backpedalled. “We are proud to represent them in this matter, look forward to future representations, and have enormous respect for their work,” Karp said in a statement on LULAC. But the encounter suggested a disturbing willingness to back away from clients who might be disfavored by the White House.\nIn the short term, Karp may have done the right thing for his firm, if at enormous personal cost. Yet, whatever the deal means for Paul, Weiss, its acquiescence to Trump marks a sad day for the legal profession—or what once was a profession, and is now just another business. It marks an even sadder day for the rule of law, which can only be vindicated when there are lawyers fearless enough to stand up for it, no matter the price. ♦","summary":"The President has two goals: to seek revenge and to intimidate lawyers challenging his agenda.

That’s a very big deal, and while the president insists this hefty import tax on cars is going to be good for “anybody who has plants in the United States”, his move – like a car in desperate need of a tune-up – could easily backfire.\n\nNearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported, and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say. Domestic auto producers will be able to jack up their sticker prices because the new tariffs will make US automakers face considerably less price competition from imported cars. This expected sticker shock could anger America’s inflation-weary consumers and voters, especially since candidate Trump had pledged to battle to bring down prices. These higher car prices could cause a quick drop in auto sales in the US, and that could translate into a downturn in auto production, too.\n\nTrump’s big hope, as well as the United Auto Workers’ big hope, is that the tariffs will encourage automakers – especially GM, Ford and Stellantis (the successor company to Chrysler) – to bring lots of their car production back into the US long term. Shawn Fain, the UAW’s president applauded Trump “for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades”. Fain, an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris, added: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”\n\nThe UAW has been one of the leading critics of the three-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). That union warned that the agreement would do grievous damage to US manufacturing by giving Mexico, a country with far lower wages, free access to the US market. The UAW cautioned that Nafta would be a boon for profit-hungry US corporations, but a bane for US factory workers. The UAW proved correct about that. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs because of Nafta. (Stellantis makes several models of its Ram pick-up truck in Mexico, while GM makes the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox there.)\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Fain said: “With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months.” But many industry experts are dubious about that, in effect saying that the UAW should be careful what it wishes for. Trump’s aggressive trade war as well as his on-again, off-again deployment of tariffs has badly shaken consumer and corporate confidence, caused stock markets to tumble and made many economists warn that the strong economy Trump inherited from Biden could sink into recession.\n\nSlumping consumer confidence, together with soaring sticker prices, could take a serious bite out of US car sales and cause production to sink. In an unhappy forecast, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, said that as a result of Trump’s auto tariffs, US plants would churn out 20,000 fewer cars per week, about a 30% drop compared with before Trump imposed the tariffs. “By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Smoke said in a Wednesday conference call with clients and journalists. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”\n\nAs for Trump’s dream that his tariffs will result in far more domestic auto production long term, that could prove elusive. During Trump’s two months back in office, he has disconcerted and discombobulated corporate executives by sowing uncertainty and instability – by his and Elon Musk’s tearing up of the federal government; by his repeatedly flouting federal law and the constitution; and by his imposing tariffs one day, then suspending them the next day, and then reimposing them a few days later. Moreover, Trump has executives fearing an economic downturn, with his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying Trump’s policies are “worth it” even if they cause a recession.\n\nWhen CEOs are feeling so uncertain due to Trump’s volatility, capriciousness and antics – as well has him changing his mind every few days on trade policy – that Trump-induced sense of instability means auto executives are unlikely to do what Trump wants: to rush to invest a billion or two to build a new auto plant. If Trump and his team had gone about imposing tariffs with a far steadier hand and had made their case in a more thoughtful, non-Trumpian way, then many executives would be far more open to building auto plants and other plants in the US in response to tariffs.\n\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that Trump’s auto tariffs could backfire badly. In a statement, the chamber said: “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”\n\nTrump’s sudden announcement on auto tariffs will certainly help him in one way – it made tariffs the nation’s lead news story and pushed to the side those hard-hitting stories about the Trump administration’s acutely embarrassing leak on bombing Yemen. On the other side of the ledger, the tariffs will hurt Trump and the US in a profound way. By imposing a 25% tariff on auto imports from Canada and Mexico, Trump, many trade experts say, is blatantly violating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. (Trump once called it the “best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA”.) Brad Setser, an expert on global trade at the Council of Foreign Relations, said this breach of the USMCA would hurt the US’s credibility and “may raise questions about the value of any future deals Trump signs”.\n\nFor decades, the UAW has been right about the need for Washington to do more to prevent the loss of manufacturing jobs (and to help those workers who lost their factory jobs). But with Trump, the UAW seems to be betting on an unsteady, capricious – and anti-union – general to win a trade war, but as veteran racetrack bettors will tell you, unsteady horses rarely win the race.\n\n Steven Greenhouse is a labor reporter.","summary":"Nearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say\n\nAfter two months of flip-flopping on tariffs, imposing them one day and often suspending them the next, Donald Trump gunned the accelerator of his trade war on Wednesday by announcing a 25% tariff on autos and auto parts imported into the United States.

In an interview with The New York Times' Ezra Klein, he carefully explained that the Republican Party under President Donald Trump has benefitted from a massive shift of young people into the GOP column.\n\nHistorically, young voters tend to be more liberal than older Americans, and so these GOP gains are quite astounding—particularly among young men. Vice President Kamala Harris actually lost black male 18-year-olds, according to Shor. Overall, voters age 26 and under broke for Trump.\n\nI wrote an op-ed for the New York Post explaining some of the reasons for this shift. One major factor is that Trump has transformed himself from a cable news and reality TV star—a medium of boomer communication—into a figure of the young-male-dominated podcasting universe.\n\nThe 2024 Trump campaign correctly surmised that it would need to reach voters who reside outside retirement communities, and that long-form podcast appearances would play to Trump's strengths and moreover, the key podcasting personalities — Joe Rogan, Theo Von and others — have come to evince a right-wing sensibility, if not exactly conservative politics. Their vibe is \"Barstool conservatism,\" a phrase coined by the writer Matthew Walther to describe an ethos that is culturally libertarian — i.e., you won't find much opposition to gay marriage and abortion in such circles — and yet decidedly Republican in that it is wholly opposed to the hectoring, self-righteous tone of elite progressivism.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that the Democratic Party has been in thrall to a cultural vibe that is maximally off-putting to young dudes:\n\nThe MeToo movement, the rise of wokeness, and the enforcement of cancel culture identified some true bad actors, but also spiraled out of control, resulting in a general atmosphere of persecution against young men.… Is it any wonder, then, that young men have sought solace in media environments where sports and fitness are well-liked and encouraged? Where free speech is celebrated and political correctness is attacked? Where it's OK to tell raunchy jokes and think girls are attractive (and say so)? And, importantly, where Trump is cast as a supportive figure?\n\nRead the full op-ed here.\n\nA vibe is a hard thing to pin down; obviously, Democratic politicians are not introducing legislation that calls out toxic masculinity or disparages UFC, so it's somewhat difficult to explain why it's the case that Democrats are stuck with this terrible branding. Yet stuck they are. It's why Rogan, the archetypical media figure who appeals to young right-leaning males, went from being a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) in 2020 to an outright Trump voter in 2024. The vibes are off.\n\nOf course, it's not all vibes. There should be no doubt that the Democratic Party's prominent association with some of the worst policy choices of the last 10 years—from the perspectives of young people—is radicalizing Gen Z in a rightward direction. The Democrats, for instance, are the party that was much more closely associated with COVID-19 lockdowns, mandates, and importantly, school closures, which significantly disrupted the social lives of young people and clearly had severely negative consequences for their mental health and future prospects. (The journalist David Zweig has a fascinating book coming out on this subject in April.)\n\nDemocrats are also the party that is more protective of entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. It's become prevailing wisdom to assert that saying anything even remotely suggestive of entitlement cuts is political suicide; Republicans are constantly reminded that these programs generally poll well. However, I have to wonder whether this emerging age gap in politics is an expression of the fact that young people have grown more cognizant of what they are asked to sacrifice for the elderly. Meanwhile, disastrous big government policies have made more expensive so many things that young people need, particularly housing and child care.\n\nI suspect Gen Z has become resentful of this massive transfer of wealth from younger, poorer Americans to older, wealthier Americans. And I suspect this dynamic is really undermining the Democrats' overtures to the kids.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI'm joined by Amber Duke to discuss Signalgate, due process and deportations, whether food stamps should subsidize junk food, and one Democrat's insulting \"Hot Wheels\" comment.\n\nWorth Watching\n\nIn the last two or three years, I have played or replayed basically every major Legend of Zelda title. The one exception was The Wind Waker, released on the Nintendo GameCube. The older games are available on the Nintendo Switch's virtual console—i.e., you can just download them—and the more recent games were rereleased for the Switch itself. But Wind Waker occupies an unfortunate middle spot.\n\nNot to be deterred, I went hunting for my Nintendo Wii console, which I found in the back of my closet. (Actually, I found two of them. I have no idea where the other one came from.) The earliest version of the Wii, I recalled, was backward compatible with the GameCube, and I still had my copy of Wind Waker. What I didn't have was a GameCube memory card—remember those!—but it was easy enough to order on Amazon.\n\nAnd, thus, I have been enjoying a replay of Wind Waker, which was first released 23 years ago, in 2002, during my first year of high school. I don't think this game is as good as its two predecessors (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, my personal favorite), or the next installment (Twilight Princess), but I'm having a blast with it.","summary":"Perhaps young people have become resentful of the government's massive transfer of wealth from kids to the elderly.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/03/27/why-gen-z-is-embracing-trump/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/03/rollcallpix162893-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 18:44:05","author":"C.j.

I don’t mean that to say the union does a poor job representing U.S. autoworkers (though I do believe that is also true). I mean it as a simple statement of fact: The UAW is not the bargaining agent for the vast majority of U.S. autoworkers.\n\nAbout 1 million Americans are employed in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The UAW reported to the Department of Labor that it had 370,239 active members in 2023. The 1.5 million–member UAW of Walter Reuther is long gone, and the UAW today has far more retired members than active ones. Even if every UAW member were an autoworker, almost two-thirds of U.S. autoworkers would not be members.\n\nBut the actual proportion of autoworkers who aren’t in the UAW is even bigger than that because, contrary to the union’s name, most members of the United Auto Workers are not autoworkers. The UAW has about as many members in the University of California system as it does at General Motors. In recent years, it has been much more successful organizing graduate students, whom it attracts with its progressive politics, than autoworkers.\n\nAs of 2023, the UAW represented about 57,000 workers at Ford, 46,000 workers at GM, and 43,000 workers at Stellantis. That represents the bulk of its autoworker membership, since the union has few footholds in foreign automakers’ operations in the U.S. Throw in the roughly 4,000 Volkswagen workers in Tennessee who are represented by the UAW beginning last year (which is being generous because not all of them are necessarily members, Tennessee being a right-to-work state), and that’s about 150,000 autoworkers represented by the UAW.\n\nThat’s less than half of the union’s claimed membership. And it’s just 15 percent of the total number of U.S. workers employed in auto manufacturing. There’s no reason to expect that the UAW would speak in the general interest of autoworkers when 85 percent of autoworkers aren’t members.\n\nThe low union membership rate among autoworkers is actually high compared with other manufacturing sectors. Despite the common perception of factory jobs as union jobs, only 7.8 percent of U.S. manufacturing workers are union members, according to 2024 BLS data. That’s hardly different from the numbers in the private sector overall, where just 5.9 percent of workers are in unions.\n\nThe UAW is more than happy to see autoworkers outside the Big Three suffer, because if the tariffs work as intended to redistribute profits to the Big Three, that means more money for the UAW to bargain for its members who work there.\n\nThe UAW also likely sees hope in the details of the president’s decree imposing these tariffs. It says auto parts that comply with the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement will be tariff-free for the time being while the government devises a process to only tax their non-U.S. content. The order will still hurt the Big Three, but it will likely hurt them less than it will hurt the foreign automakers in the U.S., who are more likely to get parts from Japan, Germany, or South Korea that aren’t USMCA-compliant. It’s also entirely possible that the government never actually gets around to devising that process and the compliant imports remain tariff-free indefinitely.\n\nThe UAW knows it is more likely to be able to shape policy by saying it supports the president’s tariffs. Flattering Trump works, as Teamsters president Sean O’Brien has demonstrated by essentially picking the secretary of labor. The UAW is also digging itself out of the hole it dug by virulently opposing Trump and backing Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThere’s also the simple fact that UAW president Shawn Fain is an ideologue who is opposed to free trade. In the UAW statement supporting Trump’s actions, he deplores the “free trade disaster,” and he has put out a video entitled “NAFTA Sucks” in which he says he voted for Ross Perot in 1992 because he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Fain says is responsible for “plant closures, deaths of despair, and economic devastation.”\n\nNever mind that the number of U.S. auto manufacturing jobs increased for five years after NAFTA took effect. Or that what really cost auto jobs was the Great Recession, which hit car companies especially hard in part because of the UAW’s exorbitant pension demands. Or that U.S. auto manufacturing employment had been steadily increasing from 2010 until Covid and today sits roughly at its pre-Covid level. Or that there are about as many U.S. autoworkers today as there were in 1991, before NAFTA supposedly destroyed their jobs.\n\nFain doesn’t care about the thousands of Big Three autoworkers who were laid off after the UAW’s much-lauded contract “wins” following its strike actions in 2023. And he certainly doesn’t care about the nonunion autoworkers in the South, whom, with the exception of the Volkswagen workers in Tennessee, he couldn’t convince to join the UAW, despite the entire national media cheering him on. He cares about his own power, and about getting the court-appointed monitor who is investigating him for financial misconduct and workplace retaliation off his back.\n\nThe UAW is best understood as a corrupt retiree association and progressive activist group that represents some autoworkers on the side. Most autoworkers want no part of it. No one should be surprised when it takes stances that aren’t in autoworkers’ best interest.","summary":"The union doesn’t represent most autoworkers.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/03/why-the-united-auto-workers-supports-tariffs-that-will-hurt-auto-workers/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UAW-yes-sign.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 18:28:18","author":"Dominic Pino","authors":["Dominic Pino"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":304849882,"title":"Lesli Linka Glatter on ‘Homeland’ to ‘Zero Day’ and Bringing Production Back to Los Angeles","text":"For Lesli Linka Glatter, the seed to her working on Zero Day came 10 years ago, when she was working on Homeland. Glatter, who is now the president of the Directors Guild of America, worked on Showtime’s era-defining espionage drama starring Claire Danes as producer and director, helming 25 episodes throughout its eight-season run.\n\n “I love the political or conspiracy thriller as an engine to tell deep character stories, to look at the world we’re in and juxtapose environment, government and politics with the human being,” Glatter tells The Hollywood Reporter of what drew her to Netflix’s recent hit political thriller starring Robert De Niro. “General Michael Hayden, the former head of the CIA and also of the NSA, who was an adviser on Homeland, had started talking about: what is truth in a post-truth world? What interested me about Zero Day [when I got the script years later] was not taking a political side [to explore that], and there’s a little bit of Homeland in that.”\n\n Glatter came on board to direct all six episodes of Zero Day, created by Eric Newman, Noah Oppenheim and Michael S. Schmidt. The limited series filmed mainly in New York, where De Niro resides, to capture the East Coast political setting for the thriller that follows the first-time TV actor’s former president being called back to service to investigate a catastrophic cyberattack called a zero-day event. Homeland tackled national and global cyberterrorism, including the hacking of elections, but the series never encountered a zero-day attack. “There has never been a zero-day event that affects all industries simultaneously,” says Glatter. “Needless to say, that’s the biggest fear.”\n\n Below, Glatter unpacks the timely themes of Zero Day, reveals a wild Zero Day–Homeland White House connection and looks ahead to her next project at Apple, Imperfect Women. The top TV director-producer, who lost her Pacific Palisades home in the recent wildfires, also takes stock of the industry to urge the return of production to L.A.\n\n I was so sorry to see that you lost your home in the fires. \n\n Of course, it was terrible. But it’s so much bigger than me. It’s the whole community. We have to rise from this, and a lot of that I think is trying to keep production in America. I’m starting a new project in March that shoots here in L.A. The kindness of strangers… in the worst of times, people’s better selves come out. I see it all over. The generosity of spirit is really moving. I wish people behaved like that to one another at all times.\n\n That’s actually a lot of what Zero Day speaks to.\n\n It is so true. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to make it.\n\n Zero Day speaks to our current moment. When you first got the pitch, it couldn’t have possibly felt as of the moment as it’s turned out to be. What drew you to the series and made you want to be the sole director? \n\n I was not involved with the development. The script was sent to me and when I read the first hour, what interested me was this idea of how we are relating to truth. And that was happening well before the moment we’re in, which is only more exacerbated now. \n\n The first time I heard [of how truth was evolving] was when I was still on Homeland. One of our advisers, General Michael Hayden, started talking about: what is truth in a post-truth world? This was a while ago, and we are now in a time where we cannot agree on what is fact and what is opinion, even when facts are facts. How do we communicate? We have to find a way to hear each other. If conversations are always filled with accusations and you’re convinced there’s no seed of truth, how do you find a way to reach across? \n\n That’s what interested me about Zero Day. Some of my favorite scenes are when two characters have completely opposing views and there’s a lot of truth in each view, if we could only stop and hear each other. \n\n You never tackled a zero-day event on Homeland that I can recall. Is that right?\n\n That’s right. A zero-day event, which is a flaw in software that can be hacked, is the most powerful cyber weapon known to the intelligence community. There have been many zero-day events since 2010 [when Homeland began production]. We dealt with some cyber intelligence, like the hacking of elections and all of that, and in fact, we used some of the same advisers [as on Zero Day]. \n\n Zero Day is realistically real, but where we take reality to another level is the event itself. There has never been a zero-day event that affects all industry simultaneously. Needless to say, that’s the biggest fear,. This took down aviation transportation, banking, power… that has never happened. It’s always been one industry at a time and there has been a patch to fix it. So this was about the idea that you could take down all industries to terrify people. In Zero Day after the attack, everyone gets a message saying: “This will happen again.”\n\n I hate to go back to the horror of 9/11, but it speaks to being attacked and what you do when there is fear and panic. The higher part of oneself and the best thinking does not come out. There is a need to try to find the enemy, the need to feel safe again. You will give up any civil liberty to feel safe again. \n\n You filmed Zero Day at the end of 2023 and through summer 2024, which means the show was done when the November election came and President Trump was reelected.\n\n That’s exactly right. This was written well before the current administration. We cast Angela Bassett [as Zero Day president] having no idea Kamala Harris would end up being the [Democratic presidential] nominee. It wasn’t about that. We made a a point not to talk about the right or left, to try to really deal with the truth of the situation. I’m always interested in what happens when a government or an individual is given unlimited power. Being given unlimited power is a huge burden and most people or governments cannot deal with that and do not make the best choices for the country or humanity. \n\n In the end, the truth wins out when De Niro’s former President George Mullen does the right thing when announcing the results of the Zero Day Commission’s investigation into the attack. It was a surprising ending — both for a political thriller and in political reality. Was that flip ending also part of the intrigue for you?\n\n Yes. This is a show where there’s anxiety everywhere. There’s nothing about our world now or the world of Zero Day where the ground is solid. People do not feel safe, and I wanted to put people in that feeling. I’m always interested in the back rooms of power where decisions are made. One of the things that interested me is that this could end up being a very dark story, and in many ways it is. But there was something about someone making that choice between right and wrong in the end, and where do you stand when confronted with that? \n\n All of the characters have a different relationship with truth. For Mullen, truth is truth. He really stands for that, because having to make a choice that deals with your own personal life or someone in your family would be a very hard choice to make. At the end of the day, you sleep with yourself. What can you live with? I’m amazed at some of the things going on in real life where people can do what they’re doing and feel okay about it, and yet people do. Angela’s President Mitchell at one point says, “Yes, the truth is the truth, but it’s not always the most important thing.” I’m interested in each person’s point of view. How each character sees the world and moves through it.\n\n A lingering question in Zero Day is whether or not Mullen is a reliable narrator or if he’s fit to do this job. As director, you put the audience in his mind and yet we never got a definitive answer. Where do you stand, and what did you want us to think?\n\n I went into that moment by moment. I’m very interested in acuity in our leaders and the idea of an unreliable narrator, but also someone you really want to be able to do it. You’re rooting for him to be able to save us and save America. Skating that line was really interesting: is he all there? Is he the one who is able to do this? Sometimes he is completely there and other times you’re like, is this the person we’ve put our hope and our fates in? And that is also very anxiety producing.\n\n The whole idea of the memory palace is based on research. When these memory sequences came up, he’s trying to remember a conversation he had and is struggling to get back to that moment. When you’re dealing with memory, the very classic exercise to try to remember is to go back to the exact same situation — exact same night, exact same clothes — and empty the room and then fill it back up until hopefully you’re filling back up the piece that you’re desperate to remember. That’s how I tried to conceptualize it. Because I needed to hang on to something that felt real, rather than some tricky visual thing that would make no sense at the end of the day.\n\n But Proteus [the neurological warfare weapon] is a real thing that is based on the Havana syndrome. It’s research done within our own intelligence community on a weapon that is able to alter minds, which is terrifying. So I think there’s some truth to all of it. I think he is suffering from some sort of early dementia, and the stress and pressure all of that, as well as being in the public eye again after 12 years.\n\n Co-creator Eric Newman told me that he wrote it as if there was a weapon being used on Mullen, but then when in post-production on the show, he changed his mind. He said he had to commit when writing it.\n\n That’s how I approached it. That moment by moment, it was happening.\n\n His acuity is certainly very strong in the end, when he announces the findings of his zero-day investigation and exposes how high the corruption goes in U.S. government. What was it like directing De Niro in that finale and recreating the Capitol?\n\n When I first met him, I’m like, “He’s a legend, an icon. He’s Robert De Niro.” But of course, you get to know the human and that falls to the wayside. He is all of those things. But he is also just an amazing guy. He is incredibly committed, smart, works really hard and is a great collaborator. He’s a wonderful No. 1 on the call sheet. We’ve seen him do comedies, but I had no idea how funny he was. This is heavy material and there was a lot of laughter on the set. We all liked each other so that helps; we had an incredible cast and crew. In this team sport, you want to put the absolute best people together. And we were going to be living together for 103 shooting days. That’s a long time.\n\n Where were some highlights of where you filmed?\n\n We were based in New York and, how great to shoot a project that’s actually based in America in America? Given that production is down 40 percent, which is terrible for American storytelling, that is so important. Honestly if De Niro hadn’t said that we need to shoot in New York, I don’t know where we would have shot. Maybe Toronto.\n\n So, we had an amazing time. I love New York. We were based at Steiner Studios [in Brooklyn] and then we shot all over. His estate was in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. and we shot a lot in the city. It was all based on research because, coming from years of doing Homeland, I want things to feel realistically real. We had amazing advisers.\n\n Where was your White House and Oval office set? \n\n You want to hear something crazy? We had built multiple Oval offices for Homeland and the last one we built had been left in Richmond, Virginia. We carted that set, which had been folded, and we rebuilt it [for Zero Day]. It was repainted and looks completely different. But yes, that was the Oval from Homeland. Someone would make a fortune if they built the perfect West Wing. I even built the West Wing in Morocco [for Homeland].\n\n We also did shoot in DC. Because of 9/11, you can’t shoot anywhere on those Capitol steps. They don’t allow it. It used to be hard, but in West Wing times [which Glatter was a director on], you could shoot all over. But now it’s really different. So we did a green screen. We built steps with columns and everything else around it. But we did shoot all around the White House. We were able to close down streets and use the military, because that needed to feel like it was totally real.\n\n Dan Stevens received a lot of attention for his portrayal of a Tucker Carlson-like media personality. What was it like filming his Evan Green show?\n\n He’s such an extraordinary actor and joy to work with. He just really became that character. We found this amazing house in Oyster Bay, which is the house we shot his scenes in. The shot continued and he went downstairs, so in the basement we built his studio. \n\n I do want to ask how the strikes, the fires and your position at DGA, how all of it is pushing you to call for projects to film in L.A. What is that message from you right now?\n\n I’ve been involved in leadership for a while. When the various people came to me and said, “Will you run for [DGA] president?” I was like, “Absolutely not. I’m way too busy.” But the DGA is built on working leadership. We have amazing people on our board; everyone is working, because you don’t really have skin in the game if you’re not out there in it. I think that helps. I think it makes us strong,.\n\n My dad was a labor organizer at the International Ladies garment Union. From childhood, I understood that you get to a certain place in your career and are supposed to give back to your community. I guess that’s how I ended up doing this. It’s certainly been a hard time, and it’s much more time consuming that I had ever thought, but it’s rewarding in that way. If you can help make a difference, we all need to do that. I’m always inspired by the board and the members in leadership who have these crazy, busy careers who give back to their community. \n\n But I have to say, going from Peak TV to the slumpery slope of the loss of production — from the pandemic when everything shut down to then finally getting back going again, and then having the strikes — all of that has been incredibly hard on production. The DGA is 40 percent UPMs, ADs, second ADs, associate directors, stage managers — were not just directors. We represent the director’s team. So to be 40 percent down in production across America is so horrifying for labor. \n\n I get that the studios and networks are trying to make their shows for a cost. But America, our storytelling industry, the icon of “Hollywood,” we cannot lose that. We cannot lose and not support the labor that has built Hollywood. The studios and networks need to be part of that solution. I understand if you’re doing a show that based in Paris that you’re not going to be shooting in the Midwest. But, let’s try to keep things that are based in America in America. Let’s not go shoot Los Angeles in Australia.\n\n And because of what’s been so damaging with the fires in L.A., we have got to keep production here. We have the best crew in New York, in L.A. and now in Atlanta. We have an amazing production center in Chicago. We have to keep our storytelling business in America.\n\n Can you talk about that next project that you are shooting in L.A.? \n\n I never want to do the same thing twice. I always want to mix it up. I’m doing a project for Apple with amazing actors. I love actors. I’m working with Kerry Washington, Elisabeth Moss and Kate Mara in a show for Apple called Imperfect Women. The whole team is amazing. Annie Weisman is writing. I’m very excited about it. And yes, it shoots in L.A.\n\n Zero Day is now streaming on Netflix.

Kat Cammack.\n\n \"We're gonna have tremendous goodies in the bag for women too,” he promised the crowd. “The women, between the fertilization and all the other things we're talking about, it's gonna be great.”\n\n “Fertilization.

I’m the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question,” Trump responded.\n\n In response to one attendee’s concern at the time that abortion bans could affect access to fertility treatments, Trump recalled how he had recently learned about IVF.\n\n \"So I got a call from Katie Britt, a young, just a fantastically attractive person from Alabama,” he told the crowd. “She’s a senator, and she called me up like 'emergency, emergency' because an Alabama judge had ruled that the IVF clinics were illegal and they have to be closed down.”\n\n \"And I said, explain IVF, very IVF, very quickly. And within about two minutes, I understood it,\" Trump added. \"We're totally in favor of IVF.\"\n\n The \"emergency\" that the president mischaracterized at the October town hall was a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court on Feb. 16, 2024, which stated that frozen embryos at IVF clinics were protected under Alabama’s civil Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. \n\n Due to concerns that they could be sued for destroying frozen embryos, several fertility clinics in the state paused some of their services, though the clinics themselves were not outlawed.\n\n In response, Trump's then-opponent Kamala Harris labeled his comments defending IVF as \"quite bizarre.\"\n\n \"What is he talking about?\" she wrote in a post on X. “His abortion bans have already jeopardized access to it in states across the country — and his own platform could end IVF altogether.”\n\n On Feb. 18, 2025, Trump signed an executive order aimed at “expanding access” to IVF.\n\n “President Trump promised to advance IVF and help American families with the associated costs so American families can have more babies, building on his record of supporting family formation and stability,” the order reads.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n However, while it declares that the Trump administration recognizes “the importance of family formation and that our Nation’s public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children,” it doesn’t include specifics about how the administration would alleviate costs.\n\n Instead, the order merely “directs policy recommendations to protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments.\"","summary":"The president previously declared himself the \"Father of IVF\" after asking a female senator what it meant","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-nicknames-himself-fertilization-president-womens-history-month-11704347","image":"https://people.com/thmb/39v8z2sOk31KRr7cmkFs3e8j80E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/donlad-trump-womens-history-event-tout-032725-bd270264429748acb0aeffe3e13d72ca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 16:42:45","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":304851558,"title":"MAUREEN CALLAHAN: The truth about smack-talking Jasmine Crockett... a woman so profoundly stupid it's no wonder Democrats want her as their next leader","text":"This is who the Dems consider a rising star? A woman who just made fun of her own state governor for needing a wheelchair?\n\nCongresswoman Jasmine Crockett is 43 years old, which came as a shock to me. Her speech and demeanor are so profoundly immature I thought she was at least ten years younger.\n\n'Governor Hot Wheels' was what she recently called Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who was paralyzed over 40 years ago in a freak accident, struck by a falling tree while out running.\n\nIt gets even better: She said it while addressing a Human Rights Campaign dinner on Saturday in LA – a town that lives on virtue signaling. And the audience cheered!\n\nBut Crockett couldn't leave that disgusting excuse for a joke alone. 'The only thing hot about him,' she said of Abbott, 'is that he is a hot-ass mess, honey.'\n\nCrockett is a pastor's daughter. How Christian of her. That some Dems are touting her as a star says everything.\n\nWhere are her party leaders to shut his down? Where are the so-called adults? Barack? Michelle? Hillary and Bill? AOC?\n\nWhere, for that matter, are the Rachel Maddows of the liberal media? You know, the ones so high on their self-regard that they never miss a moment to preach about kindness, diversity, equity and inclusion?\n\nThen again, it was Maddow who called Trump 'disgusting' for celebrating a 13-year-old brain cancer survivor during his joint address to Congress in January – a boy so moved that he hugged Secret Service Director Sean Curran, who had just made him an honorary agent.\n\nAnd it was Maddow's equally galling MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace who linked this young boy's dream of becoming a police officer to the January 6 riots.\n\n'I hope he never has to defend the United States Capitol against Donald Trump's supporters and if he does, I hope he isn't one of the six who loses his life to suicide,' she said.\n\nThese people are sick.\n\nMake no mistake: They are emblematic of a party rotting from within, so morally adrift that not a single one – not even the true elders, breaking hips and promises on their way out the door – will stand up for what's right.\n\nThe only Dem worth a damn is John Fetterman, but look where that's gotten him. Standing up for Israel after 10/7? He's a pariah. Warning his party that they're self-destructing? Ignored.\n\nAfter the Dems sat stone-faced during Trump's January address – refusing to be moved by that little boy, or by the grieving family of Laken Riley, the 22-year-old nursing student murdered by an illegal immigrant – Fetterman called out their deplorable behavior on X.\n\n'A sad cavalcade of self-owns and petulance. It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained,' he wrote.\n\n'We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to – and it may not be the winning message.'\n\nBut it's not just the message. It's the messengers.\n\nWhen these highly educated pols are literally talking down to working class communities, black and Latino voters, adopting accents and dropping their 'g's, they're communicating one thing: they think these voters are stupid.\n\nThey are not. They are on to these elitists and their snobbery, and it's yet another reason Trump won.\n\nJust ask Barack Obama, who adopted a street cadence to hector black male voters – calling them 'brothers' – for not supporting Kamala Harris.\n\n'Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.'\n\nThis from a man married to the woman his party was begging to run. Instead, they got Kamala Harris – and now Jasmine Crockett.\n\nHarris herself loves shedding her posh Californian drawl.\n\n'Let's just get through the next sixty-fow days,' she said on the trail. 'Hah 'bout that?'\n\nHow about that, Kamala of UC Law School.\n\nAnd who could forget her Bob Marley impression on Stephen Colbert, days before losing: 'Have you no empathy, mon'?'\n\nDear lord. The Dems never learn, do they?\n\nThey didn't learn from Hillary's embarrassing 2016 'hot sauce' pander, telling Charlamagne tha God that she always keeps a bottle in her purse. Sure. \n\nThat disclosure — along with her mispronunciation of Beyoncé's name — led Charlemagne to mock Hillary to her face.\n\n'Now you went to Brooklyn last night,' he said, 'and you didn't say \"rest in peace\" to Biggie Smalls or shout out Jay-Z? Why not?'\n\nThis is what we need — much more of this. Hillary, trapped on live radio, hoisted by her own petard.\n\nCharlemagne: 'Just one \"big-up\" to Brooklyn, RIP.'\n\nHillary: 'I said I love Brooklyn.'\n\nCharlemagne: 'You gotta say, \"Is Brooklyn in da house?\"'\n\nHillary: 'Brooklyn in da house, that's right.'\n\nJoe Biden learned nothing from Hillz, telling Charlamagne in a 2020 interview that 'I tell you what – if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.'\n\nYou ain’t black – from the whitest, oldest political mediocrity in recent memory. An octogenarian in obvious mental and physical decline who, along with his wife, lost this election due to his own hubris – then last week told his party he wanted to fundraise for them.\n\n'Delusional and arrogant,' said one ex-Biden staffer. 'No voter wants to hear from him.'\n\nSelf-awareness has no home in the modern Democratic party.\n\nOnce more unto the breach steps Jasmine Crockett, the product of exclusive private schools, a lawyer and congresswoman who is cosplaying as a Real Housewife and talking smack.\n\n'It is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally,' she said on MSNBC this month. 'It is not a crime.'\n\nBreaking into the country illegally is the very definition of a crime.\n\nSeriously: Why does she think Dems lost the election? Could it be that the overwhelming majority of Americans want secure borders?\n\nCrockett also said that Kamala ran a 'flawless' campaign and that Hispanics who voted for Trump have a 'slave mentality'.\n\nShades of Barack talking down to his brothers. Keep going, Dems. Keep insulting the voters who you have already thoroughly alienated.\n\nCrockett has also smeared congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene as a 'bleach blonde, bad built, butch body' – earning her raves and applause on 'The View', those moronic hosts otherwise outraged by Trump's verbiage – and insulted Republican Rep. Nancy Mace:\n\n'Somebody's campaign coffers really are strugglin' right now, So [Mace] is gon' keep sayin' trans, trans, trans' – pause for dramatic hair flip – 'and chile, listen.'\n\n'I am no child,' Mace shot back. 'Do not call me a child.'\n\nMace speaks for a weary America.\n\nTo anyone among would-be Democratic leadership: Do not speak to us like we are children. We are quite smart – in fact, most of us are smarter than you.","summary":"This is who the Dems consider a rising star?

Sign up to get book recommendations, author Q&As, deep dives on trends in the industry, and more in your inbox every week.\n\nDear readers,\n\nAs we bring Women’s History Month to a close, I thought it fitting to reflect on the unique ways women engage with literature, specifically fiction.\n\nIt’s often observed that women are more likely to read fiction than men, and while much has been written on men’s reading habits, less has been done on women’s practices. As we honor women writers and literary advocates this month, I took a deep dive into why women read and explored the gender gap in reading.\n\n📚 Reading anything good lately? Share your last great read with us.\n\nBooks move her. He’s not so sure.\n\nI remember the very first time I finished a novel, probably in the second or third grade. It was Sharon Creech’s “The Wanderer,” a story about a 13-year-old girl, Sophie, who sets sail across the Atlantic ocean with a gaggle of uncles to visit her grandfather in England. \n\nI was absolutely awestruck after finishing the book, in complete disbelief at not only having hit a milestone (finishing my first chapter book!) but also at the complete escape into another world. I felt like Alice, falling down the rabbit hole into Wonderland, wholly transported to a new and exciting world. That experience changed my life, and I haven’t stopped reading since.\n\nI hope boys (now men) had these kinds of experiences with reading, too. I mourn for those who haven’t. According to the internet, many men haven’t had that kind of experience, and as a result, don’t read – to the detriment of society, apparently. \n\nIn a brilliant story on the viral panic over men’s reading habits, Vox journalist Constance Grady examines this curious phenomenon coursing through the cyber sphere. The thinking goes: if men’s disinterest and decline in reading continues on its downward trajectory (as data show), dark days loom ahead for America. Or, another variation: “If men had been willing to read novels, the idea is, perhaps Kamala Harris would be preparing her inaugural address right now,” Grady writes.\n\nIt is true that men read less than women, and there is a gender gap in reading, to be sure. A 2022 study from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), administered by the Census Bureau, offers some insight: Just over half, or 56.6%, of women and 40% of men read a book in 2022, but just 29.5% of men read fiction, compared to 49.2% of women. \n\n“Both populations deserve study so that promoters of the literary arts (e.g., publishers, bookstores, nonprofit organizations, educators) understand how motives and interests in fiction-reading may show up differently in the two sexes – and what are some respective barriers,” Sunil Iyengar, the director of research and analysis at the NEA, told me in an email.\n\nIn the midst of this online panic, I thought about the literary men the internet has grown to idolize: the “book-boyfriend,” the @hotdudesreading Instagram account with more than 1 million followers, the idea that “the sluttiest thing a man can do is read” (yes, that’s a real headline). We put men who read on pedestals, and look at their disinterest in reading as a bad omen for this country. Their reading habits are viewed as simultaneously (paradoxically!) responsible for both our “downfall” and also a means toward our “salvation.”\n\nBut getting men to read more fiction won’t – can’t – be what “saves” us. And our desire for this to be the solution “says a lot about what our culture worries about and all the things we hope will heal us,” Grady said.\n\nReading Grady’s piece on the anxiety around men’s reading habits made me think about women, who seemed to have gotten lost in translation, or overlooked (surprise, surprise), in the viral panic over men. \n\nIt also made me think about the binary, cis-gendered way we study and perceive reading habits across genders. I hope this newsletter goes beyond the binary, to explore why reading is so important and impactful to all of us. \n\nWhy do women read more fiction than men?\n\nMy search for answers led me to Helen Taylor, a British author and emeritus professor of English at the University of Exeter. \n\nTaylor’s book, “Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives” was published in 2019 and explores some of the anecdotal trends surrounding women’s reading habits. \n\nTo be clear, Taylor’s book isn’t a sociological study on women’s reading habits (she had no interest in such a methodology, she said, adding that answering the question of why women read fiction is frankly too large of an undertaking to be possible). \n\nInstead, she interviewed and polled over 500 women readers and writers through questionnaires about their reading habits. She attended literary festivals, conferences, book clubs, and anywhere women went to find great books (and each other). \n\nWhat she found was this: “Women use fiction in different ways from men…they see their reading as being a part of their life, not something separate from their life. It is something that guides their life,” she said in a phone interview.\n\nIt’s also a way to subvert patriarchy, Taylor said.\n\n“We live in a patriarchal society where men are setting the agenda, where men are telling us who we should be and what we should be. But fiction is giving us different stories. It’s telling us stories about powerful women, about imaginative women, about women who subvert patriarchy and who create their own lives. And I think that’s very important for women,” she said. “These are terrible generalizations, but I do think there’s a sort of truth in it.”\n\nFor Amy Brabenec, the children’s book buyer and curator of the romance and sci-fi sections at Brookline Booksmith, reading (and reading fiction, specifically) was a way of exploring parts of herself that weren’t represented in the staple (read: white male) authors she was assigned to read in school.\n\n“If I wanted to read something that I felt like would be more my experience or more something I was interested in, I had to go and find that. I knew books like that had to exist, but where were they? I think women and girls are more used to finding things, we’re just trained younger to have to go find the things that are for us, because society is not giving them to us,” Brabenec said.\n\nAt Brookline Booksmith, women readers are leading the charge in the rise of romantasy (a subgenre of fiction that blends fantasy elements with romance). Many of the bookstore’s bestsellers come from the genre, which has seen substantial growth since the pandemic. Brabenec attributes the dominance of women readers in the romantasy genre to marketing, which she said targets them specifically.\n\nWomen also seem to be reading and buying more fiction than men at Harvard Book Store, book buyer Melissa Sagendorph told me. \n\n“Women are obviously responsible for the huge explosion and popularity of romance as a genre, but even things that you would typically think would be more male-centric, like the hard sciences or the histories, women are pretty much buying those like on an even pace with men,” she said.\n\nAt book clubs and other literary events at the bookstore, women also seem to make up the majority of attendees. \n\n“It’s really common to have an event that’s mostly women in attendance, and it’s really common to have an event that’s evenly split, but very, very rarely will you ever have an event that’s mostly men,” Sagendorph said.\n\nWhile women seem to be dominating book sales at Harvard Book Store, Sagendorph wonders if it’s a chicken or egg situation: “Do we sell strong, female-driven narratives because that’s what our community reads, or maybe that’s what our community is reading because that’s what we’re providing?” \n\nHow can we close the gender gap in reading?\n\nThe “why” behind women’s reading habits is an amorphous, slippery thing. Experts I spoke with offered more anecdotes and curiosity than definitive answers. \n\nWhat I can tell you is this: Women read fiction because it is a way to see and experience our world (and worlds beyond it) in powerful, personal ways. It is “an act of empathy,” Iyengar, the NEA researcher said. Some of the NEA’s studies have shown that literary readers are even more likely than non-readers to participate in social and civic activities in their communities.\n\nUnfortunately, the gender gap in reading persists, and fiction-reading rates have declined at a comparable rate for men and women over the last ten years, Iyengar said. From 2012 to 2024, both men and women saw a roughly 8 percentage-point drop in their reading rates. \n\n“The divide in reading rates – between men and women – remains, but it would have widened if more women had read in 2022. Closing this gap is important, but so is raising overall reading rates for both sexes” Iyengar said.\n\nIf you’re trying to get back into reading, Brabenec, the Brookline Booksmith buyer, suggests audio books as an alternative to print books. She recommends trying out an audio book of something you have already read before as an easy entry point into the medium.\n\nFor book buyers and folks within the industry, Sagendorph of Harvard Book Store suggests building displays and buying books that will “encourage people to read,” no matter their gender.\n\n“People will buy the books that you put up and that you advertise. Just keep pushing the books that are going to appeal broadly and that are going to push boundaries,” she said.\n\n✏️ Pencil these in \n\nTake a break from the news at these joyful literary events happening near you:\n\nPoetry Open Mic at Trident Booksellers & Cafe | Mar. 30\n\nBring your own poetry works and perform them in front of a supportive crowd. \n\nThe Great Gatsby Centennial | Apr. 10\n\nCelebrate the centennial of F.

Among major U.S. automakers, GM has the most extensive operations in Mexico and Canada, which would take a direct hit from the president’s latest import taxes on vehicles and auto parts made abroad. The Chevy Silverado is produced by both of America’s immediate neighbors, while the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain are manufactured in Mexico. The Chevy Trax compact SUV, meanwhile, comes from South Korea. “Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded [from tariff impacts] given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. “GM has the most exposure to Mexico.” Trump administration officials suggested there would be a temporary carveout for vehicles and parts that complied with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement, but said how that would end up working was still being determined. At least one analyst suggested any auto tariffs that impacted Mexico and Canada would violate the agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term. The new levies come just as the car industry notches the highest first-quarter new-vehicle sales in the U.S. since 2021, Edmunds analysts said Thursday, with strong demand in March contributing to a 1% jump from the same period a year ago. But analysts now say that trend could be in peril. “With nearly half of all vehicles sold being assembled outside of the U.S., we anticipate major repercussions from tariffs at any level,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. Goldman Sachs estimated the 25% duties could drive up sticker prices by anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 per imported vehicle and by $3,000 to $8,000 for domestically made ones. Automakers appear to be treading cautiously with their public remarks on the policy change. “U.S. automakers are committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans,” Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement following the announcement. “It is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers.” But Ford CEO Jim Farley was far less sanguine last month, saying at an investment conference that 25% tariffs would be “devastating” and would “blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Speaking at the same conference, GM executives signaled they were prepared to weather as much as 50% of the impact from any new tariffs. “When we know exactly what’s going to happen, and/or even have an indication of what’s going to happen, we know the steps we could take,” CEO Mary Barra said at the time. The company indicated it could take further steps to blunt the effects from long-lasting trade policies, including by shifting production. But on Thursday the president emphasized that his new auto tariffs would be “permanent.” He has said they’ll bring more auto production back to the U.S. and generate vast revenues for government coffers, ballparking those proceeds at up to $100 billion without providing details behind that estimate. While automakers could each feel the impacts differently, the whipsawing White House trade policies are destabilizing for the entire industry, experts say. “What we’ve seen so far in this is an announcement and then a change, and then an announcement and then a change,” Stephanie Brinley, automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility, said Wednesday evening. “I don’t know that anybody’s breathing a sigh of relief.” For automakers, she said, “the situation is still incredibly complicated and the decisions are complex, and the tariffs that were announced are one portion of a lot of things that go into global sourcing decisions.” One silver lining, she added, is that “if this settles it down, and this is what the tariff is, instead of back-and-forth at least you have an answer.” Drury said the ripple effects from tariffs could be felt far beyond industry C-suites and dealership lots. “Automakers have huge investments to make, and the language of these tariffs could upend plans that were years in the making. The automotive industry also has long-term and deep-reaching impacts within any community that receives these investments,” he said. “People’s whole lives are on the line, and even if someone doesn’t work on an assembly line, they will know someone who does.” While industry experts and automakers brace for fallout, the nation’s top autoworker union hailed the tariffs. “We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,” United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said in a statement Wednesday. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.” The union had endorsed Trump’s rival in last year’s election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, with Fain having slammed Trump as a “scab” standing against labor. UAW leaders at the local level, meanwhile, continue to voice concerns about White House trade policies. So far, major announcements of new auto production facilities continue to mount, though not in areas where the UAW has traditionally prevailed. A recent list of new electric vehicle plants highlighted by Automotive Dive showed just one such facility in the Midwest, with the rest dispersed throughout the South — a region with fewer labor protections and a deep base of Trump voters.","summary":"General Motors shares fell more than 7% Thursday as investors weighed the auto giant’s outsized vulnerability to the tariffs President Donald Trump announced Wednesday.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/trump-auto-tariffs-gm-cars-trucks-made-in-mexico-canada-rcna198366","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250327-mexico-general-motors-mn-1100-99b968.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 15:38:31","author":"J.j.

From interning during the President’s first term to defending him in front of the global media, she has achieved a lot at the age of 27. In January, after Trump took over the White House for the second time, Leavitt accompanied him, vowing to vigorously defend him for the next four years while also slamming his rivals.\n\nShe became quite the household name for her controversial take on many things, including the President’s mass immigrant deportations and attempting to play down the leaked Signal group chat scandal. However, she knows how to handle Donald Trump‘s controversial actions.\n\nDuring her internship at the White House, she learned many things and honed her skills further while working on the Republican leader’s 2024 election campaign trail. A mom and wife at home, a loud-mouth Trump supporter in front of the cameras, how does Karoline Leavitt‘s day in life look like? The youngest White House Press Secretary herself gave us an insight in October last year when her boss was putting his best efforts into winning the election once again.\n\nOn Instagram, she shared an Instagram video with the caption, “72 hours in the life. No one works harder than President Trump.” The video starts with Leavitt announcing, “Come with me for a day in the life as President Trump’s press secretary,” as she stands in front of The Trump Organization’s Boeing 757, better known as Trump Force One.\n\nShe starts her day by boarding the aircraft, showing viewers the luxurious interior as she says, “Welcome to the notorious Trump Force One where even the coffee cups are branded.” Leavitt then shows off a cup with the text “TRUMP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” As she begins her journey, Karoline says, “Goodbye, West Palm and it is really a day in Erie, Pennsylvania. We are met with an amazing crowd of supporters as our motorcade passes by.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by KAROLINE LEAVITT (@karolineleavitt) \n\nNext, we are taken to the rally, where the 27-year-old is seen speaking to a reporter. “I have a quick TV hit before President Trump takes the stage and the crowd goes wild listening to his message to make America strong and safe and wealthy again,” she said. The next task for the President and team is to have an American lunch back at the Trump Force One. “We load back up onto the plane, McDonald’s is served, and the football is on for good measure,” narrates Leavitt.\n\nShe then gives us a rare insight into an early morning shift, as her bedside clock shows 4:55 am. “President Trump works so hard, late night, early mornings are the norm.” That night, the team landed back in New York for a layover before an early start for morning media.\n\nNext for Leavitt is a session at the Fox News studio, where she calls Kamala Harris a “disaster,” something that would make international headlines. Karoline returns to Trump Tower, where the President is doing an interview. “Once he wrapped we immediately hit the road for Georgia to tour devastation from hurricane Helene,” the Press Secretary shows us a clip of Trump taking a stroll at the devastated region.\n\nHer video ends with an admiration for her boss. Karoline says, “It’s always so inspiring to see how much hope President Trump brings to people across our country everywhere he goes, and with that, we’re back in West Palm Beach.”\n\nA month after the video, Trump was elected President, announcing that he would bring Leavitt to the White House, and so began her journey as the youngest Press Secretary ever.","summary":"Karoline Leavitt's day-to-day life as Donald Trump's White House Press Secretary is more interesting than you think.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/karoline-leavitt-claims-nobody-works-harder-than-trump-see-what-her-crazy-schedule-looks-like","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Donald-Trump-and-Karoline-Leavitt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 14:52:08","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.261},{"id":304807896,"title":"The Latest: Canada PM calls Trump tariffs a 'direct attack;' Trump downplays Signal exposure (World)","text":"The United Auto Workers leader is praising President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on vehicles and parts. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney says it’s a ‘direct attack’ on his nation, but he’ll need details before taking retaliatory measures. Mexico is already seeking “preferential treatment” to tax finished cars and not each component while parts cross borders.\n\nThere are no signs that the Signal chat controversy will fade soon for Trump, who has said he stands by his national security team and has assailed the credibility of the reporter who broke the story.\n\nThe Associated Press returned to a Washington courtroom to ask a judge to restore its full access to presidential events.\n\nAnd the president plans to sign more executive orders in Thursday’s latest news about politics and the Trump administration.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nMexico seeks preferential treatment for autos to protect jobs\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that Mexico does not want to be drawn into taking positions with each new U.S. tariff. She cited Trump’s taxes on aluminum and steel as well as his new ones on imported automobiles and auto parts.\n\n“There shouldn’t be any tariffs, that is the essence of the commercial treaty” the first Trump administration signed with Mexico and Canada, she said.\n\nUpdating the Mexican people on his team’s efforts in Washington, Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said they had more than half a dozen meetings with top Trump officials, but once Trump was moving ahead, they shifted gears to seek preferential treatment.\n\nNow he said both sides are discussing how that could work: The basic idea is that automobiles exported from Mexico would not face the full 25% tariff, but rather would be taxed based on where their components came from.\n\nWhite House spotlights UAW cheering Trump’s auto tariffs\n\nThe Trump administration is eagerly noting that United Auto Workers union president Shawn Fain, who endorsed the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, is welcoming Trump’s 25% auto tariff.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Fain “wasn’t the greatest fan” of Trump, but still has “applauded the president for this move.”\n\nFain on Wednesday said of Trump’s tariffs announcement, “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”\n\nAttorney General seems disinclined to investigate top Trump administration officials over Signal chat exposure\n\nWhen asked at an unrelated news conference what the Justice Department plans to do about top national security officials using a messaging app to discuss details of a planned military attack, Pam Bondi declined to comment and deflected.\n\nShe also insisted that none of the information shared on Signal was classified, even though officials have provided no evidence that that’s the case.\n\nEspionage Act statutes require the safe handling of closely held national defense information even if it’s not marked classified.\n\nBondi, who has pledged not to play politics with the department, quickly pivoted to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Joe Biden, who were investigated for allegations that they mishandled classified information but were not charged. Both Democrats were subject to extensive criminal investigations and the FBI and Justice Department have long track records of such inquiries.\n\nThe US Health and Human Services agency says it will eliminate 10,000 jobs\n\nThursday’s announcement by the agency responsible for monitoring infectious diseases, inspecting foods and hospitals and overseeing health insurance programs for nearly half the country says its workforce will shrink from 82,000 to 62,000 positions.\n\nThe cuts include layoffs, early retirements and voluntary separations, encouraged through buyout offers and will mostly affect the public health agencies:\n\n1. the Food and Drug Administration, responsible for setting standards for Americans’ foods and medications, will shed 3,500 workers\n\n2. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks infectious disease outbreaks, will cut 2,400 positions.\n\n3. the National Institutes for Health, the world’s leading public health research agency, will lose 1,200 people.\n\n4. the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees health coverage for older and poor Americans, will shed 300 jobs.\n\n\n\nVaccines group Gavi says US has not confirmed it will end funding\n\nThe global vaccines group that helps immunize more than half the world’s children against infectious diseases could lose more than $1 billion in pledged U.S. funding, according to a USAID spreadsheet that leaked this week.\n\nBut the Gavi alliance ’s chief executive said Thursday that the U.S government hasn’t confirmed the proposed cuts.\n\nDr. Sania Nishtar said Gavi is “engaging with the White House and Congress,” to secure the funding.\n\nThe 281-page spreadsheet detailing plans to terminate 5,341 awards to dozens of groups was first reported on by The New York Times.\n\nGavi says it has averted nearly 19 million deaths by helping to vaccinate more than 1 billion children in 78 poorer countries against diseases including measles, Ebola and malaria.\n\nEurope lashes out over Trump auto tariffs and the economic threat to both continents\n\nEuropean automakers, already struggling with tepid economic growth at home and rising competition from China, on Thursday decried the U.S. import tax on cars as a heavy burden that will punish consumers and companies alike on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe new 25% import tax announced by Trump “will hurt global automakers and US manufacturing at the same time,” the European Automobile Manufacturers’ association said in a statement.\n\nThe head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the tariffs would weigh on car makers and every company in the deeply interwoven global supply chain “with negative consequences above all for consumers, including in North America.”\n\n“The consequences will cost growth and prosperity on all sides,” Hildegard Müller said in a statement.\n\nThe stakes are enormous for BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Stellantis and their vast network of suppliers, as well as the entire European economy.\n\nDefense secretary minimizes Signal chat exposure\n\nThere are no signs that the Signal chat controversy will fade soon for Trump, who has said he stands by his national security team and has assailed the credibility of the reporter who broke the story.\n\nPete Hegseth told reporters in Hawaii he had not texted “war plans” or “attack plans” in the Signal group, pointing out he had called his post a “team update.”\n\n“My job, as it said atop of that (post), everybody’s seen it now - ‘TEAM UPDATE’ - is to provide updates in real time, general updates in real time, keep people informed,” he said before boarding a plane for Guam without taking follow-up questions. “That’s what I did. That’s my job.”\n\nTrump furious that judge whose impeachment he’s called for assigned Signal lawsuit\n\nThe president showed his fury on social media early Thursday, declaring it “disgraceful” that U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has been assigned another hot button case involving the Trump administration.\n\nCases are randomly assigned to the 20 judges in the Washington court.\n\nBoasberg was assigned on Wednesday to preside over a lawsuit filed by the group American Oversight against several Trump administration officials and the National Archives and Records Administration. It alleges they violated federal recordkeeping laws when they used a Signal chat group to discuss military strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nBoasberg’s assignment to the Signal lawsuit came just two days after the Trump administration, in the Venezuela deportation case, invoked the “state secrets” privilege to refuse to share details with the judge about the timing of deportation flights to El Salvador.\n\n“There is no way for a Republican, especially a TRUMP REPUBLICAN, to win before him,” Trump said. He added that Boasberg is “Highly Conflicted.” Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg.\n\nUS cities located in states won by Trump would be most hurt by Canadian tariffs, an analysis finds\n\nThe U.S. cities most vulnerable to a trade war with Canada turn out to largely be in the states that helped return Donald Trump to the White House — a sign of the possible political risk he’s taking with his tariff plans.\n\nA new analysis released Thursday by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce detailed the areas most dependent on exports to Canada, with San Antonio and Detroit topping the list of 41 U.S. metro areas. The findings show that the United States’ 25% tariffs on Canada and Canada’s retaliations could inflict meaningful damage in key states for U.S. politics.\n\nThe analysis was conducted before Trump announced Wednesday that he was placing additional 25% tariffs on imported autos and parts starting on April 3.\n\nTrump has begun another trade war. Here’s a timeline of how we got here\n\nLong-threatened tariffs from Trump have plunged the country into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.\n\nTrump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products ranging from fruit to automotive imports. Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.\n\nFast-forward to today and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trump’s more sweeping tariffs this time around — and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill. There’s also been a sense of whiplash from Trump’s back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation, including some recently-postponed taxes on goods from America’s largest trading partners.\n\nCanadian prime minister says Trump’s auto tariffs are a ‘direct attack’ on his country\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says he needs to see the details of Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations.\n\nCarney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAutos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries. Carney says it is appropriate that he and Trump speak on the phone. The two have not spoken since Carney was sworn in March 14.\n\nAP returning to court in suit against the Trump administration\n\nThe Associated Press is returning to a Washington courtroom Thursday to ask a judge to restore its full access to presidential events. That’s weeks after the White House retaliated against the news outlet last month for not following President Trump’s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn a previous hearing last month, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden refused the AP’s request for an injunction to stop the White House from barring reporters and photographers from events in the Oval Office and Air Force One. He urged the Trump administration to reconsider its ban before Thursday’s hearing. It hasn’t.\n\nThe AP has said it needs to take a stand against Trump’s team for punishing a news organization for using speech that it doesn’t like. The news outlet said it would still refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its style guidance to clients around the world, while also noting that Trump has renamed it the Gulf of America. The White House said it has the right to decide who gets to question the president.\n\n“For anyone who thinks the Associated Press’s lawsuit against President Trump’s White House is about the name of a body of water, think bigger,” Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, wrote in an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal. “It’s really about whether the government can control what you say.”\n\nThe president has dismissed the AP as a group of “radical left lunatics” and said that “we’re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.”","summary":"The United Auto Workers leader is praising President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s 25% tariffs on vehicles and parts.

And he left the spreadsheet with another Harris aide.' \n\nBiden, at 81, was the oldest person ever to be sworn in as president. Donald Trump railed against his rival's age and questioned Biden's mental abilities, referring to him as 'Sleepy Joe.'\n\nDemocrats publicly defended Biden but, it turns out, they were privately preparing to replace him.\n\nHarris' Chief of Staff Lorraine Voles had been working on a contingency plan since November 19, 2021. That was the day Biden temporarily signed over presidential power to Harris when he underwent a colonoscopy.\n\nThe vice president's team launched a stealth operation to have a plan ready in case they needed to take over, author Chris Whipple reveals in his upcoming book 'Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds,' which is out next month.\n\nA Democratic operative told Whipple: 'We just feel like we should put a plan in place. Maybe something happens,' according to an excerpt of the book in Vanity Fair.\n\nBiden dropped out of the presidential race on July 21, 2024 following his disastrous debate with Trump. \n\nBut Parnes and Allen reveal in their book their were questions about Biden's fitness from Democrats leading up to that point.\n\n'A handful of Democratic National Committee officials already had considered contingency plans,' Allen and Parnes write. 'In hush-hush talks starting in 2023, these officials gamed out Biden-withdrawal scenarios, according to two people familiar with them.\n\n'They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance: if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue. If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination.'\n\nBiden stubbornly remained in the race, encouraged to do so by first lady Jill Biden and their son Hunter Biden.\n\nHe was so stubborn it took a month after the debate - and an intense pressure campaign from Democratic officials - to get him to step aside. \n\nBecause in the days after the debate, the worries continued.\n\nTwo days after Biden fumbled on the Atlanta debate stage, he was in New Jersey for a fundraiser with Gov. Phil Murphy. \n\nHe needed to have florescent tape on the carpet, 'colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk'.\n\n'He knows to look for that,' an aide said.\n\nAt the event, Biden spoke haltingly when he answered questions and needed cues for his remarks.\n\nThat wasn't the only fundraiser that sparked concern. Those closed door events are filled with loyal Democrats whose financial support is critical to winning elections. It's a chance for candidates to make a lasting impression.\n\nBiden was not doing that. \n\nActor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling for Biden to leave the race just weeks after he and other Hollywood stars helped raise $30 million for Biden at a Los Angeles fundraiser. \n\n'I was raised to tell the truth,' Clooney told '60 Minutes' Sunday of his piece. \n\n'I had seen the president up close for his fundraiser, and I was surprised, and so I feel as if there were a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that, and I also believed I had to tell the truth.' \n\nClooney's essay sent shock waves through the public and led to a pile on of voices calling for Biden to step aside.\n\nHe did so, after repeated urging and a call from Nancy Pelosi, as DailyMail.com previously reported.\n\nBiden promptly endorsed Harris but the vice president was not the top choice of everyone.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Barack Obama wanted a primary. And Obama favored having a governor, not Harris, as the nominee, Whipple reported in his book.\n\nHarris, however, quickly garnered support among the party faithful and locked up the nomination within a week.\n\nA Democratic operative told Parnes and Allen of their worry they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: 'Well, at least she has a pulse.' \n\nHarris suffered a massive loss to Trump despite spending billions of dollars on her presidential campaign.","summary":"Democrats close to Kamala Harris established a secret 'death pool' in case President Joe Biden died in office and the vice president needed to be sworn in.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14543237/Inside-secret-Democrat-death-pool-talks-early-2023-prepare-case-Biden-DIED-office.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/27/14/96634621-0-image-a-8_1743084755918.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 14:21:50","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":304774976,"title":"Trump’s trade policy is misguided but don’t be quick to blame tariffs","text":"As the clock ticks down to Donald Trump’s planned imposition of “reciprocal tariffs” on US trade partners on April 2, Trump’s opponents have been attacking tariffs as a price-raising menace, rather than indicting Trump’s two-month master class on how to misuse a potentially effective policy tool.\nMany Democrats seem to have forgotten that Joe Biden increased the size and scope of the first Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from China. And while Biden raised tariffs in 2024, inflation still started to decline.\nBiden’s combination of tariffs and industrial policies to boost demand for domestic goods and incentivise investment delivered the manufacturing boom that Trump keeps promising. Instead of trumpeting this achievement, the Democrats’ 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris attacked Trump’s proposed tariffs in a campaign that lost a majority of working-class voters.\nNow, instead of attacking Trump’s misguided notion that tariffs alone can revive American manufacturing, and highlighting his plan to kill the industrial policies that will deliver new manufacturing jobs, Democrats have doubled down.\nBranding tariffs as Trumpian is a mistake. If you support a carbon border tax to combat climate change or enforcement of labour standards in trade pacts, you support tariffs. And tariffs are popular. Shortly before the US presidential election, 56 per cent of Americans favoured increasing tariffs.\nThe damage Trump has caused since taking office in January is not due to tariffs per se but the economic uncertainty caused by constant tariff changes and the targeting of non-trade-related goals, like migration, fentanyl trafficking and countries like Canada – with which the US has a non-oil trade surplus. Riding Trump’s tariff roller coaster, prospective US manufacturing investors are more likely to reach for a barf bag than their chequebooks.\n\nEven so, a March CBS poll found Americans still wanted higher tariffs against China. Are they wrong? Core elements of the post-war Bretton Woods system are either incompatible with today’s realities or have been entirely eliminated, like fixed exchange rates.\nA chronically overvalued dollar means that imported goods denominated in other currencies crush even the most efficient US producers. Meanwhile, decades of liberalisation of capital flows, together with powerfully enforced investor rights, have led to the offshoring of even high-end manufacturing to low-wage countries.\nThe result has been a persistent US global trade deficit since 1975, including US$918.4 billion in 2024. As economic theory would predict, de-industrialisation and greater economic inequality followed. The North American Free Trade Agreement and the emergence of the World Trade Organization in the mid-1990s, together with China’s accession to the WTO in 2001, turned the gradual decline of US manufacturing capacity since the early 1980s into a rout.\nThe US has since lost more than 90,000 factories and now produces dollar-denominated assets bought by foreigners with the billions of dollars they earn by selling Americans their goods. This has been extremely profitable for the US economy’s financialised sectors and wealthy investors – and a disaster for many.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. Sixty-three per cent of Americans could not cover a US$500 emergency expense, while so-called deaths of despair among working-age Americans – from suicide, alcohol-related diseases and drugs – decreased overall US life expectancy starting in 2015. Former factory towns nationwide have been shattered.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. The Covid-19 crisis demonstrated the perils of having production of many essential goods concentrated in too few countries, which US military analysts consider a national security risk. The US can create good jobs and restore a sense of security for the 62 per cent of American workers without college degrees by boosting domestic production of products essential to Americans’ health, safety and security. This, and diversifying the sources of US imports, can strengthen US national resilience and security.\nTariffs will be part of the fix because the problem is on the import side. America cannot export its way to balance. Anti-dumping, subsidies and WTO enforcement cases have not stopped this. If deficit countries united to raise tariffs on surplus countries, it would not only help rebalance trade but also benefit their workers.\nAs offshoring has moved into higher-wage work, the main premise of free trade gains – that even if some people lose their jobs, everyone benefits from access to cheaper imported goods – has collapsed. US workers now lose more in wages than they gain from cheap imports.\n\nTariffs are not the panacea Trump claims, but they also do not always raise consumer prices. Tariffs are charged on the wholesale price of imported goods. Whether these costs are passed on to consumers is a choice made by companies that import tariffed goods. A National Bureau of Economic Research study showed few retail price increases after the 2018 China tariffs, because companies absorbed the cost from their profit margins instead.\nOn the other hand, some firms use tariffs as cover to increase their margins. Strong enforcement of competition policy can combat price increases during the necessary transition to more balanced trade.\nTo reap the benefits of trade, it is critical that the US cut its large chronic trade deficit. Trump’s focus on “reciprocal tariffs”, rather than balanced trade, does not suggest an intention to use tariffs strategically to achieve this. But Democrats must stop dismissing outright a policy tool that they themselves embraced under Biden. The question they should focus on is whether Trump’s tariffs will help or hurt Americans.\nCopyright: Project Syndicate","summary":"Instead of attacking the use of tariffs, the Trump administration’s domestic critics should consider their popularity and effectiveness.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3304085/trumps-trade-policy-misguided-dont-be-quick-blame-tariffs","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/27/ec38fc80-2727-4f39-826b-beb84f26b0e0_402eb176.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 13:30:07","author":"Lori Wallach","authors":["Lori Wallach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":304790182,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Aides Had a Secret Plan for Biden’s Death During Presidency—What Were They Really Preparing For?","text":"Kamala Harris’s team was reportedly ready to get her in the Presidential race just in case things went south with Joe Biden.

Uh, what?! Is that why outlets like Politico were adamant that Vice President Kamala Harris was riding a so-called “dream economy” into the election because they were just continually “highlighting” or “inventing bad news?”\n\nHow about when Politico praised Biden’s “‘holy grail’” economy or when The New York Times ran the headline “The Economy Looks Sunny, a Potential Gain for Biden” on the same day in February 2024 alone?\n\nHow about The Washington Post’s repeated treatment of voters as idiots for not realizing how great the Biden economy supposedly was? Or how about this beauty from The Times from July 25, 2024, “2025 Could Be a Great Time to Be President, Economically Speaking?” Here’s another absurd pre-election gem from The Times, “The Economy Looks Strong as Election Day Nears.” \n\nInsanity doesn’t even begin to describe Baker’s ridiculous historical revisionism, but luckily the MRC has the video records of the media’s general treatment of the Biden economy during his presidency. Grab some popcorn, watch the clip below and judge for yourself.\n\nMedia: The Economy Is Actually 'Fantastic,' Voters Are Just Too Dumb To Notice\n\nIn a nutshell, the media was doing the very pro-Bidenomics tribal dancing that Baker made it seem like was non-existent. Instead, he cherry-picked just two stories from The Times, one from The Post and a generic allusion to media that reported recent college graduates couldn’t find work as his evidence to back up his claims that the media writ large was just pooh-poohing Biden’s economic record. That was it. But Baker doubled down:\n\nThese are some of my highlights, but the point is the ‘bad economy’ was a repeated theme of the media’s reporting throughout the Biden years. I don’t expect the media to tell people how to feel about the economy, we all know people hate inflation and everyone has heard the story that workers think they have ‘earned’ their pay increases, while inflation is the government’s fault, but this doesn’t justify the media’s mis-representing reality to tell a story that isn’t true.\n\nBaker’s faux-furor over the media stemmed from his citation of new data from another leftist anti-free market think tank heavily funded by Soros, the Economic Policy Institute, suggesting that low-end, minimum wage workers experienced supposedly explosive wage growth for the year 2024, “bucking historical trends.” “It shows that workers, especially those at the bottom of the wage distribution, had substantial real wage gains since the pandemic,” claimed Baker. He embellished further: “[T]here were long periods over the last half-century where wages for lower and middle-wage workers did not keep pace with inflation. In the last five years, they not only kept pace, but hugely exceeded inflation.”\n\nNot so fast. Research was also released by Statista in February 2025, which found that “[d]espite the level of wage growth reaching 6.7 percent in the summer of 2022, it has not been enough to curb the impact of even higher inflation rates. The federally mandated minimum wage in the United States has not increased since 2009, meaning that individuals working minimum wage jobs have taken a real terms pay cut for the last twelve years.” \n\nThe other inconvenient factoid about the EPI report Baker is waving around like a foam finger at a ballgame is that he apparently distorted the findings. There’s a surprise (not)! MarketPlace, which covered the same report that Baker did, was much more upfront about what the EPI data really showed: “The lowest paid workers saw wages rise since the pandemic, but many still struggle.” MarketPlace turned to W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research Senior Economist Brad Hershbein, who “said even with that jump in wages many of the lowest-paid workers are still struggling, and that inflation has hit them particularly hard. ‘[Those workers] tend to buy things that are more subject to inflation, and those things also represent a larger share of all the things that they buy,’ he said.”\n\nBaker is virtually guilty of committing the very media gaslighting on the Biden economy that MRC Business had been reporting on for years in effectively telling struggling Americans: Stop complaining, you’re actually doing great economically but you’re just too dumb to see it. Real estate company Redfin released another report February 24, 2025, which found that “[t]he average minimum-wage earner in the U.S. would have to work 106 hours per week to afford the $1,599 median-priced apartment.” \n\nThis was a minor step down from the “125 hours” peak in 2022 when the inflation rate hit 40-year highs and the median asking rent was over $1,700, but Redfin noted that this was still “20.4% ($271) higher than pre-pandemic (January 2020) levels.”\n\n\"A rule of thumb in personal finance is that people should spend no more than 30% of their earnings on housing, though this rule has become harder to follow as housing costs have soared,” Redfin stated. “Many minimum-wage workers are spending over 30% to make ends meet. Many are also living in apartments with below-average rents.” \n\nAnother March 2025 report from MortgagePoint found that “more than half of Americans say they feel ‘overwhelmed’ by rising utility costs, mortgage payments, and rent, leaving many consumers with little money left over after paying their monthly housing expenses,” based on new research from American Home Shield. Just on energy bills alone in the past year, “Americans reported an average rate increase of 11%, and more than three out of five are unaware of the reasons for these increases,” MortgagePoint reported.\n\nDoes that sound like an economy that Americans should be just tickled pink over, Baker?\n\nNewsBusters Media Editor Bill D'Agostino contributed to this report.","summary":"It’s apparently Opposite Day.

The American President’s net worth now stands at around $4.5 billion and Harris’ is, as reported by Forbes, around $8 million.\n\nThe difference between the net worths of these two is huge and even with a new book deal coming in, Harris is not likely to get anywhere closer to where Trump stands. This new book, which would be talking about her experiences with Joe Biden at the White House, has reportedly secured a deal of $20 million, which is the largest deal that any VP in history has been able to make.\n\nHarris’ memoir did help her add some value to her net worth as, “In 2018, she made around $320,000 from her memoir The Truths We Hold, and in 2019, she earned around $280,000 in book publishing advances, putting her total income from her memoir over half a million dollars.”\n\nMoreover, in her career, which includes her positions as district attorney of San Francisco, U.S. Senator, and eventually Vice President, she never made more than $235,000 per year. Therefore, the major part of her net worth comes from her marriage with Doug Emhoff, who earned $1 million a year when he worked as a big shot entertainment lawyer. \n\nAs reported by Town & Country, “Since Harris and Emhoff began filing joint taxes, the couple has reported over $1 million in income per year. However, once Harris assumed the Vice Presidency, Emhoff left his job and joined Georgetown University’s law school as a member of faculty, and his income has dropped to around $200,000 per year.”\n\n在 Instagram 查看这篇帖子\n\nTown & Country further reported about the home of Harris and Emhoff that the latter purchased in 2012. It was mentioned, “The estimated market value on the home, per Zillow, is around $5 million. (Forbes estimates it around $4.4 million.) When Harris became Vice President, she sold her San Francisco apartment and D.C. apartment.”\n\nWhile this stands to be the present net worth of the former American VP, if Harris had successfully risen the ranks and went on to become the American President, her pay cheques would have reached $400,000, which would have contributed significantly to increase her net worth.","summary":"A major part of Kamala Harris’ net worth comes from her marriage with Doug Emhoff.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-wealth-comes-nowhere-near-trumps-ex-vps-net-worth-revealed","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kamala-Harris-net-worth-is-significantly-less-than-Donald-Trump1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 12:52:36","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.116},{"id":304761630,"title":"Exclusive: Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republicans Call to Unleash Broadband Development from 'Woke' Biden Regulations","text":"Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senate Republicans on Thursday called for the Trump administration to remove “woke,” climate change, and extraneous regulations that hampered the expansion of broadband internet.\n\nThune and the Senate Commerce Committee Republicans wrote to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as the secretary has committed to a “rigorous review” of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, a $42.5 billion program tucked within the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\n03.27.25 Thune Letter to Lutnick Re BEAD by Breitbart News on Scribd\n\nThe program sought to dramatically expand Americans’ access to broadband internet; however, as congressional Republicans and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr have pointed out, the program has largely failed to connect Americans with internet.\n\nSens.

The confusion over how to comply with this rule led to a significant delay in Virginia’s BEAD broadband deployment.\nEligible projects must account for “climate-related” risks, which was not included in the infrastructure bill text\nThe Biden-Harris administration has an inconsistent waiver process to ensure speedy deployment for the purchasing of broadband products and supplies from American workers and businesses.\n\nHowever, now with Lutnick leading the Commerce Department, Thune and Senate Republicans believe that the BEAD program can finally expand internet access to all Americans despite the heavy obstacles the Biden administration set out for the program.\n\n“Under your leadership, the BEAD program can finally fulfill its long overdue mission and ensure taxpayer dollars are not spent funding extraneous, burdensome regulations,” Thune and the Senate Republicans continued. “Eliminating these obstacles will empower states to work closely with broadband providers and accelerate deployment, maximize resources, and reach truly unserved and underserved communities without any more delay caused by unnecessary government interference.”\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

Democrats will seek to capitalize on growing frustration with the Trump administration, while Republicans are hoping the voters who supported Trump in November will stay loyal and come out again in an off-year spring election.Elon Musk-funded groups have spent $10 million backing Schimel, The Associated Press reported. Altogether, he and his supporters have spent about $41 million, while Crawford and her crew have spent about $32 million.Polls show that voters are split over who to back in the Supreme Court race. But some have given Crawford a small lead.The most recent poll, by SoCal Strategies, conducted between March 25-26 among 500 registered and likely voters, gave Crawford a 50-42 lead over Schimel.Crawford also had the lead among white voters, who make up 83 percent of Wisconsin's population, according to PRRI's 2023 American Values Atlas. Among the demographic, Crawford was leading Schimel with 49 percent to his 45 percent. According to the poll, 89 percent of Black voters also backed Crawford. No Black voters backed Schimel, while 11 percent said they were undecided.But Hispanic voters were divided, each candidate favored by 49 percent of those surveyed.Crawford also had the lead among male and female voters, and voters in every age group other than the 30-44 age group, who were evenly divided. She also leads among voters with a degree, as well as voters without a degree.Schimel was backed by 87 percent of voters who backed Trump in 2024, while Crawford was backed by 94 percent of voters who supported Kamala Harris.An RMG Research poll, among 800 registered voters from February 25 to February 28, also showed Crawford with a slight lead.Forty-two percent said they planned to back Crawford, while 35 percent leaned toward Schimel and 17 percent were undecided.But other polls have shown voters divided. A recent poll conducted by OnMessage Inc. and Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) showed Crawford and Schimel both on 47 percent, and 5 percent weren't sure. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters on March 9 and March 10. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.A TIPP Insights poll, which surveyed 1,045 registered voters from February 7 to February 11, also showed the race tied, each candidate receiving 38 percent of the vote. It had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.1 percent.A Marquette poll conducted between February 19-26 among 864 registered voters, found that 29 percent of respondents view Schimel favorably, while 32 percent view him unfavorably. Nineteen percent view Crawford favorably, compared with 23 percent who view her unfavorably.The same poll found that voters are unfamiliar with both candidates. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they don't know enough about Schimel to make a decision about him, while 58 percent said they don't know enough about Crawford to form an opinion.However, early voting data suggests the race is anything but low-profile.After early voting commenced in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this week, electoral data shows that turnout is far exceeding levels from the last Supreme Court race two years ago. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, nearly 48 percent more early ballots have been cast compared with the same point two years ago, with more than 345,000 voters returning ballots, either by mail or in person, compared with about 233,000 at this point two years ago.Wisconsin voters do not register by political party, making it difficult to determine how many early ballots come from Republicans or Democrats. However, data shows significant increases in early voting across both Democratic- and Republican-leaning counties.Milwaukee County, the state's largest and a Democratic stronghold, leads with 54,750 ballots returned—46 percent more than at this point two years ago. Liberal Dane County, home to the state capital and the University of Wisconsin, saw a similar 46 percent rise.Republican-leaning areas have also seen sharp increases. In the suburban Milwaukee WOW counties—Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington—ballot returns surged by over 62 percent in Waukesha and 51 percent in Ozaukee. In Washington, the most Republican of the three, early voting had more than doubled compared to two years ago. Brown County, another GOP-leaning area, reported a 34 percent increase in early turnout.What People Are SayingWMC Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said: \"Like many Wisconsin statewide elections, this race is very close and will come down to the wire. This is a winnable race for either candidate right now, and will simply boil down to whichever side does a better job of getting out their voters. It really cannot be overstated how much is on the line.\"Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette poll, said: \"Voters are interested in the race in general, but they just don't know that much about the candidates.\"Donald Trump wrote in a Truth Social post late last week: \"All Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel.\"Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told supporters on Monday that electing Crawford was important so she and other liberal justices can order a redraw of congressional boundary lines. \"As soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines,\" Jeffries said in a live discussion on the social media platform X. \"The only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\"What Happens NextThe election result is expected shortly after polling closes on April 1.","summary":"Crawford is running against Republican Donald Trump backed candidate Brad Schimel for a spot on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/wisconsin-supreme-court-race-polls-susan-crawford-brad-schimel-2051318","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2615750/wisconsin-supreme-court.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 12:15:41","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":304744118,"title":"Do you sometimes feel as if your timeshare is holding you hostage?

According to a polling aggregate by CNN’s Harry Enten, Trump’s favorability ratings, though slightly underwater, are higher this month than at a comparable point in 2017 or when he won the election in November. \n\nSimilarly, while a small majority of people still tell pollsters the country is on the wrong track, the percentage saying it is moving in the right direction has spiked since Trump took office. That number is at 40% or higher in six of the seven polls included in the latest RealClearPolitics average. An NBC News poll recorded its highest right direction percentage since 2004, Marist since 2009.\n\nMany voters who cast their ballots for Trump like what he is doing and are happier than when former President Joe Biden was in office. Those who pulled the lever for former Vice President Kamala Harris are unhappier, but there was a certain amount of progressive discontent with Biden.\n\nDemocrats hope all these numbers will get much worse for Trump as tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding their implementation sap the economy. They also believe their base’s backlash against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency will spread to the rest of the electorate as essential public services are eventually affected. \n\nHistorically, the party controlling the White House loses congressional seats in the midterm elections. Right now, Republicans hold what political analysts like to call the “trifecta” — the House, Senate, and presidency. \n\nBut Republicans underperformed in a similar scenario in 2022, winning the House but falling short of taking control of the Senate back from the Democrats. Other exceptions to the general rule include the 2002 midterm elections, which occurred a little more than a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 1998 elections that took place after congressional Republicans impeached then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nThere are also fewer swing districts than before, as Republicans already hold the reddest and Democrats the bluest seats in the country. This was a problem for House Republicans in 2022 and could hamper their Democratic counterparts next year.\n\nDemocrats held their own in the Senate, actually picking up a seat in 2022, thanks in part to weak Republican candidates. But that only got them from 50-50, with Harris breaking ties, to 51-49. After last year’s elections, Democrats are down to 47 Senate seats against the GOP’s 53.\n\nDemocrats posted record-low favorability ratings in recent polls. CNN found 29% viewed the party favorably, the lowest in the network’s polling dating back to 1992. NBC News also found just 27% viewed the Democrats favorably, a low in their polling since 1990. At least some of this is progressive disenchantment with the party rather than a swing to the right, however.\n\nThe angry protests spearheaded by the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), along with the organized demonstrations at Republican lawmakers’ town hall meetings, could be a sign of organic progressive energy. Or, along with anti-Tesla violence targeting Musk’s bottom line, they could repel the wider electorate.\n\nYet Democrats still have hope even without a course correction or DOGE and the tariffs eroding Trump’s standing. Their base now includes many high-propensity voters sure to show up for the midterm elections. Republicans may struggle to turn out the lower-propensity voters who brought Trump back to the White House without the president himself on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats won a special election in Pennsylvania this week in a predominantly Republican district. Democrats also flipped an Iowa state Senate seat eight weeks earlier and only narrowly lost a special House election in the Hawkeye State earlier this month, suggesting the pattern of overperformance in the off-year elections may be continuing. Republicans are currently worried about a special congressional election in Florida next week.\n\nTHE CENTRISTS ARE LOSING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY’S CIVIL WAR\n\nThe two parties are closely matched in generic congressional ballot polls, in which respondents say whether they want Capitol Hill to be run by Republicans or Democrats. \n\nTrump is proceeding as if he needs to get as much as possible done before the midterm elections, and the inevitable subsequent shift to the 2028 presidential election, in which he is currently constitutionally ineligible to run. Republicans will defend a razor-thin House majority next year.","summary":"Both parties are seeing mixed signals from the data 19 months ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, less than 100 days into President Donald Trump’s second term.

Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes’ account of the campaign that followed, will be published next week – as Trump’s second term enters its third tempestuous month. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nPublished extracts from the book have described controversial episodes from Harris’s short campaign and conclusive defeat, including her inability to land an interview with the influential podcaster Joe Rogan, in contrast to Trump, and her frustration with close control maintained by former aides to Biden.\n\nLong an issue for Democrats, the question of Biden’s age and fitness came to a head on 27 June, when the president performed disastrously onstage with Trump in Atlanta. Parnes and Allen provide detailed and dramatic insights into the crisis.\n\nAmid calls for Biden to withdraw, the authors write, aides to Biden “frantically push[ed] back in phone calls and in text messages, accusing donors of promoting their own agendas at the expense of Biden, the party, and the country”.\n\nParnes and Allen then switch to using italics, which they say indicates sources describing personal thoughts or descriptions of the private thoughts and conversations of others.\n\n“It all sounded like a serial killer’s conspiracy theory. Donors want to scrap Biden so they can get his wannabe replacements – the governors, with power over state decisions – to beg them for cash, Biden aides argued.\n\n“This isn’t fucking Wall Street financiers versus Ivy League presidents. Our guy isn’t scared of your money. We have grassroots donors. We have the support of the voters. We have the nomination in hand. All you’re doing is fucking yourself and the president. We will remember this. Capisce?\n\n“The last threat, the ace in the hole, was Kamala Harris. Even if Biden did drop out and you got your dreamed-up open convention, you would only succeed in nominating the vice-president. Is that what you want? You want her? Look at her polling. No one wants her. Forget it. It’s never gonna happen.”\n\nEntreaties fell on deaf ears. Donors “cut off hundreds of millions of dollars”. On 21 July, Biden dropped out.\n\nIt was a historic moment but the party moved swiftly to avoid further upheaval. There would be no open convention. Instead, Allen and Parnes describe how opposition to Harris, even from grandees including the former president Barack Obama and the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was beaten aside by figures including Jim Clyburn, the veteran South Carolina congressman who did much to make Biden the nominee and Harris his running mate just four years before.\n\n“There are some powerful folks saying, ‘Off with both their heads,’ Clyburn thought. They’re all planning to pass over Kamala.”\n\nParnes and Allen also describe how before becoming the nominee, and for a time after, Harris “pined” for Obama’s support. A painful process, it was made worse by Harris never having forged close ties with the former president and his wife, Michelle, ever since being denied access to a VIP area at the Obamas’ election celebration in Chicago in 2009.\n\n“Doesn’t he see what’s happening? she thought. Harris felt hurt that he thought so little of her. That pain turned to anger. What’s holding him back?”\n\nAccording to Parnes and Allen, Obama never thought Harris could beat Trump but backed her when he saw he was under threat himself, “suddenly in a position where his actions against Biden and Harris could diminish him in the eyes of Democratic elites”.\n\nObama endorsed Harris and campaigned for her. So did Pelosi, who spoke of her “immense pride” in doing so.\n\nParnes and Allen report a less positive verdict from the former speaker. According to an unnamed “person who spoke to” Pelosi on the night of the Atlanta debate, Pelosi “actually was worried … saying, ‘Oh my God, it’s going to be her.’”","summary":"Top aides ‘aggressively’ made case to Democratic donors last summer, according to account of 2024 campaign by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes\n\nTop aides to Joe Biden “aggressively” warned Democratic donors last summer that if the then president was forced out of the 2024 election over concerns about his age and fitness, the party would inevitably make the “mistake” of running the vice-president, Kamala Harris, against Donald Trump, a new book says.\n\n“One donor on the receiving end of an electronic message summed up the sentiments of Biden’s top aides: ‘They were aggressively saying that we would wind up with the vice-president and that would be a mistake.’”\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/27/biden-dropping-out-kamala-harris","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502f10596adda0263d272cafad3bc8375a036774/0_0_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 10:00:23","author":"Martin Pengelly","authors":["Martin Pengelly"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":304699248,"title":"Republicans fret about Florida special election in red district: ‘Set off alarm bells’","text":"In addition, officials have raised concerns that Democrats have been running slightly ahead of Republicans according to early voting data in a district composed of 49% Republicans and 25.5% Democrats, according to the Florida Division of Elections website. \n\nWeil and Fine are facing off in the special election on April 1 to replace former Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, who resigned from his seat in January when he was tapped by Trump to become the U.S. national security adviser.\n\n“On the early days of early voting, it was alarming to us, because the first day, we didn’t see a very big turnout. And so a small turnout can obviously lead to very inopportune outcomes,” said Vic Baker, a committee member for the Volusia County GOP. \n\nBaker said he believes Weil’s massive cash infusion has made a difference specifically when it comes to media exposure and has the potential to make the race more competitive than expected. \n\n“They have saturated the airwaves. They’ve put signs up everywhere. They took out full-page ads in newspapers. They have left no inch of turf untouched. In terms of the campaign, it’s been an absolute blitzkrieg from that side,” he said, speaking with the Washington Examiner. “Obviously, that set off alarm bells because normally you know — Mike Waltz and Trump handily won this district.”\n\nWaltz won by more than 30 points in November 2024 and Trump beat then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 30 points in the same district. However, a recent poll from St. Pete Polls showed the race within the poll’s margin of error, with Fine ahead by 48% of the vote, while Weil received 44%. The poll of 403 likely voters was conducted on March 22 with a 4.9% margin of error.\n\nBaker expressed skepticism about the poll, questioning the reliability due to the small sample size and margin of error. He suggested that Republicans would ultimately support their candidate and downplayed Weil’s chances, despite his significant fundraising advantage.\n\n“I would say that it would be a political earthquake if a Republican lost a congressional race in this district, and I don’t think that we’re going to see a political earthquake next Tuesday,” he said.\n\nTrump has attempted to get the momentum moving in Fine’s direction, posting his support for the Republican again on Truth Social. Elon Musk’s super PAC is pouring last-minute resources into the race, spending roughly $10,200 in texting services, according to a federal campaign finance report filed on Monday. House Republicans in recent days have been calling donors to help fill in the gaps, according to three sources with knowledge.\n\nThe race is also notable due to Fine’s fraught relationship with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Fine notoriously turned on DeSantis during the 2024 GOP primary and flipped his endorsement to Trump after saying the governor hadn’t done enough to address antisemitism in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nDeSantis, who represented the same district from 2013 to 2018, said on Tuesday he expects Fine to underperform.\n\n“Regardless of the outcome in that, it’s going to be a way underperformance from what I won that district by in 2022 and what the president won it by in November,” DeSantis said Tuesday. “They’re going to try to lay that at the feet of President Trump. That is not a reflection of President Trump. It’s a reflection of a specific candidate running in that race.”\n\n“[Fine] has long been a thorn in DeSantis’s side, and Ron is more than happy to, you know, you know, stick the shiv in a little deeper and twist the knife,” said a Florida Republican operative, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “Knowing Ron in the way that he operates, he would be more than happy if Randy lost. He won’t say that publicly.”\n\n“[DeSantis] is not going out of his way to help him, that’s for sure,” the person added.\n\nBryan Piligra, Fine’s campaign spokesman, emphasizes Fine is fully committed to the race and is determined to defeat his opponent.\n\n“Randy Fine is taking nothing for granted and is personally invested in this race to ensure we stop socialist Josh Weil from stealing this seat and sabotaging President Trump’s agenda,” Piligra said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner. “Voters across the 6th District know Randy will fight unapologetically alongside President Trump to secure our borders, lower taxes, and protect Social Security for all Floridians.”\n\nTrump allies in the state believe Fine will ultimately win the race but have concerns that a closer race could be seen as an indicator of how the electorate is feeling.\n\n“Randy Fine is going to win the race. It’s just going to be much closer than a lot of people anticipate,” said Ford O’Connell, a Florida-based Republican strategist. \n\nO’Connell said Republicans need to draw enough attention to the race in the final stretch in an effort to prevent Democrats from pushing a broader narrative that they are competitive even in Republican strongholds as a result of what they perceive as widespread anger at Trump and Republicans. \n\n“The Republicans never want to give the Democrats right now, as they are lost in the wilderness, an ounce of oxygen,” O’Connell said.\n\nAnother special election, in the state’s 1st Congressional District, will also occur on April 1 to fill the vacancy left by former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz when he resigned from Congress late last year. Democratic candidate Gay Valimont managed to bring in nearly $6.4 million from Jan. 9 to March 12, surpassing Republican Jimmy Patronis’s $1.1 million during the same period. Concerns about Patronis are not as prevalent as those surrounding Fine.\n\nSome Democrats are pointing to a significant upset victory in a Republican-leaning state Senate race in Pennsylvania as a signal that the tide could be turning against Trump in his adopted home state of Florida.\n\nDemocrat James Malone narrowly defeated Republican Josh Parsons by less than 1 percentage point in the race for Pennsylvania’s state Senate District 36 on Tuesday, narrowing the GOP’s majority in the chamber to a 27-23 advantage. The district had been held by a Republican and was won by President Donald Trump last November in the presidential election with 57% of the vote. \n\nDEMOCRATS FIGHT TO GAIN FOOTHOLDS IN FLORIDA AS GOP CONCERNS RISE OVER FUNDRAISING\n\n“We look at that PA race and we think it signals that anything can happen,” a national Democratic operative said. “We’re aware those Florida races are a major uphill climb, there’s no doubt about it, but there are numerous signs that the American electorate is not pleased with what they are seeing in the White House.”\n\n“If we are able to close the gaps and show this was a tighter-than-expected result, it’s off to the races for 2026,” the person said.","summary":"Republican operatives in the Sunshine State fear a congressional special election race in a deep-red district could be closer than expected, which could inadvertently be seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump’s record ahead of the midterm elections in 2026.

For the first time in more than 20 years, by the study’s estimate, the world now has more autocracies (91) than democracies (88), with liberal democracies (29) now the least common regime type. Twenty-seven countries have transitioned from democracies to autocracies since 2005. “If autocratization starts in a democracy, the probability of surviving is very low,” the authors note. “The favorite weapon of autocratizers is media censorship.”\nAs for the United States, V-Dem researchers recorded a precipitous decline in the democracy index during the first term of Donald Trump and a partial recovery under President Joe Biden. In the first few months of Trump 2.0, the backsliding is accelerating rapidly. “The enabling silence among critics fearful of retribution is already prevalent,” the report notes.\nWhile V-Dem still classifies the US as a liberal democracy, two leading democracy scholars, Steven Levitsky and Lucan A. Way, believe America is on the cusp of a transition to an authoritarian system. “Authoritarianism does not require the destruction of the constitutional order,” they write in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs. “What lies ahead is not a fascist or single-party dictatorship, but competitive authoritarianism—a system in which parties compete in elections but the incumbent’s abuse of power tilts the playing field against the opposition.”\nV-Dem’s research indicates that a free press is a key bulwark against authoritarian consolidation and suggests the possible stakes in the battle over US press freedom. The media assault has already been well-documented. Anticipatory obedience is rife—from The Washington Post, which has gutted its opinion section, to ABC News, which chose to settle a libel suit filed by Trump rather than fight it. The Associated Press remains locked out of the White House press pool because it refuses to adopt the Trumpian denomination for the Gulf of Mexico. Pro-Trump influencers are displacing traditional media from the White House to the Pentagon. And Trump’s lawsuits are grinding ahead. In an action against CBS News, Trump has objected to the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris; CBS News refutes the charge. Trump claims The Des Moines Register committed fraud when it published a preelection poll showing Harris in the lead (though it is hard to argue for damages since Trump won Iowa—and the election); the Register and its parent company, Gannett, have described Trump’s case against them as meritless. The president has also gone after the Pulitzer Prize Board, saying it libeled him—libeled him?—when it defended its decision to honor The New York Times and Washington Post for reporting on Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US elections.\nAnother media assault has been less visible but more immediately consequential in terms of the consolidation of autocratic power: the takedown of Voice of America. The authors of Project 2025’s nearly 900-page “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise” offered Trump very specific guidance on what he should do with VOA and the other US media outlets funded by US taxpayers. The president, the report advised, should reform the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the agency that oversees those outlets, curtail its independence, trim its costs, and bring it under the direct control of the executive branch in order to “tell America’s story and promote freedom and democracy around the world.” In December, Trump announced that one of his staunch acolytes, election denier Kari Lake, was his choice to serve as director of VOA.\nJournalists I spoke to at VOA assumed that Lake, who had a long career as a TV reporter before launching unsuccessful campaigns for Arizona governor and senator, would try to turn Voice of America into the Voice of Trump, despite her claims to the contrary. They were alarmed because VOA’s mission as established in 1942 is to promote American soft power by showcasing the value of independent journalism, often in places where a free press does not exist. But they were not prepared for what happened next.\nWhile Lake’s official appointment as VOA director awaited the Senate confirmation of the next CEO of the USAGM, in early February, Elon Musk called for the broadcaster to be shut down altogether. Weeks later, Lake was named special adviser to the USAGM and sworn in on March 3. Soon thereafter, she reportedly showed up at VOA headquarters with several DOGE staffers in tow. On March 15, following an executive order from the president seeking to dismantle the USAGM, virtually the entire VOA staff, more than 1,300 people, were put on administrative leave, and full-time contractors had their contracts terminated. The legality of the whole undertaking is being challenged in a lawsuit filed March 21 that names Lake as a defendant.\nWhen VOA’s millions of viewers and listeners from around the world tuned in, they either got dead air or music on a loop. It reminded VOA veteran Steve Herman of covering coups abroad. “I’ve been on the ground in places around the world and all of a sudden the music comes on instead of the programing—it’s like, uh-oh, I know what’s happening,” says Herman—the chief national correspondent and former White House bureau chief, who had already been suspended by the USAGM over his social media activity, before the rest of his colleagues were put on leave. “The loss is incalculable to America’s image.”\nNext on the DOGE chopping block may be US public media: the NPR and PBS stations across the nation, which are also funded in part by American taxpayers. The DOGE Subcommittee of the Congress, led by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, heard testimony from the heads of NPR and PBS this week, and the proceedings had the aura of a show trial. “As we continue to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse, we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” said Greene in her closing statement, in which she said the committee would be calling for the organization to be dismantled and defunded. “From what we have heard here today, the American people will not allow such propaganda to be funded through the federal government.”\nOn average, NPR member stations receive about 10% of their revenue from the US Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is funded by Congress. Still, a cutoff in underwriting could be devastating, particularly to local stations in more rural areas. Jim Schachter, the president and CEO of New Hampshire Public Radio, tells me that citizens across his purple state depend on NPR as a primary news source and continue to rely on radio in emergencies. “It’s my country too,” says Schachter, describing his concern for the fate of public media. “You don’t take things away from me simply because you don’t like them.”\nBeyond the threat to NPR itself, publicly questioning the value of fact-based journalism in a congressional hearing could further soften up public sentiments and lay the groundwork for legal attacks on independent national media. Trump has indicated these may be coming, and based on previous statements could be high on the agenda for Trump’s FBI director, Kash Patel.\nOf late, the president has also thrown shade at CNN, MSNBC, and other major news networks, saying, “it’s totally illegal what they do,” and has been posting on his own media platform, Truth Social, to call out journalists by name, at times using condescending epithets. While such swipes may seem petty (the president merely expressing his passing, if customary, pique), they actually serve to signal to Trump’s minions that these outlets and news people are fair game. It’s part of the same playbook that Trump has used at rallies, sometimes inflaming members of the crowd to hassle the media representatives in the press pen.\nIt also sets an example for his supporters—and others in the administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, for example, went on the warpath this week. After it was revealed that he shared sensitive military information in a group chat, using the encrypted messaging app Signal, he did not publicly accept responsibility for a potential security lapse, nor did the president immediately come out and admonish him. Instead, Hegseth tried to turn the tables on Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was apparently unwittingly added to the officials’ Signal conversation about a pending US military assault on Houthi positions in Yemen. This wasn’t just “blame the messenger.” It was: raise questions about the credibility of a member of the media so as to deflect attention from one’s own behavior—and demonize that journalist in the process.\nTrump’s attacks on the traditional media seem to be only part of his strategy. A second part, evidently, is an effort to manage or encourage platforms within the media ecosystem that support him—from X to Truth Social to the bro-castors who rallied around his campaign. “Competitive autocracies always try to control the media,” says Kate Wright, a media scholar at the University of Edinburgh, former BBC journalist, and coauthor of a book on VOA. “Often that control is covert, but it can be overt as well. This slants public conversations about political issues in favor of the ruling administration, while sustaining the illusion of a full and free democracy.”\nThis is why it’s so important to put into perspective what these efforts to undermine the media mean in terms of the potential US descent into authoritarianism, as part of a broader assault on institutions of democratic life, from civil society to universities. According to V-Dem’s research, the “fatality rate” of democratic regimes that have begun the slide into autocracy is 67%, and the window to turn things around is generally about five years. There does not seem to be much consensus among democracy scholars about how far along the US is in terms of its autocratic transition. But one thing is clear. After 10 years of decline, a democratic rebound is “close to impossible,” according to a recent V-Dem policy brief.\nThe fate of America’s democracy, therefore, depends in good measure on the fight to preserve media freedom. The battle lines are no longer about who controls the narrative or who gets access to the president. It’s more elemental. Media organizations across the country must rally to defend their rights, protect their people, and report the news with independence. In practical terms, this means preparing their newsrooms to work in a more adversarial environment, marshalling legal resources, and building strong alliances around a shared commitment to press freedom. If they fail—and the ramparts have already been breached—then America’s authoritarian future may be all but inevitable. Once autocracy takes hold, it’s very hard to dislodge. There may be no going back—to democracy.","summary":"A leading global democracy research institute says democratic “backsliding” must be turned around quickly—warning that after 10 years, recovery is “close to impossible.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-press-freedom-authoritarianism","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67e4283587ce43dd205b894b/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/donald-trump-attack-on-press.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 10:00:00","author":"Joel Simon","authors":["Joel Simon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":304707824,"title":"Remember brat summer?","text":"Sweet Creme – Ab Sweet Creme era mei ajayen\n\nAgency: In-house\n\nI was left in stitches after this ad – a parodic take on the use (and overuse) of ‘Gen Z’ lingo in advertisements.

It’s not just gimmicks like Elon Musk’s offer of $100 to registered Wisconsin voters who sign a petition against “activist judges,” and $100 more for each additional voter they persuade to do the same. Musk and other megadonors have blown past previous spending records in a way that threatens a new American oligarchy.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.\n\nWe have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg) one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.\n\nThese numbers do not take into account all the spending and contributions by these ultrawealthy individuals (or the amounts given to non-disclosing political organizations). Take the expenditures of the world’s richest man, Musk. Even the $291.5 million figure does not include the value of content on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter), which reaches hundreds of millions of users. Researchers found that Musk seems to have tweaked the platform’s algorithm to promote content favorable to Trump, something quite valuable but hard to precisely value. Nor do these figures include the value of the publicity for his controversial get-out-the-vote efforts in swing states, among them a $1 million a day lottery for registered voters that could well have violated federal law.\n\nThe rise of the nine-figure donor raises two fundamental questions: Why is this happening now? And how will this new spending affect American elections and public policy?\n\nIn the 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the First Amendment as allowing an individual to spend unlimited sums independently supporting or opposing candidates for office, ruling that limits meant to equalize the voices of those in society to influence elections were “wholly foreign to the First Amendment.” In that same opinion, the court upheld restrictions on the amount that an individual could contribute to political committees.\n\nRight after Buckley, nothing would have stopped a billionaire from spending $100 million or more to independently support or oppose a candidate for office, so long as the money was not contributed to a candidate or a political committee or spent in coordination with them. Despite Buckley and other similar holdings, it was rare (and remains rare) for individuals to engage in significant independent expenditures.\n\nThe ultrawealthy likely did not want to engage in large independent expenditure operations that would expose their names on ads supporting or opposing candidates, as federal campaign disclosure law requires. And they also probably did not want to have to hire and oversee employees to spend money on their behalf: It would be far easier to give the funds to a candidate’s committee or another professional group supporting or opposing candidates. But contributions to outside groups—which could help put some distance between the donor’s name and the ads—were capped at $5,000, rendering unavailable this path for big money.\n\nThat $5,000 cap came under political pressure and constitutional attack. In the 2004 elections, Soros gave millions in contributions to America Coming Together, a 527 group (so called for a different provision of the Internal Revenue Code) supporting Democrat John Kerry for president over incumbent George W. Bush. ACT claimed that because of how it spent its money (by avoiding election ads explicitly calling for Kerry’s election or Bush’s defeat), the $5,000 cap didn’t apply. After 2004, the Federal Election Commission reined in the practice of using 527 groups to circumvent contribution limits to political committees.\n\nBut then came the Citizens United revolution. In 2010 the Supreme Court reversed two key precedents that had limited the independent spending of corporations in federal elections on the grounds that such spending could “distort” the political marketplace. The actual holding of Citizens United v. FEC was less important than the reasoning employed by the court; roughly speaking, the justices made a number of doctrinal moves facilitating campaign finance deregulation. Most importantly, SCOTUS significantly narrowed the definition of corruption from one that included the sale of access to political figures by large donors to one more akin to quid pro quo bribery.\n\nCitizens United resulted in a series of additional Supreme Court and lower-court cases (most importantly, a D.C. Circuit case called SpeechNow) and Federal Election Commission rulings that led to further deregulation of the campaign finance system. Many of these cases engaged in a kind of bootstrapping in which the courts or regulators first made a hole in the law, and challengers could subsequently point to that hole as a justification to strike down more laws, reasoning that the remaining laws were no longer effective.\n\nOne of the most important examples of this deregulatory bootstrapping occurred in relation to political committees that engage only in spending money independently in campaigns. These entities, now known as super PACs, function just like ACT, the 527 group Soros supported in 2004. But now these groups are blessed as legal, and they can take unlimited sums to support candidates. On top of that, thanks to a ruling of the Federal Election Commission sought by Democrats in 2024, campaigns can now closely work with those super PACs on voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without running afoul of the rules prohibiting coordination between candidates and nominally independent outside groups. According to the Washington Post, Musk spent millions last year working with the Trump campaign on these efforts.\n\nBillionaires no longer need to worry that they will break the law by spending previously obscene funds supporting or opposing candidates for office. These days, anyone with sophistication can spend whatever they want in federal elections, so long as they structure the giving properly. And some of the ultrawealthy (like others in society) are passionate about politics during our polarized times. They increasingly see no reason to resist leveraging their economic clout in the political arena.\n\nAnd it’s not just the nine-figure donors who are worrisome. OpenSecrets data show that the top 100 donors gave almost 70 percent of total money to outside groups like super PACs. The top 1 percent of donors gave 98 percent of the outside money. And thanks to changes in technology, such as the rise in social media, the ultrawealthy have new ways to transform their economic heft into political might without risking legal trouble.\n\nToday we have a mostly deregulated campaign finance system, except when it comes to some activities of political parties—rules the Supreme Court will likely soon strike down too. What remains is campaign finance disclosure, but much current political activity is not covered by disclosure rules because laws have not been updated to deal with the movement of campaigns to the online space. And new First Amendment attacks on the constitutionality of disclosure could soon bear fruit at an increasingly deregulatory SCOTUS. So we can expect a day when we may not even know how many nine-figure donors are out there seeking to influence our elections and our elected officials.\n\nOne might pooh-pooh the rise of the nine-figure donor and say it doesn’t matter. In the 2024 presidential election campaign, according to OpenSecrets data, Kamala Harris and her allies raised nearly $2 billion compared with Trump and his allies’ $1.45 billion. Overall, money was not as big a factor in the outcome of the election as other aspects that influenced voter choice, given that each side had ample funding to get out their message and run their campaign.\n\nThis minimization of the problem ignores two key points. First, the presidential election is unique in that it always attracts large amounts of money with high stakes and high interest. Money, even from a megadonor, is unlikely to be determinative: Both sides will be amply financed. But this is not necessarily true of other races. When Musk, for example, seeks to spend significant sums to influence the outcome of a Wisconsin Supreme Court race, or when Nicole Shanahan (RFK Jr.’s running mate for president) threatens to fund super PACs supporting Republican candidates to challenge incumbent senators who do not support Trump’s Cabinet nominees for confirmation, money can be much more influential—especially in otherwise noncompetitive general elections in which the real fight is for the party primary.\n\nMore important is what the money buys. Even putting aside the possibility of quid pro quo deals, the money secures influence and access. Musk has gained unprecedented access to Trump and unparalleled influence over the new administration through his White House office and activities for the amorphous Department of Government Efficiency, which is cutting federal employees and programs and engaging in the deep mining of governmental data (in many cases on issues with which Musk, the world’s richest man, has a financial conflict of interest). Republican senators toed the line and voted for Trump’s Cabinet nominees potentially out of fear of a Shanahan- or Musk-funded GOP primary.\n\nThese are not the only examples. Right after coming into office, Trump gave TikTok a reprieve, something that benefited supportive megadonor Jeff Yass, who owns a stake in its parent company. Miriam Adelson cares about Israeli policy, and she has had plenty of meetings with the president to make the case for her preferred Middle Eastern foreign policy. Again, one doesn’t need a quid pro quo to see how access makes it more likely for policy to favor the interests of the superrich.\n\nAll of this portends the rise of an American oligarchy, in which the richest individuals have an outsize influence on politics and public policy, made possible only because of the Supreme Court’s First Amendment decisions, beginning with Buckley and continuing with Citizens United and others. Even if the wealthy aren’t buying electoral outcomes, they are buying higher probabilities of affecting electoral outcomes and governmental decisions that work in their favor. And with the ability to purchase social media platforms, A.I. systems, and other new means of communication, knowledge production, and information dissemination, the wealthy will enjoy effective, unprecedented pathways to influence public debate in disproportionate ways.\n\nPlutocracy and oligarchy, rule by the wealthy and superwealthy, threaten democracy. As I have long argued, the court took wrong turns in Buckley and Citizens United in viewing societal attempts to achieve political equality (or at least minimize grotesque political inequality) as “wholly foreign to the First Amendment.” Instead, reasonable limitations on the ability of oligarchs and plutocrats to convert their vastly unequal economic power into political muscle, combined with ample protection for robust political debate through searching judicial review, can assure both greater equality and the promotion of First Amendment values, thereby enhancing American democracy.","summary":"Billionaire money could have even more impact in these races than it did in the presidential election.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/elon-musk-wisconsin-campaign-finance-billionaire-donors-money-politics.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/9e2804ca-b014-46c7-b45c-5d3702e695b6.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 09:40:00","author":"Richard L.

Subscribe here.\n\nOn February 21, President Trump removed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a four-star Air Force general with a distinguished military record named Charles Q. Brown. Gen. Brown was only the second Black officer to chair the Joint Chiefs, the first being Colin Powell more than 30 years ago.\n\nTrump also fired the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, both pioneering women senior officers. The premise was that all three were diversity hires, not competent enough to have been promoted on the merits.\n\nFranchetti had headed the Sixth Fleet and U.S. naval forces in Korea. Fagan was previously the commander of the Coast Guard Pacific Area, with prior terms as Coast Guard deputy commandant and commander for operations.\n\nBrown had a 40-year career. Entering the Air Force in 1984 as a fighter pilot, he logged over 3,000 flight hours, including 130 hours in combat. He commanded the Pacific Air Forces, the Air Forces Central Command, and the Air Force Weapons School, as well as the 8th Fighter Wing and the 31st Fighter Wing.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth had long targeted Gen. Brown. “First of all, you gotta fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs,” he said in a podcast in November. In one of his books, Hegseth flatly suggested that Brown was promoted because of his race. “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt,” Hegseth wrote. “Since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter.”\n\nThe insidious nature of the attack on DEI is not just that it targets minorities and women, but that it undermines ordinary civil rights enforcement.\n\nBrown was a particular target because he had chosen to speak out after the police murder of George Floyd. Brown posted a video message to the Air Force titled “Here’s What I’m Thinking About.” He described the pressures that came with being one of the few Black men in his unit. He recalled pushing himself “to perform error-free” as a pilot and officer his whole life, but still facing bias.\n\nTo succeed Brown, Trump nominated a retired white three-star general named Dan Caine. A fighter pilot, Caine did some stints at the CIA, as a private entrepreneur, and as a part-time member of the Air National Guard from 2009 to 2016. Trump spoke about first meeting Caine in Iraq, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019 and again in 2024, where Trump quoted him as saying, “I love you, sir. I think you’re great, sir. I’ll kill for you, sir.”\n\nCaine has nothing close to Brown’s command record, and it is unheard of to jump a retired three-star general to the top post of chair of the Joint Chiefs. Had this happened in the private sector—a Black man with an impeccable record being fired to open up a spot for an obviously less qualified white man—Brown would have had an open-and-shut case against racial discrimination as prohibited by the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nALL OVER THE GOVERNMENT, the supposed war on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” is being used as a transparent cover for racism, pure and simple. Any Black or female public official is at risk of being fired as a presumed diversity hire. They are at even more risk if they happen to work in any program having to do with civil rights. We are back to the nearly 400-year era, to echo the title of a book by Ira Katznelson, when affirmative action was white. Because the new racism is cynically couched in the language of rolling back DEI, there has not been the outcry that simple racism should produce.\n\nThe insidious nature of the attack on DEI is not just that it targets minorities and women, but that it undermines ordinary civil rights enforcement. All federal agencies have civil rights offices that enforce basic laws against discrimination. If they are doing their jobs, they can’t avoid talking about race and gender.\n\nAstonishingly, Trump’s initial series of executive orders even revoked President Lyndon Johnson’s Executive Order 11246 of 1965, which was the origin of the federal government’s affirmative action efforts. As Johnson put it in a celebrated commencement address at Howard University in June 1965, “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘you are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.”\n\nJohnson quite reasonably concluded that it wasn’t enough to illegalize outright discrimination in hiring and promotion, as Title VII of the recently enacted 1964 Civil Rights Act did. The labor market had well-worn informal norms and patterns of recruitment. These would not be altered just by posting a sign, “All Welcome.”\n\nThe sociologist Mark Granovetter wrote a famous research study in 1973 called “The Strength of Weak Ties,” on how most people actually got jobs. It systematically confirmed what everyone intuitively knew: You got jobs through informal networking. Somebody knew somebody’s cousin, or a neighbor heard that such-and-such an employer was hiring. These informal networks simply excluded Blacks, because they always had.\n\nEmployers and trade unions needed to take affirmative steps to actively recruit members of minority groups who had been explicitly barred or tacitly excluded from these informal networks. Johnson did not have the authority to require that all employers make such efforts, but he could require it of federal contractors, which included virtually all large corporations.\n\nThus, Executive Order 11246 provided that: “The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.”\n\nVery gradually, thanks to affirmative outreach requirements, racial and gender patterns in the labor force became more integrated, though there is ample evidence that Blacks and women are still underrepresented relative to their skill levels in many occupations, especially in supervisory and executive positions. The fact that these patterns vary widely among different corporations is evidence that discrimination persists among some employers.\n\nAffirmative action has long been attacked as reverse discrimination—disguised quotas at the expense of better-qualified whites. In the Bakke case of 1978, Allan Bakke, a white man, sued the University of California medical school at Davis, charging that he had a better academic record than that of several Black students who were accepted under a “special admissions program,” while he was rejected.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a fractured decision, ordered Bakke admitted, but also found that some kinds of affirmative action programs could be justified, if the purpose was “diversity,” a concept wholly invented by Justice Lewis Powell to cobble together a 5-4 majority. But diversity, which has now become both an objective of progressives and a target of conservatives, has nothing to do with the original rationale of affirmative action, which was to offset the lingering disadvantage created by 400 years of slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow. Why give preference to the son of Pakistani or Mexican millionaires, just because they’re “diverse”?\n\nA second, more subtle complaint of conservatives has been to argue, picking up on Lyndon Johnson’s “starting line” metaphor, that there may have been a time when affirmative action was defensible. But more than a half-century after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that time has passed. This was the argument of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger, deciding a complaint brought by a white applicant denied admission to the University of Michigan Law School. O’Connor wrote that carefully designed diversity programs were still constitutionally allowed, but added, “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary …”\n\nWell before the clock on those 25 years ran out, the high court ended affirmative action entirely, in 2023, holding that it amounted to reverse discrimination against whites, in violation of both the 14th Amendment and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But as Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy, a leading scholar of race and the Constitution, points out, efforts at Black uplift have always been resented as discrimination against whites, going back to President Andrew Johnson’s efforts to sabotage Reconstruction.\n\nIF YOU DRILL DOWN INTO how Trump’s assault on DEI affects basic enforcement of civil rights (never mind diversity), one place to look is the crippling of civil rights enforcement by key agencies. For example, the Department of Education has an Office for Civil Rights that normally investigates thousands of complaints. Since Trump took office, that process has ground to a halt. According to an investigation by ProPublica, the only new cases opened by the office’s attorneys have been directed at such Trump priorities as getting rid of gender-neutral bathrooms, banning transgender athletes from women’s sports, and pursuing alleged antisemitism.\n\nSince Trump took office, no new cases have been brought in the historic areas of civil rights enforcement, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or national origin. According to ProPublica, about 12,000 complaints were under investigation when Biden left office, yet there has been no follow-up under Trump.\n\nIt’s a similar story at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, someone who believes they are the subject of discrimination in hiring, promotion, work assignments, sexual harassment, or other such grievances begins by filing a complaint with the EEOC. If EEOC investigators or attorneys find that the complaint has merit, that can lead to a settlement or litigation.\n\nTo the extent that government employees work on anything having to do with race, they become high-priority targets.\n\nBut on January 28, Trump illegally fired two Democratic EEOC commissioners, Charlotte Burrows and Jocelyn Samuels, leaving the commission without a quorum. Trump also fired the EEOC’s general counsel. In the absence of a quorum and without a general counsel, the EEOC may not bring major new cases that involve patterns of discrimination. Trump’s action was illegal; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifies that EEOC commissioners serve for fixed five-year terms. There is no provision that allows the president to remove a commissioner, even “for cause.” (In a similar case, illegally fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox—who is Black—was restored to her position by a federal judge, though the Trump administration has appealed.)\n\nIn principle, career EEOC staff can continue the commission’s day-to-day work of continuing investigations that are already in progress. In practice, the Republican acting chair has moved to realign the commission’s priorities with the “reverse discrimination” themes and goals of the administration. It has explicitly halted LGBTQ cases for both new and existing complaints.\n\nThe EEOC’s Annual Performance Report for fiscal year 2024 gives some sense of the scope of its work and the reality of continuing racial and gender discrimination. In 2024, the commission won nearly $700 million in monetary damages, benefiting some 21,000 claimants. The commission filed 88,531 new charges in 2024. Quite apart from whether the Trump administration explicitly pauses new charges, other executive branch policies, such as a hiring freeze and forced and voluntary resignations, will leave the EEOC with far fewer resources to deal with its existing backlog, much less to bring new cases.\n\nAnother prime target is enforcement of nondiscrimination in housing. Despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, study after study has demonstrated that discrimination in the sale or rental of housing has persisted. The 1968 act itself requires all federal agencies to “administer their programs” in a manner “affirmatively to further the purposes of” the Fair Housing Act.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration promulgated the “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” rule through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to carry out the purposes of the Fair Housing Act. It requires cities and towns that receive federal money “to create a plan for rectifying fair housing barriers.” But in a tweet posted on July 29, 2020, President Trump said, “I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood … Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!”\n\nBiden moved to restore the rule, but neglected to finalize it, afraid of giving Trump an opening to claim that Democrats were “destroying the suburbs”—by letting Black people move there. This made it much easier for Trump to rescind it again; what took four years in the first term took a month in the second.\n\nHUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is expecting a reduction in force of a whopping 76 percent. “That should tell you that they are not interested at all in protecting civil rights as it relates to fair housing,” Antonio Gaines, president of AFGE National Council 222, which represents HUD employees, told the Prospect. “You’re going to see landlords violating those rights. There will be no forum to hear those complaints or hold private-sector landlords accountable for these things. It’ll be a regression to the 1960s or ’70s.”\n\nTrump has also found DEI in Biden programs that were racially neutral, and used alleged DEI excesses as grounds for terminating them. As Hassan Ali Kanu reported in the Prospect, a prime example is the environmental justice initiative known as Justice40. The goal was to deliver 40 percent of new federal investments, such as those in the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, to disadvantaged and low-income communities, regardless of race. On his first day in office, Trump shut down Justice40 as an offensive case of DEI, and separately directed federal agencies to terminate “all DEI, DEIA and ‘environmental justice’ offices,” positions, and programs.\n\nFederal efforts to reform police abuses are yet another victim of Trump’s orders. According to a report from The Washington Post, the Trump administration has frozen all ongoing Justice Department civil rights cases. One specific target is Justice Department consent agreements with local police departments to rein in abusive patterns of police behavior.\n\nThese include a pending consent decree for the Minneapolis Police Department, following their multitude of failures during the George Floyd saga, but a federal judge has punted on the decision in order to allow Attorney General Pam Bondi more time to “familiarize herself with the situation.” Bondi could also upend ongoing Justice Department negotiations and potential litigation to reform the Phoenix Police Department, following a DOJ report which found that Phoenix police systematically harassed Black, Hispanic, and Native American people.\n\nThe Department of Justice also shut down the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD), which was a federal effort to track misconduct by law enforcement across the nation. NLEAD was the result of a 2022 Biden executive order that Trump rescinded in his first few days in office.\n\nMeanwhile, another civil rights agency, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, is effectively out of business. The OFCCP was created to enforce Lyndon Johnson’s Executive Order 11246. With Trump’s repeal of the order, there is nothing for OFCCP to do, except maybe to harass government contractors to dump DEI programs.\n\nQuite apart from hobbling agencies engaged in explicit civil rights enforcement, Trump’s war on DEI has become a pretext for firing government workers generally. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team has compelled the dismissal of large numbers of civil servants. To the extent that government employees work on anything having to do with race, they become high-priority targets. And a disproportionate number of these public workers are Black.\n\nMusk got into an open conflict with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at a March cabinet meeting over his proposed cuts to the FAA. According to The New York Times, Duffy said: “What am I supposed to do? I have multiple plane crashes to deal with now, and your people want me to fire air traffic controllers?” Musk’s rejoinder, based on no evidence, was that people hired under DEI programs, presumably unqualified, were working in control towers.\n\nTrump’s CIA director John Ratcliffe fired 19 CIA employees who served in roles related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The workers then filed a lawsuit contesting their firings, pointing out they had been temporarily assigned to carry out civil rights laws within the intelligence community, including advancing the hiring and promotion of underrepresented minorities. But federal district court Judge Anthony Trenga ruled that while he thinks based on “basic fairness” the employees shouldn’t have been dismissed, nonetheless Ratcliffe had the authority to fire them.\n\nTHE DAY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION for a second term, Trump issued a series of executive orders collectively titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.” This sounds innocent enough because it invokes merit, and who can be opposed to merit?\n\nThe order revoked several civil rights and diversity orders from the Obama and Biden presidencies, and directed all agencies of government to “[e]xcise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and terminate all ‘diversity,’ ‘equity,’ ‘equitable decision-making,’ ‘equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,’ ‘advancing equity,’ and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.”\n\nA major target is public education. A supplemental order threatens to revoke federal funding of public schools that accurately teach America’s history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. This is dressed up as “Ending Racial Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling.”\n\nOn February 14, the Education Department sent out a “Dear Colleague” letter to educators, asserting that “[e]ducational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices. Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them—particularly during the last four years—under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’… smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline.” The letter warned that teaching this history could cost all schools their federal funding.\n\nTrump’s strategy of destroying habitats where liberals tend to work blends with his perverse distortion of civil rights principles.\n\nIn truth, systemic and structural racism is a major aspect of the history of the United States, especially in the slaveholding states. The Trump administration is demanding that schools airbrush that history, in favor of what can only be called indoctrination. To the extent that states and cities with progressive governments stick to their principles and teach the truth, Trump’s agencies get another pretext for trying to deny them funds.\n\nOn February 17, the Education Department announced that it was terminating $600 million in grants for teacher training, much of which was targeted to attract and train minority teachers. The department objected that “many of these grants included teacher and staff recruiting strategies implicitly and explicitly based on race,” which was the whole point. The department also complained that some of the training materials “included inappropriate and unnecessary topics such as Critical Race Theory; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); social justice activism; ‘anti-racism’; and instruction on white privilege and white supremacy.”\n\nIn North Carolina, as result of this order, more than a dozen programs will be terminated, totaling $90 million, including programs to recruit and train teachers for substantially Black communities with severe teacher shortages, as well as programs to cultivate master teachers. Among the grants revoked was a $2.4 million grant over five years for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to help recruit and train teachers for the Diverse and Resilient Educators Advised through Mentorship (DREAM) program to work in high-needs Durham schools.\n\nThus the Trump strategy does triple duty. It weakens public education and teacher training, especially in Black communities; it takes funding away from a liberal university; and it warps the accurate teaching of American history in favor of a falsely heroic white narrative.\n\nTRUMP’S STRATEGY OF PUNISHING blue states and destroying habitats where liberals tend to work blends with his perverse distortion of civil rights principles. This poisonous mix came together in the announcement on March 7 that Columbia University would lose $400 million in previously committed federal grants because of its failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment, and that similar treatment of other universities would follow.\n\nThe statement, jointly issued by the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration, said that the HHS and Education Departments would soon issue stop-work orders to immediately freeze the university’s access to some funds.\n\nConsider what’s at work here. For starters, this is illegal. The federal government has no authority to freeze or take back previously given grants unless fraud is demonstrated.\n\nSecondly, the order creates a standard made up out of whole cloth, defining the university’s previous actions to protect Jewish students as inadequate. Given the free-speech and assembly rights of the First Amendment, it’s not at all clear what the university authorities should have done.\n\nThe tenuous connection between the university’s conduct and the attempt to freeze or take back the grants is invented and entirely bogus. There is no instance where the Trump administration has shone a similar spotlight on the actions of universities for failing to protect the rights of Blacks, Hispanics, women, or sexual minorities.\n\nThe attempt of the far right and the Trump administration to wrap itself in the cause of battling antisemitism is hypocritical and disgusting. This is the same Donald Trump who said of the Charlottesville marauders, whose slogan was “Jews will not replace us,” that there were “very fine people on both sides,” even after antisemitic marchers deliberately crashed a car into a group of peaceful protesters, killing one.\n\nTrump pardoned the January 6th insurrectionists, who included several members of the antisemitic Proud Boys and other explicit antisemites who follow QAnon. One photo from the January 6th rampage shows a man wearing a “Camp Auschwitz” T-shirt emblazoned with a skull and crossbones, and the phrase “work brings freedom,” a translation of the Auschwitz motto “Arbeit macht frei.”\n\nTrump is a defender of Jews against supposed antisemitism when that’s useful to attack liberal universities, and an ally of the most explicit and vicious antisemites when that happens to be convenient for him.\n\nThe Christian right embraces the land of Israel out of a theological belief that only when the Jews return to the Holy Land will the Rapture come. Their biblical function fulfilled, Jews, as nonbelievers in Christ, will then go straight to hell. Trump’s alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is every bit as opportunistic and hypocritical. Should it ever become convenient, Trump will turn on the Jews.\n\nMEANWHILE, PRESSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION, major corporations have scrapped DEI programs and affirmative action commitments. They include Accenture, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Deloitte, Disney, Ford, Goldman Sachs, Google, Lowe’s, McDonald’s, Meta, Molson Coors, Paramount, PepsiCo, PwC, Target, and Walmart. Many of these companies are not just getting rid of exaggerated DEI language, but ending entire human resource programs aimed at recruiting and promoting applicants from underrepresented groups.\n\nIt’s another example of how the Trump war against DEI becomes a war against basic civil rights. For instance, in February, Paramount’s co-CEOs informed staff that the company will no longer have hiring goals based on race, ethnicity, sex, or gender and that it will stop collecting this data from applicants.\n\nAll large corporations have regulatory business with the U.S. government. Ditching DEI is a handy way of ingratiating themselves with Trump. The ease with which DEI was dropped suggests that social responsibility was never a value for these corporations, but a useful fig leaf until it stopped being useful. As Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò writes for Slate, “on many levels, elite institutions and powerful organizations were performing symbolic identity politics to bolster their reputations without enacting meaningful material reforms,” like unionization or other forms of worker empowerment.\n\nResisting Trump’s racism is one aspect of the general imperative of resisting Trump.\n\nThere have been a few corporate holdouts. Delta remains dedicated to its DEI efforts. Chief External Affairs Officer Peter Carter said on an earnings call in January, “DEI is about talent, and that’s been our focus.” Costco continues to uphold its DEI programs. Apple has resisted pressures. Last month, the company’s board of directors asked shareholders to reject a DEI rollback proposal.\n\nProcter & Gamble provided a statement to The Cincinnati Enquirer in February that said equality and inclusion is good for business. “This cannot and will not change,” CEO Jon Moeller declared. “It’s critical to who we are and what we do, to our principles, values and purpose and most importantly to winning.”\n\nLet’s see how long these corporate holdouts manage to hold out.\n\nTo put the history of corporate affirmative action in perspective, while many of these efforts were carefully crafted exercises in branding, there is no doubt that corporate affirmative recruitment and promotion efforts, some dating back to the 1960s, did create new opportunities for Black workers and executives, and broke down prejudicial assumptions. Some Fortune 500 companies became good places for Black Americans to work.\n\nThe same is true of the military, which was far ahead of civilian America in breaking down racial barriers. And the civil service, about 20 percent Black, became known as a good place for Black professionals to pursue career opportunities. By attacking all three, in the name of combating DEI excesses, Trump is savaging the places where Black people work. It’s racism, pure and simple.\n\nLATE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, a right-wing group associated with the Trump campaign created a lethal TV ad, which showed a flamboyantly costumed transgender person, intercut with an interview in which Kamala Harris seemed to be saying that she supported gender-altering surgery for prison inmates at taxpayer expense. The punch line of the ad: “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.”\n\nThe ads, which had several different variations, were aired more than 30,000 times in every swing state. The Trump campaign used the ads extensively in televised NFL and college football games and NASCAR races. The ads not only identified Harris with one of the most fraught forms of DEI, but made fun of the cultural left’s use of invented language, for those who got the sly reference.\n\nOf all the forms of DEI, the treatment of trans people is one of the most controversial, even among progressives. Democrats and feminists have divided on whether trans people who are born male should be permitted to compete in women’s sports. Nationwide, according to the NCAA, fewer than ten trans people compete in intercollegiate sports out of a total of about 510,000 athletes, but this controversy has consumed disproportionate attention and done disproportionate damage, crowding out the more complex issue of trans rights generally.\n\nThe use of the ad and the damage to the Harris campaign raises larger questions. Did the left bring this targeting on itself, by embracing a sometimes exaggerated, easy-to-caricature form of DEI that turned out to be more controversial than affirmative action, which had been broadly accepted by the mainstream since the 1960s? And did the demands of the cultural left spill over and damage the Democratic Party?\n\nThis is a much trickier question than it seems. It depends on which left and which Democrats you are talking about.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement, which gained broad currency in the aftermath of the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, aptly pointed out that despite the three great civil rights acts of the 1960s, far too many Black people, especially young Black men, were regularly subjected to police harassment, humiliation, arrest, and brutalization. Middle-class Black drivers were disproportionately pulled over for the crime of Driving While Black. Random testing confirmed that discrimination in housing was still rampant. Blacks at elite universities were presumed to be beneficiaries of racial preferences while legacy admissions of C students were rampant.\n\nStructural racism, in short, persisted. The sadistic killing of George Floyd was impossible to ignore, and it was only one in a long series of police murders of innocent Black men, hardly any of which were punished. Police enjoyed impunity. For a short time, the Black Lives Matter movement had the support of a majority of white people.\n\nMuch of the DEI movement was an effort by well-meaning whites to respond to Black demands and express solidarity and sympathy with the still-unfinished business of civil rights. At the extreme, some of it could be silly, as in language policing that invited caricature. Some terms, like “Latinx,” were widely rejected by their intended beneficiaries, as a perversion of Spanish. The word “woke,” long used in the Black community to mean alert to race and racial threats, soon became the latest word to ridicule hyper-politically correct whites.\n\nIn 2019, as support for Black Lives Matter intensified, a Black scholar named Ibram X. Kendi published a perfectly timed book titled How to Be an Antiracist. One of Kendi’s themes was that even well-meaning whites needed to look harder at their own subconscious racism. This became part of a narrative that had currency among Black radicals: You may think that you are an “ally” of anti-racist efforts, but think again. You are either an active anti-racist or you are a racist. A related theme was that whites who were looking for guidance from Blacks on how to help battle racism were burdening Black people who already had more than enough burdens. Whites needed to figure out their own racism and work in their own communities.\n\nKendi’s story resonated in some quarters and had elements of truth. But it seemed oblivious to the practical need for interracial coalition if we were serious about making progress. There are just not that many whites of goodwill enlisting as allies in the first place, and even fewer if they are being told that they are racists but don’t know it. All of this was grist for the real racists.\n\nThere is no central committee of the cultural left to sort out what themes and narratives make sense and which ones backfire. Activists and writers are free to say and do what they choose. It’s a free country (or at least it was).\n\nTo some extent, universities also went overboard in their commitment to DEI. At faculty meetings and in classrooms where I teach, a good proportion of my colleagues and students make sure to identify their pronouns. I have never quite gotten the logic of this. Demanding through peer pressure that faculty and students indicate via this code whether they are gay, straight, bi, or trans seems like a way of outing people in a group meeting who may not want to be outed. Why not ask people to disclose their race and religion?\n\nAt the peak of the effort to police language, some groups issued lists of forbidden words that bordered on self-parody. One was not supposed to use the term “fieldwork,” because it evokes the work in the cotton fields of slaves—sorry, enslaved people. A Stanford University guide to language even recommended avoiding the word “grandfather,” because it was used in the grandfather clauses of the Jim Crow era designed to prevent Blacks from voting. These insensitive uses of language could be understood as “micro-aggressions.”\n\nIt’s one thing to banish the n-word. The latest version of rarified language policing is a form of virtue-signaling and cheap grace. Rather than obedience, it produces eye-rolling, even among good liberals. There are just not enough people in the general public who have sympathy for it. That’s why the “they/them” ad resonated.\n\nIf you have a DEI bureaucracy, whether at a university, a corporation, or an agency of the government, its tendency is to keep coming up with more rarified forms of DEI. Mandatory training by diversity consultants, at universities and government agencies, may have produced more resentment than heightened sensitivity, even among would-be allies.\n\nTo some extent, Biden’s administration embraced a version of DEI that invited backlash. To flag just one example, Biden’s Executive Order 14035 of June 25, 2021, titled “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce,” put the entire federal government in the business of promoting forms of DEI that went well beyond affirmative action. In the internal politics of the Democratic Party coalition, this and similar orders are the result of letting constituent groups demand and define maximal policy. Biden provided some fat targets for Trump to gleefully repeal.\n\nWHAT, THEN, SHOULD DEFENDERS of civil rights be doing now? Trump’s assault on basic civil rights in the name of ending DEI is not only thinly veiled racism. It is also part of Trump’s larger project of destroying government and punishing states and cities led by Democrats. Resisting Trump’s racism is one aspect of the general imperative of resisting Trump.\n\nSome of this is done in court, some in the court of public opinion. The impact of the war against DEI on basic civil rights needs more attention and condemnation. The efforts to shut down government and target minority and women workers as diversity hires is illegal and will be the subject of litigation that will eventually be resolved by the Supreme Court.\n\nOne thing going for the Democrats is Trump’s propensity for overreaching and contradicting himself. It’s too soon to tell whether there will be anything resembling remotely fair elections in 2026 and 2028. If there are, and Democrats can manage more unity than in their early stumbles, there is a decent chance of taking back at least one house of Congress in 2026 and winning the presidency in 2028.\n\nWhat then? I put the question to one of America’s most respected Black constitutional scholars, professor Randall Kennedy. He teaches at Harvard Law School and is the author of several books, including the authoritative defense of affirmative action, For Discrimination, and is a former law clerk to Thurgood Marshall.\n\nKennedy had several thoughts. An edited transcript of our full conversation is posted here. Although advocates of racial affirmative action have long resisted socioeconomic affirmative action as a weaker second-best, explicitly racial affirmative action has now been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Kennedy told me that he thought socioeconomic affirmative action was now a defensible high ground.\n\nLiberals, Kennedy argued, need to reclaim the basic idea of color blindness, which conservatives have used to pillory preferences. “To be appropriately color-blind is to recognize the full humanity of others free of misleading distractions unleashed by racial mythologies,” he said.\n\nTaking a long view, the never-ending struggle for racial justice has ebbed and flowed, sometimes with allies in government, often with enemies. The first Reconstruction lasted only from Lincoln in 1865 to the withdrawal of federal troops from the South in 1877. The era of Jim Crow then lasted nearly another century until Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and the great civil rights acts of the 1960s. That was the Second Reconstruction. But as Kennedy points out, in the debate over the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even though it did no more than prohibit discrimination, its opponents treated the bill as preference for Blacks.\n\nThe Second Reconstruction lasted only until Richard Nixon’s “Southern strategy” shifted the South from a Dixiecrat anti-Black monolith into a Republican one. There was a brief era of biracial governments in the South, with racially liberal governors such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. But that era came to an end with a right-wing Supreme Court weakening voting rights. When progressives return to government, we need a long-deferred Third Reconstruction, this time with greater attention to coalition politics and a coalition of the decent.\n\nResearch assistance for this article was provided by Nic Suarez.","summary":"The real targets of the war on DEI include civil rights enforcement, federal outlays that serve Black communities, and Black workers in and out of government.","url":"https://prospect.org/civil-rights/2025-03-27-trumps-simple-racism/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22678/download/APR25%20Kuttner%20home.jpg?cb=df6cf4a350087f15eac461f0a37a49e8&w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 09:30:00","author":"Robert Kuttner","authors":["Robert Kuttner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":304859828,"title":"I expected to be embarrassed and outraged by Trump. Instead, I feel lucky. | Opinion - USA TODAY","text":"It was easy to hate Donald Trump when he jumped from reality TV to politics a decade ago. In 2015, Trump campaigned for president as an obvious populist: personality over party, policy and even country. He positioned himself as a conservative, but he really wasn't one.\n\nInstead, Trump claimed that he was the miracle vaccine that would cure what ailed America. MAGA fans couldn't get enough.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, 2021, I really disliked him. And as the 2025 campaign began, I didn't want to support a former president who wouldn't cede his election loss and who had a sordid personal history, including his mistreatment of women and a felony conviction. He also whined on social media like a 9-year-old boy who'd lost gaming privileges. I thought there were stronger Republican candidates who would better embrace conservative ideas.\n\nBut Republican primary voters chose to back Trump in 2024, and he picked an excellent ally in Ohio Sen. JD Vance as the vice presidential candidate. By then, the choice was obvious: Support a guy who hates leftism or support far-left progressives who would push America even further into decline. Our elections are binary, despite what my Libertarian friends think, so the choice was clear.\n\nBy now, two months into Trump's second term, I had expected to be embarrassed and outraged by our new president. But I'm not. I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\nActually, my mind is blown. I feel lucky that I've been a witness to some of the most radical changes ever attempted in the federal government − and in an extraordinarily short amount of time.\n\nThere are times when moderation makes good sense. But the current domestic and international climate calls for dramatic changes. Maintaining the status quo was not tenable. We needed a leader to aggressively make changes on many fronts, including the economy, the size and reach of the federal government and America's approach to foreign relations.\n\nTrump is reforming government and restoring liberty\n\nAmericans who are alarmed by Trump should recognize the significance of the nation's decline under progressive leaders. President Joe Biden drove the country to the far left, losing control of our borders, driving up the budget deficit and the national debt and imposing a progressive social agenda that ignored what most Americans believed. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were even more progressive and would have made it even harder to turn the ship around.\n\nAmerica's quest for liberty is not exclusive to a 248-year-old revolution, identifiable by red coats and taxation without representation. Tyranny is now trickier to spot, but it can be found in far-left ideas embedded in federal aid programs, higher taxes and attempts to infringe on personal liberties. Republicans have bought into these efforts at times, but Democrats are far worse.\n\nTrump presidency isn't normal, and that's a good thing\n\nMy litmus test for Trump's efficacy isn't whether he passes the normalcy test − he's already failed it. Mine is simply this: Is Trump supporting ideas and polices that make my family and me more free? Love him or hate him, Trump is doing exactly that.\n\nTrump and Congress are putting together a plan to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which will enable Americans to keep more of their money and fuel economic growth.\n\nWith Elon Musk's help, Trump is finding and eliminating government waste and overreach. It's been a messy process, and I wish Trump had used a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, but his efforts will restore our government to its original purpose: empowering, not hindering, Americans.\n\nIn less than three months, Trump has revitalized military recruitment, protected the ability of women and girls to compete fairly in sports and secured our nation's southern border.\n\nBorder crossings are down 94% from last year. That is so extraordinary that few on the left or in legacy media have even broached the subject, preferring to downplay the crime, drugs and other massive problems that came from Biden's chaotic border policies.\n\nTrump's leadership, while not traditional, also has helped return hostages to their families, astronauts to Earth and common sense to public schools.\n\nIs Trump a disappointment to some? Of course. But even CNN this week had to acknowledge that the American people are still aboard the Trump train, with the president's favorability ratings actually rising since he was elected in November.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, polls show that an increasing number of Americans believe the nation is headed in the right direction.\n\n\"According to Marist, 45% say that we‘re on the right track,\" Harry Enten, CNN's chief data analyst, said Tuesday. \"That‘s the second-highest that Marist has measured since 2009. How about NBC News? Forty-four percent, that‘s the highest since 2004. The bottom line is the percentage of Americans who say we‘re on the right track is through the roof.\"\n\nThose numbers really shouldn't surprise anyone. From taxes and the economy to the border and government efficiency, Trump is driving ideas that will restore liberty and promote prosperity.\n\nTraditional Republicans and progressive Democrats might be the biggest losers in Trump's second term, but the biggest winners are Americans who love liberty the most.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

Now irate Americans are shoplifting from Whole Foods.","text":"Lee insists he's \"famously\" a very good Catholic. He's a moral person — his mother raised him right. And by his internal calculation, it's OK to shoplift from Whole Foods. Why? Because of Jeff Bezos.From about 2020 to 2022, Lee, a 20-something communications professional living in the Washington, DC, area, engaged in what he describes as \"grand theft auto-ing\" from his local Whole Foods store. He would cheat the scale at the hot bar, pocket spices, or take home four lemons in the self-checkout aisle while only declaring two. Lee has never shoplifted from anywhere else — not Safeway, not a local store. He's largely stopped taking from Whole Foods because he moved to a different neighborhood that doesn't have one. However, he told me, there's one by his gym he'll pop into — and steal from — from time to time.Lee has weighed the ethics of what he's doing. At one point, the guilt got to be so much that he confessed his misdeeds to his mother. Once he explained his reasoning — Amazon's market power, Bezos' wealth, what the billionaire has done at The Washington Post — she came around.\"If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too,\" Lee says. Lee is a pseudonym — the same goes for all of the shoplifters and ethically (and legally) compromised individuals quoted in this story. Over the past several months, I've spoken with nearly a dozen of them — some I found through their confessions online; others reached out when they heard through social media I was working on this story.Practically speaking, it's a good moment to be a billionaire in America — you've probably got more tax cuts on the way, and the president is nice to you as long as you're nice to him. Maybe your stocks are down, but you're still a billionaire, so it's fine. In terms of public perception, however, the superrich have seen better days. Americans are vandalizing Teslas to get back at Elon Musk. Mark Zuckerberg's \"Zuckermoon\" is over. As for Jeff Bezos, some people are stealing from him — or, rather, his companies — in an effort to exact revenge. Like Lee, they're enacting some moral payback, one fancy cheese from Whole Foods or fudged Amazon return at a time. They're sticking it to The Man, who in this case is one specific individual.These subversive infractions directed at Bezos and his billionaire cohort may be rooted in legitimate gripes with the state of the world and its unfathomable wealth inequality. On the spectrum of crime severity, swiping $20 worth of goods from a multibillion-dollar corporation does not rank high. But the justifications people offer are just that — justifications. None of what they're doing is actually making the type of impact they might like to see, and they're conveniently ignoring Bezos' positive contributions, such as his philanthropy. And they could be causing unintended harm to the non-Bezoses of the world, as in, everyone else. Many retailers have put items behind glass cases to combat theft, which is a headache for everybody. Shoplifting can demoralize workers, and if enough people do it, it may lead companies to raise prices, or in the case of return fraud, mean businesses make sending unwanted items back a lot harder.In the realm of retail theft, middle-class consumers and opportunist thieves are a growing group of culprits. It's difficult to tease out the exact size and scope of the cohort, given how incomplete retail-theft data can be. Amazon isn't exactly shouting its shrink numbers from the rooftops, and other companies have even admitted to mistakes in assessing the problem. But as one loss prevention professional put it to me last year, everyday, ordinary shoplifters are \"like a giant organized mob, they just don't know each other.\"Many of them abide by a certain code around who they take from, and the swath of small-time larcenists I've spoken to consistently say that anything Jeff Bezos-related falls into the \"allowed\" column. He's the second-richest man in the world, he's highly visible, and they don't love what they know about him personally. They feel like they're balancing the scales in stealing from one of his companies, undertaking some sort of Robin Hood-esque endeavor where they take from the rich to give to the poor, the comparatively poor being themselves.Take Jesse, a 30-something tech worker who until recently would steal entire bags of groceries from Whole Foods with his roommates. A friend at Instacart tipped them off to the opportunity — with so many personal shoppers roaming around the aisles, workers weren't going to notice another person loading bags or whether they were paying for what was in them. Once, they got expensive steaks from the butcher and left without paying for them, later grilling them out on a friend's roof.\"I never felt bad for the corporation as a whole, because it was Amazon and, you know, it was Jeff Bezos,\" Jesse said. \"He just profits so much taking advantage of the little people, so if we as little people can bite back a little bit, and that's me taking $100 maybe out of revenue for him, that's a little bit of a middle finger.\"Separately, there's Carson, another Whole Foods bandit whose friends joke they're actually \"liberating\" items from the store, not stealing. As Carson, a 30-something who works in the nonprofit sector, told me for a story last year, he likes slipping salmon lox into his laptop sleeve and estimates he saves about $1,000 in groceries a year by shoplifting, largely from Whole Foods.\"It's easy to look at him like a Lex Luthor,\" Carson told me recently, referring to the Superman villain.Carson isn't just extracting his purported payback through Whole Foods. He likes to throw big, complicated parties, so he'll buy $1,000 of decorations from Amazon, use them, and then return them.\"Who's actually hurt in this strange, dehumanized system?\" he said.Reporting for this story, I heard the same sentiment over and over from shoplifters and less-than-honest Amazon shoppers. One Whole Foods nabber, a 30-something tech worker, justified their penchant for lifting from the grocery store as a mix of ease, quality, and antipathy toward one of the richest people in the world. \"My lack of remorse for any of this is — it's a big corporation. They have so much money, eggs are $10, screw them,\" they said.One 50-something business owner explained how they would exploit a loophole in Amazon's return system to get what amounted to free money for runs to an Amazon Go store in their office building. When I asked whether they felt any sense of regret, the answer was succinct: \"F— no. He's the most successful entrepreneur alive.\"Jimmy, a 30-something government worker, told me he's \"indifferent\" toward Bezos, and he does feel somewhat bad about engaging in some light return fraud. One of his gaming controllers recently broke, so he bought a new one, stuck the old one in the box it came in, and sent it back undetected. Still, he's not losing sleep over it. \"We know how much money that company makes. They're not going to be worried about that $70,\" he says. \"I feel like the Batman of returns. I choose my targets.\"The Bezos bashers' complaints ran the gamut: Whole Foods is a gentrifier; he's just too rich; shooting himself into space is gauche. Whatever anyone's precise justifications, there have been plenty of headlines and accusations that paint Bezos and his companies in an unflattering light. Amazon's e-commerce practices are bad for the environment. His businesses have been widely criticized for their approach to workers, including subjecting them to brutal work conditions and engaging in wage theft. His recent political turn and push to exert more influence over The Washington Post, which he owns, has turned many people off and reportedly lost the paper thousands of subscribers.To be sure, Bezos has also given people plenty to be happy about. It's super convenient to have stuff delivered to your door at the drop of a hat. Whole Foods is, for the most part, a lovely shopping experience. But in an era where billionaires are viewed as the bad guys, and there's growing anger about extreme wealth inequality, it can be easy for people to overlook any upsides. There are a handful of guys in popular culture who epitomize the enormous gap between haves and have-nots. Bezos is one of them.It is fair to wonder, though, if stealing from Whole Foods or returning a dress you wore to a wedding is the best way to get back at Bezos. It's a bit of a stretch to think the answer to that one is yes.I reached out to Garret Merriam, an associate philosophy professor at California State University, Sacramento, who studies ethics, to get his read. He told me there are likely three broad categories of thinking going on here. There are those who don't really consider what they're doing to be stealing — they're oblivious to it. Like taking a pen from the breakroom at work, they figure it's baked in when they grab a snack as they browse the Whole Foods aisles. There are people who recognize it's cheating, but they don't think it's wrong, given Bezos' wealth and his business practices. In a context where Amazon has paid millions of dollars to settle wage theft lawsuits, they figure lying about a lost package is a small way to try to even things out. And then there are those who feel a sense of political desperation — they're powerless in the face of massive political and economic forces, and this is an outlet for some sort of action, even if futile. \"The target is misapplied, but the anger is, I would say, understandable,\" he said.People have a tendency to try to neutralize potentially unsavory behavior by coming up with ways to justify their actions, Emmeline Taylor, a professor of criminology at City St. George's, University of London, said. In this case, they tell themselves things like, \"Bezos is bad, Amazon won't even notice, this seems like a victimless crime,\" to make themselves feel better and like they're in the right. \"They've sort of rehearsed this in their head so many times or even said it out loud, they start to believe it themselves,\" she said. \"That's what allows them these sorts of moral gymnastics.\"While people may see their actions as a way to get back at Bezos, the sheer size of the modern corporation creates a level of removal that makes it easy to sit back and think, \"Who cares if someone pulls one over on them?\" After all, it feels like they're pulling one over on us all the time.\"When we take from a store or a workplace, it gets a little bit easier to distance yourself,\" Terrence Shulman, the founder of the Shulman Center for Compulsive Theft, Spending, and Hoarding, said.Beyond the fact that theft and fraud are, you know, against the law, anti-Amazon avengers may not recognize the collateral damage they could be inadvertently causing. If you steal from Whole Foods, Bezos won't know, but the store manager who's fired over it will. (I did survey some Whole Foods workers about this, and several of them confirmed that (a) they see a lot of middle-class and even seemingly wealthy shoplifters, and (b) they may be a little bothered by some of it but are not in a tizzy.) Before you lie to Amazon that your package never arrived or return the wrong item, you might want to check who the actual seller is.John Roman, the CEO of BattlBox, which sells outdoor gear and equipment, would rather just sell everything from his own website, but they've got to be on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms just because of the reach. He's currently dealing with a return fraud situation — someone bought a new spotlight from him, said they didn't like it, and shipped an older model back. BattlBox didn't even realize what had happened until they sent the returned item to another customer who flagged it. Roman has filed an appeal with Amazon, but there's \"no telling\" whether the company will side with him.He doesn't really blame people for doing this. By making returns so easy and taking \"the customer is right\" philosophy to the extreme, Amazon has fostered this behavior. \"I don't think the average consumer even understands that it's not Amazon selling the product,\" he said, pointing to the fact that Amazon regularly introduces an Amazon Basic version of a best-selling item — which then gets prominent website placement near or above the original — in order to get in on the action. Roman even understands the get-back-at-Bezos stuff, given how the ultrawealthy are viewed.\"I'm not saying I agree with it, but I fully understand the people that view that they're giving it to The Man, but the reality is that you are actually hurting small businesses,\" he said.Ironically, shoplifting at other retailers has been a plus for Amazon's business — people frustrated that everything is locked up at CVS and Target just go to Amazon's website instead. It's not clear how big of a problem shrink is for Whole Foods and Amazon since the company doesn't break it out in their financials. When Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked about return fraud in a CNBC interview last year, he sort of shrugged it off, saying at the company's scale, \"You get a bit of everything.\"\"It matters to them, but does it matter enough to put the time and effort into trying to stop that? I would say probably not,\" Arun Sundaram, an analyst at CFRA Research, said. He joked that given how profitable some other arms of Amazon's business arms are, if it wanted to give free food to customers for a month, it probably could.Amazon declined to comment for this story. Jeff Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.I'm not trying to say that the logic among Amazon and Whole Foods thieves is, \"I woke up in the morning mad at Jeff Bezos because killed The Washington Post's Kamala Harris endorsement, so now I'm going to steal overpriced salami from Whole Foods.\" Attitudes are generally more removed and hazy. They view snacking while shopping (without paying for said snack) as a victimless crime, with the only potential victim being Bezos, even if that's a stretch.\"I don't know who I'm hurting,\" Lee said.In the current economy, it's hard not to feel like you're being taken advantage of at every turn. Everything's getting more expensive, but corporate profits are still going up. Companies are constantly cutting costs, whether that means laying off workers or making it impossible to talk to a customer service representative on the phone. People feel like they have to be on guard against business trickery and slights. If you've shrugged and said, \"That's how they get you,\" enough times, you start to think about how you'll get them. People feel like big business has broken the social contract, so they can break it back.If people want to hurt Amazon with their pocketbooks, the best thing they can probably do is just not shop there. But that would require effort, planning, and forgoing the luxuries of on-demand shopping, which many people don't seem so willing to do.\"That would be a moral response,\" said Stuart Green, a Rutgers law professor who focuses on the moral theory underlying laws. \"I don't think you can steal things that you like and then say you're doing it because you don't like the company.\"At least it's better than setting Teslas on fire.Emily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.","summary":"People are stealing cheese from Whole Foods and committing return fraud at Amazon.

(This is not the first time he has referred to Musk this way. Right before the election last year, Walz told a crowd: “Look, Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit.”)\n\nParking for a moment the perfection of the phrase “skipping like a dipshit” to capture Musk’s very particular style of movement and speech, the range of what can and can’t be said in politics has clearly, radically changed. When you look back on the phrase that caused Hillary Clinton so much trouble in 2016 – “basket of deplorables” – it sounds like a quote from an 18th-century novel. “Take that, sir! You and your basket of deplorables!” Now we have Trump referring to Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor mistakenly added to the Signal chat, as a “sleazebag”, and Hegseth, the US defense secretary, telling JD Vance that he fully shares the vice-president’s “loathing of European free-loading”. We are millimetres away from someone shouting “asshole” across the floor of the Senate.\n\nThe Signal chat, obviously, wasn’t supposed to be public, and responding to the leak this week has put the White House in a delicious bind – or rather, a bind that we might have enjoyed as delicious had it not underscored just how petrifyingly stupid Trump’s team really is. On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, had simultaneously to dismiss further revelations from the Atlantic designed to expose the White House lie that none of the information discussed was classified, while slamming the magazine for leaking “sensitive information”. Well, Karoline, which is it?\n\nThe new information shared by the Atlantic on Wednesday was, to use government-approved language, freaking MIND-BLOWING. Two hours before the Yemeni bombing raid, Hegseth, Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz went into extraordinary detail as to the exact timing, nature and target of the bombings. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” wrote Hegseth, followed by a stream of similar details. After the release of the information on Wednesday, retired military brass lined up in the US to tell cable news channels: “There is no question this is classified.”\n\nAnd while it remained deeply unfortunate for the Trump administration that, of all the people they might have mistakenly cc-ed into the group, it happened to be a serious journalist like Jeffrey Goldberg, given the frat boy tenor of the exchange, it could also have been a lot worse. We should, surely, be grateful that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who organised the group on Signal, didn’t do that thing – look, we’ve all done it – where you inadvertently send a bitchy message about someone to the person in question, or in this case a message outlining a plan to drop a bomb on their head to the Houthi rebel commander target. Or as Waltz described him, in the style of a man shooting the breeze at the water cooler, “their top missile guy”. One assumes the only reason that guy wasn’t in the chat, too, is that he hadn’t gotten around to signing up for Signal.\n\nIt’s not the rudeness, of course, it’s the flippancy that terrifies. The tone of the messages flying between the most powerful people in the world via an unsecure messaging app and on subjects of vital national security was that of someone idly texting with one hand while throwing and catching a hacky sack in the other. At one point, per Wednesday’s new trove, Mike Waltz wrote “typing too fast” and it must have taken every shred of collective will power in the group for no one to reply, “Sausage fingers!”\n\nWaltz, by the way, is the figure who has come closest to saying sorry for the mess, remarking on Fox News on Tuesday that he took “full responsibility” for the error. But then he ruined the vanishingly rare moment of appearing to be the only adult in the room by referring to Goldberg – a hero without whom none of us would know any of this had happened – as “scum”. And, sadly, back we went to square one.\n\n Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist","summary":"The leaking of top-level military secrets was bad enough, but I’m obsessed with Maga’s fratboy lexicon\n\nThe Maga-fication of American political discourse, which started, arguably, with Donald Trump mocking a disabled reporter in 2015, peaked this week with news of Pete Hegseth referring to European countries in the leaked Signal chat as “PATHETIC”, and enjoyed a detour last Tuesday when Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and former running mate of Kamala Harris, appeared at a town hall in Wisconsin and called Elon Musk “a dipshit”.

Tom Emmer became the House GOP whip in 2023, Republicans’ mission was simple: Limit the damage President Joe Biden did before President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nWhile coordinated and successful opposition is no easy chore (just ask former Speaker Kevin McCarthy or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer), governing, even with a trifecta, is harder. But that’s precisely the task before Emmer and his Republican colleagues. \n\nEmmer, a Republican from Minnesota, opened up about those difficulties on this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” We discuss the dynamics inside the House Republican conference as budget negotiations and bringing rogue federal judges to heel dominate conversations on Capitol Hill.\n\nThough most odds-makers had Democrats taking back the House last year, Emmer was confident that Republicans would come out of the 2024 elections with a trifecta, especially after Democratic nominee Kamala Harris chose Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., as her running mate. \n\n“Tim Walz is one of the most incompetent executives my state has ever seen,” Emmer said. “Probably the singular greatest mistake they made was putting him on the ticket.”\n\nWhile Republicans retained control of the House, their majority is razor-thin. To complicate matters, battle lines were drawn within the House GOP conference last Congress, infighting that culminated with the removal of McCarthy. Now that Republicans are fully in the driver’s seat, will they be able to leave the bumps of last Congress in the rear-view mirror and codify the Trump agenda?\n\n“One of my favorite phrases is ‘the animals at the watering hole tend to look at each other much differently as the water recedes,’” Emmer said of the evolving dynamics in the House GOP. “Don’t for a second think they all like each other. Don’t for a second think they’re all going to agree on exactly the same things. They’re not.”\n\n“You can put the same jersey on a bunch of human beings and put them out on the field,” Emmer said, but “that’s not a team.” What makes a team is “a game plan”: “You have to give them leadership and incentive to succeed.”\n\n“They’re going to run into each other,” Emmer admitted. “Some of it’s not going to be pleasant, but you know what? It ends up with a much better result when you’re all done.”\n\nEmmer used himself as an example: “I’ll tell you what: my political leanings, it’s going to be funny, but they lean more with the Freedom Caucus than they do with the other side.”\n\nBut, “that’s Tom Emmer the member. As the whip, I got to figure out how I get both of these ends to work together and get to the same result. And that’s not done by getting one side or the other to give up their core beliefs. It’s trying to put them in a situation where, despite their differences, they can honor their core principles.”\n\nHouse Republicans managed to do just that with the continuing resolution that funded the government through the end of the fiscal year. The House left Washington after passing the continuing resolution and sending it to the Senate, putting Democrats, especially those in the Senate, in a lose-lose situation: Either vote with Republicans or own a government shutdown. \n\nFor the first time in a long time, Democrats found themselves on the back foot when it came to government funding. Crucially, Emmer told me, the continuing resolution gives Republicans “the chance to reset the constitutional art of governance, which we have not done in three decades around this place,” by going through the normal appropriations process for fiscal year 2026.\n\nWhile next fiscal year’s appropriations bills are being worked on in the background, the more pressing matters for Republicans in Congress are to nail down a budget resolution for the budget reconciliation process and to bring rogue federal judges to heel.\n\n“You may be surprised to know that more universal injunctions were issued by federal district court judges in the month of February than were issued in the first three years of the Biden administration,” Emmer told me. “There’s a red flag.”\n\n“I practiced law for 20 years. I trust judges to apply the law to the facts that are presented,” Emmer said. But “you can’t be a pseudo-legislature. That’s not the way this works, and that’s been the complaint for years.”\n\n“When you have morons like Chuck Schumer going out there and literally telling PBS last Sunday, ‘don’t worry. We spent the last four years appointing 230-some progressive judges who are going to rule against Trump every time’ … if that’s what’s happening, they’re not doing the job that they’re supposed to.”\n\n“If there is a problem, we need to know about it. And so do the American people,” Emmer stated.\n\nVictory means very little if Republicans don’t do anything with it, but Emmer is confident that Republicans can get the job done and the American people will reward them for it: “We’re going to defy the odds in the midterms and keep the majority.”","summary":"When Rep.

She called them akin to incoherent word salad. She wasn’t wrong.\n\nAside from random stories of big men coming to him crying, Donald Trump had a special fascination towards the stories of Hannibal Lecter. Yes, the fictional character. A cannibal.\n\nIf you are confused as to what inspiration can a presidential candidate get from a cannibal in a movie, you can join the line.\n\nThrough his campaign, Trump brought out the topic of how Hannibal Lecter was an inspiring figure and he fought against the system (we are just as clueless). And on more than one occasion, he called the character- Great Hannibal Lecter.\n\nAfter the elections, it was assumed the character would go back to the books and movies. Apparently not. Hannibal Lecter has been the subject of new, odd remarks from President Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump was joined by female members of Congress and key women allies in his administration. It was for a White House-hosted Women’s History Month event on Wednesday. Trump took a moment during his speech to call out the cannibalistic murderer. However, the occasion called for celebrating women throughout history and was no way related to Lecter.\n\nTrump: “We got a lot of votes because of Hannibal Lecter.” pic.twitter.com/JQ5iRtcYhq\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 26, 2025\n\nHe said to the crowd – The legendary Dr. Hannibal Lecter used to be in a hotel room close to you. He added that “fake news” would ask, “Why does he keep mentioning Hannibal Lecter?”. “You know why?” I asked. Since we recently won an election. Hannibal Lecter helped us gain a large number of votes. “Hannibal Lecter is not welcome in our nation,” Trump declared to the bewildered audience.\n\nThis word vomit made no sense. Yet here we are.\n\nEvery time Trump talks about Lecter, people get more and more confused. Steven Cheung is the director of communications for the Trump campaign. He answered many inquiries on the Republican nominee’s frequent use of Lecter’s name last year.\n\nTrump praised fictitious cannibal Hannibal Lecter pic.twitter.com/BbtzKqAksE\n— David Leavitt 🎲🎮🧙‍♂️🌈 (@David_Leavitt) July 19, 2024\n\nHe has defended Trump, saying that President Trump is a talented and inspirational storyteller. One of the many ways he engages the public and voters is by making references to popular culture. In contrast, he claimed that Kamala Harris was as relatable as a shabby couch.\n\nTrump has previously mentioned Hannibal Lecter when he has spoken about immigration or mental health, even though his motivation for doing so today was irrelevant.\n\nSocial media users, however, think that his purpose in bringing up Hannibal is to provide shock value in order to divert attention away from the conversation about current affairs. His obsession did give rise to several memes and jokes.\n\nIn his latest cabinet appointment, Donald Trump has announced that Dr. Hannibal Lecter will be Director of Health and Human Services pic.twitter.com/ujN7n3kjEn\n— TheDailyLiberal (@DailyLiberal1) December 15, 2016\n\nIt could be a ploy to divert the attention from #signalgate. Or maybe President Trump is old and confused and has no idea what he is talking about.\n\nEither way, Hannibal Lecter would not have appreciated being dragged into politics like this.","summary":"Donald Trump talked about Hannibal Lecter to a very confused crowd at The White House.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trumps-most-bizarre-moment-yet-thanks-hannibal-lecter-for-votes-in-latest-speech","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trump-and-hannibal-lecter.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 05:06:52","author":"Divya Verma","authors":["Divya Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001}]}
