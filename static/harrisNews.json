He dropped out the following month and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee. \"I'm not a doctor. Aging happens quite quickly,\" Psaki added on the Semafor podcast that was published Friday. The former Biden aide, who left the White House in May 2022, said she hadn't seen him in person in the two-and-a-half years afterward leading up to the November election. JEN PSAKI RECALLS REACTION TO BIDEN'S DEBATE, ‘HEARTBREAKING’ SUMMER BEFORE 2024 EXIT: ‘I WAS LIKE, IS HE OK?’ But she warned against people using the term \"cover-up\" to describe how the White House responded to questions about the president's age during that time. \"'Cover-up' is a very loaded term,\" Psaki said, adding that people typically use that expression when talking about a crime. \"People use that term as related to Watergate. Or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war,\" she continued. \"I think it's a bit of a dangerous term.\" Psaki was also hesitant to criticize the media when asked if the press should've been \"more aggressive\" in covering the \"pretty big story\" about the president's health.

Psaki suggested one reason there may have been a reluctance to report on these concerns. \"While we know there were problematic things behind-the-scenes now in 2023 and 2024, there was an aggressive all-out pitching operation from the right-wing and from the Republicans about Joe Biden's age and how he was in decline….the majority of which wasn't true, in 2019-2022,\" Psaki claimed.

Losing Dems need a moderate pivot, but radical left steering for a cliff","text":"On Nov. 5, the Democratic Party received what counts in our hyper-polarized age as a comprehensive drubbing. \n\nDonald Trump swept all seven battleground states, improved over his 2016 and 2020 performances with nearly every demographic subcategory, and became the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote.\n\nIn the end, Vice President Kamala Harris’ $1 billion-plus war chest and much-praised “ground game” proved a boon to the college funds of Democratic consultants and not much else.\n\n“This was a total and complete repudiation of the Democratic Party,” one congressman told Punchbowl News on the morning after the election. “People are not buying what we’re selling. Period.”\n\nPost-election polling confirms that the party’s national brand is in the Dumpster. \n\nA late January Quinnipiac poll found that only 31% of voters hold a favorable opinion of the Democrats, versus 57% with an unfavorable one.\n\nBy contrast, Republican favorability stood at 43% — still underwater, but 12 points better — while Trump enjoyed the highest approval rating of his political career, 53%, according to a February poll from CBS/YouGov.\n\nRejection of progressivism\n\nWhile voters are undoubtedly angry at the party that gave us the Biden administration, surveys from Democratic polling firms suggest a broader public rejection of progressive cultural politics.\n\nAccording to an election postmortem by the Democratic polling firm Blueprint, published in mid-November, swing voters who broke for Trump — as 52% did, compared with only 36% for Harris — saw Democrats as being more supportive of immigrants than of American citizens (73%), wanting to “promote transgender ideology” (72%), being “too focused on identity politics” (67%), and having “extreme ideas” about “immigration” (69%) and “race and gender” (63%).\n\nThe Progressive Policy Institute’s survey of working-class voters found that 68% of respondents said that Democrats had moved too far left, compared with 47% who said that Republicans had moved too far right.\n\nThis broad-based public exhaustion with cultural progressivism, seen not merely in polling but also in Trump’s newfound status as a cultural icon, seems to suggest that the Democrats’ best path forward is to ditch “wokeness” and pivot to the center.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats have made just this argument. In a memo reported by Politico’s Jonathan Martin, Democratic donor adviser and Obama White House veteran Seth London said that his party’s rebrand should “begin with a complete rejection of race- and group-based identity politics,” a sentiment echoed by former Obama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who told Martin that “identity politics did not work electorally” and had “failed miserably strategically.”\n\nParty surrogates have been aggressive in taking aim at “the groups,” the sprawling network of progressive nonprofits and advocacy organizations that, under Biden in particular, assumed the role of the Democrats’ policy and intellectual vanguard. \n\n(As the Department of Government Efficiency has highlighted, many of these groups were not only powerful within the coalition; they were also being subsidized by taxpayers.)\n\nBlowback vs. moderation\n\nBut abandoning identity politics — and the groups — is easier said than done.\n\nShortly after the election, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts declared that the party needed to be “brutally honest” about how out of step its position on transgender issues was with the American public. \n\nAs the father of two young daughters, Moulton told The New York Times, he agreed with the eight in ten Americans who do not want schoolgirls “getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete.”\n\nThe blowback was severe. \n\nActivists, spurred on by local Democratic officials and national journalists and nonprofits, accused Moulton of “scapegoating” trans people, descended on his office for a “Neighbors Against Hate” rally, and pledged to primary him in his next election. \n\nMoulton’s campaign manager and the director of his political action committee quit in protest of his remarks, and the chairwoman of the Salem Democratic City Committee denounced him in an e-mail as a “Nazi cooperator.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee’s elections for a chairman this February, meantime, were vintage woke surrealism, straight out of 2020. \n\nThe event featured a land acknowledgment, anti-Trump slave spirituals, and an announcement by outgoing chairman Jamie Harrison explaining how “nonbinary individuals” would get counted under rules mandating gender balance among DNC officers.\n\n‘I’m too radical for America’\n\nThe DNC elected as one of its vice chairmen the Gen Z professional activist David Hogg, whose X account over the past seven years reads like an AI-generated parody of elite progressive excess.\n\nHogg had even posted in 2022 that “I’m one of the most politically toxic people in the country and I’m too radical for American politics,” suggesting that he had a more accurate view of political reality than the 2025 version of his party.\n\nIdentity politics has sway within the Democratic Party for a reason.\n\nIdeologically, as Christopher Caldwell has argued, identity politics — or “civil rights, broadly understood,” in his terminology — is the glue of the modern Democratic coalition, binding together its highly educated and affluent urban professional wing with its mass electoral base of minorities.\n\n“The groups” are not external to the party but a critical element of its machinery. \n\nThey help write Democratic policies, train and supply staffers for Democratic administrations and congressional offices, and register and organize voters during election season. \n\nThey provide patronage — Hogg, before becoming DNC vice chairman, served for years as the secretary of March for Our Lives Action Fund — and money, deciding which campaigns, issues, and even entertainment gets funded.\n\nWhen the Biden administration declared, as it often did, a “whole of society” commitment to ending this or that injustice, what this meant in practice was deputizing the groups as coequal government partners in implementing the administration’s goals.\n\nWhen Biden defied the groups by refusing to break publicly from Israel, they helped organize mass protests against him and fomented resistance to the policy within his own administration.\n\nPerhaps the most important obstacle for Democrats’ attempt to buck their activist wing is that the groups reflect the preferences of party donors. \n\nThe Democratic donor class ranges from family foundations like Ford and Rockefeller to newer philanthropic and grantmaking organizations based on finance and tech fortunes, such as George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, the various branches of Pierre Omidyar’s empire, and the San Francisco–based Tides Nexus.\n\nThese donors back not only much of the organized progressive movement but also the vast external support apparatus that wages political warfare on the party’s behalf.\n\nTo take one small but telling example: The campaign to remove Trump from the presidential ballot under the 14th Amendment was spearheaded by a 501(c)(3) called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), part of the nonprofit and advocacy machine run by longtime Democratic operative David Brock.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, CREW received $2.85 million from Soros’ Foundation to Promote Open Society — part of the same philanthropic empire that, in 2020, announced $220 million in funding for “efforts to achieve racial equality.”\n\nMaybe a charismatic new party leader could defy this infrastructure and pivot to the center, the way Trump defied a powerful GOP constituency, the institutional pro-life movement, during his 2024 campaign.\n\nAbsent that, however, the Democrats’ path of least resistance in the near term will be to drift in the opposite direction — toward a further embrace of the millennial and Gen Z left.\n\nPopulist pivot\n\nThe framework would likely be what party leaders have started calling “economic” or “authentic” populism, defined by a Bernie Sanders–esque criticism of “oligarchy” that de-emphasizes cultural politics rhetorically without actually abandoning the party’s cultural commitments.\n\nThe clearest example of this populist pivot comes from Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who, since the election, has emerged as a leading voice in an otherwise demoralized and disorganized Democratic opposition.\n\nIn memos, interviews, and X posts, Murphy has argued for the party to coalesce around a message targeting specific billionaire villains, including Elon Musk.\n\nWhen elements of the radical left (including former New York Times and Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz) openly celebrated the December murder of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson, Murphy was quick to discern a political opportunity. \n\nNo, one shouldn’t assassinate executives in Midtown Manhattan, Murphy conceded in an X video posted shortly after the killing — but he felt compelled to acknowledge the country’s anger about the “thousands of people who die often anonymous deaths every single day at the hands of a health care industry that mostly doesn’t give a s–t.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren similarly spoke of the “visceral response from people across the country who feel cheated, ripped off, and threatened by the vile practices of their insurance companies.”\n\nWhile Warren and Murphy have played footsie with the far left, others in the Democratic aristocracy have made more open overtures. \n\n“Pod Save America,” a podcast hosted by three former Obama speechwriters that acts as a clearinghouse for the party leadership’s conversations with itself, enthusiastically backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s unsuccessful bid to become the ranking Democratic member on the powerful House Oversight Committee and then lamented her loss to 74-year-old Gerry Connolly as a victory for the “gerontocracy.”\n\nAmid chatter about the need for a “Democratic Joe Rogan,” “Pod Save America” invited the leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker for a discussion of where the Democrats went wrong in 2024. \n\nA popular influencer who straddles the worlds of elite progressive media (his uncle is Cenk Uygur of “The Young Turks”) and the communist-adjacent milieu of a newly radicalized millennial/Gen Z left, Piker has the potential to play a major role in the Democrats’ future.\n\nA widely shared Slate profile of the “hot” and “dangerous” Piker observed that his “access” — he has hosted Ocasio-Cortez and Biden FTC chief Lina Khan on his stream — is “evidence of a fledgling effort to make him more central to Democratic messaging.”\n\nThe electoral prospects of this rebrand seem dubious. \n\nIn a post at the Liberal Patriot, the disaffected Democratic strategist Ruy Texeira notes that it is “magical thinking” to believe that voters will suddenly forget about Democrats’ cultural radicalism and inept governance if the party focuses on class war. \n\nMuch of Trump’s populist appeal, he observes, comes from working-class resentment of progressive cultural politics — “soak the rich” messaging will do nothing to address it.\n\nBut a pivot to the left would have at least one advantage: delaying any reckoning with the party leadership that brought the Democrats to this point. \n\nIt was, after all, the Obama administration that oversaw the rise of the new identity politics and its nationwide implementation through the coercive power of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nIt was the outgoing Obama administration and the Hillary Clinton campaign that cooked up Russiagate and tried to use the resulting hysteria to consolidate the national security establishment against Trump.\n\nAnd it was the Biden administration that pushed an economic agenda that pundits described as “economic populism” and “social democracy” and inspired regular comparisons of Biden with FDR.\n\nThat agenda yielded the inflation that voters last November cited as a key reason for giving Democrats the shove.\n\nIt was the Obama and (contrary to myth) Biden administrations that oversaw the tilt in American foreign policy away from Israel and Saudi Arabia and toward Iran, paving the way for the Gaza war that, ironically, ended up inflaming the left against Biden and serving as an electoral millstone around his neck.\n\nIn the Italian novel “The Leopard,” set during the 19th-century movement for national unification, a young Sicilian nobleman urges his uncle, a powerful conservative landowner allied with the Bourbons, to flip his allegiance to Garibaldi’s nationalists to avoid being caught on the losing side. \n\nAs the young man explains, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.”\n\nDemocratic leadership seems to be thinking similarly. \n\nWhat advocates of the pivot to the left are suggesting, in effect, is a rehash of what they have pushed as party leaders over the past decade and a half — albeit with fresh young faces and “radical” new antiestablishment branding to “meet our moment.”\n\nGiven the institutional strength of the party, they may succeed.\n\nBut as Donald Trump proved in 2016, a party exhausted of ideas, with a leadership class sporting a record of failures, makes a prime target for a hostile takeover.\n\nPark MacDougald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and editor of The Scroll, Tablet’s daily newsletter.

The order is the latest attempt by Trump to limit or intimidate institutions he does not agree with, including law firms, universities and media companies such as CBS, which is being sued for $20 billion over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign. The CPB immediately fired back Friday, with a statement asserting that the president does not have the power to cut off its funding — Congress does. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,\" the CPB said in a statement. The White House is likely aware of that fact as it reportedly is expected to go to Congress with a formal request to claw back the $1.1 billion currently allocated for the CPB over the next two years. But the president's executive order will not help if the White House is taken to court over the issue, which appears likely. A representative for the CPB did not comment on whether it will pursue legal action, but PBS President Paula Kerger said in a statement that the service is \"exploring all options.\" \"The president’s blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle of the night, threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years,\" Kerger said. NPR Chief Executive Katherine Maher said, \"we will challenge this Executive Order using all means available.\" She called Trump's order \"an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities.\" Both executives were pounded by Republican legislators in March at a hearing in the Capitol where a large photo of drag queen Lil Miss Hot Mess appearing on a PBS kids show was displayed behind committee chair Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). Jeffrey McCall, professor of communication at DePauw University, said there is a case to be made that government funding of public radio and TV outlets needs to be revisited as the media landscape provides a wide array of information sources that didn't exist when the CPB was founded in the 1960s. Instead, the White House is \"shooting itself in the foot\" with political attacks. \"If they go to court over the issue, the first thing CPB lawyers are going to say is this is viewpoint discrimination and they will probably be right,\" McCall said. \"The way the Trump administration is going about this is a little clumsy because they are making this a political football.\" One reason for forming the CPB in the late 1960s was to prevent the government from using funding to exert editorial control over programming. The president's announcement of the executive order — titled \"President Trump Finally Ends the Madness of NPR, PBS\" — came with a litany of stories described as \"examples of the trash that has passed for 'news.'\" The examples included an NPR story on eating human placentas, a practice that has been around for decades, and a 2017 documentary about a transgender teen on PBS. If the battle goes to Congress, public media could have the upper hand. As NPR and PBS executives have often pointed out, most of the CPB funding goes to local public radio and TV stations that are often the lone sources of journalism in their communities. PBS cites data that shows 58% of all TV households tune into one of its member stations over the course of a year and that 60% of its audience lives in rural communities. While the internet is cited as a reason to end public media funding, PBS noted that its programming is viewed in 87% of non-internet homes and 56% of low-income households. Republican politicians in red states who don't get a lot of face time on Fox News like having local outlets where they can reach their constituents. Such thinking has helped preserve public media funding in the past. While Los Angeles outlets have a larger population to draw on for financial support from listeners and local underwriters, the loss of federal dollars would be significant. LAist KPCC-FM (89.3) would lose about $2 million, a relatively small portion of an overall budget of roughly $45 million, but substantial enough that it could have an impact on staffing and programming, said a person familiar with the station’s operations who was not authorized to speak publicly. KCRW-FM (89.9), stands to lose $1.3 million from a budget of $24 million, slightly more than 5%.

So, if I'm somebody who can bring this nation together, hopefully find some common ground, it's something I would consider.\"Why It MattersFollowing across the board losses in the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has been embroiled in infighting and has yet to have a clear leader emerge. Prominent Democrats are beginning to position themselves for the 2028 race, seeking to redefine the party's direction.Beshear's popularity as a Democratic governor in the predominantly Republican state of Kentucky underscores his bipartisan appeal. His ability to win reelection in Kentucky, a state that has consistently voted for Donald Trump, highlights his potential to attract a broad voter base.He's expected to serve as the chair of the National Democratic Caucus in 2026, a role that would expand his national profile ahead of a potential 2028 run.What Do the Polls Show?Morning Consult, which tracks approval ratings for all 50 governors, in early April showed that Beshear maintained a 68 percent approval rating in the first three months of 2025. That numbers makes him the highest approved Democratic governor, and the second-highest approved overall, trailing just behind Vermont Republican Phil Scott, who had a 75 percent approval rating of registered voters surveyed.National polling for the 2028 Democratic primary does not place him in the top tier just yet.Political forecasting site Race to the WH tracks the latest presidential primary polls for the 2028 election. Their national polling average puts him at 2.3 percent.Kamala Harris leads the projections with 27.1 percent, trailed by Pete Buttigieg at 16.1 percent. Beshear falls just above Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, both at 2.0 percent.What Happens NextBeshear is not the only Democrat who has suggested a possible 2028 presidential bid.Former Rhode Island governor and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo this week said to David Axelrod that she would consider running.Other possible contenders, including Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have yet to state whether or not they will pursue White House bids.In 2020, the last election not featuring a Democratic incumbent, more than two dozen candidates explored White House bids or entered the primaries.","summary":"Democratic Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has said he \"would consider\" a 2028 presidential bid.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/andy-beshear-presidential-election-democrat-polls-white-house-2067533","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2637987/kentucky-governor-andy-beshear.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 20:57:47","author":"Kate Nalepinski","authors":["Kate Nalepinski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":317269654,"title":"Black People M.I.A from Anti-Trump Protests, But Maybe It's Time to Start Showing Up","text":"As protests continue to rage across the country against President Donald Trump’s administration, there seems to be one group of Americans no where on the front lines: the Black community. Black folks always show up and out for past social and political causes, but now that we’ve taken a collective step back, our absence is being felt big time.\n\nEvery single day since Trump took office there’s been protests in one city or the next, according to The Washington Post. And in the sea of demonstrators, it’s been hard to spot many Black faces. Trump’s return to office marks a new age in America, and Black people are fed up. But should we be doing more?\n\nWhy Aren’t Black People Protesting?\n\nBlack folks have always been champions of civil rights for all, way before Trump took office. And history shows us we haven’t always gotten the credit we deserved for it. Now, our community is reluctant to help — and for good reason.\n\nMore than 86 percent of Black voters casted their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to CNN exit polls. But not only did the voice of the Black community go unheard with Harris’ loss, but since Trump 2.0, attacks on Black history, gouging of government agencies and even threats to social security have all been a collective slap in the face of Black voters... So why would they join the fight now?\n\nAre We Making a Mistake?\n\nDespite Black people having more than enough reason to sit out this round, we’re living through events for the future history textbooks. These national protests will go down as powerful examples of Americans exercising their rights and taking a clear and direct stand against the acting president. But just as the demonstrations will be documented, so will Black folks’ absence from them. \n\nThere’s power in the Black community, and there’s even more power in mobilization. Many Black leaders including Harris, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett and William J. Barber praised folks for taking to the streets all while encouraging Black people to hold down the fort. “What we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage,” Harris said during her first major speech since leaving office. “Courage is contagious.”\n\nAre Protests Even Working?\n\nShort answer? Yes and no. Protesting against Trump doesn’t promote policy change because Trump is the one making said changes. But as thousands of folks continue to hit the streets, one thing is certain: this is a new age of America. \n\nAmericans haven’t banded together like this since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and we all remember just how impactful George Floyd’s death was. The New York Times estimated anywhere between 15 and 26 million people protested in honor of Floyd. Directly following the tragic murder, several laws like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act aimed to address issues like police misconduct, racial profiling and excessive force. So if you need a recent example of protests influencing real change, well there you go!\n\nIs Rallying the Only Way to Protest?\n\nJust because Black folks put their foot down when it comes to joining demonstrations doesn’t mean we’re laying down for the next four years. Rev. Al Sharpton and other leaders have led their own boycotts and called out the president.\n\nBetween Sharpton’s “buy-cott” of Costco— the grocery store giant who famously doubled down on their commitment to diversity— and politicians like N.J. Rep. Cry Booker’s 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, Black folks are finding new ways to show our solidarity. We have a long four years and beyond to buckle up for, so Black folks, it might be time to rethink how our chapters will read in the new history books.","summary":"As protests continue to rage across the country against President Donald Trump’s administration, there seems to be one group of Americans no where on the front lines: the Black community.

For the record, there have not been any recent riots in Harlem, nor have there been any organized demonstrations against Harvard over its decisions to uphold and protect its DEI practices and initiatives.\n\n“What is he talking about exactly? There were no riots in Harlem. They definitely didn’t go from the non-riots to protest Harvard,” Kosta said. “And none of that had anything to do with Stephen A’s question about academic freedom. It’s almost like he’s talking about Black stuff because Stephen A. Smith is Black.”\n\n“The Daily Show” production continued to play the clip from Trump’s interview, during which the president suddenly shifted to boasting that he had “a very high Black vote.” The number of Black male voters for Trump roughly doubled in the 2024 presidential election. However, former Vice President Kamala Harris won 80% of the Black vote, per an exit poll by the Associated Press.\n\n“I’m starting to think that maybe Trump should not be choosing the curriculum for the smartest college in the world,” Kosta said. “The answer was so dumbfounding that Stephen A., who is a professional interrupter, was left speechless for the first time in his life.”\n\nAfterward, Kosta moved on to Smith’s “General Hospital” cameo appearance, but he had to throw in one more Trump bit to seal the comedic deal on his segment.\n\n“I can’t wait to tune in next week to see if he has an evil twin Stephen B. Smith,” Kosta said, making light of Smith’s character, who fatally shoots a nurse in the episode. “I guess I got to start watching ‘General Hospital,’ or as Trump calls it, ‘General Harlem.’”\n\nYou can watch “The Daily Show” clip in the video above.","summary":"\"It's almost like he's talking about Black stuff because Stephen A.

The kind of week that requires a drink, or several, to forget about. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nThey say it’s easy to start a war, harder to finish one. David Hogg, the Democratic National Committee’s current Vice Chair (and we’ll see how long that lasts), is trying to trigger a war within his party, threatening to launch a massive primary campaign against older incumbent Democrats. But with each passing day, it’s becoming less clear how he will seize his victory.\n\nOn Tuesday, Semafor reported that Kalyn Free, a Native American attorney whom Hogg defeated in the vice chair election, is challenging the results of the race.\n\nThe DNC plans to hold a meeting on May 12 to hear Free’s challenge. Free, of course, claims the “fatally flawed election … discriminated against three women of color candidates.”\n\nBig yikes. Those are not words you want to hear if you are a straight, white male.\n\nMeanwhile, Hogg is vowing to continue being a petulant goofball. Or, to borrow his words, “fight.”\n\nF This, F That\n\nIlhan Omar has a sailor’s mouth. And bad political instincts, too.\n\nDaily Caller News Foundation reporter Myles Morrell asked Omar if more Democrats should jet off to El Salvador and advocate for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member deported by the Trump administration.\n\nSimple question, right?\n\nIn fact, Omar didn’t even have to answer it. She could have simply walked off in silence. Politicians do that literally every day.\n\nInstead, she made a mockery of herself, and, without answering the question, repeatedly told Morrell to “fuck off.”\n\n“Do you think more of your Democratic colleagues should be traveling to El Salvador to advocate on behalf of Abrego Garcia?” Morrell asked.\n\n INSANE: Rep. Ilhan Omar tells Daily Caller News Foundation reporter @MylesMorell to “f*** off” 🚨 pic.twitter.com/cZdn6BmgWj — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 1, 2025\n\n“I think you should fuck off,” Omar said.\n\n“I’m sorry, what, congresswoman?” Morrell asked.\n\n“You should fuck off. You,” Omar said.\n\nYes, what a fantastic look for Democrats. Way to keep it classy, Ilhan.\n\nKamala, Why?!\n\nIt’s a huge night for Kamala on Wednesday. This is her first major speech since her blow-out loss to Donald Trump.\n\nAll she has to do, frankly, is not say something ridiculous. That’s a tough ask for Kamala, but not an impossible one.\n\nAh, but what does she do? Kamala encourages Democrats to act like elephants, referencing a recent viral video of elephants at the San Diego Zoo huddling together amid an earthquake. She called it a “powerful metaphor,” encouraging fellow Democrats to “find and connect with each other.”\n\n“Please allow me, friends, to digress for a moment. Okay, it’s kind of dark in here, but I am going to ask for a show of hands. Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago? The one of the elephants at the San Diego Zoo during the earthquake. Google it if you have not seen it,” Harris said.\n\n“So, that scene has been on my mind,” she added. “Everybody has been asking what are you thinking about these days. For those who haven’t seen it, here those elephants were, and as soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet, they got in a circle and stood next to each other to protect the most vulnerable. Think about it. What a powerful metaphor.”\n\nPowerful, indeed.\n\nCrockett Loves Borders\n\nShe’s back. The queen of dark woke.\n\nIt may comes as a shocker, but Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett is a fan of secure borders. And on Wednesday, expressed such support while accidentally indicting her own party’s open border policies.\n\nCrockett posted an Instagram video complaining about Trump and the GOP’s agenda to deport illegal aliens. However, she accidentally called for, yes, closed borders.\n\n“How would [the Trump administration feel] if some other country decided they were gonna just start throwing people randomly in our country. That is absolutely insane. All I gotta say is you need to get these fools out of here,” Crockett said.\n\n Jasmine Crockett on deportations: “This is insane. How would it feel if countries sent people to our country!?” pic.twitter.com/3RuovIWJVP — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) May 1, 2025\n\nJasmine arrived at her conclusion that borders are good, in a roundabout way. But, hey, that has to count for something.\n\nWalz Admits He Was A DEI Hire\n\nDemocrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz admitted Monday that was a DEI hire, and guess what happens when you hire someone solely based on their race or ethnicity?\n\nAs was the case with Waltz in the 2024 election, DEI hires tend to be failures, because they were never cut out for the job in the first place — except for the fact that they had the correct skin color.\n\nAt a Harvard Kennedy School forum, Waltz said that Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate to “code talk to white guys.”\n\nBrilliant strategy, I must say.\n\n“I also was on the ticket, quite honestly, because I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that, then I could put them at ease. I was the permission structure to say you can do this and vote for this, and you look across those swing states, with the exception of Minnesota, we didn’t get enough of those votes,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nWell, it clearly didn’t work. Walz was far better at code-talking to white liberal women than to any man — black, white, gay, straight, orange, or purple.\n\nTrump Trumps The Polls\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s poll numbers aren’t looking too hot at the moment. But Democrats might not have a reason to celebrate.\n\nAccording to a new CNN poll, 45% of registered voters believe Trump is doing a better job than former vice president Kamala Harris would have. Forty-three percent believe the same of Harris.\n\n “These numbers should be a major wake-up call for Democrats.” Even now, Trump still does well when matched against Democrats. -Trump 45%-Harris 43% on who’d be doing a better job as president -Trump 40% to Dems in Congress’ 32% on who can better deal with the main U.S. problems pic.twitter.com/P5Fg4KdLqG — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) May 1, 2025\n\n“If Democrats think that at this particular point, just because Donald Trump is unpopular, that they’re going to run away with it like a Heisman Trophy winner – that is not necessarily the case. These numbers should be a major wake-up moment for Democrats,” CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten said.\n\n“When you match Donald Trump against his actual competition, Donald Trump comes out ahead…and that is why Democrats, in fact, cannot count their chickens just yet, because those eggs have not cracked at this particular moment,” he continued.\n\nSign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

So, naturally, funding for those is being targeted as well. This is partially a function of the administration's intention to eliminate the Department of Education, but there also seems to be a specific focus on programs that target low-income individuals.\n\nFor example, the GEAR UP program describes itself as \"designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.\" The OMB document describes it as \"a relic of the past when financial incentives were needed to motivate Institutions of Higher Education to engage with low-income students and increase access.\" It goes on to claim that this is \"not the obstacle it was for students of limited means.\"\n\nSimilarly, the SEOG program funding is \"awarded to an undergraduate student who demonstrates exceptional financial need.\" In the OMB's view, colleges and universities \"have used [it] to fund radical leftist ideology instead of investing in students and their success.\" Another cut is claimed to eliminate \"Equity Assistance Centers that have indoctrinated children.\" And \"The Budget proposes to end Federal taxpayer dollars being weaponized to indoctrinate new teachers.\"\n\nIn addition, the federal work-study program, which subsidizes on-campus jobs for needy students, is also getting a billion-dollar cut. Again, the document says that the states can pay for it.\n\n(The education portion also specifically cuts the funding of Howard University, which is both distinct as a federally supported Black university and also notable as being where Kamala Harris got her first degree.)\n\nThe end of US leadership\n\nThis budget is a recipe for ending the US's leadership in science. It would do generational damage by forcing labs to shut down, with a corresponding loss of highly trained individuals and one-of-a-kind research materials. At the same time, it will throttle the educational pipeline that could eventually replace those losses. Given that the US is one of the major sources of research funding in the world, if approved, the budget will have global consequences.\n\nTo the people within the OMB who prepared the document, these are not losses. The document makes it very clear that they view many instances of scientific thought and evidence-based policy as little more than forms of ideological indoctrination, presumably because the evidence sometimes contradicts what they'd prefer to believe.","summary":"Budget document derides research and science-based policy as \"woke,\" \"scams.\"","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/","image":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1291108057-1152x648.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 19:39:25","author":"John Timmer","authors":["John Timmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":317251158,"title":"Tim Walz Thinks Democrats Didn’t “Do a Good Enough Job” of Listening to Voters—But He’s Not Despairing","text":"When I caught him at one last month—in Lorain, Ohio, a manufacturing town near Cleveland—it harkened back to the optimism of the early days of Kamala Harris’s campaign. She and Walz seemed to have the wind at their backs, and it felt like “good vibes” might prevail over Trump, JD Vance, and what the Minnesota governor memorably described as “weird” MAGA Republicans. It didn’t exactly work out last fall, of course: Trump returned to power, and Democrats were cast into the political wilderness.\nAnd yet, the former veep candidate remains hopeful. In a follow-up conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length, Walz sounded off on Trump’s “dangerous” agenda, his own party’s shortcomings, and the “opportunity” Democrats could have on the other side of Trump’s term: “Trump has shown us that, in 100 days, we can significantly change this country,” Walz told me. “We’ll simply do it for the good of the people.”\nVanity Fair: One thing I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how radically different things would be if the election had gone just a little differently. I mean, Trump claimed to have this “mandate” because he won the popular vote and Republicans won unified control in Washington—which isn’t insignificant, obviously. But we’re talking about a small fraction of votes in a handful of states that, if they go the other way, the country is on an entirely different trajectory. It’s striking to think about that as someone on the outside. But on a personal level, I wonder what that’s like for you, as someone whose name was actually on the ticket.\nTim Walz: I certainly wanted Kamala Harris! We would not have had this chaos. We would have had a serious leader. She’d have been surrounded by serious people—not these unserious clowns who sit around Donald Trump. And I think Americans would have seen a trajectory, especially on the economy and our global relationships, continue on. But a lot of people say that, like, there would have been this radically different world—I don’t think Donald Trump would have quit. I think January 6 would have been very small compared to what he would have done. He’s that dangerous. And so, you know, it’s all speculation, but I think for me, I respect how dangerous he is. I respect when he says he’s going to do something, no matter how unhinged it is, he’s going to attempt to do it.\nI think the foundational values of America would have been much more in place. I think that’s what these town halls are about. I think people are coming looking for a different way of doing things. I don’t think anybody should pretend it’s going to go back to the way it was before so quickly. It’s going to take work.\nYou mention the town halls. At the one in Lorain, Ohio, it seemed cathartic for those who were there. But talking to folks afterward, there was also this sense of powerlessness still—like at least for the time being, we can sound all the alarms we want, but at the end of the day there are limits to what can be done to check this guy’s whims. What do you say to that? And do you feel that to some extent as well?\nWhat I try to tell people—even the power of a proactive approach, of going there, I talk about how you feel a sense of community. You’re surrounded by people. You’re not going crazy, other people think this way, too. It gets you away from the negative.\nI have to tell you, I’m blessed here in Minnesota with [state Attorney General] Keith Ellison. The attorneys general in states are doing a hell of a job, and the federal bench at this point in time is still holding. How long that happens, I don’t know. What does the Supreme Court do when those federal cases reach them? I also don’t know. But I do think that this is not performative protest. What I thought was different, and I don’t know how you took it—I’ve done town halls and everything, and what I found so interesting about these, and I think Democrats would be wise to listen to this…people are telling their stories. They’re sharing and trusting others with their stories, and they’re telling stories about how this impacts them. To be candid with you, I’m not sure Democrats have done a good enough job of that. We talk about the need to protect the Department of Education. I don’t think we always get to the why. At my town hall down with Beto O’Rourke in Texas, a young man named Aiden, a middle schooler—he understands that if the Department of Education goes away, him and his friends who might have Individualized Education Programs are put at risk. And I think that’s what the town halls have done differently. I think this willingness of people to tell what government means to them is stronger than I’ve seen it.\nWell, speaking of the effects the Trump administration is having on everyday Americans, Trump just released his budget plan today, and, as expected, it includes massive cuts to non-defense spending, diversity initiatives, and clean-energy initiatives, among others—upwards of $160 billion in total, all of which will be meant to offset his planned tax cuts. It’s hard to be surprised by this; this is essentially the wishlist he ran on. But what do you make of the proposal, and what do you think it would mean for everyday Americans?\nI’m just digesting like everybody else. But I think what is significant about this coming out is not just that it is horrific and not that it favors the wealthy and not that it is cruel—it’s that it is now on paper. And members of Congress who are avoiding these town halls are now going to have to vote for it. You already see a couple of them cracking. That was the purpose of the town halls—to put the pressure on them that we are watching you. We are watching you if you are going to make these cuts, if you’re going to make cuts to Social Security, if you’re going to make the cuts to veterans’ benefits, education—things that poll very highly amongst Republicans and Democrats. Now, you’re on the clock. It was theoretical. It was Mr. Lie During the Campaign—I’ll reduce prices, I’ll end the war in Ukraine, I’ll do this, I’ll do that. Well, none of it was true. He can get away with trying to make those lies. But now he put it on paper.\nWhat I would say is this is a rallying point. I think a lot of the town halls and a lot of the rallies were pretext. Now, it’s real. This is the fight to this CR vote. If we get this thing to fail, or significant backing off of these, not only does it protect the American public—it puts Donald Trump at huge risk, and it puts those members of Congress at huge risk.\nAnd he has, amid some of this pressure, backed off certain things. I’m thinking about tariffs here. He has backed off some tariffs or amended them. He “modified” his auto tariffs in an executive order this week, for example, amid a lot of warnings from industry leaders about the effect they would have. And I guess you could look at that as some relief, that perhaps he can be moved, but to me it also adds to this other concern: That he’s basically holding the economy hostage and using the promise of relief to force the private sector to kiss the ring.\nI agree with you 100 percent. If he’s making any changes, it has nothing to do with the pain it’s causing the American public. It has nothing to do whether experts agree with it or not. It has everything to do with Donald Trump’s personal poll ratings, which are tanking. So as long as they continue to tank, he may modify himself. And look, I’m grateful if it’s providing a little relief to Americans. But this flip-flopping, putting a tariff on and off—the damage is already done. People are looking for trading partners they can depend on. The stress is already showing up. The tariffs are already hitting. You know, he goes and pressures Jeff Bezos—well, Americans are not stupid. When the XBox they’re planning to buy their kids over Christmas has gone up from $300 to $380, which it did today, they’re going to know it’s totally Trump. So the only way Trump will change is if he thinks it’s a personal threat to him.\nLook, we’re going to win the governor’s race this fall in New Jersey and Virginia. You’re going to start to see any special elections, they’re going to start losing members of Congress who are in districts that Kamala Harris won, and Republicans are going to start jumping ship, and Trump’s going to have a problem. What I worry about is, just like a cornered rat, he’s going to start lashing out again. That’s why I would expect you to see him double down on his horrific policies around immigration and no due process. He will scapegoat the LGBT community. He will go after political rivals. We need to be buckled up and ready to go. They’re showing that. This resistance feels different to me.\nIn what way?\nI just think it’s more focused and it’s less dependent on an election or a candidate. It’s more focused on, You’re not going to do this to America. You’re not going to do this to my neighborhood.\nOne thing that feels different to me compared with the first term is that some of it feels more antagonistic to Democrats, as well. It seems like there’s broader frustration, not only with Trump for doing all this, but toward Democrats for not putting forward enough of a competing vision. It feels more wide-ranging.\nI think that's fair, too, and I think you should have to respond to people. I've been saying this. People are frustrated that when we get power, we haven’t moved the ball far enough. They were happy with the [Affordable Care Act] 15 years ago, but they’re still battling with their insurance company and getting denials and things. We are seeing jobs go overseas. Trump assesses their pain, even though he caused most of it and is not going to fix it. He assessed their pain. And Democrats—I heard it especially in Ohio, that, you know, You guys said you were going to help and you didn’t. So I think what it’s doing is refocusing. I know people say, We don’t need a circular firing squad. We don’t need to fight internally. I think we do need to re-clarify who we are. If our brand is damaged, we need to make sure, without a doubt, the working class knows we’re with them. So I’m glad for people to challenge us. I’m glad for them to challenge me if I’m not moving in a direction that helps them. I think that makes us stronger.\nEspecially with Democrats in the minority right now in Washington, and Republicans not doing a ton to curb Trump at the moment, state leaders like yourself have taken on even more importance. Democratic governors have made a lot of moves to shield their states from Trump. But there does seem to be some divergence in approach. I’m based in Chicago—JB Pritzker, in my state, has taken a very aggressive approach; Gretchen Whitmer, in Michigan, has established this “working relationship” with Trump on certain things, even as warns that he has brought the United States into a “constitutional crisis.” How do you think about your approach? And, more broadly, how do you think Democrats should be coming at this political moment?\nFirst and foremost, Democratic governors have a responsibility to protect their people in their state. Each state's a little different. Each state's circumstances are a little different, in how they approach them. And I found that out during COVID. I had a good working relationship with Vice President Mike Pence, who I had served within the House, and he was very helpful—I don't know if that story ever got told. But you find your way to make a difference. JB is out hammering on this, you’ve got Maura Healey, you’ve got Andy Beshear doing his thing by showing that there’s a way to bring people together. For me, it’s a little bit different, having been the vice president’s running mate this last time. It brings a little more attention, so I have a platform, and I’m going out and using that platform to challenge these folks. But I think it goes back to, how can we best make sure that the damage he’s doing is mitigated? And I trust my Democratic governor colleagues are trying to use their skills and their unique position to the best of their ability. I keep saying this, Eric, and I think this is true: Democratic governors, senators, Senator [Cory] Booker, others that are out there, House members, Bernie Sanders, AOC—I think all of us need to fill a lane that’s best for us. I don’t think one voice can counter where Trump is at. He sucks up too much oxygen. So I’m actually quite comfortable with each of these folks finding what they can do. And I can tell you, again, going back to the governors—their styles may look differently, but it’s all focused on protecting their states.\nThis week marked 100 days of this presidency. It’s stunning to think of all the destruction he’s wrought in that time. It’s stunning, too, to think there’s over 1,300 days more. Looking ahead at that…\nLook, he’ll be a lame duck after the midterms, and that’ll significantly change things. I see it as an opportunity. He has massively changed and rearranged us as a nation. He’s destroyed our relationships, our credibility. He’s put us into the camp with the autocrats—North Korea, Russia—and he did it in 100 days. So my thinking is, Why the hell should we wait a generation to fix healthcare? Why should I wait a generation to pull people out of poverty? I’m of the sense now that Trump has shown us that, in 100 days, we can significantly change this country—we’ll simply do it for the good of the people.\nThis guy will be gone at one point in time. You’re right—1,300 days. I do think he’ll be dangerous during that time. But I think we should see it as an opportunity when we get back in power: God help us if we don’t move fast to improve peoples’ lives. That’s how I’m looking at it.\nAn opportunity, as well as an endurance test right now.\nIt is. We’ll stick together. I’m in for the fight, and I can tell Americans are.","summary":"In an interview with VF, the Minnesota governor and former veep hopeful called on his party to take a “proactive approach,” and labeled Trump’s White House “unserious clowns.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/tim-walz-isnt-giving-into-trump-era-despair-this-resistance-feels-different","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68151b0e5233df60bfbcd383/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf525-tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 19:37:14","author":"Eric Lutz","authors":["Eric Lutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":317245472,"title":"Meet the AI, crypto executive cozying up to Trump while also backing resistance movement: 'Won't be fooled'","text":"FIRST ON FOX: One of the major players in the crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) industries attempting to cozy up to the Trump administration is a longtime Democratic operative and donor who has backed anti-Trump efforts and candidates while working for companies stacked with Democratic activists. Chris Lehane, a veteran political strategist dating back to the Clinton administration, has donated over $150,000 to Democrats, FEC records show, and many of those Democrats have been outspoken Trump critics for several years. Lehane has been a major backer of Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who voted to convict Trump during his impeachment trial in 2021 and against several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. He also hosted a San Francisco fundraiser for the Virginia senator, along with Open AI’s Sam Altman, in March. Warner has been a key figure in the resistance to the Trump administration, including being a vocal critic of the Trump administration's \"sloppy\" Signal chat controversy and pushing back on the administration's DOGE push against waste, fraud and abuse in government. Lehane also donated thousands of dollars to the Biden and Harris campaigns. TRUMP CRYPTO CHIEF SAYS WE ARE IN THE 'GOLDEN AGE' FOR DIGITAL ASSETS, 'CLEARING THE DECK' OF BIDEN BARRIERS In 2024, Lehane joined the board of Coinbase, which operates one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, and has taken an active role influencing crypto and AI policy in recent months. Coinbase’s Board of Directors has donated more than $22 million to Democratic candidates and committees while donating less than $5 million to Republicans, FEC records show. Those donations include almost $50,000 to Kamala Harris' campaign since 2009, including to her presidential campaign, from board member and top Democratic donor Ron Conway. Conway has donated over $300,000 to the DNC, over $1.5 million to the DCCC and millions to the House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC, FEC records show. Since 1999, board member Fred Wilson has given over $2 million to political campaigns and committees, and only $17,600 of that went to Republicans, FEC records show. MR. WONDERFUL TALKS 'EXCITEMENT' AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY UNDER TRUMP: AMERICA IS IN A 'NEW PHASE' Additionally, Coinbase’s Global Advisory Council is laden with Trump critics, including John Anzelone, a pollster for Biden, Obama and Hillary Clinton; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper; former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa; former GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who said in September he would not vote for Trump; and former Democratic Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, who served on the January 6th Select Committee. Julia Krieger, Coinbase's head of U.S. public affairs, previously worked for American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research firm, and Media Matters, known for organizing pressure campaigns against conservative voices it opposes. She also held multiple roles in the Biden administration and the 2020 Biden campaign. Coinbase does have two Trump allies on its advisory board — David Urban and recently appointed Chris LaCivita, who served as the Republican National Committee's chief operating officer and held multiple titles on the successful 2024 Trump campaign. Additionally, several members of Coinbase's executive team have donated to Republicans, including Brian Armstrong and Paul Grewal. Armstrong, the company's CEO, was present at the Trump White House crypto summit earlier this year. Open Secrets data from the 2024 election cycle shows a roughly 50-50 split between Coinbase's donations to congressional Democrats and Republicans. \"Our focus has always been mission first, to support candidates that support crypto and blockchain innovation, and we're proud to do so,\" Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, a former top NSC official under President George W. Bush, told Fox News Digital. Lehane also serves as the vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, a company that Fox News Digital reported on recently. It partnered with a new AI initiative led by a group co-founded with outgoing Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry that has pushed left-wing causes and has several board members aligned with Democrats. The longtime Democratic operative is also an operating partner at Haun Ventures, which is staffed by employees who appear to donate almost exclusively to Democrats. Since 2022, individuals listed as being employed by Haun Ventures have made 43 separate political contributions totaling over $110,000. All 43 of those were to Democratic candidates or organizations.

Etienne, citing conversations with Democratic House lawmakers, portrayed Jeffries as indecisive and too weak in opposition to President Donald Trump.\n\n“If you don’t have coordination, you’ve just got words on a paper that you’re calling talking points,” Etienne said. “It’s meaningless. And I think that’s where we are right now.” (RELATED: Hakeem Jeffries Pushes Back On David Hogg’s Plans To Primary Incumbent House Dems)\n\n“I was hearing from leadership staff that the leadership on Capitol Hill right now wants to sort of move away from that Pelosi era — that they … don’t want to embrace anyone or anything that’s like Pelosi,” Etienne told the podcast host, Politico’s Rachael Bade. “Which I just think is the dumbest s-h-i-t ever.”\n\nAlthough Etienne expressed respect for Jeffries’ “ability to message,” she immediately followed up saying that the top House Democrat cannot effectively make decisions on how to message.\n\n“What I’ve been hearing from members is that, to sort of some it up, he thinks long, too long and wrong about things. He takes too much council and then takes too long to make a decision,” Etienne said. “Which says that maybe you don’t trust your gut in the moment, which is also fair when you’re a new leader cause you’re still trying to figure it all out. It might also suggest maybe you don’t have a handle on the caucus, or you don’t have a handle on how to actually land some punches on Donald Trump.”\n\nJeffries has reportedly been taking some heat from the left for lacking a plan to counter the Trump administration. Etienne said she noticed a lack of control over the caucus during the president’s joint address to Congress in March.\n\n“I thought the 50 different protests during his joint address was embarrassing. It was a T-shirt, it was a paddle, it was a walkout. The reality is, you’ve gotta learn when to pull the trigger on some of these tactics,” Etienne said. “I also thought it was a problem for Mr. Jeffries. It says a lot about how people value his leadership. He asked for no protests, and what did they do? They protested in fifty different ways to the point in which it was just an ineffective protest. I think that was the beginning of a signal that he might have a larger problem.”\n\nAfter Trump’s joint address, Democrats’ protests quickly made headlines, whether it was refusing to clap for special guests throughout the speech or Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green’s repeated disruptions which resulted House Speaker Mike Johnson promptly removing the lawmaker from the chamber.\n\nThe morning Etienne appeared on Politico’s podcast, Jeffries had given a speech about the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency. However, she said no one on the Democratic leader’s team sent out a press release with his talking points.\n\n“And I’m going to be doing TV and this interview all day. That’s a failure,” the former top Pelosi and Harris aide said. “How do you get to discipline if you’re not telling people what the hell you want them to say?”\n\nEtienne also said she was “disappointed” after a press conference earlier this year where Jeffries said the Democrats had “no power” being in the minority.\n\n“It said to me that he’s not seeking out the answers to that actual question which is what powers do I have in the minority? What can I actually do?” Etienne said. “Trump is just giving us all this incredible red meat. I mean, incredible. I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like the biggest gift any party has been given by the opposition and we’re just squandering it.”\n\n Big Scoop Here: Jeffries is telling Democrats he doesn’t want more trips to El Salvador via @Carrasquillo https://t.co/51mmkKItOQ — Sam Stein (@samstein) April 30, 2025 \n\n“Hakeem Jeffries is the so-called leader of a team that doesn’t fear him, doesn’t follow him, and now, doesn’t even pretend to respect him,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Marinella said in a press release.\n\nJeffries on Monday dodged the Daily Caller News Foundation’s question on his messaging to House Democrats on taking trips to El Salvador to protest reputed MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation. Reports later surfaced that Jeffries was telling Democrats behind closed doors to stop the trips to the Central American nation.\n\nJeffries and his office denied the reports, calling the discussions “a complete and total fabrication” at his Thursday press conference after another reporter asked if he supports members of his conference going to El Salvador in the future. Jeffries said, “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”\n\n“Hakeem Jeffries greenlit a trip to support an illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member, then turned around and threw his own members under the bus when it blew up in his face,” Marinella said in a statement. “Now he’s acting like he had nothing to do with promoting an alleged domestic abuser as their poster child. This is what Democrat ‘leadership’ looks like.”\n\nJeffries’ team did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I mean, I've never seen anything like this before. It's like the biggest gift any party has been given by the opposition, and we're just squandering it, to a degree,\" former Pelosi advisor Ashley Etienne told Politico's Deep Dive podcast. Etienne helped Pelosi oversee Democrats' messaging during President Donald Trump's first impeachment. She also previously worked for former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. She said Jeffries was \"doing well\" in many areas and said she had \"a tremendous amount of respect\" for the New York Democrat but signaled that he was missing opportunities on anti-Trump messaging.

And I'm going to be doing TV and this interview all day. That's a failure,\" Etienne said. \"How do you get to discipline if you're not telling people what the hell you want them to say? At least emphatically, at least tonally.\" Jeffries' allies pushed back against that characterization, pointing out that intraparty friction was taking attention away from Trump's low poll numbers and Republicans' policies. \"Donald Trump’s approval ratings are plummeting, and he’s bringing House Republicans down with him. Extreme MAGA Republicans have been forced to delay their plans to advance Trump’s centerpiece legislative priority due to intense backlash against their scheme to enact the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and food assistance. Let’s keep the main thing, the main thing,\" Jeffries spokesperson Christiana Stephenson told Fox News Digital. Just Friday morning, Jeffries released a statement hammering House Republicans for having to delay part of their legislative work to advance Trump's agenda. But Etienne's comments are a notable rebuke from a former senior Democratic leadership aide to one of the party's most powerful current officials, which comes after months of Democrats being plagued by infighting over messaging woes. Etienne noted that Democrats had scored several wins on the messaging front, like having \"successfully demonized Elon Musk\" and Sen. Cory Booker's recent record-breaking filibuster speech. But she singled out liberals' protests during Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress as an \"embarrassing\" setback for the party and Jeffries. \"If you look at the headlines post-the speech, even during the speech, it was more about Democrats and Democrats protesting rather than what Trump was actually saying. And in those kind of moments, you don't want to become the story. You want Trump to be the story,\" Etienne said. \"And I also thought it was a problem for Mr. Jeffries. I mean, it really says a lot about how people value his leadership. He asked for no protest. And what did they do? They protest 50 different ways.\" AOC CLAIMS 'WE ARE ONE' IN CAMPAIGN-STYLE VIDEO DESPITE YEARS OF INVOKING RACE, GENDER IN POLITICS Both Pelosi and Jeffries' offices told Politico that the latter often seeks the former's input, and Jeffries' spokesperson pushed back on Politico's reporting that House Democratic leaders were seeking to move past Pelosi and that Jeffries was not doing enough to help Democratic groups with messaging. One of those groups, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), pushed back on the assertion they were not hearing enough from Jeffries. PCCC sent out a press release that read, \"Today, in a POLITICO article we are not interested in dwelling on, a former Pelosi staffer attacked Hakeem Jeffries. PCCC co-founder Adam Green said, ‘We hear more from Jeffries than we ever heard from Pelosi.’\" Meanwhile, a House Democratic aide told Fox News Digital that Jeffries held \"multiple calls\" previewing his earlier speech on Trump's first 100 days in office, as well as talking points \"emphasizing the Leader’s message that President Trump’s first 100 days have been a disaster for the American people.\" Stephenson, Jeffries' spokesperson, also posted on X of Politico's report, \"Can anyone tell me how grandstanding like this is anything other than a gift to Republicans?\" But House Republicans' elections arm was quick to pounce on the discord as well. \"Hakeem Jeffries is the so-called leader of a team that doesn’t fear him, doesn’t follow him, and now, doesn’t even pretend to respect him,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Democratic strategist Julian Epstein, a former chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Jeffries' leadership but said that Trump was not Democrats' main problem. \"He's not a particularly effective speaker, gives no sense of direction or purpose, seems intent on not offending anyone, and has a leadership style that seems extremely passive,\" Epstein said. \"The Democrats in the House just seem like a big blob that goes wherever gravity takes them, and right now gravity is taking them to the hard protest left. But no matter who the leader is, if the Democrats are selling a product that voters don't like, it won't matter.\" Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"A former top aide to ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sounding off about House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries&apos; efforts.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-pelosi-aide-accuses-hakeem-jeffries-squandering-anti-trump-opportunities-stunning-rebuke","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/jeffries-pelosi-story.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 18:34:27","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":317223686,"title":"Tim Walz’s goofy ‘revelation’ speaks volumes about Democrats’ identity-politics fixation","text":"Former vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz recently told an audience at Harvard’s Kennedy School that former Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as a running mate because of his uncanny ability to connect with the average Caucasian cisgender dude.\n\n“I could code talk to white guys — watching football, fixing their truck,” he explained. “I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.’”\n\nIt’s true, all the fellas are talking about “permission structures” these days.\n\nAlas, the White Guy Whisperer didn’t really help the Democratic Party ticket at all in 2024.\n\nPart of the problem, one imagines, is that the governor of Minnesota has an utterly deluded conception of himself as the embodiment of the working-class male.\n\nThough even if he were, few would have cared. Blatant pandering doesn’t go over well with any race or gender.\n\nFor one thing, guys who talk to guys never talk about how good they are at talking to them.\n\nSay what you will about President Donald Trump, he doesn’t “code” his language to appeal to the working class or anyone else.\n\nWhen he slams general managers for passing on Shedeur Sanders in the NFL draft, for example, you know the comment hasn’t been vetted by a bunch of pinhead pollsters or risk-averse handlers.\n\nYet, authenticity is about the last thing that came to mind watching Walz’s ham-fisted manly media stunts in 2024, not during his cringy Madden video game contest with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or his hunting outing where he struggled with a shotgun.\n\nNever mind that the notion of “white guys” being transfixed by a candidate simply because he also watches football is awfully insulting. Just because a couple of white guys talk about trucks doesn’t mean they agree on foreign policy.\n\nNow, we might have a propensity to read too much into things politicians say, but I think Walz’s white-guy code comment also speaks to one of the big problems hampering Democrats: They have an unnatural obsession with identitarianism.\n\nIt is tragically stupid and wholly un-American to approach people by race. On the most basic level, voters who define themselves, or let others define them, by immutable characteristics undermine their self-worth and free will.\n\nThere’s no such thing as “white guys” in anything but a physiological sense.\n\nTrump and I are both white guys born in Queens, though, admittedly, one of us has been marginally more successful.\n\nStill, a white Southern Baptist from Georgia probably gets Trump, a billionaire who’s lived a gold-plated existence, in ways I don’t.\n\nAnd a white Evangelical guy from rural South Carolina, a Catholic white guy from Arizona or an atheist white guy from Oregon all have different sets of cultural values, interests, and quirks.\n\nA minuscule number of racists find their identity in being “white.”\n\nI’ve never once in my life wondered what other “white people” were thinking or doing or saying, nor has any normal person.\n\nYet, the Democratic Party is a coalition cobbled together by identity politics.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons it’s compelled to expend so much energy painting the opposition as a bigoted enemy.\n\nThe left has gambled on the idea that ethnic demographics would transform the electorate and destroy the “white” Republican Party. No such luck.\n\nDemocrats see the world in swaths of color and believe everyone has a similarly blinkered view of the world.\n\nFor years, Republicans pandered to Hispanics and black voters to try to expand their coalition, altering policy and lifting minority candidates for the sole purpose of connecting to voters through identity.\n\nIt never works because identity politics has always been overrated.\n\nGenerational voting patterns and regionalism have far more powerful effects on who we support.\n\nAnd citizens in urban areas tend to vote for Democrats who align with their moral outlook. Urban areas have more minorities. The rural public votes for more traditional values. The political conflict isn’t about color but worldview.\n\nIf racial divisions exist, it’s often because they are lumped together by the modern left.\n\nIncidentally, one of the benefits of federalism and local control is that it allows these disparate people to live under a single federal government that upholds some basic ideals.\n\nDemocrats have spent years trying to centralize the federal government and appropriate institutions to compel people to adopt their own increasingly narrow and unhinged liberal sensibilities.\n\nAnd one of the most corrosive aspects of that worldview is projecting your own racial views onto others.","summary":"“I could code talk to white guys — watching football, fixing their truck,” Walz explained. “I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.’”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/02/opinion/tim-walzs-goofy-revelation-speaks-volumes-about-democrats-identity-politics-fixation/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/2024-philadelphia-pennsylvania-harris-ended-103587104.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 18:27:22","author":"David Harsanyi","authors":["David Harsanyi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":317227312,"title":"More than 25 percent of people say Chinese-Americans are a ‘threat’ to the US, poll finds","text":"More than a quarter of Americans think Chinese-Americans are a threat to U.S. society, a new poll released Thursday revealed. \n\nThe Social Tracking of Asian Americans in the U.S., or STAATUS Index, found that 40 percent believe Asian Americans are more loyal to their countries of origin than the U.S.\n\nThis comes just five years after the Covid-19 pandemic, when the U.S. experienced a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. \n\nTwenty-seven percent said they were “at least somewhat concerned” that “Chinese Americans are a threat to U.S. society, especially around national security.”\n\nMeanwhile, 63 percent of Asian Americans say they felt unsafe in at least one daily setting, according to the index, which was released on Thursday at the start of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Josh Riley’s reelection campaign took a check from a left-wing activist group that supports abolishing cash bail, the Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.\n\nRiley’s campaign committee accepted a $1,000 donation from Voters of Tomorrow PAC, a youth-driven advocacy organization that promotes a host of so-called criminal justice reform policies, according to his Q1 Federal Election Commission (FEC) report. The freshman lawmaker campaigned as a moderate Democrat and crossed the aisle on several pieces of GOP-backed legislation in the first months of the 119th Congress, but has repeatedly taken donations from left-wing groups that support eliminating cash bail among other far-left policies. (RELATED: ‘Criminal Justice Reform’ Advocate Denied Bail After Being Charged In Murder Case)\n\nRiley represents New York’s 19th congressional district, a swing seat in upstate New York that President Donald Trump came within less than two percentage points of winning in 2024.\n\nThe lawmaker narrowly defeated then-incumbent Republican New York Rep. Marc Molinaro by less than 10,000 votes in a November rematch of the district’s 2022 contest in which Riley had lost to Molinaro by less than 5,000 votes.\n\nThe New York Democrat’s seat is one of 26 districts in which the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the House GOP’s campaign arm, is aiming to flip during the midterms.\n\nThe NRCC slammed Riley for accepting a donation from a group that supports cash bail abolition among other “soft on crime” policies.\n\n“Out of touch Democrat Josh Riley is a con man,” NRCC spokesperson Maureen O’Toole told the DCNF. “He’s desperately trying to dupe voters, but his record proves that he has been pushing radical soft on crime policies that are a threat to his district since day one. Josh Riley has no business being in Congress and he cannot be trusted to keep his constituents safe.”\n\nA spokesperson for Riley did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nNew York’s state legislature eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and some low-level felonies in 2019 under former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s leadership. Republicans and certain New York Democrats have sharply criticized the prohibition of bail requirements for failing to crack down on repeat offenders and for contributing to a rise in crime in the state.\n\nRoughly 65% of individuals released without bail under New York’s state law who had a recent prior arrest were rearrested within two years of release, according to a February 2024 study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice’s Data Collaborative for Justice.\n\nOne New York City man was arrested 46 times for retail theft in less than a year, but was allowed to walk free every time under the state’s bail reform laws, the New York Post reported in October 2021.\n\nVoters of Tomorrow advocates for the elimination of cash bail among other “justice” issues including the decriminalization of prostitution. The left-wing Gen Z group also promotes far-left racial concepts. Its policy page states, “It is not enough to not be racist; we must be actively anti-racist,” and calls for dismantling “all institutions that continue to perpetuate racism against People of Color.” Voters of Tomorrow also argues that the federal government must “end the abusive practices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prevent them from further terrorizing human beings.”\n\n“If the ‘justice’ system has policies or laws in place that have a monetary value tied to them, then those policies only apply to low-income people,” the group states on a Gen Z Agenda 2024 document detailing its position on cash bail. “No one should have to remain in prison for the duration of their case just because they do not have the financial means to pay their bail. Cash bail only applies to low-income people and we need equal justice.”\n\nThe group endorsed Riley during his run against Molinaro during the 2024 cycle.\n\nThe Gen Z-led organization also backed former Vice President Kamala Harris, contributing nearly $30,000 in support of her presidential run, according to OpenSecrets. A campaign memo from Harris’ failed 2020 presidential bid notably called for the abolition of cash bail.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – NOVEMBER 15: Rep.-elect Josh Riley (D-NY) arrives along with other congressional freshmen of the 119th Congress for a group photograph on the steps of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol Building on November 15, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nRiley’s 2022 and 2024 campaigns have also received tens of thousands of dollars from the left-wing New York Working Families Party (NY-WFP). The party’s criminal justice initiative advocates for the abolition of cash bail and has resisted efforts to roll back changes that weakened bail requirements under the 2019 law.\n\nThe NY-WFP has also resisted efforts to amend state law, stating “we will not go back” to cash bail.\n\n“We refuse to return to a time when the wealthy could buy their way out of jail while poor New Yorkers sat behind bars,” former NY-WFP state director Sochie Nnaemeka wrote in a statement. “We will not go back.”\n\nIn October 2024, the NY-WFP transferred $5,000 to Riley’s campaign, according to FEC disclosures. New York uses fusion voting, meaning that candidates can run on multiple parties’ ballot lines. NY-WFP often endorses candidates that go on to also receive the Democratic nomination, such as Riley.\n\nIn 2022, the NY-WFP contributed more than $21,000 to Riley’s first run against Molinaro, per FEC documents. He also received $2,500 from the left-wing party’s national PAC.\n\nThe NY-WFP has also disputed linkages between crime and the elimination of cash bail requirements, arguing in May 2023 that toughening the law to give judges more discretion over holding defendants before trial were “right-wing talking points to incarcerate more Black and brown people to appease moderate voters.”\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told the Wall Street Journal in March that the state’s elimination of cash bail for most criminal offenses in addition to other so-called criminal justice reforms have “rendered the criminal justice system in New York City a high-speed revolving door for recidivists.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That endeavor took a significant step forward this week, after President Donald Trump signed a new executive order aimed at stripping federal funding from NPR and PBS. The president accused the two mainstays of American broadcasting of having eschewed a \"fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens\" in the service of \"partisanship and left-wing propaganda.\"\n\nThe 'biggest escalation yet'\nTrump's executive order specifically instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private entity that distributes government funds to public media outlets, to end its allocation of federal money to PBS and NPR \"to the extent allowed by law,\" said The New York Times. Crucially, however, \"only a small portion\" of both outlets' budget comes from federal funds, while the vast majority comes from \"donors and sponsors.\" As such, the \"immediate impact\" of Trump's order is \"unclear,\" particularly given that the CPB is funded several years in advance specifically to \"protect it from political maneuvering.\"\nEven so, Trump's \"extraordinary order\" marks the \"biggest escalation yet\" in the White House's \"assault on the media,\" Politico said. Earlier this year, the president signed a separate order designed to \"hollow out\" Voice of America, another \"independent, government-funded media organization the president has long accused of bias.\" Trump's latest order arrives amid an \"already tense\" situation between the White House and the CPB, which sued the administration earlier this week over Trump's effort to fire several members of its board, said Axios. Separately, the Federal Communications Commission has recently \"launched an investigation\" of NPR and PBS, claiming it \"appears\" as if their corporate underwriting could violate laws \"banning commercial advertisements,\" said NPR.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

There are \"few alternatives\" for news in rural communities where local journalism has been \"hit hard by corporate cuts to newsrooms.\"\n\n\"For decades,\" public broadcasting outlets have \"enjoyed bipartisan support,\" said Axios. In his first term, Trump had \"zeroed out the funding\" for PBS and NPR, but lawmakers ultimately \"always allocated the funds,\" CNN said. That was a sign that any \"national Republican opposition\" to the outlets is often \"countered by local support.\" To that end, the \"legal wrangling\" already underway to fight the administration's effort to oust CPB board members could provide a model for a \"similar legal challenge\" against this latest defunding effort, said The Washington Post. The order is \"all but certain to be challenged in court,\" Politico said.\nMany local public broadcasting stations simply \"would not exist were there not federal dollars to help,\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said on a recent episode of PBS Newshour.

Before asking what they should do, they need to understand who they are — and who they are not.\n\nThey believe they are the party of the working man, the party of Hispanics, the majoritarian party, and the party of science and competence. They are wrong.\n\nTheirs was an easy self-image to hold on to throughout the Obama years and the first Trump term, but the Biden years and the 2024 election made this self-delusion untenable.\n\nThe majoritarians against democracy\n\nFor years, Democrats have portrayed themselves as the defenders of democracy. This is an important self-image because it seemingly transcends politics.\n\nIf the other side is not merely wrong on policy matters but is in fact a threat to the very constitutional system, then the rules of fair play can go out the window. You can declare them illegitimate, justify censoring them, and liberate the media from pretending to treat them fairly.\n\nTheir recurring claim for decades is this: Whenever the majority gets to speak, Democrats win; Republicans only win by subverting the will of the majority. This self-image wasn’t born with Trump’s violent refusal to accept his 2020 election loss. It goes back far earlier than that. They have been claiming for years that all of their losses were due only to undemocratic forces.\n\nIn 2000, of course, Democrats claimed that the Supreme Court stole the election from former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nAfter losing in 2016, Democrats again claimed that they really should have won. Their first point was factually true: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the popular vote. That’s akin to pointing out that your team scores more runs than the other in the World Series while losing 4 of 6 games.\n\nMore improbably, they tried to claim that the election was hacked by Russian President Vladimir Putin. They convinced most of their voters that Putin actually altered the vote tally.\n\nAgain, the point of this exercise was to convince themselves that if a majority actually got to speak, they would clearly pick Democrats.\n\nAround the same time, Democrats and the liberal media started making an even more creative argument: They deserved control of the Senate even though Republicans had won most of the seats.\n\nUSA Today even ran a news story on this, and the New York Times started tracking the meaningless Senate popular vote (only for two cycles, before returning to relevant data).\n\nLiberals objected to the filibuster as a counter-majoritarian tool, and it became an object of faith that Republicans were “a noisy minority” who relied on minority vetoes and whose project required “cementing minority rule.”\n\nDemocrats also claim they are the true majority by complaining about Republican gerrymandering.\n\nIt’s a flattering and useful self-image, and being the Democrats, they got much of the news media to believe it.\n\nThere were always holes in this argument, of course — Democrats made perhaps the most blatant gerrymanders, Clinton didn’t win a majority of the popular vote, either, and the idea of a national popular vote for the Senate is laughable. But the last couple of years have made it impossible to maintain this illusion.\n\nDemocrats have lost their claim to majority status and have attached themselves to antidemocratic institutions.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Democratic campaigns in 2022 and 2024 was defending Roe v. Wade, which was the most significant antidemocratic Supreme Court decision of the past two generations. Roe overturned state laws on abortion and stripped abortion from the realm of democracy for decades. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, by overturning Roe, didn’t ban abortion. It gave state legislatures and Congress, the democratically elected branches, the power to set abortion law.\n\nA party whose top priority is keeping a divisive and substantive area of law out of the hands of legislators and voters cannot honestly claim to be the pro-democracy party.\n\nIn 2020, conservatives took a 6-3 majority in the Supreme Court, and Joe Biden took the White House, so Democrats shifted their counter-majoritarian tactics. They turned instead to the bureaucracy, converting the executive into a legislature to pass laws that couldn’t pass through Congress, such as student debt forgiveness and national mask mandates.\n\nNow, Trump won the Electoral College and the popular vote, Republicans won both legislative chambers, and Democrats lean again on the unelected bureaucrats to undermine the actual elected executive, the president. And of course, Senate Democrats filibuster everything they can.\n\nThere are valid debates here: Not everything should be up to the majority, and the unitary executive theory and the idea of congressional supremacy interact in some complicated ways. But Democrats are consistent counter-majoritarians nowadays, which must be hard for them to swallow.\n\nDemocrats’ demographics\n\nDemocrats cherish few things more than their perceived demographics. Since the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats have been the party of racial minorities. For about as long, they have imagined themselves the party of the working guy. In turn, Republicans were supposed to be the party of the rich white guys.\n\nThe notion that the GOP was the party of the rich was always overblown. By the Obama era, the wealthiest counties in America were all D.C. suburbs, and they all were blue counties.\n\nBy 2024, though, the Democrats had to drop the act. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to exit polls, won six-figure earners by 4 percentage points, and those earning more than $200,000 she won by 6 points. Yet she still lost the popular vote because she lost the working and middle classes by an even larger margin. Trump, the exit polls suggest, won voters earning under $50,000.\n\nWhy? One thing Democrats learned this election is that the working class rejects left-wing culture warring. Harris had stated that the taxpayer should cover the cost of gender-transition procedures for criminal illegal immigrant men who identify as women, and vice versa.\n\nTransgenderism, critical race theory, and DEI are luxury beliefs. So are the efforts to undermine marriage and the family. Rejection of family and tradition has wreaked havoc on the middle and working classes, and this isn’t lost on voters.\n\nMost shocking to Democrats’ self-image in 2024 were Trump’s gains among nonwhite voters.\n\nDemocrats and the news media spent the days before the election promising a massive anti-Trump tidal wave among Hispanic voters because a comedian at a Trump rally called Puerto Rico an island of garbage.\n\nThere was no such reaction. Instead, late breakers in the election favored Trump. The most Hispanic precincts in America tacked hard to Trump. Trump won Hispanic men, according to exit polls.\n\nThis revealed how little Democrats and the news media understood nonwhite voters — and how little Democrats understood themselves.\n\nThe competence delusion\n\nPerhaps the most painful realization of the past year involved facing their own incompetence at governance.\n\nConservatives are skeptical of government only because they believe everyone runs things as poorly as they do, Democrats thought. They adjusted to becoming the party of the wealthy by reframing this formerly despised demographic as the highly educated class.\n\nRemember Barack Obama’s first election and inauguration. Remember how much the media fawned over the intelligence and technical proficiency. They bragged about being “wonks” and “nerds.” When Obama promised to “remake America,” he excoriated those “who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.”\n\nThey saw themselves as the smart set. The pandemic was only as bad as it was because incompetent Trump was in charge.\n\nThe Biden years cured themselves of this last delusion.\n\nFirst, Biden created a border crisis and a migrant crisis through incompetent and ideological policymaking.\n\nThen, he caused massive inflation by overspending in an effort to become Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His spending yielded few results: Approximately zero charging stations were installed, for example.\n\nThese were both totally predictable problems caused by bad White House decisions.\n\nAt the same time, Democratic states crumbled into disarray. The bad governance of California, New York, and Illinois has led to crime waves, homelessness problems, urban doom loops, budget catastrophes, and a high-speed rail line that now promises to connect Palmdale to Gilroy by the year 2045.\n\nAnd the saner members of the Democratic Party had to watch silently as their party line demanded the recitation of obviously untrue things: that men can have babies and periods and that Biden was sharp as a tack.\n\nIt took ideologically driven self-delusion to believe these things. Most Democrats didn’t believe them but recited them anyway.\n\nWith these myths shattered, Democrats can finally face who they are: They are a multiethnic party, but they are not the multiethnic party. They are the party of the wealthy suburbs. They have a competency problem. And they rely on minority rights to advance their agenda.\n\nThese are not things to be ashamed of, but they are hard truths for many liberals to swallow.","summary":"Democrats, having lost everything to President Donald Trump, have been searching their soul for the past six months — and debating the findings.

Owens cited a lack of editorial independence, while sources told The New York Times that that he resigned in an effort to limit the show's parent company from \"meddling\" with the venerated newsmagazine's editorial coverage.Newsweek has reached out to 60 Minutes' press team for comment via email on Friday.Why It MattersThe upcoming story, as promoted in a press release, suggests 60 Minutes is not planning to back away from investigations into the current administration in spite of the president's lawsuit or the reports that Paramount Global boss Shari Redstone has asked the show's producers to hold off on stories critical of Trump at least until a proposed merger is finalized.The Sunday piece will also, notably, be presented by Scott Pelley, the CBS correspondent who blasted his corporate parent on last week's episode over the departure of Owens — a stunning public rebuke broadcast on national television.What To KnowTrump has sued CBS News, alleging that 60 Minutes unfairly edited an October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris—his opponent in the 2024 presidential election—to her advantage. His legal team originally sought $20 billion in damages accusing the outlet of \"partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.\"CBS hit back, saying the Harris interview underwent a typical editing process in which answers may be cut down. The network later released unedited transcripts of the interview, saying it proved the show was \"not doctored or deceitful.\" The lawsuit is widely seen among legal experts as frivolous, and chilling to free speech among media professionals.Lawyers for Trump and Paramount have begun mediation to settle the suit.Making matters more complicated for CBS News, Paramount, which owns CBS, is in the midst of a merger with Skydance Media that requires the approval of the Trump administration. Redstone asked 60 Minutes to \"delay sensitive\" stories about Trump while that corporate tie-up is pending, Puck reported this week.The White House has had a tense relationship with the press since the start of the new administration, taking a stricter approach to media relations than its predecessors, including shake-ups affecting the press pool and access to the White House and Pentagon, and a lawsuit from the Associated Press over terminology related to the Gulf of Mexico after Trump renamed it the Gulf of America.The president and one of his top advisers, Elon Musk, own social media platforms Truth Social and X, formerly Twitter, respectively, both of which play a major role in media and information circulation.Pelley, the longtime 60 Minutes anchor, will report on Trump's use of executive orders to target some of the nation's largest law firms. The piece will focus on a series of executive orders Trump issued against a handful of prominent law firms, including WilmerHale, Jenner & Block, Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, among others, according to a press release from CBS News.Many of the firms targeted by the executive orders have ties to Trump's political adversaries or figures involved in legal investigations of the former president, including special counsels Robert Mueller and Jack Smith.The administration has repeatedly said that the firms have \"weaponized the legal process,\" with White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields previously telling Newsweek, \"Democrats and their law firms weaponized the legal process to try to punish and jail their political opponents. The President's executive orders are lawful directives to ensure that the President's agenda is implemented and that law firms comply with the law.\"In April, the New York Times, citing sources close to the matter, reported that Owens' sudden resignation as the top producer of 60 Minutes was meant to \"attract public attention and persuade Paramount executives to refrain from meddling\" with the iconic news program.Pelley addressed the change up and the newsroom's concerns with its corporate parent on air last week in a segment that quickly went viral.What People Are Saying Bill Owens, former executive producer of 60 Minutes, in a note to staff: \"Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for '60 Minutes,' right for the audience.\"He added: \"The show is too important to the country. It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer.\"Scott Pelley, on last weekend's broadcast: \"Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial—lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way, but our parent company Paramount is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.\"President Donald Trump took aim at the show over its reporting on Ukraine and Greenland last month, writing on Truth Social: \"Almost every week, 60 Minutes ... mentions the name 'TRUMP' in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend's 'BROADCAST' tops them all. ... They are not a 'News Show,' but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as 'News,' and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing. They should lose their license!\"60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl told Variety on April 22: \"I have been made aware of interference in our news processes, and calling into question our judgement. That is not the way that companies that own news organizations should be acting.\"What Happens Next The segment is scheduled to air at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday. It will also feature a segment on \"freezing the biological clock\" anchored by Stahl.","summary":"The CBS News program will air a segment this weekend on Trump's executive orders targeting law firms, amid rising tensions between the network, its parent company and the administration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/60-minutes-take-trump-again-amid-reports-corporate-meddling-2067454","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2637863/donald-trump-cbs-60-minutes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 17:40:48","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":317213018,"title":"CBS rubs it in despite facing a $20 billion lawsuit from Donald Trump, 60 Minutes plans to air segments that may enrage the President","text":"Even with a $20 billion lawsuit looming over them, CBS refuses to back down. Instead, 60 Minutes is running a segment that is expected to hit a chord with President Trump on Sunday. CBS' 60 Minutes will show a program challenging Donald Trump's use of executive orders against law firms. The network's relationship with the White House is strained as concerns about media independence and corporate influence grow. According to the description of the program, President Trump pledged during the campaign to use the authority of the presidency to target his alleged adversaries. Now in the White House, Trump is targeting some of the nation's largest law firms with executive orders, accusing them of 'weaponizing' the legal system against him,” as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast. After Bill Owens, the show's executive producer, abruptly resigned after 37 years, accusing CBS executives of meddling with the show and caving in to Trump's $20 billion lawsuit, the drama between Donald Trump and the network has intensified in recent weeks. What’s Donald Trump’s issue with CBS and Paramount?Prior to his election victory, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against 60 Minutes, accusing the program of censoring an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The president was also given an interview, but he declined when he learned it would be fact-checked. He claimed the program altered Harris' clip to make her sound better. President Trump has spent a significant portion of his time in office criticizing the so-called fake news and disparaging the press. He intensified his attacks on 60 Minutes on Wednesday, as per a report by the Daily Beast. He commented on Truth Social, The case we have against Paramount, CBS, and 60 Minutes is a true WINNER. They committed unprecedented levels of deception and cheating in the political arena against the American people. How is 60 Minutes responding to the lawsuit?However, 60 Minutes is now retaliating by mocking the president in a program that highlights the severe actions taken by the president against legal firms that have been singled out by executive orders issued by the Trump administration. Last Monday, Scott Pelley, the story's correspondent, pointed to Owens' departure and criticized CBS' corporate owners, Paramount Global. Bill ensured they were fair and accurate, he said to the audience. He was tough in that regard, but Paramount, our parent company, is attempting to finalize a merger. It needs to be approved by the Trump administration.Why did 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens resign?Bill believed he had lost the objectivity necessary for truthful reporting. Following his departure, Owens stated that he was stepping aside so the show can move forward and that the show's independence was a slippery slope. As Paramount Global looks to the president for approval of its merger with the American media production company Skydance, CBS and Trump have been negotiating a settlement.FAQsWhy is Donald Trump suing CBS and 60 Minutes? He alleges that the show edited an interview unfairly, defrauding the public. What topics will the upcoming 60 Minutes segment cover? It focuses on Trump's executive moves against legal firms that he perceives as opponents.","summary":"Despite a $20 billion lawsuit, CBS's 60 Minutes will air a segment critical of President Trump's executive orders targeting law firms.

Looking beyond the headline number, however, the results told a different story.\n\nAt first blush, the 0.3 percent decline in GDP sent stocks lower, with the NASDAQ down 3 percent on the day at one point. The culprit behind the numbers was a 41.3 percent rise in imported goods and services. If we import more than we export, as we did substantially in the quarter, the economy's growth decreases.\n\nThe surge in imports began after the November 2024 elections and continues today. These higher imports result from President Trump's intention to levy tariffs on all our trading partners. U.S. corporations have been scrambling to get ahead of these tariffs by ordering products before the deadline. Trump's second 90-day reprieve has only heightened the trend toward importing even more goods from overseas.\n\nThe decline in GDP was also the first substantive instance where the \"hard\" economic data matched so-called soft data. Over the last three months, the University of Michigan sentiment numbers, the AAII Institutional investor surveys, and consumer confidence polls have indicated that investors and consumers are growing steadily more negative about the economy and market.\n\nThe president was quick to cast the blame for the disappointment on the prior administration, although, to my knowledge, neither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris, his rival in the election, had any intention of waging a tariff war. He also indicated that if the economy weakens in the second quarter, he will blame Biden again.\n\nHowever, if the president had just looked under the GDP hood, he might not have been so quick to duck the blame. If you strip out the import data, the economy grew by 3 percent. Private business investment was up while government spending fell. Business equipment and machinery investment rose 22.5 percent. That is a powerful upswing.\n\nThe Trump administration could have taken credit for that result. Trump promised that when Congress passes his \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he would give business and factory investment a 100 percent immediate depreciation write-off retroactive to Jan. 20.\n\nThat means the cost of these purchases would be tax-deductible in Year 1 instead of being stretched out and deducted over the life of the equipment. How much of those purchases were related to avoiding tariffs and how much was a genuine willingness to invest in America will likely show up in the data in the months ahead.\n\nIn addition, the Fed's favorite inflation indicator, The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), came in weaker than expected, indicating that inflation has not increased, at least for now. I expect April's Consumer Price Index to be weaker still.\n\nJobs, on the other hand, is a different story. U.S. jobless claims rose to a nine-month high, but Friday's nonfarm payroll employment report drew the market's attention. The number beat estimates, coming in at 177,000 jobs gained compared to 138,000 expected. That helped markets rise to top off a good week of gains.\n\nSome on Wall Street are betting that a weaker economy, steady inflation, and the threat of rising unemployment might be a sufficiently worrisome combination for the Fed to alter its wait-and-see point of view. The bond market has upped its probability that the Fed will cut rates at least four times this year. It could provide cover for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to give in to the president's continued pressure to cut interest rates now instead of waiting.\n\nLast week, the market could continue to rally, providing quarterly earnings came in better than expected. Fortunately, that is what happened. We have made progress. I could see 5,700 to 5,750 before a pullback occurs on the S&P 500 Index. That is a mere 50 to 100 points away.\n\nIn the meantime, my warning to wait before chasing gold proved to be the correct call. I expected at least a 10 percent correction in the yellow metal, which would take the price down to $3,150.\n\nFor markets to continue their recovery, we need to see the following: A peace deal, the tariffs disappear, China and the U.S. come to a trade agreement, the Fed cut rates, and/or no recession. That's a long list, so let's say just two of the above need to happen for further gains.\n\nA June rate cut is a good bet, and China said on Friday that it is at least willing to talk to the U.S. on trade at this point. A Russia/Ukraine deal and/or a U.S. recession remain a 50/50 bet. I am afraid some tariffs are here to stay.\n\nIf none of the above occur, we remain in a 500-point trading range (5,200-5,700) on the S&P 500. Until these issues are solved, we remain Trump-dependent.","summary":"Some on Wall Street are betting that a weaker economy, steady inflation, and the threat of rising unemployment might be a sufficiently worrisome combination to convince the Fed to lower rates soon.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/business/columnist/economy-mixed-messages-market-gains/article_ca4e6b82-e806-46fc-80af-f74913153548.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/9c/b9cf39e2-aaf5-4fec-8387-860d37ab68f3/6814fbaabe434.image.jpg?crop=1731%2C909%2C0%2C144&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 17:30:00","author":"Blox Content Management,By Bill Schmick","authors":["Blox Content Management","By Bill Schmick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":317227316,"title":"Shari Redstone wants ‘60 Minutes’ to back off Trump amid lawsuit. They are doing the opposite.","text":"Despite the pleas of its corporate boss to “delay sensitive” stories about Donald Trump, 60 Minutes is planning to run a segment Sunday night that will focus on how the president is targeting “some of the biggest law firms in the country that he accuses of ‘weaponizing’ the justice system against him.”\n\nThe report will be presented by correspondent Scott Pelley, who ended the latest broadcast of the Sunday night news show by issuing a stunning on-air rebuke of his network’s owners following the sudden resignation of the program’s top producer.\n\nLast week, longtime 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens stunningly announced that he was leaving the vaunted news magazine, claiming that he was no longer allowed “to make independent decisions” on the direction of the show, suggesting corporate interference.\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room was Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News over the interview 60 Minutes conducted with Kamala Harris late last year, which the president contends was deceptively edited and amounted to election interference.\n\nDespite legal experts saying Trump’s case is baseless, Shari Redstone – the chief shareholder in CBS News’ parent company Paramount – has pushed for a settlement in the case in order to help get a merger across the line with Skydance, which needs the Trump administration’s approval. Owens, meanwhile, had made it clear that he would not apologize for the way the program conducted or edited the interview.\n\nMeanwhile, in what is likely to only incense the president even further, the Harris segment at the center of this kerfuffle recently received an Emmy nomination – for “outstanding edited interview.” \n\nFollowing Trump’s return to the White House, multiple media corporations have backed down in their legal fights against the president, who unleashed a series of questionable lawsuits over his complaints about unfair coverage. Amid these capitulations by organizations such as Disney and Meta, Paramount has expressed a willingness to settle with Trump in hopes that his handpicked FCC chairman – who has acted as Trump’s personal attack dog against non-conservative news outlets – will approve the merger with Skydance.\n\nIn recent days, the two parties have entered into mediation, with the Paramount board having already laid out acceptable financial terms for a settlement. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company is willing to pay Trump in the neighborhood of $15 to $20 million, which would be in line with the amount Disney settled to resolve the president’s lawsuit against ABC News.\n\nThe prospect of a potential settlement, which has outraged CBS News employees and journalists, has also resulted in Redstone upping her concerns over the editorial direction of 60 Minutes, which is the crown jewel of the network’s news division.\n\nAt the same time, while the president’s lawsuit and the upcoming merger are front and center in Redstone’s mind, she has also taken umbrage with the program’s coverage of the Gaza war and the conflict between Israel and Hamas. \n\nA passionate supporter of Israeli causes, Redstone grew incensed with the Sunday night newsmagazine following a January segment about those impacted by the war in Gaza because she viewed it as antisemitic, CBS News sources told The Independent. Previously, Redstone publicly backed CBS Mornings co-anchor Tony Dokoupil after he was reprimanded by CBS News chief Wendy McMahon for violating editorial standards for his combative interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates on Gaza.\n\nA day after that report ran, she pushed to have veteran CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky installed as the interim executive editor overseeing standards. In that role, Zirinisky would serve as a check on Owens and McMahon and serve as the eyes and ears for Redstone.\n\nRedstone grew even more anxious last month after the president raged about segments that 60 Minutes did on Trump’s Oval Office meltdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the president’s efforts to annex Greenland. The president urged FCC chief Brendan Carr to “impose the maximum fines and punishment” on Paramount and CBS “for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nFollowing the president’s blowup over the program’s reports, the New York Times first reported that Redstone contacted Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks and asked to be briefed about all politically sensitive segments for the remainder of the show’s season, which ends later this month. \n\n“Inside 60 Minutes, news of her desire for greater oversight, reported here and elsewhere, struck many as a violation of the show’s long-cherished editorial independence—not just from its parent company, but even from the rest of CBS News,” Puck noted this week. “Regardless, Shari’s attempts to influence 60 Minutes coverage went beyond that. According to those sources with direct knowledge of the matter, Shari also asked Cheeks if it would be possible to delay sensitive stories about Trump or his policies until after she had closed the Skydance deal.”\n\nAt that point, although 60 Minutes had made no changes as a result of Redstone’s requests, Owens felt that he could no longer remain at 60 Minutes due to the interference attempted by the corporate overlords. \n\n“It’s clear that I’ve become the problem — I’m the corporation’s problem,” Owens said while addressing the show’s staff about his resignation. Additionally, he bristled at “having a minder” and how, in the past, “the corporation didn’t know what was coming up.” \n\nAhead of CBS News promoting the upcoming segment about Trump’s efforts to intimidate law firms and bend them to his will, the New York Times reported that 60 Minutes staffers had “expressed concern that corporate overseers could potentially interfere with an upcoming segment about conflicts between major law firms and the Trump administration.” \n\nThe segment is indeed scheduled to air this Sunday and will be hosted by Pelley, who said at the end of the last broadcast that Owens quit because he “felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” Pelley also used that monologue to note that Paramount is pushing for a merger that “the Trump administration must approve.”","summary":"The program is scheduled to run a segment on Donald Trump’s intimidation and targeting of major law firms despite the network’s owner asking if ‘60 Minutes’ could delay sensitive stories about the president amid settlement talks of his meritless lawsuit","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/60-minutes-shari-redstone-trump-b2743946.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/08/18/PARAMOUNT-SKYDANCE-FUSI%C3%93N_25246.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/d8sdFmsg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-02 17:00:14","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":317215154,"title":"Trump judge bars deportations under 1798 law","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nTrump judge bars deportations under 1798 law\n\nA Trump appointee has ruled that the president's use of a wartime act for deportations is illegal\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'The president cannot simply declare there’s an invasion and invoke a wartime authority during peacetime'\n\n(Image credit: Michael M.

The paper, which is owned by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, was also hit by a major round of job cuts in Jan. 2024, when the Times laid off 115 journalists. \n\nFriday’s cuts also come a few days after AdWeek reported the Times lost “around $50 million” in 2024. The paper has 335,000 subscribers, after losing 25,000 in the past few months, according to the report. \n\nSoon-Shiong has taken a more hands-on approach at his paper in recent years. Last fall, he nixed the editorial board’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — a move that led to a handful of employees leaving; One editorial writer who quit even called him a “chickens—t” who threw the editorial team “under the bus.”\n\nEarlier this year, Soon-Shiong said it has been a “struggle” to get his newsroom to buy into a more balanced ideological approach. On that front, the Times introduced an artificial intelligence-powered “bias meter” that would give a political rating to opinion stories in March; the feature made headlines one day after launching when it downplayed the KKK’s racist history.","summary":"The latest round of cuts comes after dozens were laid off from the organization in March\n\n\nThe post LA Times Lays Off 14 Staffers in Latest Round of Job Cuts appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-layoffs-14-staffers/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/los-angeles-times-building-el-segundo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 16:48:38","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":317191436,"title":"‘60 Minutes’ to air anti-Trump segment amid lawsuit over Kamala Harris interview","text":"“60 Minutes” is planning to air another critical segment on Sunday about President Trump’s targeting of law firms with executive orders — even as corporate-parent Paramount Global is in talks to settle a high-stakes lawsuit with the president.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley — who recently accused Paramount of editorial interference — is leading the report, which is described by the CBS-run show as look at how Trump is “using executive orders to target some of the biggest law firms in the country that he accuses of ‘weaponizing’ the justice system against him.”\n\nPelley made news last Sunday when he called out his bosses on-air, accusing them of interfering with the program’s coverage, which led to the departure of “60 Minutes” boss Bill Owens — who also claimed a loss of journalistic independence.\n\n“Bill made sure they [the show’s reports] were accurate and fair,” Pelley told viewers. “He was tough that way, but our parent company Paramount is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”\n\nSources said Parmamount boss Shari Redstone has expressed concerns to CBS CEO George Cheeks over critical segments of Trump and his policies, asking if the program could wait to run them until after the merger between Paramount and Skydance Media was complete. \n\nBut concerns from higher ups come as the president has attacked “60 Minutes” over a host of segments. \n\nThere is no evidence of increased oversight of “60 Minutes” that has caused the show to change its programming, nor has Cheeks ever tried to execute her request, however.\n\nReps for CBS and Redstone declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Paramount and Trump have started mediation to try to resolve the president’s $20 billion lawsuit against the network over the way that “60 Minutes” edited a sitdown with then-Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris last fall. \n\nThe settlement talks are taking place as Paramount seeks approval of its merger with Skydance from the Federal Communications Commission, which is also probing the Harris interview for complaints of “news distortion.”\n\nThe Harris segment, which ran in October, received a News and Documentary Emmy nomination earlier today for outstanding edited interview.\n\nSources told The Post that Trump is looking for $100 million to settle the lawsuit — much more than what Paramount is currently willing to give. \n\nAs previously reported by The Post, Paramount is hoping to settle for betweek $15 million and $25 million — which is what Trump settled recent lawsuits with Disney’s ABC and Meta earlier this year.","summary":"Scott Pelley is leading the anti-Trump report, which will look at how Trump is \"using executive orders to target some of the biggest law firms in the country that he accuses of 'weaponizing' the justice system against him,\" CBS said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/02/media/60-minutes-airing-anti-trump-segment-amid-lawsuit-over-kamala-harris-interview/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/103706730.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 16:46:20","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":317182482,"title":"Trump ousts Waltz as NSA, taps him for UN role","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nTrump ousts Waltz as NSA, taps him for UN role\n\nPresident Donald Trump removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and nominated him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThis is the first major Cabinet shakeup of Trump's second term\n\n(Image credit: Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US \n\nWhat happened\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he had removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and would nominate him to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in the first major Cabinet shakeup of his second term.

The \"Signal episode hurt Waltz,\" The Associated Press said, but not as much as \"attacks\" by far-right influencer Laura Loomer and Waltz's own \"hawkish views on Iran and Russia.\"\nLoomer, believed to have convinced Trump to fire much of Waltz's staff last month, texted \"Loomered\" to Politico after the site reported Waltz's exit. Trump reportedly \"wanted to get to the 100-day mark in his term before firing a Cabinet-level official,\" Reuters said. Now, \"after three months of relative restraint,\" said Politico, \"Trump may be ready to fire others.\" He churned through four national security advisers in his first term.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

'They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena.' \n\nThe unearthed version showed that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking, compared to 60 minutes that were filmed. \n\nThe unedited clip opens with the former VP sneezing as she explains she is 'allergic to mold,' while other sections of her answers were cropped and cut out completely. \n\nIn other places, Kamala Harris gave rambled answers on why she should be president, foreign policy, and Donald Trump - all which were quietly nipped by CBS. \n\nThe full version of the interview shows that while Harris gave a lengthy answer when asked about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CBS only aired about seven seconds on 60 Minutes.\n\nHere are the differences between the transcripts and what made it on air. \n\n Harris slamming Trump as a 'racist' is edited out\n\nThe long version of the CBS interview revealed that the network cut out an entire answer Kamala Harris dedicated to slamming Donald Trump as a racist. \n\nInterviewer Bill Whitaker asked the then-Vice President: 'And talking about that person you're mentioning right now, you have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. \n\n'In fact, you have called him a racist, and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?'\n\nKamala Harris' answer to this question was completely cut from the CBS episode.\n\nIn the uncut version, Harris bashed Trump for having a 'bouquet of microphones' at his disposal, and for his 'most vile lies' about people in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nThe reference is to the comments Trump made last year, about illegal migrants in the midwestern state eating people's dogs.\n\nIn the unearthed version, Kamala also made a bizarre boast about how when she was DA in California, 'the words I spoke could move markets.'\n\nIn the deleted version of the interview, Harris then went on a strange rant about school kids' picture day that they seemingly missed as a result of Trump's words about Springfield, Ohio. \n\nShe responded: 'So let's just break down what you just talked about, and talk about it in the context of the words that Donald Trump has spoken, and the actions he has taken, and whether that is reflective of who we are as Americans, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. \n\n'We have a former President who wants to be President again, who has a bouquet of microphones in front of him, who has said the most vile lies about a group of legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. And if I may, Bill, let me just say something. \n\n'You know, from the time I was a prosecutor, to attorney general, to now I'm Vice President, I learned very early in my career when the voters bestow on you the authority to have these positions, you must be very thoughtful about how you use that microphone in front of you. \n\n'And you know, when I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets. \n\n'So the idea that the former president, who again is running to be President, would use that microphone in a way that is about vilifying and demeaning a whole population of people, you know what has happened because of that? \n\n'One day when this happened was a school day, picture day for an elementary school. Picture day. You know what picture day is for our children. They get excited the night before when you put out the clothes they're going to wear, they go to school making sure their faces are clean, and their hair is done, and they go to school for picture day. You know what happened to these children? They had to evacuate that day because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the words of Donald Trump.' \n\nInstead of airing this section, the cut version on CBS was far less explosive against the Republican - and contained far fewer words.\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris was broadcasted as saying: 'So I say that I'm glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it's just wrong. It's just wrong.' \n\nHarris' answers on Israel are edited out\n\nThe interviewer asked: 'What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control?'\n\nHer response, which was aired, went as follows: 'Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred, 250 hostages 15 were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped. And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.'\n\nBut the next section of her answer was completely edited out of the interview, the newly-released transcripts revealed: 'And that [the war ending] has to be our number one imperative, and that has been our number one imperative.'\n\nUnprompted, Harris then asked herself a rhetorical question - and gave a round-a-bout, lengthy, repetitive answer. This part was removed from the original broadcast. \n\nHarris said: 'How can we get this war to end?\n\n'Well, critical elements of that are we have got to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. We have to - we have to get aid in. We have to lay the path toward a two-state solution. I do believe that we must maintain that as an objective, no matter how out of reach it seems at the moment. And the work that we have to do is also pay attention to what is happening every day in the region and put U.S. resources into everything we can do, diplomatically and otherwise, to de-escalate what is happening in the region.' \n\nCBS edited Whitaker's question to Harris about Netanyahu not listening to the United States - where he cited reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the administration has repeatedly been blindsided by the Israeli PM.\n\nHarris responded by boasting about the work they have done with Israel and cropped her answer down to just: 'We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.'\n\nHarris' answers on Iranian threat are edited out\n\nWhitaker asked Harris a pointed, simple question about foreign policy - that was completely left out of the version CBS aired in October. \n\nHe asked the former VP: 'Let's hit on some more foreign policy. Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?'\n\nKamala Harris' answer was Iran - followed by a series of rambling sentences. \n\nShe said: 'Well, there are different reasons that we should be thoughtful about each. Most recently, I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. And look, I mean, Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? \n\n'And what we saw in terms of just this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic 11 missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities. And that must be.' \n\nThe interviewer pushed her further, asking a question about what she would do if she - as the hypothetical President - found out the Middle Eastern power was building a nuclear arsenal. \n\nHe asked: 'So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?'\n\nBut instead of taking the bait, Harris turned down the question completely. \n\nShe responded: 'I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.'\n\nThis entire conversation was edited out of the broadcast by CBS. \n\nHarris' answer on why she should be president is trimmed\n\nWhitaker asked Harris why a quarter of voters feel they don't know her - despite having served as the vice president for four years.\n\nThe newly-released transcript showed that CBS omitted a large chunk of Harris' bizarre, digressive words about 'traveling the country' - rather than actually saying why she ought to be Commander-in-Chief. \n\n'But Madam Vice 21 President, a quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you, they don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? I mean, you have been vice president for almost four years. You've been on the national scene for longer. What's the disconnect?' Whitaker asked. \n\nIn both the edited and aired versions, Harris started her response with: 'It's an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote.'\n\nHowever, CBS edited out her next few sentences. 'And that's why I'm traveling our country. I've seen you in a few states in the last couple of days. I'm talking with folks where they live. I'm listening to folks. And working to earn the vote of every American,' Harris said.\n\nBoth versions continued: 'This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.'\n\nHarris' answer on NATO and the war in Ukraine is trimmed\n\nWhen asked if she would expand NATO to include Ukraine if she were President, CBS cropped down Harris' response and jumped to her slamming Trump. \n\n'How about as President, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?' Whitaker asked.\n\n'Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,' Harris said.\n\nThe transcript showed Harris actually said: 'And doing what we can to continue to build and strengthen the alliance around the support for Ukraine's right to be an independent nation, free from having its borders forcefully taken by Russia. \n\n'And we are going to continue to work closely with our NATO allies to continue to reinforce America's alliance in the context of NATO. Again, in this election, there's a real difference between me and the former president. \n\n'I believe in reinforcing the strength of NATO, understanding again it is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known. Donald Trump would pull us out of NATO.'\n\nHowever, CBS removed her speaking about what the Biden administration was doing to support Ukraine - before just showing her blasting Trump. \n\nThe version that aired on 60 Minutes jumped to Harris stating: 'Donald Trump, if he were President, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. Let's be clear about that. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.' \n\nHarris' economic plan answer is chopped up \n\nWhen Whitaker asked Harris how she intended to pay for her economic plan, CBS edited out her answer on inflation.\n\n'It is estimated by the Nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you going to pay for that?' Whitaker asked.\n\nCBS kept the first sentence of the former vice president's response, 'Okay so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent.'\n\nBut the transcript showed CBS sliced up her answer by removing the next part of her sentence.\n\n'Because this is an election and there are two choices, everyone from Goldman Sachs to Moody's to Nobel laureates, so on the first point, comparing my economic plan to Donald Trump's economic plan, they have reviewed it,' Harris continued.\n\nThe aired version pieced her first sentence with this bit she said later on. 'And determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,' Harris said.\n\nAgain, CBS removed her repeated ranting about analyst and a portion where she where she talked about inflation. \n\nHarris said in the original transcript: 'Sixteen Nobel laureates, Moody's, others have determined, after reviewing what Donald Trump is proposing, that he would induce inflation, increase inflation, and bring about a recession by the middle of next year.'\n\nThey aired the last of her response, 'My plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.'\n\nHarris' answers on China and Taiwan are edited out\n\nAsking the then-VP a question about China, Whitaker said: 'What about China? China is strongly asserting its dominance, its control of the South China Sea, especially around the Philippines. What is the U.S. responsibility for keeping China from simply taking over the South China Sea?' \n\nHarris' answer, which was completely cut from the broadcast, read: 'Well, I have actually worked very closely with the leaders in the Philippines on just this very issue, and including the work that we are doing in terms of coordination between our military and training, and what needs to happen in terms of protecting the freedom of the South China Sea.'\n\nThe next section was also cut, apart from a voice over of Harris saying: 'We must win the competition for the 21st century with China.' \n\nThe full, unaired quote, read: 'China, first of all, we must win the competition for the 21st century with China. We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we must operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests. What we -'\n\nWhitaker said: 'So say if China attacks Taiwan. Would we use military force to support Taiwan?'\n\nHarris refused to give a straight answer - and instead gave a flurried answer about fentanyl.\n\nShe said: 'Bill, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. But listen, we need to make sure that we maintain a one-China policy, and - but that includes supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait. \n\n'But on the issue of China, we also - again, these are not - We cannot afford to have foreign policy that is myopic. We must be able to also, as it relates to China, continue to do the work that we have begun to deal with the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. That's a real issue. Again, you talk to families around our country who have -- I just, on a constant, sadly, regular basis meet parents and family members of people who have died from fentanyl, young people who have died from fentanyl. \n\n'Are we going to stop trying to stem the flow from fentanyl? And we have to deal with that, and understand China's role in that, and our ability to work with China to stop that flow. Which we have begun to do, and I'm going to continue to do. We need to make sure we have open lines of communication with China, in particular military to military. So these issues are all - they're multifaceted.' \n\nCBS cuts crucial line from Harris' answer on the border crisis \n\nThe network cut one very crucial line from Kamala Harris' answer about the border crisis. \n\nShe was asked: 'You recently visited the southern border, and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings, and you said you would take it even further. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?'\n\nThe answer she gave that was aired - and the one that was filmed - were nearly identical. \n\nHarris said on the CBS broadcast: 'So we came into office, and almost hours, Bill, after our inauguration, the first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill...'\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris then went on to describe what happened next.\n\nBut the unedited version revealed that CBS left out three key words at the end of her speech about the border crisis bill. \n\n'...Which I support.","summary":"A controversial interview featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris has been nominated for a major award, despite President Donald Trump's criticism of the editorial process.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14672851/kamala-harris-60-minutes-emmy-donald-trump-cbs.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/02/16/97911763-0-image-a-6_1746200128063.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/06/8167424840424863059/1024x576_MP4_8167424840424863059.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-02 16:13:27","author":"Charlie Spiering,Claudia Aoraha,Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Claudia Aoraha","Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":317174144,"title":"The Vietnam and Gaza Wars Shattered Young Illusions About US Leaders","text":"by Mauro Teodori (san francisco, usa)Friday, May 02, 2025Inter Press Service\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, USA, May 02 (IPS) - Eight years before the U.S.-backed regime in South Vietnam collapsed, I stood with high school friends at Manhattan’s Penn Station on the night of April 15, 1967, waiting for a train back to Washington after attending the era’s largest antiwar protest so far.\n\nAn early edition of the next day’s New York Times arrived on newsstands with a big headline at the top of the front page that said “100,000 Rally at U.N. Against Vietnam War.” I heard someone say, “Johnson will have to listen to us now.”\n\nBut President Lyndon Johnson dashed the hopes of those who marched from Central Park to the United Nations that day (with an actual turnout later estimated at 400,000). He kept escalating the war in Vietnam, while secretly also bombing Laos and Cambodia.\n\nDuring the years that followed, antiwar demonstrations grew in thousands of communities across the United States. The decentralized Moratorium Day events on October 15, 1969 drew upward of 2 million people. But all forms of protest fell on deaf official ears. A song by the folksinger Donovan, recorded midway through the decade, became more accurate and powerful with each passing year: “The War Drags On.”\n\nAs the war continued, so did the fading of trust in the wisdom and morality of Johnson and his successor, Richard Nixon. Gallup polls gauged the steep credibility drop. In 1965, just 24 percent of Americans said involvement in the Vietnam War had been a mistake. By the spring of 1971, the figure was 61 percent.\n\nThe number of U.S. troops in Vietnam gradually diminished from the peak of 536,100 in 1968, but ground operations and massive U.S. bombing persisted until the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in late January 1973. American forces withdrew from Vietnam, but the war went on with U.S. support for 27 more months, until – on April 30, 1975 – the final helicopter liftoff from the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon signaled that the Vietnam War was indeed over.\n\nBy then, most Americans were majorly disillusioned. Optimism that public opinion would sway their government’s leaders on matters of war and peace had been steadily crushed while carnage in Southeast Asia continued. To many citizens, democracy had failed – and the failure seemed especially acute to students, whose views on the war had evolved way ahead of overall opinion.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, Gallup found “significantly more opposition to President Richard Nixon’s Vietnam policies” among students at public and private colleges than in “a parallel survey of the U.S. general public: 44 percent vs. 25 percent, respectively.” The same poll “showed 69 percent of students in favor of slowing down or halting the fighting in Vietnam, while only 20 percent favored escalation. \n\nThis was a sharp change from 1967, when more students favored escalation (49 percent) than de-escalation (35 percent).”\n\nSix decades later, it took much less time for young Americans to turn decisively against their government’s key role of arming Israel’s war on Gaza. By a wide margin, continuous huge shipments of weapons to the Israeli military swiftly convinced most young adults that the U.S. government was complicit in a relentless siege taking the lives of Palestinian civilians on a large scale.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll in June 2024 found that Americans opposed sending “weapons and supplies to Israel” by 61-39 percent. Opposition to the arms shipments was even higher among young people. For adults under age 30, the ratio was 77-23.\n\nEmerging generations learned that moral concerns about their country’s engagement in faraway wars meant little to policymakers in Washington. No civics textbook could prepare students for the realities of power that kept the nation’s war machine on a rampage, taking several million lives in Southeast Asia or supplying weapons making possible genocide in Gaza.\n\nFor vast numbers of Americans, disproportionately young, the monstrous warfare overseen by Presidents Johnson and Nixon caused the scales to fall from their eyes about the character of U.S. leadership. And like President Trump now, President Biden showed that nice-sounding rhetoric could serve as a tidy cover story for choosing to enable nonstop horrors without letup.\n\nNo campaign-trail platitudes about caring and joy could make up for a lack of decency. By remaining faithful to the war policies of the president they served, while discounting the opinions of young voters, two Democratic vice presidents – Hubert Humphrey and Kamala Harris – damaged their efforts to win the White House.\n\nA pair of exchanges on network television, 56 years apart, are eerily similar.\n\nIn August 1968, appearing on the NBC program Meet the Press, Humphrey was asked: “On what points, if any, do you disagree with the Vietnam policies of President Johnson?”\n\n“I think that the policies that the president has pursued are basically sound,” Humphrey replied.\n\nIn October 2024, appearing on the ABC program The View, Harris was asked: “Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?”\n\n“There is not a thing that comes to mind,” Harris replied.\n\nYoung people’s votes for Harris last fall were just 54 percent, compared to 60 percent that they provided to Biden four years earlier.\n\nMany young eyes recognized the war policy positions of Hubert Humphrey and Kamala Harris as immoral. Their decisions to stay on a war train clashed with youthful idealism. And while hardboiled political strategists opted to discount such idealism as beside the electoral point, the consequences have been truly tragic – and largely foreseeable.\n\nNorman Solomon is the national director of RootsAction.org and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

DEI was such a priority, that it was baked into the incentive structure for people to advance professionally,' the former Hawaii congresswoman told the journalist. \n\n'And I would imagine it was very similar across the federal government, where some employees told me that they were put in a position where they had to spend half of their time working on DEI initiatives in order for them to be able to advance professionally,' Gabbard added.\n\nPresident Trump and DNI Tulsi Gabbard in the Oval Office\n\nA pride flag flies outside of the FBI headquarters\n\nGabbard said in a recent interview with Megyn Kelly that the Biden administration seemed to center their entire administration round DEI initiatives\n\nLurid sex chats among NSA agents exposed as intel chief Tulsi Gabbard vows to punish workers\n\n'When we look at why this was a priority for the President, this is not some superficial thing,' the DNI told Kelly. 'There are national security implications to what the Biden administration was doing in centering almost their entire administration around DEI initiatives.' \n\nEliminating the ODNI's DEI projects will save the the agency approximately $20 million annually, aides tell the Daily Mail. \n\nThe ODNI's Human Capital Office has also been shuttered, which will save up to $150 million annually. \n\nIn February it was shockingly revealed that employees in the intelligence community were using a chat room to discuss sex and gender reassignment surgeries. \n\nAn image posted by the CIA on X celebrating pride month in 2023\n\nScreenshots show workers casually referred to how much they enjoyed having sex upon having gender surgery in their work chat, saying 'I've found that I like being penetrated (never liked it before GRS), but all the rest is just as important as well.'\n\nAnother bragged that having the surgery allowed them 'to wear leggings or bikinis without having to wear a gaff under it.'\n\nGabbard vowed at the time that 'those involved will be held accountable.' \n\nOver 100 workers were fired as a result of the investigation. \n\nDonald TrumpPoliticsTulsi Gabbard\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTulsi Gabbard rips apart 'wokeness' in national intelligence with massive anti-DEI wins in first 100 days\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is celebrating how many DEI policies she has been able to cancel in the Trump administration's first 100 days.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14672331/tulsi-gabbard-national-intelligence-anti-dei-wins-100-days.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/02/15/97962399-0-image-m-101_1746197313879.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 15:15:26","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":317168208,"title":"How Trump just embarrassed MAGA billionaire supporter","text":"President Donald Trump does not mind humiliating one of his closest allies. \n\nTrump delivered an address to graduating seniors at the University of Alabama on Thursday night. The speech closely replicated one of his political rallies as he echoed his familiar rhetoric on the 2020 election, his tariff plans and the Biden administration.\n\nAt one point, he jabbed the tech CEOs, including billionaire Elon Musk, who flocked to support him after winning the 2024 election. Many tech CEOs donated funds for Trump’s inauguration following his win over former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\n“If you look at some of these internet people, I know so many of them.

The Republicans Against Trump account on social media platform X suggested that previous presidents would be ridiculed if they spoke like that.\n\n“Imagine the headlines if Joe Biden or any other president had spoken like this during a university commencement.

He’s thinking, ‘I can do this for Trump, and I can win over these MAGA people, and I can snake through this thing.’ It’s incredibly sad. There were a lot of people who believed in Marco. I was certainly one of them.\"\n\nCuriously, as the Trump inner circle shrinks, Rubio has moved into the center of it. You’ll recall that, along with the con man remark, he also insisted that “for years to come, there are many people on the right, in the media and voters at large, that are going to be having to explain and justify how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump.”\n\nAnd now Rubio has been “trapped” into working more jobs for Trump than the guy at Mar-a-Lago who was trying to unplug security cameras, drain the pool, flood a storage room and tamper with witnesses.\n\nAlong with Secretary of State, Rubio’s other official duties indicate ... a) serious people don’t want to work in the Trump administration; and b) Trump has become so paranoid that only sycophants can work for him.\n\nWho knew that only a few months after Trump railed on the campaign that Americans under Joe Biden had to work two or three jobs to make ends meet, a guy in Trump’s cabinet would face the same fate.\n\nWhich leads us to the one-liner:\n\n“Of course Trump has the one Latino guy in his cabinet working four jobs,” former Kamala Harris staffer Armand Domalewski tweeted.\n\n“Marco Rubio, unbelievable,” Trump said Thursday before announcing on social media that Michael Waltz would be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations and Rubio would take over as national security adviser in the interim. ”When I have a problem, I call up Marco, he gets it solved.”\n\nThomas Wright, an NSC official during the Biden administration who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the national security adviser post alone is “more than a full-time job.”\n\n“It is just very hard to comprehend the idea that you can do this job sort of part time,” Wright said.\n\nHe said he watched national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his deputy work 14-15 hour days, six to seven days a week: “I think they felt that they had to do that to do the job properly.”\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News, Rubio joked that Trump couldn’t ask him to be pope because he’s married. True, but as pope it would be a heck of a lot easier for Rubio to have his confession heard.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and longtime foreign policy adviser. In February, Grenell was instrumental in freeing five Americans held hostage in Venezuela, and over the last day, his name, along with several others, has been floated as a possible replacement for former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Trump announced Thursday that Waltz would be leaving the post to become United Nations ambassador in a major shakeup of his national security team.\n\nGrenell, who refers to himself as the president\u0019s \u001cfixer,\u001d is a close Trump confidante who has served in a variety of roles, including acting director of national intelligence and ambassador to Germany during Trump\u0019s first term. Earlier this year, Grenell, known for his blunt talk and contentious approach to foreign policy, served as Trump\u0019s emissary during the devastating California wildfires, strongly backing his calls to attach conditions to any federal disaster aid to help Los Angeles rebuild.\n\nDuring the presidential transition, Grenell was a contender for secretary of state, but that role went to Marco Rubio. Now the roving envoy role gives Grenell the freedom to keep his options open and enter the crowded California gubernatorial field if the political dynamics seem right.\n\nEven if Trump taps Grenell to fill the national security adviser role, he still has time to determine whether to jump into the California governor\u0019s race. The election is more than a year and a half away, and candidates have until March 2026 to file their paperwork.\n\nOver the last few weeks, as speculation swirled about Harris\u0019 intentions, several candidates on both sides of the aisle have joined the race, including conservative commentator and Fox News contributor Steve Hilton and Biden\u0019s Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. The pool includes Republican and former Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco, and several Democrats: Rep. Katie Porter, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, State Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former State Controller Betty Yee, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, and entrepreneur Stephen Cloobeck.\n\nWhoever decides to run, the Democratic supermajority-controlled state is a long shot for Republicans. No GOP candidate has won statewide since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger\u0019s landslide re-election in 2007. Without a Hollywood blockbuster movie star or another widely recognized personality in the mix, a Republican candidate for governor faces long odds.\n\nStill, a late March poll showing Californians warming to the idea of a Republican governor is stirring hopes amid the GOP. Nearly 50% of likely California voters said they are now considering voting for a Republican for governor in 2026, with 71% expressing dissatisfaction over Gov. Gavin Newsom\u0019s and legislative leaders\u0019 records on addressing California\u0019s high cost of living. Such a large field of Democratic gubernatorial candidates could divide Democratic and independent voters, giving a conservative or independent candidate a potential opening, but only if the number of right-leaning candidates in the race remains limited. \n\nSo far, Grenell has said he\u0019s focused on paving the way for conservative candidates across the state rather than throwing his own hat in the ring. He says his political action committee, Fix California, which he founded in 2021, registered 200,000 new conservative voters last year alone.\n\nThe group\u0019s registration efforts have corresponded with a significant uptick in Republican voter registrations in recent years \u0013 some 775,000 new Republicans were added to the voter rolls since 2019, according to the California Republican Party. Over the last year, GOP voter registrations have increased by more than 100,000 while Democrats have declined by tens of thousands, according to reports from the California secretary of state.\n\nThe California GOP did not invest in those efforts, however, and several state conservative activists have said the credit goes to Grenell and Fix California.\n\nLast year\u0019s voter registration drive was particularly successful in flipping Congressional District 41 from blue, helping longtime California GOP Rep. Ken Calvert hold on to his seat in a tight re-election last year.\n\nGrenell said he aims to replicate the results of Stacey Abrams\u0019 Fair Fight organization\u0019s five-year digital voter-registration program that made once-red Georgia a swing state, and similar efforts in Florida and Ohio. Fix California officials have identified 1.4 million Californians that it wants to register to vote by the 2026 midterm elections to help Trump maintain a Republican majority, avoid another round of impeachment efforts in Congress, and give a conservative candidate a better shot at a gubernatorial win.\n\n\u001cI do a lot of jobs, but Fix California is one of my favorites,\u001d Grenell told supporters Wednesday night. \u001cI don\u0019t get paid. & I do all this work because I think that the only way to save this state is to do something that\u0019s very unsexy \u0013 just register people to vote.\u001d\n\nTrump has thrown his support behind Fix California\u0019s efforts, raising $3 million in one Los Angeles fundraiser in 2021, while first lady Melania Trump headlined another event which raked in $1 million, Grenell said.\n\nSome 50% of Californians aren\u0019t registered to vote, and of the 50% who are, only roughly 40% go and vote in any given election, Grenell said.\n\n\u001cYou can\u0019t have this small group of the same people who vote and pick our leaders,\u001d Grenell added. \u001cWe have to expand the pool, and I believe that if we can do that, we can change Sacramento.\u001d\n\nThere\u0019s a good chance, he added, that those sitting on the sidelines in California, where Democrats hold all statewide elected offices and supermajorities in the legislature, are \u001ccommonsense conservatives\u001d who don\u0019t believe their vote will count or \u001caren\u0019t charged up or they just want to mind their own business.\u001d\n\nGrenell is challenging all right-leaning candidates in the governor\u0019s race to spend half of all money they raise on voter registration drives. \u001cI\u0019m tired of people running, raising millions of dollars, losing, and walking away with their own lists,\u001d he said. \u001cThey lose, they walk away, and the next person has to start all over.\u001d\n\nKatie Zacharia, who serves as senior adviser to Fix California, says that the group\u0019s efforts could be instrumental in helping Republicans win back swing California House seats because newly registered voters are highly likely to vote in the next election. Two Republican House members, former Reps. Michelle Steel and John Duarte, lost to Democratic challengers Derek Tran and Adam Gray, respectively, by less than one percentage point in November, while two other Republicans lost by just three percentage points.\n\n\u001cStatistically, 80% of those who are newly registered turn out,\u001d Zacharia told RealClearPolitics.\n\nIn the aftermath of the devastating wildfires, Grenell suggests that Los Angeles County, with its 9.78 million population, is prime territory to pick up registrations from conservatives and independents fed up with the Democrats\u0019 record of failed leadership.\n\nGrenell predicted that Angelenos would support the strings he\u0019s pressing Trump to attach to any release of federal wildfire disaster money to the state. Congress is set to consider that disaster relief package in the late spring or summer.\n\nHe also said he\u0019s fighting to implement conditions for those federal funds \u001ccome hell or high water.\u001d Grenell is pressing Trump to demand that state Democrats gut the California Environmental Quality Act, a series of regulations requiring state agencies to mitigate the environmental impacts of their work, and the elimination of the California Coastal Commission, which highly regulates building and development near beaches and coastlines.\n\nNewsom earlier this year waived many aspects of both for the post-wildfire rebuilding process in Los Angeles, but eliminating the wide-ranging environmental laws in California is an ambitious, highly unlikely task, considering the supermajority control of both houses of the state legislature. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is already fighting several of Trump\u0019s sweeping executive orders threatening its federal funding in court.\n\nYet, the wildfires shined such an intense national spotlight on California government mismanagement this year that Grenell believes there\u0019s a unique but fleeting opportunity to shift California politics.\n\n\u001cUnless we shift the paradigm of voter registration, we are not going to win, but we do have a chance,\u001d Grenell said. \u001cThe fires have given us an unbelievable moment. We cannot miss this moment.","summary":"The night before former Vice President Kamala Harris re-emerged on the political scene in a speech rallying Democrats to &quot;lock in&quot; to fight President Trump, one of Trump's top lieutenants issued a warning.","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/05/02/ric_grenells_favorite_yet_unsexy_role_registering_california_voters_152743.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 14:13:51","author":"RCP,Susan Crabtree","authors":["RCP","Susan Crabtree"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.074},{"id":317204042,"title":"Conservative Icon, Thinker David Horowitz Dies at 86","text":"Screenshot Newsmax TV\n\nBy Eric Mack Newsmax\n\nLongtime Newsmax commentator and conservative Jewish author David Horowitz has died at age 86.\n\n“On behalf of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, we are very saddened to announce the passing of the Center’s founder, David Horowitz,” the center he founded in 1998 wrote Tuesday night on X.\n\n“David Horowitz, 1939-2025. Requiescat in pace.”\n\nAn updated post read, “David passed away today, April 29th, 2025.”\n\nImportant: Famed Jewish author David Horowitz’ ‘Dark Agenda’ warned Christians of coming persecution, See More Here\n\nHe is survived by his fourth wife April and his four children and leaves a lasting memory on the Newsmax viewership and readerships.\n\nHis story is one of a self-proclaimed former Marxist who had “second thoughts” on leftist ideology, becoming a conservative stalwart and a fierce defender of religion and President Donald Trump.\n\nIn fact, Trump used the title of Horowitz’s “Final Battle: The Next Election Could Be the Last” book to make it a prevailing theme in hundreds of Trump campaign rallies between his departure from the White House in January 2021 to his return to the White House after the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nAmong his most recent books was “The Radical Mind.” Horowitz wrote so poignantly about the left and its ideology because he used to preach it himself before he saw the light as former President Ronald Reagan did.\n\nBut the one book that helped reshape the 2024 presidential election campaign was one that moved Trump as he boarded Trump Force One to appear for his famed mugshot and booking for his first-of-its-kind arrest of a former U.S. president in April 2023.\n\nAs Trump took flight, he issued a press release making reference to his call for a “final battle.”\n\nTrump’s release simply stated: “ICYMI: ‘Trump: 2024 Is Final Battle; We’re Only Ones Who Can Stop Them.'”\n\nThe release urged supporters to read a Newsmax article detailing Trump’s use of the term “final battle” at his March 2023 rally in Waco, Texas.\n\nTrump returned to the campaign rally trail in Texas, saying, “2024 is the final battle.”\n\n“That’s going to be the big one,” Trump told his crowd at the rally. “You put me back in the White House, their reign will be over, and America will be a free nation once again.”\n\nTrump was clearly referring to Horowitz’s bestseller, “Final Battle: The Next Election Could Be the Last.”\n\nPreviously, Trump has explicitly praised Horowitz’s “Final Battle.”\n\nTrump wrote in February 2023, “My great friend and author of ‘Dark Agenda,’ David Horowitz, is out with a new book, ‘Final Battle: The Next Election Could Be the Last.’ It is great! Get your copy!”\n\nIn “Final Battle,” Horowitz had predicted the leftists, so fearful of Trump’s return to the White House, would stop at nothing, including indictments against the former president.\n\nThe effort backfired, as Trump’s campaign raised millions off the indictments and would ultimately knock out the Biden family dynasty and defeat replacement candidate then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nHorowitz’s books often dealt with his conversion to become a Republican during Reagan’s administration, the fight from the left against religion and the left’s seeking to destroy America.\n\nA practicing Jew, Horowitz said one of the most important books he wrote was “Dark Agenda: The War to Destroy Christian America” — which detailed, he said, the left’s war on Christianity, which, he warned, was leading to making the religion illegal and open for persecution.\n\nMany of the Horowitz book titles would ultimately become Trump campaign mantras on the stump, including “The Enemy Within,” “Big Agenda,” “Dark Agenda,” and “Blitz: Trump Will Smash the Left and Win.”\n\nEric Mack ✉\n\nEric Mack has been a writer and editor at Newsmax since 2016.

Ever so politely, the beat journalists probed Carr about recent moves he’d made—like using the power of his role to investigate news organizations for airing stories that just happen to make Donald Trump unhappy. Notably, Carr has launched a probe into how CBS edited a 60 Minutes interview of then candidate Kamala Harris. Despite no evidence of journalistic malpractice, Trump demanded that the network should “lose its license” over the story. He also recommended other networks lose their affiliates “because they are just as corrupt as CBS—maybe even WORSE!”\nThis was before Trump came back to power, and Jessica Rosenworcel, then chair of the FCC, brushed it off. She noted that the agency didn’t revoke licenses because a politician disliked how he was covered. Before Rosenworcel left office, the complaint was denied. But after Trump installed Carr as FCC chair in late January, he pulled the case out of the dustbin and started an investigation. So much for following Trump's January 20 executive order demanding “no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.”\nCarr’s response to questions about CBS at the open meeting was: “All options remain on the table,” even the “death penalty” of the network’s broadcast license. He also indicated that NBC and the other networks that have covered the case of the legal immigrant mistakenly deported to an El Salvadorian prison might be in similar trouble. His justification was that since broadcast outlets have exclusive access to their slice of public airwaves, their content must be in the public interest. If they don’t like that, he said, they can be podcasters.\nThe trouble with this—well there are a lot of troubles with this—is that it’s obvious that “the public interest” here is being interpreted as “stuff Donald Trump likes.” While the FCC can issue sanctions about “news distortion,” that term refers to egregious and consciously fraudulent reporting. The CBS case and the network coverage of deportations aren’t even in the same universe as that kind of malfeasance. “This is one of the tools that the administration is using to censor and control the news media, and to punish anyone that dares to speak against our government,” the remaining Democrat on the commission, Anna Gomez, told me this week.\nIt’s not only Democrats who are alarmed by this. In March, far-right crusader Grover Norquist—the guy who once said he wanted to drown government in a bathtub—was among the ultra-conservatives who signed a letter begging Carr to dismiss the case, saying it would “constitute regulatory overreach and advance precedent that can be weaponized by future FCCs.” Dude, it’s the current FCC we have to worry about! When Carr tried to explain his complaints about news coverage, he said they were all about empowering local news as opposed to big networks. But Gomez told me that the stations themselves are spooked. “I've spoken to local broadcasters throughout the country, and they're nervous that they're going to get dragged before the FCC based on the content of their coverage,” she says.\nHow did we get here? Carr’s background indicates that he might have been a straightforward leader of the agency. After several years as a legal adviser, he became a commissioner in 2017 and Joe Biden reappointed him in 2023. (Three of the five FCC commissioners, including the chair, are to be from the president’s party.) As a lifelong Republican—his father was once one of Nixon’s lawyers—he would be expected to champion conservative stances, like fighting net neutrality and sucking up to big telecom interests. His views on government regulating content seemed in sync with the First Amendment: After two House Democrats complained about Fox News after the January 6 insurrection, he released a statement saying, in part, “A newsroom’s decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official, not targeted by them.”\nBut even before Trump elevated him to the chairmanship in January, Carr was veering into wing-nut territory. “When I was at the White House, he was like a thorn, always trying to make all kinds of weird MAGA moves,” says Tim Wu, who was Biden’s special assistant in tech policy. “We refused to have anything to do with him, because he was playing by a different rule book. He was less like a commissioner and more a random podcaster.” One of those MAGA moves was writing the communications chapter in the notorious Project 2025 playbook that turned out to be the road map the White House is using to dismantle the government, though the chapter said nothing about regulating “news distortion.” As chair, Carr must now be listened to, especially as he veers into the censorship lane.\nOne irony of the Carr strategy is that he sits atop the FCC when the agency’s literal powers are weaker than ever. In February, Trump signed an executive order reining in independent agencies like the FCC—essentially making himself a supercommissioner with ultimate authority. Also, a recent Fifth Circuit court decision seemingly stripped away the FCC’s power to unilaterally impose fines. (Carr says that the reasoning was faulty, and the agency is appealing.)\nDespite these limitations, Carr is still dangerous. The mere act of investigating—or even criticizing—a media company's actions, whether they involve objective journalism or a DEI policy, can have a chilling effect. (Carr is looking into Disney’s efforts to promote gender and racial equity, which he sees as another reason to sanction media companies.) “While there are no formal decisions of the FCC, Carr is using his powers of intimidation and coercion,” says Thomas Wheeler, who was FCC chair during Obama’s second term. Morality and justice aside, it’s an effective strategy. “Point one, there's no vehicle to push back, because there's no final decision you can take to court. And point two is that it’s not necessarily healthy to poke your regulator in the eye.”\nJonathan Nuechterlein, a former general counsel at the FTC, writing about another Carr overstep— he questioned Google because its YouTube TV service doesn’t carry the faith-based Great American Family Network—opined that Carr doesn’t need to make rulings or invoke fines to make a difference: “Jawboning” alone can be akin to enforcement. “A jawboning target cannot simply call the FCC’s bluff,” he wrote, “because the Commission, and the Administration as a whole, enjoy great discretion to kneecap any disobedient company down the road in unrelated contexts, ranging from merger-approval proceedings to litigation settlements to the award of government benefits.”\nThe CBS case is proof of that. The network is a subsidiary of Paramount, which is seeking government approval of a multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance, a media company controlled by David Ellison. When Trump personally sued Paramount for a ridiculously high $20 billion due to CBS’s editing, the company had an incentive to go into settlement talks—and apparently, impose extra oversight on 60 Minutes. This led the show’s longtime leader to resign. When anchor Scott Pelley announced the change on the air, he specifically cited the Paramount merger as a motivator for the oversight. The assumed endgame: a settlement in Trump’s favor, whereupon the president would order an end to the FCC investigation. At the April open meeting, Carr ducked a question about whether he would drop the issue if Trump ordered it.\nPeople expect presidents to rail about their press critics. Using regulatory bodies to engage in government censorship—didn’t I hear about an executive order banning that?— is something quite different. It’s straight out of the authoritarian handbook, and must be called out strongly. That’s what led a bipartisan group of former FCC commissioners to file a letter on March 26, objecting to the CBS investigation. Failure to dismiss the complaint, they wrote, “would suggest that the Commission has been transformed into a tool of White House-driven speech suppression.”\nBehind the strong language of the letter, however, is a tale of submission. According to Wheeler, the call to sign the letter went out to all the former commissioners since the Bush years, including six chairs. “Out of those 24, we could only get 5 to sign that filing, and only two chairmen—because of the fear of retribution,” he says. Carr’s blustery censorship may be less alarming than the silence of those who stand by as our rights erode.","summary":"Under its new chairman, the FCC is threatening broadcasters and pushing President Donald Trump’s agenda.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-fcc-brendan-carr-donald-trump/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/68128fb98756b2b4fe46373d/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Plaintext-FCC-Unconstitutional-Censorship-Investigation-Business-2202557391.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 14:00:00","author":"Steven Levy","authors":["Steven Levy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":317143440,"title":"CBS scores Emmy nomination for ‘60 Minutes’ Kamala Harris interview at center of Trump suit","text":"The controversial “60 Minutes” interview at the center of President Donald Trump’s high-stakes lawsuit against CBS News is now an Emmy-nominated program. \n\nThe nominations for the 46th News & Documentary Emmy Awards were announced Thursday. \n\n“60 Minutes” landed several nods, most notably in the Outstanding Edited Interview category for its primetime special featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nAmong the other nominees in that category include CBS’ interviews with Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the late Pope Francis, as well as NBC’s interview with Celine Dion and ABC’s interview with Brittney Griner. \n\n“Of course it’s nominated for best editing because it takes some serious talent to edit Kamala’s answer into something that’s coherent and understandable, which in the end they still failed to do,” White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital.\n\nNeither CBS News nor representatives for Trump’s legal team responded to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment.\n\nLast fall, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit (it has since been increased to $20 billion) against CBS News and its parent company, Paramount Global, for what he alleged was election interference with how the network handled its Harris interview in the days leading up to the presidential election. \n\nThe lawsuit stems from an exchange Harris had with “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t “listening” to the Biden administration.\n\nHarris was widely mocked for the “word salad” answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on “Face the Nation.” \n\nHowever, when Whitaker asked the same question during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris’s “word salad” answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. \n\nEarlier this year, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC’s “news distortion” policy after a complaint was filed. \n\nCBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. \n\nThe released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris’s comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the “Face the Nation” preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. \n\nIn the months since, CBS News has faced turmoil. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is reportedly in favor of settling the lawsuit with the president. \n\nMany believe a settlement would help pave the way for Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump’s FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction.\n\nBoth parties agreed to mediation, which is currently underway, signaling their courtroom feud will result in a settlement. \n\n“60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, who at the time refused to apologize for the Harris interview, resigned last week, citing corporate pressure he said prevented him from maintaining editorial independence. \n\nRedstone not only wanted to reportedly “keep tabs” on upcoming segments involving Trump, she reportedly urged CBS execs to delay any sensitive reporting on Trump until after the merger deal closed with Skydance.\n\nThe speculation was affirmed by journalists on “CBS Evening News” and “60 Minutes,” who saluted the beloved network producer on-air while addressing Trump’s looming lawsuit. \n\nOne CBS News insider told Fox News Digital that everyone at the network is “on edge” over the ongoing drama. \n\n“Nobody knows the next shoe that will drop,” they told Fox News Digital. “And internally, it’s just very chaotic because everyone doesn’t know what will happen next.”\n\nCBS staffers believe Trump’s lawsuit is “BS” and that no one wants to see Paramount settle. Some are even “scared” about the prospect of a settlement, believing it will “hurt the news division and the perception of it.”","summary":"\"60 Minutes\" landed several nods, most notably in the Outstanding Edited Interview category for its primetime special.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/02/media/60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview-at-the-center-of-trumps-cbs-lawsuit-receives-emmy-nomination/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/103700391-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TRI1Kine-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-02 13:56:04","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":317152554,"title":"Watch: Key moments from the local elections so far... in 100 seconds","text":"Pat Shepherd: 'I had no idea it was VE Day'As most the UK celebrated VE Day, Pat Shepherd was given a vital task when high-ranking Nazi officers landed at her airbase to surrender military plans. 1 hr ago\n\nRussell Brand's court appearance explained... in 50 secondsThe BBC's Charlotte Gallagher reports from outside Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, as Brand faces multiple charges.2 hrs ago\n\nBBC Newsline Signed SummaryA signed summary of BBC Newsline.2 hrs ago\n\nFootage captures near misses on tram tracksThe tram CCTV clips of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians were all filmed in South Yorkshire.3 hrs agoSouth Yorkshire\n\nHenry Zeffman: Reform UK wins Runcorn, but what comes next?Henry Zeffman: Reform UK wins Runcorn, but what comes next?3 hrs agoPolitics\n\nDo you complain about the hot weather?Temperatures reached over 27C in Cardiff's Bute Park on Thursday 1 May.7 hrs agoWales\n\n'Well there you go' - watch moment spokeswoman learns Waltz newsTammy Bruce found out about Mike Waltz's job change from a reporter during a news briefing on Thursday.19 hrs agoUS & Canada\n\nEast of England weather forecastThe latest weather forecast for the East of England from BBC Look East.20 hrs agoEngland\n\nRos Atkins on...

It's the cautionary tale about how ceding a trifle of something — such as a cookie — to a mouse will only lead to more demands and expectations, each harder to satisfy than the last. Perhaps when Donald Trump read this book to a group of children for a photo-op as a private citizen back in 2003, he inverted its original lesson.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Blaming Trump alone for laid off workers hides key factors\n\nSteele adds, \"Rather than heeding the caution the book imposes on the reader about the slippery slope of capitulation, he may have interpreted the mouse's journey as aspirational — a blueprint for expanding his power that he is now applying to our entire system of governance.\"\n\nSteele, a Never Trump conservative and MSNBC host, emphasizes that CE0s, law firms and law firms who try to placate Trump won't make life easier for themselves.\n\n\"These days, Trump is getting offered much bigger rewards than cookies,\" the former RNC chairman warns, \"and the demands are growing broader and more unfeasible. We've seen this unfold recently as Trump bent Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to his will. Maybe Bezos didn't see much potential for harm when he allegedly prevented The Washington Post's editorial board from endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris for president, or donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and then attended the actual event with a prime spot.\"\n\n Steele continues, \"That was roughly 100 days ago, a period of time in which Business Insider estimates Bezos has lost $36 billion. You would think a poor return on investment would be grounds for getting out of a deal with Trump, but think again.

Those actions have bled the publication of readers and revenue as Bezos favors his daddy Trump over his customers. \n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote on X.\n\nHis choice of social media platform was no coincidence, as that’s where the biggest sycophants curry favor with Trump and his co-President Elon Musk.\n\n“I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America,” said Bezos, whose idea of a free market includes contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration festivities. “I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.”\n\nHa ha! Yes, unfettered capitalism sure is hard to find in today’s media landscape.\n\nBut what’s so “free market” about tariffs? What does “freedom” mean if people are not properly informed? \n\nIf Bezos wants to live his supposed ideals—ideals that have severely damaged one of our nation’s premier journalistic institutions—then he can prove it by doing exactly what Trump fears most: letting people know how tariffs are affecting the free market, and informing them of the factual consequences so they can properly assess how to proceed. If consumers love higher prices from tariffs as much as Trump seems to, then great! The GOP can rest assured during the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nRelated | Trump praises Jeff Bezos for turning Washington Post into MAGA media\n\nYet Republicans are obviously terrified at the prospect—and that includes Trump. That’s why despite all of the president’s swooning over the word “tariffs,” Leavitt essentially threatened Bezos from the White House press room’s podium. \n\nBut that certainly shouldn’t matter, as Bezos has told us he’s not afraid of any retribution. \n\n“You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests,” he wrote when justifying his paper’s nonendorsement. “Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other. I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled, and I believe my track record as owner of The Post since 2013 backs this up. You are of course free to make your own determination, but I challenge you to find one instance in those 11 years where I have prevailed upon anyone at The Post in favor of my own interests. It hasn’t happened.”\n\nWell, it seems to be happening now. \n\nHe can prove otherwise to everyone by doing what Trump fears the most: clearly show the 230 million people who buy from Amazon the impact and consequences of Trump’s dunderheaded tariffs. \n\nIn fact, free market principles demand it.","summary":"Trump administration officials threw a hissy fit on Tuesday over a report that Amazon planned to start listing the impact of tariffs on individual product prices.

Despite this, polls still seem to show that Trump is commanding more trust than his main opposition party.This dynamic not only strengthens Trump's hand as he advances his second-term agenda but also signals a daunting challenge for Democrats heading into the 2026 midterms—one that could further erode their influence at both state and federal levels.What To KnowIn January, Donald Trump appeared to be riding a wave of political momentum—his approval ratings had climbed into positive territory for the first time in his career, and polls suggested he was more popular than ever.But recent polls suggest that Trump now holds the distinction of being the least popular president at the 100-day mark of a second term, surpassing even the historically low ratings he received during his first presidency.A CNN/SSRS survey conducted April 17—24 among 1,678 adults found that only 41 percent approve of his job performance, while 59 percent disapprove—a 4-point drop since March and 7 points lower than in late February. This marks the lowest 100-day approval rating for any president since modern polling began under Eisenhower and is even worse than Trump's own first-term numbers.A Fox News poll from April 18—21 of 1,104 registered voters showed a net approval of -10 points, with 44 percent approving and 55 percent disapproving—down 8 points from the previous month.In comparison to past presidents at the same point in office, Trump is far behind: Joe Biden had a 54 percent approval rating, Barack Obama 62 percent, and George W. Bush 63 percent. Trump's rating has fallen to just 39 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted April 18—22 among 2,464 adults—down 6 points since February.The NPR/PBS/Marist Poll, conducted April 21—23, revealed perhaps the sharpest criticism, with 46 percent of registered voters assigning Trump an \"F\" grade for his performance—the worst 100-day grade ever recorded for a U.S. president.But despite the negative polls for Trump, some suggest he is still more popular than the Democrats.The CNN/SSRS poll showed that when respondents were asked who would be doing a better job as president, 45 percent chose Trump, while 43 percent chose Kamala Harris. \"This looks a lot like the election result,\" CNN pollster Harry Enten noted. The 2024 election saw Trump beat Harris in the popular vote by two points, with around 50 percent of the vote. That would suggest that voters' support for Trump has not shifted all that much since November.An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, conducted between April 18 to 22 among 3,634 respondents, brought more bad news for the Democrats, showing that when respondents were asked who they trusted more to deal with the U.S.'s main problems, 40 percent chose Trump, compared to just 32 percent who chose Democrats in Congress.And in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between April 25-27 among 1,029 adults, the Republicans held a significant advantage over Democrats on two of the most pressing issues for voters: immigration and the economy.When asked which party has the better plan to address immigration, respondents favored the GOP by a wide 19-point margin. On the economy, Republicans also lead by 9 points. That is despite recent polls showing Trump deep underwater on both issues over the past few weeks after he announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and became embroiled in a dispute with the Supreme Court over the mistaken deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.It comes at a time when polls have shown that following their 2024 election loss, the Democrats are more unpopular than ever.According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990.There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party.The survey suggested that this may be because Democratic voters want their party to take a tougher position in Congress. Among Democratic voters, 65 percent said they wanted their congressional representatives to \"stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington,\" while 32 percent said they should \"make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\"The poll largely reflects the debates occurring in the Democratic party right now in light of their 2024 defeat.Some feel that in order to get back on track and win back the House in the 2026 midterms, the party should take a more bipartisan approach to politics, and work with Trump to pass legislation, while others feel that doing so will alienate Democratic voters who see Trump as a toxic figure.This dispute played out this week when Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined Trump at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, which provoked backlash from progressives.A Reddit post from political group 50501 accused her of \"destructive enabling behavior\" and legitimizing a president they believe should face impeachment. Tara Setmayer, co-founder of The Seneca Project, said on X that Whitmer is \"disqualifying herself\" because of her actions.However, some defended Whitmer, including Travis Akers, a veterans and gun reform advocate and a naval intelligence officer, who said on X: \"It's ridiculous that Democrats are upset with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for joining President Trump at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.\"Mike Nellis, Democratic strategist, added: \"You won't catch me complaining about Gretchen Whitmer saving tens of thousands of jobs or bringing in federal relief for people without power in Michigan. That's the damn job.\"Whitmer's appearance followed her disastrous meeting in the Oval Office last week. The Michigan governor had gone to see the president for what she described as a private meeting. But the meeting led to an awkward moment, when Whitmer was left standing in front of cameras as Trump signed an executive order targeting a critic and repeating his debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.A New York Times photographer captured her at one point shielding her face with folders.In a statement, Whitmer's office said the governor was brought into the Oval Office in front of the press \"without any notice\" and emphasized that her presence was not an \"endorsement of the actions taken or statements\" made at that event.But Whitmer received much backlash, some Democrats accusing her of \"appeasement.\"However, Whitmer appeared to dismiss these claims, writing on X: \"I'll work with anyone who's serious about getting things done. But I'll never compromise on what I believe. In Michigan, we know how to get things done—and that means working together.\"She added: \"Bipartisanship isn't about sacrificing our values. It's about standing strong and finding common ground to get things done. It's about putting people first, every single time.\"What People Are SayingCNN pollster Harry Enten said: \"These numbers should be a major wake-up call for Democrats. Democrats cannot count their chickens just yet, because those eggs have not cracked at this particular moment.\"What Happens NextIn 2026, Americans will head to the polls to elect new senators and representatives.

Trump won 60% of white men, suggesting they did not respond well to Walz’s permission structure. Trump also carried 54% of Hispanic men and 21% of black men, according to exit polls.\n\nWalz previously brought his brand of harmless masculinity to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) podcast, where he suggested that Trump-supporting men felt threatened by him and perhaps rightly so. “I do think I could kick most of their ass,” Walz said. (The singular is in the original.)\n\nPerhaps a generic Democrat could do better next time. “I think we need to collectively run a presidential campaign without a candidate right now that builds all the infrastructure. … By the time we get to 2028, we’re ready,” Walz said. \n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) has now twice been successfully trolled by Trump. Her impromptu remarks as Trump marked his 100 days back in office went better than her hiding her face behind papers in the White House, but her tarmac embrace of the president could come back to haunt her. Chris Christie was never forgiven by his party’s base for hugging Barack Obama when they were governor of New Jersey and president of the United States, respectively. \n\nAt the same time, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD), one of the Democrats’ rising stars, announced on Thursday that he would be taking a pass on the 2028 presidential race.\n\nIn retrospect, one of the signs that the Democrats were going to lose the 2024 election even after replacing former President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket was their most ambitious elected officials deciding to forgo the opportunity. No one seriously floated a challenge to former Vice President Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention after Biden dropped out. Whitmer and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), both Rust Belt governors, were similarly disinterested in being Harris’s running mate. \n\nTwo major things could happen that might make 2028 different. The first is that if the economy and Trump’s poll numbers continue on their present trajectory, Democratic candidates will not need exceptional political skills to win. The second is that if the economy and Trump’s poll numbers are bad, more talented Democrats will see an opportunity and run.\n\nEstablished politicians often fight the last war, and presidential campaigns often start a year or two before the actual election year. In 1992, most of the presumed top-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination chose not to run. Mario Cuomo, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen, and others made their decisions in the aftermath of the Gulf War, when President George H.W. Bush had record job approval ratings and looked unbeatable. \n\nBut the early ‘90s recession, coupled with the lips-defying Bush tax increase, made the incumbent quite vulnerable. Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who had bombed in his 1988 Democratic convention speech, ascended to the top against second-tier competition like Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown. Clinton also proved to be a generational political talent. \n\nA lot could change between now and the midterm elections, much less the next presidential race. Trump’s numbers and the economy could improve. The political climate could be radically different. Republicans will be looking at a different nominee in 2028, though that candidate will need to run under the conditions left by Trump, just as John McCain campaigned in the shadow of second-term George W. Bush.\n\nIf the Democrats have a Clinton-like talent waiting in the wings, they have yet to show sufficient interest in the White House. But it wouldn’t take a huge shift from 2024 nationally or in the battleground states to produce a different electoral outcome.\n\nDemocrats need their opponents to create the permission structure Tim Walz couldn’t.","summary":"Whatever ails President Donald Trump, each day brings new reminders that many of the Democrats who would like to replace him aren’t quite ready for prime time.  Every time Gov.

It’s opinions of elites that have filtered down through the news media membrane. This is evident by the fact that most people’s opinions aren’t theirs. They are the opinion of some elite somewhere. \n\nAnd the thing about that is that elites don’t really see Donald Trump as an existential threat to their lives and fortunes. He is not evil, per se, but instead just another political actor with whom they can bargain. This, too, is evident. You can see this amorality in the fact that elites are lining up to bribe the president out of tariffing their businesses. \n\nThat his policies are intent on immiserating the middle class is none of their concern. Evil needn’t be stopped when it can be bargained with.\n\nSo if public opinion is really the opinion of elites, and if the opinion of elites is that they can bargain with the devil, then public opinion will probably reflect that, meaning that our democratic republic may end up collectively deciding there’s really no need to fight Donald Trump. \n\nThis paradox has been banging around in my head, and it informed the questions I asked Nicholas Grossman. He’s a professor of political science at the University of Illinois, and senior editor of Arc Digital.\n\n“Some elites will stay on board until the very end, some will quietly reduce public support without acknowledging that, and some will sour as Trump continues abusing power and damaging their bottom line,” he said. “I don't know where the tipping point is, but I expect more elites to accept what Trump is, as he keeps throwing it in their faces.”\n\nJS: I'm hearing a lot of talk among liberals about how the tide is turning against Trump. Is this real or wishful thinking?\n\nNG: I think there's something to that, though we shouldn't overstate it, and it's definitely not a reason for complacency. It’s in declining polls, protests, losses in court, and more institutions finding their spines. That will probably grow as economic damage hits more this summer. \n\nI just wrote about that in The Bulwark. Trump's declining polls \"aren’t just numbers for politicians and media to discuss, they represent millions of opinions. It’s an inexact gauge, of course, but a sizable, multi-month drop like this indicates a change throughout society. Call it a vibe shift, one more connected to reality than the sweeping Trumpist vibe shift proclaimed in the aftermath of last year’s election.\"\n\nJS: CNN did a poll showing more voters still trust Trump more than they would Kamala Harris if she were president? Is this really a vibe shift?\n\nNG: Depends on the baseline. From the sweeping pro-Trump vibe shift declared after the election, which saw a bunch of business and media rush to him as if that was the unquestioned future, yes.\n\nIf the 2024 election were rerun today, would the results be different? I don't know, no one knows, and I don't think it matters. In the midst of an election in a two-party system, \"do you dislike the Democratic candidate?\" is a highly relevant question. But we're not, so the main question is \"do you approve or disapprove of the president?\"\n\nJS: Regarding the opposition party, are the Democrats in as bad a shape as they appear to be? Some seem to be up for the fight. Others do not. Can we deduce anything from this internal division?\n\nNG: I think the shape of the Democrats is an over-discussed topic, since they have little institutional power, and it's more than a year and a half until the next national election.\n\nThat said, some are up for the fight and taking action (Senator Chris Van Hollen going to El Salvador and getting a meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia; Bernie and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doing big rallies, various other examples). Some aren't up for it and are keeping their head down in fear or complacency. And some argue that fighting would be counterproductive, and it'd be better to avoid confrontation, avoid drawing any attention to themselves, and let Trump harm his standing on his own while waiting for the midterms (Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, consultants such as James Carville, etc.).\n\nI think the first camp is right, and I've been glad to see more of that. Courage is contagious. But mostly I think what we're seeing is the Democrats reeling from Trump winning the election, then going through the process of adjusting to the new political circumstances.\n\nJS: Elite opinion tends to become public opinion. So far, elites seem to believe Trump isn't evil. They can bargain with him. How bad do things have to get, tariff-wise, for that to change? Would it change at all?\n\nNG: I think we've seen it change some already. Maybe the biggest example is in finance, where influential figures like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon were Trump boosters during the election, told people to get over the tariffs in February, and are now criticizing his economic policies. Another is Harvard standing up to unreasonable White House demands, unlike Columbia, which tried appeasement.\n\nSome elites will stay on board until the very end, some will quietly reduce public support without acknowledging that, and some will sour as Trump continues abusing power and damaging their bottom line. \n\nI don't know where the tipping point is, but I expect more elites to accept what Trump is, as he keeps throwing it in their faces.\n\nJS: Trump is literally tearing down aspects of the federal government that were erected during the New Deal and Great Society years. He's ending those eras. What is going to replace them, if anything?\n\nNG: I'd love to be able to paint a picture for you, but I don't even know where to start. We're in uncharted territory (for the United States, at least) and the future is very uncertain. \n\nThis won't go on forever, but so many things are in play, with so many variables that could go in multiple directions, that I don't have a sense of what happens next, and I don't believe anyone who claims they do. \n\nThe only thing I'm confident of is there won't be a simple \"return to normalcy,\" like Joe Biden attempted. Trump's first term was arguably a fluke. His second was a choice by American voters who had spent years seeing exactly who he is and what he offers. There could be a revival or renewal, but there's no going back.\n\nNOW READ: Dem shows how to take a Republican smear and hit back","summary":"The thing about a democratic republic is that it’s directed by public opinion, and the thing about public opinion is that it’s not really the public’s.

Either that’s a guy with a lot of responsibility, or is one of these Washington insiders, who wears those cheap suits and bargained harder for his title than his salary.\n\nIn his piece, I worked for Harris and Biden. Here’s the missing link for Democrats,Flaherty spent a lot of time talking about “opt-in” voters, allegedly us. And “opt-out” voters, allegedly them. Democrats are winning “opt-in” voters big-time, you see, but just can’t seem to reach those pesky “opt-out” types, who he described this way:\n\n“At their core, opt-out voters generally don’t trust politicians or the mainstream media. Many assume the system is rigged, the media is biased and neither party is actually fighting for them.”\n\nThat’s funny, because that at least vaguely sounds like me, and I thought I was an “opt-inner.” It hurts to admit that, especially as a guy who gave his life to journalism. But let’s face it, we are all being suckered and rolled by billionaires who own our current-day corporate media and their clever messages of surrender disguised as news.\n\nBefore diving face first into his “opt-in” “opt-out” spiel, Flaherty, who’s 33, wanted us to know this important nugget:\n\n“I’ve come up through a party that clings to TV ads and news releases, holding on to a media environment that stopped existing a decade ago.”\n\nI played along and read the piece, but not before asking several times why if this guy was so damn smart and knew about some “missing link” and the fact he was part of an ancient media environment that “stopped existing,” he didn’t do something about it as the deputy campaign manager on Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign when it would have mattered — LIKE LAST F–––––G YEAR.\n\nExcept the truth is he wasn’t that smart last year, either, because here is what he said about the campaign just 75 days from the election:\n\n“Young voters are very excited about this ticket, and voters across the country are excited about this ticket, and that’s because of the vice president, and that’s because of Gov. (Tim) Walz.”\n\nActually if young voters had showed up for Democrats as they had in the past, Harris would have won going away, because here are the facts:\n\n75-year-old white men supported Kamala Harris by a whopping 14 points over 20-year-old white men in this election. Worse? Among all 18-year-olds, women of color are the ONLY group Harris won. Trump even won nonwhite men in this age group by a narrow margin.\n\nThat’s called a massive failure, and if we are to believe Flaherty and all his tens of years of expertise he’s dragging along, it’s a failure he most certainly should have seen coming, and acted on when he had the chance, instead of Monday morning quarterbacking in the NYT while this country burns.\n\nLook, Flaherty seems like an earnest lad, who’s got a serious political addiction, but the nonsense he’s dealing to his “opt-inners” in the NYT right now isn’t helping. He is becoming highly skilled at making himself believe almost anything about anybody depending on who is paying him to do it.\n\nTrust me on this: D.C. is just crammed full of these people, who are elbowing each other out of the way to get a rising politician’s attention.\n\nFlaherty’s piece is just the latest from the gang of gung-ho, inadequate staffers in the Biden/Harris/Harris/Walz campaign who spent 2024 hiding how bad things were on the inside to the millions of donors on the outside.\n\nThey are falling all over themselves to explain how it all went wrong, despite all they were allegedly doing right.\n\nRather than reckon with their issues, they apparently just decided to roundly ignore them, and sent out 73 fund-raising messages an hour, so they could use that money to ensure that Harris reached as many critical “opt-in” voters as possible, and join the coveted billon-dollar campaign fundraising club.\n\nFor having reached that milestone, and then spent that money in all the wrong places, people like Flaherty still figure they will have jobs inside the party forever, and that is the damn problem right there.\n\nEverything anybody thinks they knew about politics died on November 5, 2024. Right now the survival of our country — forget the Democratic Party — is on the line.\n\nWe are officially at the “fight or die” stage of American democracy.\n\nWe need to be on wartime footing. We need new leaders with new ideas who understand this. I’m talking about RIGHT NOW.\n\nThey need to be leading from the front and everywhere.\n\nWe need to plan what it will look like when people take to the streets by the millions because this is most certainly coming. I’m not talking about these isolated marches that have been popping off in the last few months, I am talking about massive demonstrations of people power.\n\nI am talking about the kinds of things that America has never seen before, because I am telling you that if you still do not believe Trump will do everything in his power to destroy us, before admitting he was wrong about anything, then you need to get out of our way, and quit wasting our time.\n\nThis is not some damn political game.\n\nIt terrifies me that too many Democrats on the inside still don’t seem to understand what the hell is going on on the outside.","summary":"Let’s start here today: Any Democrat who had a part in the Biden/Harris/Harris/Walz 2024 presidential campaign, is never allowed to work in politics again.\n\nThat might not be the brave decree it reads like, because that election might have been the last of its kind in American history, which makes the failings of the three-headed campaign so stark.\n\nAnd if that made you snicker it wasn’t meant as a joke, because if you still somehow don’t think that the American-attacking Trump won’t do everything inhumanely possible to hold onto power in 2028, you need go stand in some corner for not paying attention.\n\nHe means to end us, folks.\n\nWhat you have seen out of this stone-cold racist and his Christo-fascist cult of me-firsts during their first 100 days of this torture test has been but a small sampler of what is yet to be served.
