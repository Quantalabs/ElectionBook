Red-faced emoji.\n\nWhoopsie doodle.\n\nBut this scandal is more than just an opportunity for you and I to enjoy a good, long therapeutic crackle, because Chatgate (The Yemen Yeller? The Signal Bingle?) is a much bigger deal for Donald Trump than just being deeply embarrassing.\n\nIt could be a real tipping point. \n\nThis could be the first el scandalo that has some of those whatcha me-call-its. \n\nConsequences.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, no matter the scandal, nothing has affected Mr Trump’s standing with his tireless army of supporters, the former reality show host like a sort of greased up duck: everything has simply slipped off his back.\n\nHowever, unlike the 199 Trump scandals that have come before it, Chatgate is a firestorm that the MAGA-verse – and anyone between the ages of three and 103 – can immediately and simply get: War plans put in a group chat. The end.\n\nAlready, this has caused genuine mass public anger, with 74 per cent of Americans, including 60 per cent of Republicans, saying the war plans fiasco was a very or somewhat serious problem, according to YouGov polling.\n\nTrump & co have been unmasked for all to see as utter dimwits and certifiable drongos.\n\nUsing Signal was only “a few steps above leaving a copy of your war plan at the Chinese Embassy”, one Washington defence expert told Politico.\n\nThere have also reportedly been conversations among national security experts whether such handling of defence information might have violated the Espionage Act.\n\nThe people from the chat with the most egg on their faces? \n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz who added, god knows how, Mr Goldberg to the group and Mr Hegseth, who shared the specific details of the US’ bombing of Yemen on March 15.\n\nMr Hegseth’s messages were sent 31 minutes before American warplanes took off and two hours and one minute before the Yemen bombing raid began, and clearly endangered the military involved.\n\n“You’re going to kill somebody,” one air force pilot told The New York Times.\n\nAnd that’s what sets the Yemen chat mess apart – it’s a perfectly straightforward s**tshow.\n\nTheir unparalleled buffoonery could have killed military personnel, and Americans can immediately understand that.\n\nMr Waltz and Mr Hegseth might have just achieved what Stormy Daniels and reams of dogged prosecutors and Democrats have largely failed to do until now – to dent Mr Trump’s adamantium armour of a reputation among his followers.\n\nFor people in the US to fully appreciate the severity of the situation, they don’t have to be someone with an active New York Times subscription and be willing to wade into the finer points of campaign finance laws (Mr Trump’s criminal payment to Stormy Daniels) or care about him inflating the value of his real estate holdings or believe he should not have nicked classified documents from the White House and quite literally stored them in the Mar-a-Lago loos.\n\nThis is the first great crisis that might actually stick to Mr Trump, and which might penetrate the craniums of his base.\n\nBecause everyone from diehard MAGA loyalists with ‘Mar-a-Lago Or Bust’ tattooed on their bottoms to a dumbfounded Kamala Harris at her undisclosed location (restorative gong retreat with optional valium smoothies?) can immediately see just how wrong this is. \n\nIt doesn’t get any more devastatingly and blatantly unpatriotic than to risk the brave men and women of the armed services.\n\nWhat next? Mr Hegseth hunting American bald eagles for sport or bad mouthing apple pie?\n\nWhat further sets this fiasco apart from the procession of crises that preceded it is that there is no weaselling out of it.\n\nThere is no dodging of who did what and when, because Mr Goldberg has the screenshots. Literally.\n\nBob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had to meet Deepthroat in a murky DC parking garage to bring down President Richard Nixon; Goldberg just had to casually pick up his phone every time it went ding, ding, ding. \n\nHe actually found out the US was about to bomb Yemen when his phone pinged while he was sitting in his car in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nRepublicans also look like exquisite hypocrites after having mounted the “lock her up” campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016 over her use of an unsecured personal email server. \n\nNow they have been caught with their pants around their ankles doing nearly exactly the same thing.\n\n“Their personal phones are all hackable, and it’s highly likely that foreign intelligence services are sitting on their phones watching them type the s**t out,” a former White House official told Politico. \n\n“It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialled for this.”\n\nOne member of the chat was actually in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin at the time the messages were flying around.\n\nThis disaster comes at a shaky point for the President, whose approval ratings have been falling as Americans turn on him for having unleashed Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has been slashing and burning sections of government like a carving knife-wielding Freddy Kruger having a bad day.\n\nMr Trump’s numbers have also been affected by the fact that, despite his repeated campaign promises that he would whip out his magic wand and somehow fix grocery prices and cost of living pressures on “day one”, he has failed to actually do what he promised. \n\nHe has not even lazily attempted to have a bit of a crack at it, because his plate has been full, shilling for Tesla on the White House front lawn like a used Mazda salesman trying to make his quota.\n\nLet me do as Mike Waltz actually did and simply sum things up with a few emojis.\n\nLaughing emoji. Fire(d) emoji. Trump & co? They’ve finally been hit with smiling poo emoji.\n\nDaniela Elser is a writer, editor and commentator with more than 15 years’ experience working with a number of Australia’s leading media titles","summary":"Just two months into his presidency, Donald Trump is grappling with an escalating fiasco caused by a shocking fail from his own team.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/crisis-text-sends-donald-trump-over-the-edge/news-story/80884787553bf1963f6f5e73fbed6f71?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/85b665253978e52bac5850414c13fd6b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 23:20:10","author":"Daniela Elser","authors":["Daniela Elser"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":305612174,"title":"Kristi Noem's Expenses Raise Eyebrows Among Republicans in Her Home State","text":"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, while serving as South Dakota governor, billed state taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars for travel as she campaigned for President Donald Trump, a move that has drawn criticism from fellow Republicans, according to the Associated Press.Newsweek has reached out to the South Dakota Republican Party and the Department of Homeland Security on behalf of Noem for comment via email on Saturday.Why It Matters The Trump administration has vowed to slash federal spending, root out waste, fraud and abuse, and cut taxes through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Republicans have supported the agenda, repeatedly pledging to return more money to taxpayers.Noem heads the DHS, which she has said needs more funds to carry out Trump's mass deportation plans, the largest in U.S. history. However, her previous fiscal actions have drawn scrutiny from members of her own state party.What To Know A lawsuit filed last month by The Dakota Scout revealed Noem's travel receipts for when she was governor, which the Associated Press analyzed and found included over $150,000 in expenses unrelated to state business, such as covering personal and political trips like visits to Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, ahead of last year's election.The Scout, a media outlet in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, filed the lawsuit against state auditor Rich Sattgast in September, seeking to gain access to Noem's state-issued credit card receipts.Much of her travel was related to various political appearances in a private capacity, such as speaking at conservative events or Trump rallies, rather than state-related business.During her time as governor, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related expenses for Noem's office, with most costs incurred as her national profile grew alongside Trump's. At the time, she did not reveal her expenses to taxpayers.A significant portion of the money went towards security for the governor, regardless of the travel's purpose.Some South Dakota Republicans are upset by the large expenses, such as former Republican South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard who told the AP that the spending \"offends a lot of people.\"Another state Republican, state Senator Taffy Howard told the AP that \"it seems like an incredible amount of money.\"The AP reported that South Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for travel expenses, and top state officials from both parties have used state funds to cover them.What People Are SayingTim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for Noem, said in an email to the AP: \"They [Democratic governors] maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\"Relating to security costs, he said: \"Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials. When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\"Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor's office, wrote to AP in an email: \"Spending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor.\"What Happens Next? The parties reached a settlement in the lawsuit earlier this year, which lead to the release of over a thousand transactions from Noem's office.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Receipts from then-Govenor Kristi Noem show high travel spending, drawing concern from some South Dakota Republicans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kristi-noems-expenses-raise-eyebrows-among-republicans-her-home-state-2052687","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617508/kristi-noem.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 22:19:49","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":305609518,"title":"Hilarious Take: NY Times Editorial Board Believes Democrats Drifted Too Far Left for 2024","text":"The Democrats Are in Denial About 2024\n\nYes, yes, they are, as we’ve reported extensively.

Disney appears to be the second. The Philadelphia-based Comcast previously said in a statement that it would be “cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.”\n\nUnder Carr, the FCC also reopened a news bias complaint against ABC News for its handling of the September debate between then-Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and other conservatives cried foul because debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis pushed back against Trump’s inaccurate statements, including that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating people’s pets.

Carr did not reopen a complaint against Fox that Rosenworcel had also dismissed.\n\nThis is not Carr’s first admonition of Disney. In December, Carr sent a letter to Iger, accusing ABC of contributing to an “erosion in public trust.” Conservatives, including Carr, say that liberal bias among the major news organizations, including ABC News, has caused viewers to lose faith in journalists.\n\nIn December, Disney settled a defamation suit that Trump had filed against ABC and its news anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nTrump had filed the lawsuit last spring against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly said on air that Trump had been found liable for rape in an encounter with author E.

Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. “The Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,” Kendi argued, and “also one of the heartbeats” of the nation at large.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.\n\n“We do not run from or erase our history simply because we don’t like it,” she said in a statement. “We embrace the history of our country – the good, the bad, and the ugly.”\n\nTrump once praised the ‘Black Smithsonian’\n\nThe African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation’s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.\n\nFormer NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups — enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans — are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.\n\n“Attempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much … and the place that we’ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,” he said.\n\nAnd, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.\n\n“I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.\n\n“I know President Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall,” Trump continued. “I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.”\n\nTrump’s war on ‘woke’ targets history\n\nTrump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.\n\nHe ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled “woke” culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of “hating our country.”\n\nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges — public and private — that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.\n\nThe Defense Department, at one point, temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

You Can Try It Yourself.","text":"Social Security is an essential retirement income source for most seniors today. But if you ask younger workers, many aren't sure they'll ever see a dime from the program. Their concerns aren't entirely unfounded, though they are a bit overblown.\n\nThe program is in financial distress. It's been spending more money than it's taken in since 2021, and current estimates suggest it has less than a decade until its trust funds are depleted and it can't pay out all scheduled benefits. It wouldn't go away, though. Even in the worst-case scenario, Social Security would continue on with its income from the payroll taxes that workers pay and possibly from income taxes on Social Security benefits if current law remains in place.\n\nBenefit cuts could happen, but it's more likely that Congress will find a way to reform the program so most Americans can continue to receive their benefits as scheduled -- or maybe even get more than they're receiving now. The challenge is finding a strategy most can agree upon. If you want to see what Washington is up against, you can try your hand at reforming Social Security.\n\nHow would you fix Social Security's funding shortfall?\n\nThere isn't a single strategy that will keep Social Security solvent for the foreseeable future. It'll likely to take a combination of approaches. Some of the proposed solutions involve raising payroll taxes on workers while others suggest reducing benefits for some seniors.\n\nThe Reformer tool from the Committee for a Responsible Budget lets you play out different scenarios to see what kind of effect they would have on the funding shortfall. It gives you a list of several proposed options -- everything from raising the full retirement age (FRA) to investing trust fund earnings in the stock market -- so you can see what it might take to fix Social Security.\n\nThe tool does a great job of highlighting the many paths Washington could take to fix Social Security's funding crisis. But it also forces you to make some difficult choices about who should have to pay to keep the program sustainable for future generations.\n\nSome options, like taxing all wages above $400,000 -- which are currently exempt from Social Security payroll tax -- would go a long way. The Reformer tool estimates this would eliminate about two-thirds of the estimated shortfall. The idea of forcing the wealthy to pay more is one that's gotten a lot of bipartisan support, but there are few other proposals likely to appeal to such a broad base of Americans.\n\nTo make things more complicated, the tool also gives you options like changing the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula. This is something many seniors have long hoped for to help their benefits better keep up with inflation. But doing so would actually increase the projected funding shortfall because it would increase spending. So if you hope to make reforms to increase benefits to seniors, you'd have to find a way to bring in even more revenue or else decrease Social Security benefits for some retirees.\n\nWhy hasn't Washington done anything about Social Security yet?\n\nYou may be able to come up with a Social Security proposal that works for you using The Reformer. But the challenge for Washington is finding a plan that a majority of Congress -- and the public -- can accept.\n\nRepublicans have proposed gradually raising Social Security's FRA, which would effectively cut benefits for younger workers. Yet Trump has also proposed ending Social Security benefit taxes, which would increase the money available to seniors while also increasing the program's overall spending.\n\nAs with most political issues, many Democrats approach Social Security reform differently. Former Vice President Kamala Harris previously supported bills that would have required wealthier Americans to pay more in Social Security payroll taxes. However, as mentioned above, this alone wouldn't be enough to eliminate the projected shortfall.\n\nWith Social Security now less than a decade away from possible benefit cuts, the next few years are likely to see an increased focus on reforming the program. It's not clear what Congress will decide, though it may involve a combination of strategic benefit cuts and higher taxes. Once a plan is in place, it'll be time for workers and seniors alike to review their budgets and decide how they're going to cover their retirement costs.","url":"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/03/29/fixing-social-security-isnt-easy-try-it-yourself/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=8fac792e-11c4-4b3f-8a86-02b337f98c3d","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F812634%2Fsenior-holding-laptop-and-writing-note-in-notebook.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 18:00:00","author":"Kailey Hagen","authors":["Kailey Hagen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":305567270,"title":"Megyn Kelly Melts Down at Trump Victim E.

Jean Carroll—who was awarded over $85 million in punitive damages in her sexual abuse and defamation cases against Trump—in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times published Saturday.\n\nCarroll alleged that Trump sexually abused her in a dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s. However, Kelly said she has sided with Trump, who called the allegations “a hoax and a lie.”\n\n“I don’t believe one word of that. Not one word,” Kelly said. \n\n“The things I heard included things like he got handsy on an airplane. Now, I don’t know whether that happened or it didn’t, but do I find that a deal-breaker for a possible politician? Not really,” Kelly continued. \n\nKelly also said that she didn’t want her own sexual harassment claims against Ailes to give credence to those of former co-worker Gretchen Carlson—who sued the network and reportedly received a $20 million settlement. Kelly, who did not pursue legal action, said she didn’t want to hurt Ailes as the network’s “cult leader.”\n\n“I really cared about Roger, and we had gotten past his harassment of me, which, for the record, never led anywhere. I did not submit to any of his advances. I had forgiven him, and he had done so much for me, and I did not want to hurt him,” she told the Times. “And I didn’t like Gretchen Carlson, who was kind of looking for help in a way. The whole question was, can he be this thing who she has alleged he is? And I was really not inclined to help her and stick a knife in him.”\n\nDespite her very public endorsements of Trump and his administration, Kelly insisted that she is “still a journalist” and can play hardball when needed. She mentioned her viral exchange with Trump at a 2015 Fox News debate during his first run for president, in which Kelly took heat for asking the president about calling women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.”\n\n“Look, you have to separate when you’re in this business, you the person and you the professional. Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand, and they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game,” she said. \n\n“I had thrown a very tough ball right at Trump’s face in that debate,” said Kelly, adding that the attacks and threats following the debate led her to hire security to take her children to Disneyland.\n\nBut now Kelly is firmly in Trump’s corner, appearing at his victory rally just before the inauguration, and has rebuked suggestions that she has somehow caved into pressure to support him from his base. \n\n“I don’t think it was me caving. It was me rising. It was me answering something I truly felt called to do,” said Kelly. “I’m thrilled Trump won. I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won, and in the end, I had no qualms about going out there for him whatsoever.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Victoria Sunday/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesFormer Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose sexual harassment claims were a catalyst in former Fox News CEO and Chairman Roger Ailes’s resignation, said she doesn’t believe “one word” of another woman’s sexual assault claims against President Donald Trump. \n\nThe right-wing media pundit blasted author E.

This was not a mere friend dressed up for Halloween or a cast member at Disneyland but the actual actress who voiced the character in Disney's 1937 animated classic “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” \n\nIt’s hard to forget the moment you meet your idol — and learn that she is both everything, and nothing, like you expect.\n\nA young Roffman, who was always more Team Snow White than Sleeping Beauty when it came to battles for classic Disney princess dominance, was confused and starstruck. This lady didn’t look like the character she knew, but she definitely sounded like her. \n\n“When you're a kid, even though you know animation isn't real, it's still hard to imagine that there was a human actor doing that voice,” said Roffman. “To have that personification . . . and her house was such a tribute to that too . . .”\n\nThe daughter of a vocal coach/music teacher father and a mother who had been a singer for the Royal Opera Theatre of Rome, Adriana Caselotti was just 18 when she was cast as the voice of the titular zoophile soprano in what would be Disney’s first-ever full-length animated feature. The film was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film the following year. The part had such an impact on Caselotti that it became ingrained into her identity, so much so that she didn't just sound like Snow . . . she lived like her also.\n\nAdriana Caselotti's former Snow White-style home (Courtesy of Ryan Ole Hass)By the time the young Roffman and her mother went to visit Caselotti’s house in the 1990s, she was living in a custom-designed wood cabin that was made to look like the one her character stumbles upon in the movie. With its red-accented A-frame roof, footbridge and wishing well, the home echoed the dwarfs’ forest abode from the movie, but sat in the distinctly more metropolitan locale of the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. But its pièce de résistance for Roffman was Caselotti herself, who was home that afternoon and happy to entertain strangers with her cherubic singsong cadence. \n\nWhen a personality becomes your brand\n\nActors are often advised to let their character go after a production wraps – that after months or years of obsessing over this fictional being’s wants and desires it’s time to end that story.\n\nBut actors who are savvy marketers also know to give the public what it wants . . . and to use it to their advantage.\n\nAlicia Silverstone and Christian Siriano continue to make “Clueless” references and parodies on Instagram, taking advantage of the fact that Amy Heckerling's \"Emma\" reimagining is a timeless favorite. Not only does Silverstone's Cher remain iconic for both her colorful ensembles and quotable lines, but the fashion-conscious character played by Justin Walker also happens to share a name with the real-life designer. Whether they’re doing it intentionally or not, these simple nods are great ways to drum up brand awareness and name recognition for everyone involved.\n\nEven relatively minor characters can continue to thrive with savvy reminders. “The Office” actor Brian Baumgartner recently appeared on “Suits L.A.” as a version of himself who wants to “kill Kevin Malone” because he feels that his character from the long-running comedy has typecast him. In real life, Baumgartner has parlayed playing Kevin into a podcast and a few book deals.\n\nSometimes, this fictional cachet can act as a segue into other careers. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered \"The Terminator\" lines like \"I'll be back\" as part of his California gubernatorial campaign, and when he eventually won was known as The Governator. Ronald Reagan’s political slogan when he was running for president was “Win one for the Gipper,” a quote associated with his 1940 football film “Knute Rockne, All American.” And of course, during his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump invoked his “Apprentice” catchphrase, \"You’re fired,” to call out opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nBut Caselotti didn’t just reference her character in her everyday life . . . she embodied her entire ethos. \n\nThe cautionary tale of being Snow\n\nAutographed photos of Adriana Caselotti (Courtesy of Darrell Rooney)According to Richard Hollis and Brian Sibley’s “The Disney Studio Story,” Caselotti was paid $970 for 48 days of work on “Snow White.” And that could have been the end to her Disney fairy tale. But, like a prince tromping through the forest looking for a lost love, the part would always find its way back to her. Caselotti would be called upon to reprise the role in the flesh – yellow and blue gown and all – to promote a few of the subsequent releases of the film as well as other Disney films.\n\nIn another Hollis and Sibley book, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and the Making of the Classic Film,” she recounts that she once lost her luggage on one of those trips. As a result, she was stuck with nothing to wear but that dress for two weeks. This led to a humbling moment, when at 35 she was dressed in full Snow cosplay and heard an astounded little girl declare that she couldn’t possibly be the heroine because she was “so old.”\n\n“It's somewhat bittersweet to me to meet people like that, because they say, in a sense, they're frozen in time,” said Mike Bonifer, a poet and a storyteller who, in his role as a publicist for Disney in the 1980s and ‘90s, produced several specials that incorporated Caselotti. His own love for “Snow White” dates back to his mother taking him to a small-town movie theater to see it when he was five.\n\nBonifer visited Caselotti at her cottage-like home, walking through a yard decorated with animal statues. At the entryway stood a woman who still sounded like Snow White and offered him a Manhattan cocktail from a pitcher in her fridge.\n\n“I don't think I ever saw her wear the blue and yellow dress, but her voice was the blue and yellow dress,” Bonifer recalled, adding, “I suspect that when she talked to the phone company, that was the voice [she used]. And she probably got good outcomes from the phone company . . . I think we all know people in our lives like Adriana that you just go, ‘Oh, just stay the way you are. I need you to be who you are for the rest of your life.’”\n\nThis is why he uses the word “bittersweet” in reference to the actress.\n\n“I will never not love Adriana Caselotti and the memory of her voice and the memory of her she was for being Snow White,” he said. “But it's a cautionary tale to stay Snow White.”\n\nNo business like Snow business\n\nSnow White movie poster, 1937 (LMPC via Getty Images)Dealings weren’t always harmonious between Caselotti and the Mouse House either. In 1938, she and Harry Stockwell, the voice of Prince Charming, attempted to sue Disney using the argument that selling phonographic recordings of the “Snow White” soundtrack violated their contracts that restricted the use of their voices to the movie. Beyond missing out on that possible additional pay, it appears that initially, they didn't even receive any official acknowledgment of their work. Not only did the actors have to sneak into “Snow White’s” splashy Hollywood premiere – as neither made the guest list – but according to Sibley’s interviews with Caselotti, the actors weren’t even originally credited for their performances. (It would “spoil the illusion,” Walt Disney allegedly told Jack Benny when the comedian wanted Caselotti for his radio show.) This made it harder for Caselotti to get other voice work, although she does have a memorable moment during the Tin Man’s song in 1939's “The Wizard of Oz.” \n\nLater, Caselotti was deeply hurt that no one asked her to voice Snow White when the animated character appeared onstage in a filmed sequence to present an Oscar in 1993. Instead, Mary Kay Bergman voiced the part, which led Caselotti to call industry columnists after the ceremony to prove that she still sounded like her character even though she was then 77, according to Entertainment Weekly. \n\nDespite being replaced in public, no one was able to vocally match her interpretation of the part. At the Oscars, Bergman delivered her own take on the character, making her sound less childlike and more like a proper preschool teacher. “Ralph Breaks the Internet” co-writer Pamela Ribon, who also voiced Snow for that film’s epic Disney princess sleepover scene, doesn’t hit the high notes like Caselotti did. Katie Von Till, Disney’s current regular go-to voice for animated Snow, isn’t as melodic in “Lego Disney Princess: The Castle Quest.” And 2025's live-action “Snow White” doesn’t even attempt to have star Rachel Zegler take on Caselotti’s particular voice print — seemingly staying on message that it’s a new story for a new generation. \n\n“It's such a hyper-feminine style of voice-over [that] you don't hear that much these days. It's kind of an infantilized sound, like Betty Boop,” Lisa Hanawalt, an illustrator and writer known for animated series like “Tuca & Bertie” and “BoJack Horseman,” said of Caselotti’s take on Snow.\n\nCraig Gerber, the creator of the princess-focused Disney Jr. programs “Sofia the First” and “Elena of Avalor,” at first noted that “the definition of how a young princess might act and talk has changed with the times, which gives actresses greater latitude to craft a performance.” Nevertheless, he acknowledged, “Adriana did a fantastic job setting the archetype. Adriana established what a leading performance in an animated feature film would sound like and specifically defined what a Disney princess would sound like.”\n\n\"With voice acting, the actor cannot rely on their face or body language to convey the performance,” he continued. “It all has to be in the voice. So, in my experience, it’s a very specific type of acting that falls somewhere between live action and theater. It’s more exaggerated than a live action performance but not playing to the back of the house either.”\n\nIn fact, Caselotti’s voice was distinct enough that (eventually) neither Disney nor the public at large could ignore it. Caselotti was inducted as a D23 Legend, the organization’s Hall of Fame, in 1994. She also recorded a rendition of Snow’s song “I’m Wishing” that played from the wishing well at Disneyland’s Snow White Grotto.\n\nFrom Mouse House to Hollywood home\n\nSnow White clock and autographed Adriana Caselotti photo (Courtesy of Dave Woodman)Even though Disney didn't always acknowledge Caselotti, she honored her Disney role throughout her life. Her answering machine message was recorded in the style of Snow. And she told Sibley that if she saw someone whom she felt needed a pick-me-up or a special treat, she’d serenade them with the “I’m Wishing” song from the film and — long before the advent of selfies and Instagram — would give them a card that had her picture and a drawing of the character to use as proof that they’d met a real-live Disney princess.\n\nAnd much like how Snow White would bring music to the woodland creatures, Caselotti made sure her house was designed for entertaining. The communal space had an open floor plan, making it easy for guests in the kitchen to spot friends in the dining room. It was partitioned by a huge black grand piano on which was mounted a large, silver-framed autographed picture of Walt Disney himself.\n\n“She would have these opera parties every August to celebrate her older sister [and fellow singer, Louise Caselotti’s] birthday,” now retired Disney animator Darrell Rooney recalled of her fetes where friends were invited to come over and sing. ”It was a room full of just absolute characters . . . ballet dancers and behind-the-scenes people and just a Disney Animation caricaturist’s dream.”\n\nAdriana Caselotti's former Snow White-style home, sketch and modern interior (Courtesy of Ryan Ole Hass)Her entertaining reputation doesn't end there. She also had a wicked sense of humor. Rooney and his friend Dave Woodman, a fellow animator, met Caselotti after finding her information in the phone book. Woodman was happy to make the call because Rooney, a die-hard “Snow White” fan, was too bashful. But they never expected a side to Caselotti that emerged when they visited shortly after “Lady and the Tramp” star Peggy Lee successfully sued Walt Disney Co. over royalties for the video release of that film.\n\n“Adriana was afraid that, since there was nothing in the contract about videotape back when she did the voice and ‘Snow White’ was about to come out on videotape,” recalled Woodman. “She said, ‘I'm going to tell them [that] if they don't pay me, I'm going to tell everybody I slept with Grumpy.” \n\nPerhaps she made good on the threat; Caselotti later told Woodman that the matter had been handled.\n\nCaselotti died in 1997 at age 80. She was married four times and had no children. Her former home – the location where so many fans were able to walk into a Disney fairy tale – has been sold and modernized to the point that it doesn’t have as much of the whimsical set dressing from Caselotti’s day but still carries small reminders of the Disney princess' presence. Even now, inscribed in the corner of the driveway is a note declaring Caselotti as “Snow White” and her real-life best friend Gary Stark as “Prince Charming.” \n\nCement outside of Adriana Caselotti's former Snow White-style home (Courtesy of Whitney Friedlander)And her legacy lives on to this day.

Other commenters defended the White House, saying the joke was justified since the woman was arrested for trafficking fentanyl in 2020. \n\nMeet the Young Creators Behind the White House’s Social Accounts\n\nThe Daily Beast can offer some answers about one of the White House’s most closely guarded secrets: The memes are the work of a young team that includes a principal deputy communications director, a deputy communications director, and a director of digital content.\n\nThe latter is Billy McLaughlin, who put his own spin on the ICE meme when he posted it on his personal Instagram account, adding the caption “Fenty girl bye.” “Fenty” appears to be short for “fentanyl”; it is also a lingerie range sold by the singer Rihanna. McLaughlin, who took the job at 29, has now set his account to private.\n\nMcLaughlin is not listed on the official White House page but recently celebrated on LinkedIn after getting the digital content director role. He has frequently reposted the White House’s memes to his own nearly 16K followers. \n\nHe went to American University’s business school and previously worked as a social media manager, digital director, and spokesman for the National Rifle Association (NRA). \n\nThe White House declined to comment on its use of memes or McLaughlin’s involvement. \n\nThe other young MAGA men behind these viral posts are part of Trump’s Office of Communications, which lists 28-year-old Alex Pfeiffer as the principal deputy communications director. He also helped lead communications for Trump’s 2024 campaign and for super PAC MAGA Inc. after serving as editorial producer for Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight. \n\nPfeiffer also reposted the ICE meme, saying, “This is a drawing depicting a convicted fentanyl dealer being arrested by ICE. Some people on this website are more upset about a drawing than the poisoning of Americans.” \n\nHe added, “This Administration will continue to arrest and deport fentanyl dealers—even the ones that cry.” \n\nDeputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr, 32, worked on Trump’s campaign, at MAGA Inc., and as the Global Head of Marketing and Engagement for GETTR, a social media platform and microblogging site that targets American conservatives. \n\nDorr reposted the Studio Ghibli meme on his own account amid the fallout. \n\n“Disappointing that folks are more upset about this meme than they are about the fentanyl crisis,” he said on X. “People hate our President so much that they’re defending someone who contributed to the murder of Americans by selling fentanyl. The arrests will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nThe Office of Communications includes other young members like Assistant Communications Director for Special Projects Dylan Johnson, 26, who was campaign manager for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. Johnson posts his own memes on his X account, including one of Maine Gov. Janet Mills with the words “pov [point of view]: you just got wrecked by the president of the united states on live television” and a photo of the Democrat looking forlorn. \n\nCutting AI Use\n\nThe use of AI shows how the Trump aides pride themselves on being on the bleeding edge of online culture.\n\nCreators used ChatGPT, which released a new version Tuesday, to fashion an image of the ICE arrest in the style of anime house Studio Ghibli, which produced Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Ponyo.\n\nThe cartoon version of a real arrest was not the first MAGA twist on an online trend.\n\nFor Valentine’s Day, the White House posted floating heads of President Trump and border czar Tom Homan on a pink background with the words “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we’ll deport you.” \n\nThen there was the viral “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,” which featured video footage of immigration agents handcuffing a detainee and escorting him onto a plane. ASMR stands for “Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response”—the tingling feeling that occurs in response to auditory stimuli. The ASMR trend—which includes videos of whispering, tapping, and hair-brushing sounds—has existed since the early 2010s and has inspired celebrities like Margot Robbie and Cardi B to create their own videos.\n\nThe White House also seemed to scoff at immigrants when it posted a photo of Trump at a McDonald’s drive-thru to poke fun at Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and Brown University professor who was expelled from the country after visiting her home country of Lebanon. She was detained and deported even though she had a valid visa and a court order temporarily blocking her removal. The White House said the move was “commonsense security” because she had attended the funeral of an apparent Hezbollah member. \n\nA few days after the president tried to cancel congestion pricing in Manhattan in February, the White House account posted an image of Trump on a magazine cover with a crown and the text: “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is saved. LONG LIVE THE KING.” \n\nTrump has also reposted AI-generated images on his own Truth Social account, including one of him triumphantly riding a lion and Former Vice President Kamala Harris speaking to a crowd in a communist and Soviet-style political convention. And let’s not forget when the president re-posted the unhinged AI video of his vision for “Trump Gaza,” which featured bearded belly dancers and a massive gold statue of himself.","summary":"TrumpThese memes have sparked outrage from Democrats and adulation from MAGA Republicans. \n\nThe White House has pushed out a seemingly nonstop stream of viral social media posts since President Donald Trump entered office—the work of a handful of young aides who gleefully repost them on their own accounts.\n\nBut it was the most recent post on Thursday—which turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) arrest of an undocumented immigrant into a cartoon through the use of artificial intelligence—that caused an explosion of scrutiny about who is behind the posts. \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-these-white-house-aides-twist-hit-memes-into-maga-trolls/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/4FWTNLKXCJFM7AKMNWQMUTVOAM.png?smart=true&auth=1331db357aa4deaceb660f4b8b463b22f24c432c701b65045dbe44efeb29ba07&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 16:34:04","author":"Kenneal Patterson","authors":["Kenneal Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":305551196,"title":"NY Times editorial declares Democratic Party in denial about 2024 election loss, says it moved ‘too far left’","text":"The New York Times Editorial Board thinks the Democratic Party needs a serious wake-up call. In a new editorial, the liberal outlet declared that the party is in a state of denial about why it lost the presidency, as well as the Senate and the House in 2024, and said its proposed solutions for getting back on track are delusional as well. \"As comforting as these explanations may feel to Democrats, they are a form of denial that will make it harder for the Democratic Party to win future elections,\" the board said in the Saturday piece. WILL CAIN SHARES HIS TAKEAWAY ON THE ATLANTIC'S STORY ON THE TRUMP ADMIN'S 'WAR PLANS' TEXT The title of the editorial flatly declared, \"The Democrats Are in Denial About 2024.\" The Times editorial comes as the Democratic Party’s approval rating has been at one of its lowest points in modern history. According to national polls from CNN and NBC News published earlier this month, just 29% and 27% of respondents, respectively, say they view the party favorably. These represent the lowest approval numbers for the party surveyed by those outlets since the early '90s. The NYT editorial board hammered \"many party leaders\" who have \"decided that they do not need to make significant changes to their policies or their message\" following their \"comprehensive defeat.\" According to the outlet, the party has turned to a \"convenient explanation for their plight,\" namely that forces beyond its control, like \"postpandemic inflation\" hurt its chances, as well as the fact that they just need to message better. \"If Democrats could only communicate better, particularly on social media and podcasts, the party would be fine,\" the board stated, summarizing part of their denial. The outlet mentioned how new Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin insists that the party has the \"right message\" and just needs a way to \"connect it back with the voters.\" It also provided the example of former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., recently telling voters that \"90 million\" people stayed home last election and the party has to get their support. TRUMP RIPS ‘LOSER’ TIM WALZ FOR HURTING DEMS IN 2024 ELECTION It noted Walz’s point that they don’t need to try courting people who voted for President Donald Trump. The board followed up by citing each of those examples as evidence the party is in denial, and warned that the whole country, even conservatives should be concerned about it. \"The country needs two healthy political parties. It especially needs a healthy Democratic Party, given Mr. Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party and his draconian behavior. Restraining him — and any successors who continue his policies — depends on Democrats taking an honest look at their problems.\" The board admitted there is some truth to inflation hurting the incumbent party in the U.S., as it did in other countries irrespective of political parties. \"Whether on the political right or left, ruling parties lost power in the United States, Brazil, Britain, Germany and Italy,\" it wrote. Still, the board mentioned that \"incumbent parties managed to win re-election, including in Denmark, France, India, Japan, Mexico and Spain. A healthier Democratic Party could have joined them last year.\" DEM CANDIDATE CAUGHT ON CAMERA APPLAUDING NOTORIOUS ANTISEMITE'S VIOLENT RHETORIC: 'YOU BREAK HIS NECK' Inflation couldn’t have been the only policy point that crushed the party. The Times editorial pointed out how \"voters also trusted Republicans more than Democrats on immigration, crime, government spending, global trade and foreign policy.\" It then debunked Walz’s voter turnout point, saying, \"Nonvoters appear to have favored Mr. Trump by an even wider margin than voters.\" After hammering the Democratic Party, the board offered advice on how it can rise from the defeat, beginning with \"more rigorous and less wishful reflection.\" It then gave specific steps for regaining voters’ trust, the first one being, \"they should admit that their party mishandled Mr. Biden’s age.\" \"Second, Democrats should recognize that the party moved too far left on social issues after Barack Obama left office in 2017,\" it said, adding that the third step is that \"the party has to offer new ideas.\" The board said former Vice President Kamala Harris \"failed\" to offer any new ideas in her presidential bid, and that \"few Democrats are doing so today.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"The New York Times Editorial Board accused the Democratic Party of being in &quot;denial&quot; over the poor state it&apos;s in, and gave advice for leaders to get the party back on track.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ny-times-editorial-declares-democratic-party-denial-about-2024-election-loss-says-moved-too-far-left","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/931/523/jeffries-schumer-split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 16:20:12","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":305547404,"title":"Poll reveals Donald Trump would defeat George Clooney in 2028 matchup as speculation about actor’s political future grows","text":"A new Democracy Institute poll reveals Donald Trump leading George Clooney 50% to 46% in a hypothetical 2028 presidential matchup, with 4% undecided. The survey of 1,300 likely voters, conducted March 25–26 (margin of error ±3%), highlights the political divide between the two celebrities—Trump, a polarizing GOP figure, and Clooney, a longtime Democratic donor and critic. While Clooney hasn’t declared candidacy, speculation about his run has grown as Democrats grapple with a post-Biden direction. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly targeted the actor on social media, dismissing him as a “failed political pundit” and accusing him of flip-flopping on support for Kamala Harris. Clooney’s Political Credentials Under FireTrump’s attacks on Clooney intensified after the actor publicly criticized the former president’s policies and endorsed Biden in 2020. On Truth Social, Trump accused Clooney of abandoning Biden post-debate and later “pushing all out for Kamala” under “orders from the Obama camp,” claims Clooney’s team has not addressed. The poll underscores Trump’s enduring base loyalty but also hints at Clooney’s crossover appeal, despite his Hollywood pedigree. Analysts note the actor’s humanitarian work and diplomatic connections could offset critiques of his political inexperience—a narrative Democrats might leverage to counter Trump’s celebrity-driven campaign style. Why a Celebrity Matchup MattersThe hypothetical race reflects a broader trend of celebrity influence in U.S. politics. Trump’s 2016 victory proved star power could override traditional political resumes, and Clooney’s rumored bid tests whether Democrats can replicate that playbook. However, Clooney faces skepticism from voters wary of “elite” candidates, while Trump’s legal battles and divisive rhetoric risk alienating moderates. The poll’s tight margin suggests name recognition alone won’t decide the race, with policy and trust playing pivotal roles. For now, the 2028 field remains fluid, but the Trump-Clooney dynamic offers a preview of how personality-driven politics could dominate the next election cycle. FAQs:Is George Clooney actually running for president?No, Clooney hasn’t announced a campaign, but rumors persist as Democrats seek a high-profile candidate to counter Trump’s celebrity appeal. Why is this poll significant?It tests whether Trump’s base remains solid and if Democrats can harness star power to attract swing voters, signaling shifting strategies for 2028.","summary":"A new poll shows Trump narrowly leading Clooney in a hypothetical 2028 presidential race, spotlighting celebrity influence in politics.

They wouldn’t have told you at the time.”\n\nLaRosa didn’t want to say the reporters were co-conspirators, but it’s impossible to see all of their obsequious cooperation with Team Biden and think that word is inappropriate.\n\nUygur asked how they bullied the press, and LaRosa said Joe’s handlers insisted they had to pre-approve the quotes used in stories. That’s helping shape the story, not something an “independent journalist” would accept.\n\nLaRosa added, “You saw them get caught trying to script questions to radio reporters” last summer.\n\nThey didn’t just “try.” The radio hosts the Bidenites selected were happy to use the pre-scripted questions.\n\nLaRosa added, “It was very reminiscent to me of being on the campaign in 2020, where these young press staffers in these states like New Hampshire, or Iowa, or Nevada, they were sort of like dog trained to make the questions conditional for interviews.” Questions had to be submitted for approval.\n\nOn “Dr.” Jill Biden’s team, LaRosa said, he told staffers it was “unethical” to require questions before granting access, but they replied it’s what Team Joe (or “the boys’ team”) required. “These young kids are really taught to make that a part of their sort of pre-pre-screening for interviews.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s amazing to me that no one in the press complained about it,” mused Uygur. The press corps was stuffed with pushovers, from the same leftist press outlets who screamed hostile, unscreened questions at Trump and called it “strengthening democracy.”\n\nUygur wondered: “Did the press ever push back? We couldn’t see the press pushing back at all, until the debate (fiasco).” This underlined how much the press is a megaphone for Democrats, and when the Donkey Party breaks down into two sides, the press will then present both sides.\n\nLaRosa thought maybe the local reporters would be less intimidated by a national campaign. “Like why didn’t any of these reporters even in New Hampshire, and some of these small town papers or local news, like why didn’t anybody ever say anything (about the pre-screening)? I thought it was so weird at the time.”\n\nLaRosa said Team Biden were “operating out of a bunker every day,” and he never understood it because “there was so much goodwill that he had with the media” who couldn’t stand Trump. He said the Bidenites were suspicious of all journalists. Or let’s guess they were scared about whatever might tumble unscripted out of Biden’s mouth.\n\nThen came another interesting theme, with LaRosa saying Donald Trump manipulates the media coverage by energetically granting so much access that he becomes the primary source, that he’s “good copy.” Biden’s team made their leader sound tightly scripted and designed to avoid making any waves, so nothing sounded authentic.\n\nThe national media elitists were never independent enough to stand up for its own prerogatives with Biden or Kamala Harris. These cowardly pols could avoid interviews as aggressively as they desired, and there was no pushback from their supposed foes.\n\nSo we roll our eyes when journalists promote themselves as reliable professionals who are essential to a functioning government. They aren’t the ones who will be “holding government accountable” when it’s the government they all picked on Election Day.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. “The Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,” Kendi argued, and “also one of the heartbeats” of the nation at large.Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.“We do not run from or erase our history simply because we don’t like it,” she said in a statement. “We embrace the history of our country – the good, the bad, and the ugly.”The African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation’s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.RELATED STORY | Trump executive order on Smithsonian targets funding to programs with 'improper ideology'Former NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups — enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans — are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.“Attempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much ... and the place that we’ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,” he said.And, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.“I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.“I know President Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall,” Trump continued. “I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.”Trump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.He ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled “woke” culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of “hating our country.”Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges — public and private — that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Trump hosts Black History Month celebration amid DEI rollbacksThe Defense Department, at one point, temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd's killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies' celebrations of Black History Month, and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools.Civil rights advocates and historians expressed concern about a chilling effect across other institutions that study Black history.Kendi noted that many museums and educational centers across the country — such as San Francisco’s Museum of the African Diaspora, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration in Montgomery, Alabama, and the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina — exist with little to no federal or other governmental funding sources. Some already are struggling to keep their doors open.“To me, that’s part of the plan, to starve these institutions that are already starving of resources so that the only institutions that are telling America’s history are actually only telling political propaganda,” Kendi said.","summary":"Critics say Trump's order targeting the Smithsonian Institution downplays how race, racism and Black Americans themselves have shaped the nation’s story.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/critics-see-trump-attacks-on-the-black-smithsonian-as-an-effort-to-sanitize-racism-in-us-history","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10ef74c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F94%2F8c7d22e64d8ab77f862a66486713%2Fap25087632486574.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 14:45:20","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":305526464,"title":"WATCH: Dems struggle to name the leader of the Democratic Party","text":"Top voices in the Democratic Party, as well as average Democratic voters, have struggled to answer who the party's leader is when asked during interviews.

Just a little.\n\nJersey has a big national spotlight shining on all of it because only one other state — Virginia — is holding a governor’s contest this year. That means we’re a a litmus test for how voters view the first 10 months of Trump’s second term. \n\nThe massive field for the June 10 primary was finalized Monday. Republican truck driver turned former lawmaker Ed Durr was the only one to drop out. Eleven others — six Democrats, five Republicans — will battle it out over the next 10 weeks. \n\nWith TV ads starting to spread, here’s my breakdown of 2025: New Jersey Gubernatorial Madness, based on what I’m hearing from sources ...\n\nRAS BARAKA, Newark mayor\n\nSuperpowers: Leads Jersey’s largest city and is vying to become the first Black governor in a diverse state ... Has left-leaning policies that appeal to progressive primary voters and has aggressively attacked Trump — especially on immigration — at a time when polls show Democrats want their party to fight back harder ... Proved in the first debate he’s good with words (after all, he’s the son of poet Amiri Baraka) ... It’s all helped him unexpectedly emerge as one of the primary’s top two contenders. \n\nKryptonite: Another Essex County candidate, Mikie Sherrill, has the backing — and money — of establishment Democrats ... While Democrats privately see Baraka as the one who could draw the most votes away from her, their fear is Baraka is too far-left to win a largely moderate state in November.\n\nSTEVE FULOP, Jersey City mayor\n\nSuperpowers: First candidate out of the gate and running an anti-establishment campaign in the vein of Andy Kim's Senate victory last year ... Active on social media and the town hall circuit ... Has rolled out a string of detailed policy positions and fielded his own slate of Assembly candidates, who have a real shot now that the line is kaput ... Has raised $3 million so far ... Would be Jersey’s first Jewish governor ... Considered a real surprise not to be counted out in rage-against-the-machine era of politics.\n\nKryptonite: Can he steal enough of the progressive lane to box out Baraka, or will they split the vote? ... Has also made enough enemies among top Democrats who could work overtime to stunt him. And some view his outsider stances as a cynical ploy from a career politician ... Social media excitement doesn’t always equal votes.\n\nJOSH GOTTHEIMER, U.S. Representative from Bergen County\n\nSuperpowers: Raises more money than God ($3 million so far and counting), which he’s using to plaster the region with TV ads. That means a lot in a state sandwiched between New York and Philly, with no media market of its own ... He’s a Democrat promising to cut your taxes in a tough economy ... Would be Jersey’s first Jewish governor.\n\nKryptonite: Insiders were expecting this to be a Congress-colored race between him and Sherrill, but Gottheimer hasn’t taken off in polls ... Many progressives don’t like him, which could be a dagger in the primary ... Critics doubt the validity of his tax-cut plan. \n\nMIKIE SHERRILL, U.S. Representative from Essex County\n\nSuperpowers: The lone woman in the race, aiming to become only the second female to become Jersey’s governor … Considered the primary’s frontrunner, with the biggest array of the state’s powerful Dems supporting her and the majority of county party endorsements ... Insiders like her bullet points in a general election: former Navy helicopter pilot, former federal prosecutor, mother of four ... Hasn’t even started putting out TV ads yet.\n\nKryptonite: Her early-favorite status isn’t runaway, with Baraka and Fulop at her back … As we learned from Tammy Murphy last year, being the establishment pick can backfire badly in this climate. And how much do those endorsements even matter without the line? ... Some insiders fear GOP critics could attack her as Murphy administration part 2, noting players in the governor’s orbit are also in hers ... She’s begun to go after Trump more, though critics worry she’s too moderate for the base or even too stilted to truly catch fire.\n\nSEAN SPILLER, president of the New Jersey Education Association teacher’s union, ex Montclair mayor\n\nSuperpowers: Outside money. Lots of it (at least $35 million worth) from an independent expenditure group that receives funding from the political fundraising arm of his employer, the state’s largest teacher’s union, which endorsed him. His unusual campaign has no staff, but that money has paid for the many pro-Spiller billboards, mailers, and TV ads you have may seen and helped him show up higher than expected in polls ... The very powerful NJEA will work to get out the vote … Born in Jamaica, he would be the state’s first Black governor ... Focuses on education and pitches himself as outsider voice for working families.\n\nKryptonite: Still has low name ID, which is why you’re seeing all those ads ... Some teachers and good-government advocates aren’t happy his campaign appears to be boosted by union dues ... In a twist, he didn’t qualify for the primary debate stage under the state’s matching funds program because outside groups and not his campaign are raising the money.\n\nSTEVE SWEENEY, former state Senate president\n\nSuperpowers: Once one of state’s most powerful elected officials until he was unexpectedly toppled by Ed Durr, then an unknown truck driver, four years ago. Ironically may have gotten more name ID because of it ... Running as a moderate, even conservative-leaning Democrat on immigration and taxes, and some Republicans see him as the toughest general-election opponent ... Lone Democrat from South Jersey in the race, with the most county party endorsements below Trenton, which could make him a threat in a splintered primary ... Top ally and benefactor, powerbroker George Norcross, is no longer under indictment.\n\nKryptonite: His 2021 loss was historic and stripped him of his power … Still disliked by many public-worker unions and progressive Democrats after reworking pensions and other policies in collaboration with Chris Christie … The only Dem in the race with net-negative favorability marks in a recent poll ... South Jersey’s voter rolls aren’t as robust as the north’s.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nJUSTIN BARBERA, contractor\n\nSuperpowers: Impressively managed to file 2,817 petition signatures to run, even after the state upped the requirement this year from 1,000 to 2,500.\n\nKryptonite: Nobody knows who he is, other than that he’s a Trump-supporting, education-focused contractor from Burlington County who ran unsuccessfully as an independent last year for Andy Kim’s old seat in the House ... We get a pie-in-the-sky candidate like this every cycle. … Did not raise enough money to qualify for the debates.\n\nJON BRAMNICK, state senator from Union County\n\nSuperpowers: Centrist who criticizes Trump in a blue-leaning state. Gov. Murphy recently told me Bramnick is a vintage Jersey Republican that Democrats would least want to face this fall ... His law firm’s billboard dot Jersey highways and he’s spent years moonlighting as a standup comic (no joke) ... Would be Jersey’s first Jewish governor.\n\nKryptonite: Likely a tough go getting to the general election as a moderate with the growing, Trump-loving Republican base these days, unless the president’s popularity really takes a nosedive. The GOP primary has become a knife fight over loyalty to Trump, especially after his surprising showing in Jersey last year ... So far, hasn’t registered high up in public-opinion polls.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI, ex-state Assemblyman from Somerset County\n\nSuperpowers: Has spent years building name recognition. A third time running for gov could be the charm after coming just 3 points away from unseating Murphy in 2021 … A moderate, fiscally focused lawmaker during his time in Trenton, he’s upped his praise of Trump in recent years, which could help him with the GOP base. Even posed for a photo with Trump during a meeting in Bedminster last weekend ... Has led easily in most polls so far. Many Republican insiders (and Democrats) say this is his primary — and maybe even general election — to lose.\n\nKryptonite: Already been bashed by the right as an establishment pick who called Trump a “charlatan” 10 years ago. They also note he has already lost twice ... If Trump endorses his closest opponent, Bill Spadea, it could end his frontrunner status ... Recent embrace and photo-op with Trump could come back to haunt him in the general if the president keeps slipping in polls here.\n\nMARIO KRANJAC, former mayor of Englewood Cliffs\n\nSuperpowers: A conservative who casts himself as the one most aligned with the president. Though The Star-Ledger once derided him as a “Trumpy mayor,” he now wears that badge with pride.\n\nKryptonite: Little name ID. He also filed only 35 more signatures than the 2,500 required to get on the ballot. Spadea, another Trump-centric candidate, is challenging his petitions. Kranjac’s team said it’s still waiting for more signatures to be approved. Spadea’s camp sees Kranjac as a an attempt to siphon votes away from Spadea. ... Did not raise enough money to qualify for the debates.\n\nBILL SPADEA, former radio host for NJ 101.5-FM\n\nSuperpowers: A one-time congressional candidate and TV personality who spent a decade hosting a morning drive-time show on the state’s largest radio station. Gave him a mighty big megaphone to attract conservative primary voters ... Pitching himself as an unapologetic Trump backer and grassroots outsider who’d upend the system. The president was a guest on his show last year and thanked Spadea for his support while chiding chief rival Ciattarelli ... Has polled a distant second so far, but a Trump endorsement could catapult him.\n\nKryptonite: Left his radio show in January ... Also criticized Trump in the past, calling his first term a failure. I’m told Ciattarelli allies have let the president know that ... Many Republican insiders say he’d be kiss of death for the general election, say his controversial views on issues such as COVID-19 and the 2020 election are too far-right.\n\nTrump’s Bedminster club was ground zero this weekend for the Republican side of the governor’s race. The president met with the top two contenders, Jack Ciattarelli and Bill Spadea — and the backstory is high drama. I recently reported about the backroom brawl over Trump’s endorsement, with Spadea jockeying for it and Ciattarelli hoping at least Trump stays neutral. Ciattarelli allies had been working on a meeting with the president, and they jumped when they learned Trump would be at his club Friday for the first time since returning to office. Issue was: Ciattarelli was scheduled to be at the NJ GOP Summit in Atlantic City that day. And have you ever seen the rush-hour traffic on 287? So the campaign, sources say, chartered a helicopter to ferry Ciattarelli from A.C. He met briefly with Trump (and Elon Musk) over dinner, snapped a photo with him, and the president gave him the green light to post it on social media, I’m told. Jersey Twitter caught fire. Two days later, word broke that Spadea also met with Trump, on Saturday in a restaurant at the club. So far, no pictures of that. Spadea’s camp said they want to keep that conversation private. Ciattarelli’s camp also declined comment. Whether an endorsement will come for either side? “Who knows,” one GOP operative said. The line I keep hearing: Those who claim to know Trump’s plans really don’t know Trump. The Trump intrigue didn’t stop there. Spadea nabbed the endorsement of Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser. Ciattarelli got the backing of state Sens. Joe Pennachio and Mike Testa, who co-ran Trump’s 2020 campaign in Jersey. Also, one of Spadea’s former colleagues at New Jersey 101.5 radio, host Jeff Deminski, said on air Ciattarelli “would be my choice,” with Jon Bramnick coming in second. Then there’s Ed Durr, who said in a statement he ended his campaign in part so Spadea could have the resources to “carry a conservative message to November.” Durr later denied endorsing Spadea. Two days later, he appeared at Spadea’s birthday bash. Trump made more Jersey news this week, naming his former defense attorney and White House counselor Alina Habba as the state’s interim U.S. attorney (or top federal prosecutor). Trump fans celebrated, while Democrats were uneasy because Habba — a Summit native with a law office near Trump’s Bedminster club — has promised revenge on Trump’s enemies. Critics also pointed to allegations she tried to silence a sexual harassment victim and her praise of the controversial Andrew Tate. Another Jersey Republican was interested in the job: Mike Testa. But I’ve heard the a pro-Trump state senator was hurt by the fact he worked last year on the U.S. Senate campaign of Curtis Bashaw, who beat Trump-backed candidate — and now White House employee — Christine Serrano Glassner in the GOP primary. Testa told me U.S. attorney is a “Godfather” job — one you “can’t refuse.” Still, he said he’s “thrilled” for Habba. “I think she’s a solid pick.”“Affordability” continues to be a catchword for Democratic candidates for governor after last year’s dour election results. Mikie Sherrill rolled out her campaign’s first major policy plan, aiming to make housing, energy, health care, taxes, child care, and food less costly in the state. “For far too long, career politicians have promised to do something about it, but nothing seems to change in New Jersey,” Sherrill said. At the same time, Josh Gottheimer told me and my colleague Steven Rodas that he would bring back paper bags if elected governor, helping save people money and trouble. And Steve Sweeney is pledging no new taxes.Two of Jersey’s three Republican congressmen, Jeff Van Drew and Tom Kean Jr., were put “On Notice” by EMILY’s List, a national group that aims to elect women candidates and protect abortion rights. Their seats are among the 46 the group has targeted to flip in next year’s mid-term elections, when Democrats will try to take back the House. Meanwhile, Kean hosted a closely watched telephone town hall just as Republican members of Congress have been avoiding public forums because of early Trump backlash. Kean talked several topics — including the fear of Medicaid cuts — but there were no live questions. And thus no real fireworks.The state’s voter turnout last year was its lowest-ever for a presidential election. Just ask any Democrat about the apathy’s affect on Kamala Harris. In steps the Million Voters Project, a nonpartisan group of advocates aiming to figure out what happened and draw more voters to the polls. “We actually have an opportunity to change corruption and makes sure politics works or us and not for special interests,” spokesman Anthony Campisi said. They’re launching canvassing efforts this week in Newark.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nSome Jersey stories in the news: \n\nCongrats to my NJ Advance Media colleagues and friends Spencer Kent and Riley Yates for winning the Toner Prize, a national political reporting award, for their “Project Extreme” series on far-right politics seeping into blue Jersey.A majority of Jerseyans aren’t thrilled with Trump’s performance so far and Democrats aren’t happy with their members in Congress, according to a new Stockton University poll.U.S. Sen.

They happen to be the same person. Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th commander-in-chief, was born in Caldwell in 1837. You can still visit his birthplace, which doubles as a museum. His political career actually blossomed in New York, where he was mayor of Buffalo before his time in the White House. But after his presidency, he went back to Jersey, where he was a trustee of Princeton University. He died in Princeton in 1907 and has been buried there since. Another fun fact: Former Vice President Aaron Burr — yes, that guy — also rests at Princeton Cemetery. But his grave is less ornate. \n\nAbout this newsletter\n\nWelcome to What Makes Jersey Run, a weekly newsletter for anyone interested in the always-lively world of Jersey politics and America’s most important governor’s race in 2025.

It seems like the creepy billionaire’s insemination obsession has rubbed off on Trump: the legally defined sexual predator is now calling himself “the fertilization president”.\n\nTrump proudly unveiled this new nickname for himself on Wednesday at a White House event celebrating Women’s History Month. Someone should probably report this event to the DEI police, by the way, because I am pretty sure the president himself made acknowledging women’s history verboten. Earlier this year, for example, it was reported that a number of federal agencies were banning celebrations related to Martin Luther King Jr Day, Black History Month, Women’s History Month and other “special observances” because they didn’t want to fall foul of Trump’s wide-ranging executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThis particular event, however, appears to have been permitted because the curated crowd consisted of the sort of women Trump approves of: very white, and very deferential. The White House has uploaded a number of videos of the attenders gazing adoringly at Trump – who once vowed to be a protector of women “whether the women like it or not” – as he rambled on.\n\n“We’re going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too, the women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we’re talking about. It’s going to be, it’s going to be great,” Trump told the crowd. When the crowd started laughing appreciatively, Trump said “fertilization” again, before adding: “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president, that’s not bad, that’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse. Actually, I like it, right? I like it.”\n\nTo be clear: a cat didn’t accidentally walk over my keyboard while I was writing this. This is a precise transcription of what Trump said. The man has always been alarmingly incoherent – and yet with much of this, the press still seems intent on editing his wild ramblings into something that makes them seem more normal. Poynter has termed this “sanewashing”.\n\nI’m afraid I can’t seem to find what was in the goody bags that were given out at the Women’s History Month event. (Elon Musk’s phone number, perhaps?) Nor can I tell you exactly what was going through Trump’s head as he was waxing lyrical about fertilization – amid digressions about the price of eggs and gas – at an event meant to celebrate women’s achievements. But, to put the fertilization remarks in a little more context, he brought them up after boasting that he’d signed an executive order expanding access to (often very expensive) fertility treatments like IVF.\n\nThis boast is technically true: in February, Trump signed an executive order directing the domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the costs for accessing IVF. However, this was really nothing more than a PR move. As the Guardian’s Carter Sherman noted at the time: “[T]he lack of direct action on IVF in Trump’s … order is striking, especially in the context of Trump’s other executive orders, which have issued sweeping – and potentially illegal – mandates … The order does not, for example, mandate private employers cover IVF in the way that they are required to cover contraception.”\n\nHis (totally meaningless) executive order was meant to fulfil promises Trump had made on the campaign trail, where – in a brazen attempt to appeal to female voters – he supported making IVF more affordable. He also declared himself the “father of IVF” last October, while also admitting he’d only just found out what the procedure was. During, his debate with Kamala Harris, he similarly proclaimed he had “been a leader on IVF, which is fertilization”.\n\nWill Trump go any further than giving himself weird nicknames, and actually do something meaningful to increase access to IVF? Possibly. On the one hand, he has to tread carefully around IVF because it’s a sensitive topic for many anti-abortion zealots who believe frozen embryos should be legally considered children, and who have been pushing to severely curtail access to the procedure. On the other hand, however, Trump does have Musk, one of the world’s most passionate pro-natalists, whispering in his ear about how the US needs more babies.\n\nIf Trump does make IVF more accessible, it certainly won’t be more accessible for everyone. Just look at Viktor Orbán’s Hungary – a rightwing autocracy that many conservatives in the US look to as a blueprint for what they want to achieve at home – and the pro-natalist policies there. Hungary has a state-run IVF system and offers generous fertility and parental benefits to a certain subset of people. As Mother Jones has explained: “[T]he closer you look at Hungary’s eligibility requirements for family benefits, the more clearly you see the kind of babies Orbán wants to populate his boom: not just Hungarian nationals, but children from married, heterosexual, middle-income and up Hungarian nationals with stay-at-home moms.”\n\nMy wife and I spent a huge amount of money on fertility treatments to have our child and I know a lot of people who have made enormous financial sacrifices to access IVF. Ordinarily, I’d cheer on any attempts to broaden access to it. But, amid his wider war on reproductive rights, Trump’s declaration that he’s the “fertilization president” feels menacing. Women, it seems Trump is going to protect you, whether you like it or not! And the fertilization president is going to ensure you have more babies, whether you like it or not.\n\nThe Trump administration pulls funding from a study to protect pregnant women from domestic violence\n\nIt was characterized as a “DEI study”, apparently.\n\nProposal to automatically give babies mother’s surname ignites row in Italy\n\nDario Franceschini, a former culture minister from the centre-left Democratic party, has said such a law would “right a historic wrong”. Predictably, the proposal has not gone down well.\n\nThe misogynist agenda of ‘Maha moms’\n\nAmanda Marcotte looks at how the Make America Healthy Again movement is actually designed to push women out of the workforce and back into the kitchen.\n\nFlorida bill to allow teens to work overnight hours on school days moves forward\n\nLooks like the US is making child labour great again.\n\nDaily Wire host: ‘Statistically, 100% of people who have succeeded in business have been men’\n\nThis is a quote from Michael Knowles, who clearly does not Knowles what he is talking about.\n\nNew mums are being ‘strongly encouraged’ to take regular exercise and get more sleep\n\n“Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,” says the Guardian’s Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett.\n\nMasked Ice agents detain Tufts graduate student\n\nThe video of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national on a valid F-1 student visa, getting taken by Ice is terrifying.

It seems to be that she’s a Muslim woman who co-wrote an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper criticizing the university’s response to Israel’s attacks on Gaza and Palestinians. The US government has made it very clear that it will go to extreme lengths to police speech about Israel.\n\nKids under fire: an investigation into Israeli soldiers shooting children\n\nDoctors, including the US surgeon Mark Perlmutter, have been saying for a year that Israeli snipers are deliberately targeting children in Gaza. Now Al Jazeera has a devastating new documentary investigating the issue. I wish I had some hope that it might make a difference but mass Palestinian death and suffering has been normalized. Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid into Gaza over the last few weeks, for example, and roughly 1 million kids are without basic necessities yet again.\n\nThe week in pawtriarchy\n\nI suggest you don’t look up why they are there (the answer is grim) but season 2 of the Apple TV series Severance features a lot of goats. According to Gwendoline Christie, they were chaotic little divas on set. “Goats don’t care about being on television,” she quipped to People. “Goats also have an incredible self-confidence. They feel comfortable to eat clothes whilst you’re wearing them.” Never work with children or animals, they say. And absolutely never work with kids.","summary":"Trump’s executive order supposedly expanding IVF access offered nothing concrete beyond a weird nickname for himself\n\nDonald Trump has clearly been spending far too much time with Elon-I-offer-my-sperm-to-everyone-who-crosses-my-path-Musk.

Smirnov’s Glavprodukt was the first American-owned company to be targeted, and is famous across the motherland for its canned soups, vegetables, fish, and meat.\n\nAnd it was a key part of Smirnov’s business empire, which includes a $20 million, 14,000-square foot, Tuscan-style mansion once rented by Paris Hilton in tony Beverly Park in Los Angeles.\n\nThings changed in October last year, when three strangers arrived at its headquarters to take charge.\n\nThey were sent on Putin’s orders. His decree ordered that Glavprodukt and other assets owned by Smirnov’s American company Universal Beverage be put under “temporary” Russian management.\n\nSince then, he said, the Moscow-based company — which employed 1,000 workers across three factories — had begun taking losses for the first time. Overall, he estimates the company has lost as much as 30 percent of its value.\n\n“We basically have this company being destroyed on a daily basis,” said Smirnov, describing how key staffers have been fired for not being loyal enough.\n\nIn the past month, the country’s prosecutor general accused him of illegally syphoning millions of dollars to the US and of joining with Washington in seeking the “strategic defeat” of Russia. He supplied partially obscured photos of himself to The Post, saying he now fears for his and his family’s safety.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a court ordered the seizure of cash and assets connected to Glavprodukt. Russian prosecutors claimed he had been illegally sending dividends from the business to the U.S.\n\nIt was all part of a pressure campaign, said Smirnov, to force him to sell at a knock-down price.\n\n“I put 26 years of my life into that … building this company from scratch,” said Smirnov. \n\n“And I have 1,000 people, some of them were with me for 20 plus years. It’s like a family.”\n\nHe said the timing of the initial seizure was no coincidence, weeks before last year’s election.\n\n“If Kamala Harris had won the election I don’t think me, my company, or any other American business in Russia would have a chance, a single chance, to be saved,” he said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has said that Glavprodukt would be part of any conversation about resetting U.S.-Russia relations.\n\n“There are opportunities to work together, and obviously that’s going to entail talking about not just Russian assets that have been seized by – by the Europeans or the U.S. or what have you, but also American companies that have been hurt,” he said.\n\nBut Smirnov fears his company will no longer exist by then. He wants Trump to intervene and send a clear message to Moscow that American-owned businesses are off limits. \n\n“I am asking President Trump to get involved and save my company, save all other American companies,” he said.","summary":"An American businessman is urging President Trump to help save his $200 million canned food empire after Russian authorities seized control -- and now the assets -- of his company.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/world-news/businessman-asking-trump-to-save-his-200-million-canned-food-empire/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/101296273.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G6ZAVR8n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-29 12:48:19","author":"Bill Clough","authors":["Bill Clough"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":305501886,"title":"Trump govt revokes security clearances for Biden, Harris, Clinton, others","text":"Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has confirmed the revocation of security clearances for former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton and other political opponents.

Gavin Newsom’s drive toward the political center has hit a jarring speed bump: He’s spending way over budget on health care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nLet’s put this in perspective:\n\nNewsom presumably has been repositioning himself to run for president in 2028 — less as a wild-eyed California liberal and more like a sensible moderate who can attract votes in swing states.\n\nHe wants, at the least, to be regarded and respected nationally as a top-tier presidential prospect.\n\nBut the two biggest policy issues Democrats whiffed on last year were inflation — caused partly by federal government overspending — and an unsecured southern border that allowed countless immigrants to stream into the country illegally. MAGA Republicans said that one attraction for migrants was freebie benefits in liberal states such as California.\n\n“Kamala Rolls Out Red Carpet for Illegals” was the banner on one Donald Trump campaign piece attacking Democrat Kamala Harris, whose vulnerable California political roots ran deep.\n\nNewsom, in fact, bragged that California was a national trailblazer by becoming the first state to offer government health care to all low-income people, regardless of their immigrant status.\n\nSo one can only speculate how this would play with purple state voters across America — Newsom breaking the bank on health care for people living here illegally. My speculation: It’d play like a ballplayer being caught off base.\n\nIt would fit nicely into many Americans’ stereotype of a modern California governor: the leader of a radical, lefty, out-of-control state.\n\nOf course, Newsom could be rescued politically by President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress if they foolishly whack Medicaid health care for the poor and scale back Medicare for seniors in order to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. That could overshadow Newsom’s overspending on Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants.\n\nA failure to plan\n\nMedi-Cal is our version of federal Medicaid. It provides health care for roughly 15 million Californians, 38% of the state’s population and half the children.\n\nCalifornia began phasing in Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants 10 years ago when then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation covering children. Under Newsom, seniors were the next to gain coverage. And undocumented people of all ages — an estimated 1.8 million — were included last year.\n\nIt shouldn’t be stunning that the state government failed to plan adequately for the Medi-Cal expansion. Budget writers last June pegged the cost at $6.4 billion. By January, overall Medi-Cal costs had greatly exceeded the initial projection, prompting Newsom to borrow $3.4 billion to pay bills through this month.\n\nRecently, the governor asked the Legislature for an additional $2.8 billion to cover Medi-Cal spending through June. Of the total $6.2 billion in extra costs, the administration has refused to make public how much is for undocumented health care.\n\nI suspect the governor — and probably the Legislature — cooked the numbers last year to show a “balanced” budget on paper. Shock, shock. That’s an age-old custom in the state Capitol.\n\nNext year’s budget\n\nSo, Newsom and the Legislature face a tough task crafting a budget for the next fiscal year that begins July 1.\n\nThey could cut Medi-Cal services for all beneficiaries. Or they could reduce care just for undocumented immigrants — maybe lop them off the plan entirely. That doesn’t seem like anything Democrats would embrace.\n\nThey could tighten eligibility, reducing the number of beneficiaries. They could add co-pays. Or pare back provider reimbursement rates — already so low that many physicians refuse to accept Medi-Cal patients. Forget it.\n\nThey could cut other state programs to help pay for Medi-Cal — perhaps a logical move, but it would evoke screams.\n\nOr they could raise taxes. A nonstarter.\n\nThere are always budgeting gimmicks — borrowing, backfilling from other funds, kicking the can down the road.\n\nWhat they’ll most likely do: Recook the numbers.\n\nMedi-Cal funding is particularly problematic because of the way it works. The federal government matches state spending for legal residents, but not for undocumented people except in emergencies. The state is mostly on its own providing care for undocumented patients.\n\nPaying for everyone else — roughly 13 million people — Newsom and the Legislature now are at the mercy of Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nMoving toward the center, Newsom avoided lots of political grief last year by vetoing three bills the Legislature passed to help undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe most contentious would have allowed them to apply for interest-free home loans of up to $150,000 if they were first-time homebuyers. There wasn’t even enough money in the existing pot to aid citizens, Newsom noted in his veto message.\n\nA second vetoed bill would have paved the way for undocumented workers to receive unemployment benefits. A third would have required public universities and community colleges to hire undocumented students for campus jobs.\n\nRight now, Trump and Congress could whack Medicaid and give Newsom a solid rationale for cutting way back on health care for undocumented Californians. That would be lousy, hurtful policy.\n\nBut whatever happens, hopefully the governor will use uncooked numbers this time.\n\nGeorge Skelton is a Los Angeles Times columnist. ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Disney’s cultural cache has taken a major hit within the last five years as it has picked high-stakes political fights with state governments, fired stars for outspoken conservative beliefs, and injected sexual and gender-identity themes into several of its family-targeted films. Here are four more controversies in addition to Disney’s rocky \"Snow White\" premiere that have soured many people on the long-running studio. CRITICS SLAM ‘SNOW WHITE’ AS FILM ON TRACK TO BE LOWEST DISNEY LIVE-ACTION REMAKE IN HISTORY Disney axes popular ‘Star Wars’ star over politics The entertainment behemoth fired actress Gina Carano from its flagship Disney+ Star Wars series, \"The Mandalorian,\" in 2021 after she expressed her political views on social media. Carano, who played mercenary character Cara Dune in the series, was let go after the second season of the show after she generated social media outrage with her post comparing the divided political environment in America at the time to Nazi Germany. Carano was one of the show’s stand-out performers, alongside series lead Pedro Pascal. With Disney’s decision, the actress did not return for season three of the show. Despite some social media users being displeased with her post, others were outraged on her behalf, arguing that the studio fired her simply because her posts leaned more conservative. When word got out about the firing, \"CancelDisneyPlus\" began trending on social media, with some users providing proof they had canceled their Disney+ streaming accounts. Following her exit, Carano vowed to sue Disney for wrongful termination over her political views. She has accused the company of firing her over \"refusing to support movements and ideologies with which she did not agree,\" including Black Lives Matter, COVID lockdowns and sharing pronouns. After three years of waiting to get back at her former employer, a Los Angeles federal judge ruled in 2024 that the actress’s lawsuit could move forward, denying Disney’s motion to dismiss the case. 'SNOW WHITE' REBOOT STAR, WHO KNOCKED 1937 FILM, IS 'THANKFUL' FOR CRITICS: ‘MAKES ME FEEL LIKE TEFLON’ DeSantis defeats Disney Disney was dealt another blow in 2024 after its years-long legal battle against the DeSantis administration ended in defeat. Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., moved to dissolve the company’s self-governing status of the formally titled Reedy Creek Improvement District that encompasses the Walt Disney World Resort in 2022 and triumphed. The lengthy litigation ended with the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District voting to approve a settlement between both parties that invalidated the company’s claims to act as its own separate government over the territory that its amusement park encompassed. The settlement also ended any litigation between the two parties still pending in Florida state court. The settlement was a huge setback for the media company, especially as many outlets had predicted that DeSantis would be the big loser in the stand-off. DeSantis made the first move in the legal fight following Disney’s aggressive criticism of Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act. The bill, which bans Florida school employees or third parties from giving classroom instruction on \"sexual orientation\" or \"gender identity\" in kindergarten through third grade, was promoted and signed into law by the governor. The bill’s critics in the media torched the legislation, dubbing it the \"Don’t Say Gay\" bill. Disney CEO Bob Chapek, at the behest of his company, echoed the criticism, publicly condemning the law. \"We were opposed to the bill from the outset, but we chose not to take a public position on it because we thought we could be more effective working behind the scenes, working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,\" he said. \"I called Gov. DeSantis this morning to express our disappointment and concern that if the legislation becomes law, it could be used to unfairly target gay, lesbian, non-binary, and transgender kids and families,\" he said, kicking off the feud between Disney and the Florida government. DID DISNEY'S WOKE AGENDA CAUSE THE CEO SHAKEUP? Leaked meetings show Disney pushing \"gay agenda\" In response to the DeSantis-endorsed Parental Rights in Education Act, the Walt Disney company appeared to implement an aggressive pro-LGBTQ agenda among its staff and its content. Leaked videos shared by conservative anti-woke journalist Christopher Rufo on social media in 2022 revealed an internal Disney \"all-hands\" meeting where company officials discussed \"adding queerness\" to its children’s programming, promoting gender-neutral language at Disney theme parks, and demonized members of the DeSantis administration. In one of the leaked clips, one Disney team member revealed that some teams at Disney have implemented an openly \"gay agenda.\" In another video, Disney’s Diversity and Inclusion Manager Vivian Ware explains to employees that the company is ditching the words ladies, gentlemen, boys, and girls in its theme parks in order to not alienate transgender children. In a third clip, an LGBT activist accuses Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and his press secretary Christina Pushaw of trying to \"erase\" LGBT employees at Disney. Disney corporate president Karey Burke was also shown saying that she would like to see at least 50% of Disney’s characters in the future identify as LGBT or a racial minority. Disney exec’s close ties with Kamala Harris scrutinized after debate The relationship between Disney senior executive Dana Walden and former Vice President Kamala Harris made waves following the U.S. presidential debate between the then-vice president and then-GOP candidate Donald Trump. After critics accused ABC News – which is owned by the Walt Disney Company – of showing bias towards Harris by appearing to fact-check more of Trump’s statements made during the debate, some wondered whether Walden and the ex-vice president’s friendship could have tipped the scales in Harris' favor. Walden, whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' \"extraordinary friends,\" according to a report in The New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s. Days after the debate, Variety confronted her about the insinuation of her high-profile friendship affecting ABC’s treatment of Harris. \"I have the highest regard for everyone at ABC News. It’s the most professional organization, the most top-notch journalists,\" she replied. \"It doesn’t really dignify much of a response.\" DAVID MUIR’S ABC NEWSCAST WAS 100% POSITIVE ABOUT HARRIS, 93% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP AHEAD OF DEBATE: STUDY Several of Disney’s films with openly gay characters bomb Disney movies featuring some of the studio's first openly gay characters and scenes made for some box office bombs in 2022. Disney’s Pixar summer offering that year, \"Lightyear\" – based off the beloved \"Toy Story\" character – disappointed with a $51 million box office debut. The film was predicted to earn $70 million. However, stiff competition from that year’s \"Jurassic World\" installment as well as the box office smash \"Top Gun: Maverick\" hurt its debut. Coincidentally, the film features a lesbian kiss between Hawthorne, a female lead voiced by Uzo Aduba, and another female character. The kiss generated backlash from critics, which was met with condemnation from the film’s lead, Chris Evans. \"The real truth is those people are idiots,\" Evans said during an interview with Reuters Television. \"There's always going to be people who are afraid and unaware and trying to hold on to what was before. But those people die off like dinosaurs. I think the goal is to pay them no mind, march forward and embrace the growth that makes us human.\" Disney’s \"Strange World\" opened that fall to an underwhelming box office performance, earning only $28 million during its Thanksgiving weekend debut. The movie, which features an \"openly LGBTQ+ teenaged Disney character talking about his crush, went on to lose $197 million total, making it the worst-performing Hollywood film that year. Conservative film critics, like Christian Toto, told Fox News Digital that the film’s pro-LGBTQ messaging might have contributed to the bomb. \"Hollywood doesn't fully grasp the ‘go woke, go broke’ mantra,\" he said. \"In some cases, parents are avoiding content with sexual conversations. Parents are [savvier] today. They use social media and get feedback on films from their peers either online or in person.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"The poor box office debut and dismal critical reception of Disney&apos;s &quot;Snow White&quot; remake is just the latest in a long line of controversies that Disney has endured in recent years.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/snow-white-struggles-here-five-more-disney-controversies-rocked-company","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/03/931/523/disney-world-castle-e1680120430154.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 10:00:47","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.136},{"id":305479700,"title":"Trump revokes Biden’s security clearance amid political crackdown","text":"President Donald Trump has revoked Joe Biden\"s security clearance, along with access for key political figures, including Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.

Bezos’s commitment to “personal liberties” would seem to silence conservatives more than liberals like Marcus or libertarians. As for Bezos’s devotion to “free markets,” Marcus eventually published that column in the New Yorker and wondered what he meant by that. She asked if that would include the forbidding of support for “reasonable regulation,” but based off a recent Post editorial about Trump’s environmental deregulation, the answer is no. Ultimately, the Post is still mostly the same liberal outlet it has always been; Marcus is just upset they couldn’t endorse Harris because she thinks the Post actually influences people.\n\nSign the petition to help us defund another MSNBC in PBS and NPR at defundpbsnpr.org.\n\nHere is a transcript for the March 28 show:\n\nPBS News Hour\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Lastly, Ruth, it's great to have you here.

Here's why he cares about a state Supreme Court race.","text":"President Donald Trump may have run his last race, but that doesn't mean Elon Musk is done campaigning.Musk will travel to Wisconsin on Sunday, days ahead of a Supreme Court race that could shift the balance of the state's highest court. True to his word, the world's richest man is cementing his status as one of the GOP's biggest megadonors in an off-year election that has drawn significant national attention.Musk and his America PAC have spent over $12 million so far on the officially nonpartisan state Supreme Court race to help conservative Judge Brad Schimel. Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, have rallied behind liberal Judge Susan Crawford.More than $80 million has been spent, making the contest the costliest judicial election in US history — supplanting a Wisconsin court from just two years ago.\"Both sides are making a pitch to make it a referendum on Donald Trump or Elon Musk as the case may be,\" Marquette Law School professor Chad Oldfather told Business Insider. \"It's kind of the first election of consequence in the Trump era, so I think people are looking for signs here as to how the population is reacting to everything.\"Oldfather, who studies state constitutional law, said Musk's presence has given this race a different feel.\"We've had outside money coming into these races in the past, I suppose what distinguishes it is that Musk is not trying to downplay his role at all,\" Oldfather said.Tesla is suing to open dealerships in the state, fighting a state law that doesn't allow automakers to sell directly to consumers. (It's a frequent issue for Musk's company.) Musk and just about every other major figure who has weighed in on the race is more concerned about what the seven justices can do that will have national effects.\"We're trying to stop the Democrats in Wisconsin from removing two House seats,\" Musk told Fox News anchor Bret Baier during an interview for \"Special Report.\"If Schimel loses, Musk said, \"we could lose control of the House and all of the government reforms could be shut down.\"The GOP holds a 6 to 2 majority in the Wisconsin US House of Representatives delegation. History shows that the president's party typically loses seats. The GOP has a slim House majority, meaning it cannot afford to see more districts become more competitive.Crawford and her allies have repeatedly highlighted Musk's spending in the race. Wisconsin Democrats' website has a splash page that shows Musk as the puppet master of Schimel.\"Elon Musk is the most unpopular active national figure in Wisconsin politics, and the more voters see that the man who is attacking social security and their healthcare is pouring millions of dollars in to help Brad Schimel, the more voters are enraged about the idea of someone trying to buy our state Supreme Court,\" Wisconsin Democrats Chairman Ben Wikler told Business Insider.After Musk announced his initial giveaway, Crawford's campaign wrote on X, \"Brad Schimel and Elon Musk are corrupt.\"In response to Crawford, Schimel's campaign said their opponent has plenty of well-heeled supporters herself, including George Soros, Bernie Sanders, and Hakeem Jeffries.\"The attempts by Susan Crawford and the Democrats to distract the people of Wisconsin from her extreme views and the radical billionaires funding her are a mockery of hypocrisy,\" Jacob Fischer, Schimel campaign spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider.Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming called the focus on Musk's spending \"a diversion.\"\"It's a way for them to take shots at Donald Trump and at Elon Musk,\" Schimming told Business Insider. \"There's no lack of lack of big money people that have come into Wisconsin over the years that have greatly outspent Elon Musk.\"According to a March 5 Marquette Law School Poll, Musk has a -12 percentage point approval rating in Wisconsin. The same respondents only slightly disapproved (-3 percentage points) of Trump's first six weeks in office. Trump won the state last November, part of his swing state sweep over Vice President Kamala Harris that ushered him back into the White House. Just days before Election Day, Trump announced his endorsement of Schimel.Like in the 2024 election, Musk's campaigning is also drawing opposition. On Friday, he wrote on X that he would personally award two voters $1 million checks at the Sunday rally. He then deleted the tweet and later clarified that the checks were for attendees who had agreed to become spokespeople for a petition America PAC is pushing across the state. Musk's political outfit previously promised to give $100 to voters who signed the petition against judicial activism.Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, said he would challenge Musk's giveaway in court. Wisconsin law prohibits anyone from giving \"something of value\" to voters, which led some election law experts to conclude that Musk's effort was illegal.The national attention is unlikely to fade for long.Wisconsin justices serve 10-year terms. Due to retirements alone, the state will hold multiple Supreme Court elections over the next five years. In the meantime, the current race seems almost inescapable, Oldfather said.\"It's a deluge,\" he said, \"every time you turn on the TV, every time you pull up YouTube, every you open your mailbox, every time your phone dings with a text message.\"","summary":"Elon Musk and his America PAC have spent over $12 million on efforts to elect a judge who could shift the majority of Wisconsin's highest court.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wisconsin-state-supreme-court-election-analysis-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67e71d4169253ccddf9aaf25?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 09:30:02","author":"Brent D.

She spent nearly 15 years at Fox News — “Welcome to the very first broadcast of ‘The Kelly Files.’” — where she earned a reputation as one of the channel’s sharpest interviewers — “What do you say to those who say you were so wrong about so much at the expense of so many?” — before she moved briefly to NBC. But that Trump rally speech was the clearest sign yet that Kelly has moved on to her next chapter. Over the past few years, she’s found a new lane for herself in podcasting and on YouTube, where she has a daily talk show that fits squarely into the MAGA-loving media universe. “That’s fake news. It’s not reality.” “That was a bad question.” “That was a great question.” “Oh, no, it was a nasty question.” “Awesome.” “We will close the border. He will keep boys out of girls’ sports.” It’s just one of the reasons why I was so interested to talk to her about her professional evolution — “I had been rendered entirely toxic.” — her volatile relationship with President Trump — “It was useful to him to have me as a foil.” — and what she thinks some people, myself included, don’t understand about how the media has changed forever. “I just think that mode of journalism is dying, if not dead.” “I’m Lulu Garcia-Navarro, and here’s my interview with Megyn Kelly.” “Megyn, one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is because you’re really forging this new path. And I think to fully understand your career, I wanted to start early. Before you were a journalist, you were a lawyer at Jones Day, which is one of the toughest, notorious firms out there for being just a big, international law firm that only takes the best of the best. When you walked through that door, were you a tough person?” “Well, the practice of law definitely toughened me up because while I was always comfortable with public speaking, I wasn’t necessarily comfortable arguing and standing up for myself and coming under attack and being able to hold my own. And so law school helped with that. And then before I went to Jones Day, I did two years at Bickel and Brewer. Same mentality, which is kill or be killed. And it was known for its quote, ‘Rambo litigation tactics.’ So when I was very young, 24, that was very sexy to me. I thought that was extremely cool. And I loved the thought of what that could do to me, that I thought that those guys would toughen me up, would take what I had learned in law school and bring it next level. And they did.” “I know there was a time when you were working days as a lawyer and then nights and weekends, learning TV journalism. What did you feel that you could do as a journalist that you couldn’t do as a litigator?” “Have fun, it was one thing. It was like —” “What did you like about it?” “Oh, god, everything. Everything. I loved the storytelling. I loved getting a story. I loved having that extra nugget that nobody else had. I loved the excitement and the pressure, the eustress, which is the more positive stress you can invite into your life, of having to be on, of the fight or flight instinct coming on behind your neck, the tiny hairs being up because you’ve got to go, and there’s not a second go at it. You’re live. Go. So I just felt completely alive. And I also felt that what I was doing mattered. One of the reasons I chose journalism, when I was considering a second career, was 9/11 hit. And I was 30. And I was watching TV that day, having an unfamiliar emotion, watching some of the reporters, in addition to all the other horrible emotions that we were watching in the event. And that was envy. I remember watching Ashleigh Banfield, and she was just so cool under enormous pressure, and thinking, she’s doing us such a service right now, and you can’t see her sweat under the scariest possible circumstances you could put a reporter. And I thought, I want to do that.” “In 2004, you get to Fox. What were your politics then? Did you feel attracted to the news organization because it was conservative? Or were you just thinking, this is my way in, it’s the big time?” “The latter. I really wasn’t political. I was raised a Democrat, sort of. We never talked about politics in my household, but I knew my parents were Democrats. And my Nana, god bless her, she lived to 101. She used to say, ‘Republicans are for rich people. We’re not rich.’ She’s from New Jersey. That’s her New Jersey accent. So I just always thought of myself as a Democrat. And then when I started practicing law and saw what was happening to my paycheck, I started to get a little bit more fiscally conservative. And Jones Day had some more Republicans, more than I’d ever been exposed to, anyway. And so I started to be more open-minded to the right. And then when I was getting into journalism, I met Bill Sammon, who was working in the D.C. office of Fox News. I think at that time, he was still a contributor. And he said, you’ve got to get your tape to Kim Hume. And I said, ‘Oh, I think maybe I’m too green.’ I don’t know, because I knew Fox was a thing. And he said, ‘You’re not too green, and if you are, she’ll tell you you are.’ But I hadn’t even given a thought to their politics. And Roger Ailes was the first one to say to me, how did a daughter of two Democrats, a nurse and a college professor, wind up a fair and balanced person? And he was not saying, I want a Republican who does news the Republican way. And even when I was starting to anchor on Fox, he loved it. If I had a contentious interview with a Republican, he never said don’t do that. And in fact, he told other anchors, ‘You should watch Megyn. Do more of that.’” “Why do you think that was? Because it was good TV? Or because he thought they should be challenged?” “It’s probably because it was good TV. Roger loved Republicans and wasn’t too keen on the Democrats. But he would say to me, ‘Make sure you smile a lot.’ And he wasn’t wrong about that because if you’re all sharp elbows, it’s off putting, and someone doesn’t see anything in you to connect with. But when I went out in the air for contentious interviews, I always approached them with somewhat more of a prosecutorial approach, even though I never was a prosecutor. People mistake that about me. It’s just more how I am, especially if there’s somebody who I think is a villain. And every time I did it, I only got rewarded. I never got my hand slapped by Roger. He did think it made good TV. And that’s the nature of broadcast journalism. It’s helpful if you’re dynamic on the air and if you have a knack for making electric moments. Ask Donald Trump. This is something he knows instinctively. But I would just follow my instincts. If somebody was making me irritated and I felt that thing in the back of my throat, like looking across from an Anthony Weiner or as the case was, Dick Cheney, I’d know it’s time to double barrel it.” “So that approach became one of your hallmarks, this thing of being able to call balls and strikes, specifically on a conservative network, against conservatives. That was unusual. And in 2015, there was the very famous Republican primary debate. And you had a question for Donald Trump, where you asked him to explain why he had called women fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. And then he retaliated against you. His attacks were relentless after that year. You’ve talked about this a lot. But what I would like to understand in hindsight, now, why do you think he came after you?” “Well, initially, he was annoyed. I think it was sincere anger that night. He did not appreciate that question. And I think he thought we were friends. So he was even more annoyed by it. He felt betrayed.” “Why did he think you were friends?” “We’d been friendly, just through Fox. He had invited me to a couple of the ‘Apprentice’ extravaganzas. I’d interviewed him quite a few times on Fox, in my younger years. There was a very funny exchange, I think, in 2010, where he let me feel his hair to see whether it was real. I think he thought I was a fan. And I think he thought I should be a fan, that I was at Fox and I kind of looked like somebody who he would typically do well with, and he put me in this category of, she’s on my team. And while I had nothing against him and I wasn’t not on his team prior to that moment, as you know, as soon as they throw their hat in the political ring, when you’re a straight news journalist, it becomes somewhat adversarial. You’re not on their team. And in fact, you get paid to be somewhat abrasive toward them. And so the relationship does change, just given the nature of what news people do. So the week before that debate, I had been discussing not with him, but with somebody else, the Michael Cohen statement that you can’t rape your wife. Michael Cohen had said this in defense of Trump, who had been accused by his first wife, Ivana, of having raped her in the course of their first marriage or divorce, or in some explosive argument, an allegation she later recanted. And I was knocking Michael Cohen for the ridiculous assertion that one cannot rape one’s wife. Well, he did not like that. Trump was watching. And he called me up. And he told me something to the effect of, he didn’t want to see any more segments like that on ‘The Kelly File.’ And I told him he doesn’t control the editorial on ‘The Kelly File.’ And he screamed at me and hung up on me. This is the week before the debate. And then he kept calling Fox executives and complaining about me. I think his ‘Spidey senses’ were up that maybe I’m not in the friend camp anymore, and something could happen at this debate that might not be good for him. Here’s the second thing. So in the beginning, I think he was genuinely angry. But I think it quickly turned to, he liked it as a story line. He wasn’t wrong that it was good for him to show the world, and in particular, Republican voters who felt disaffected or abandoned by the party, that there were no sacred cows for Trump, even in the Republican Party, even at Fox News, even in the prime time and Roger’s chosen favorite anchors. No one. That he would fight anyone. You’ve talked a lot about what a terrible year that was, and having to go with armed guards and having his supporters come after you. Do you have residue from that period?” “No. It was such an annoying nine months. I did not want to take an armed guard to Disney World. I did not want this to go on and on. I knew it wasn’t good for me as a journalist, as a Fox News host, or as a person, to have this level of acrimony constantly at me. And I desperately wanted him to just lay off. So it was just a stressful time, when you’re just waiting for somebody who’s very angry with you and toying with you to, I don’t know, don’t get focused on something else or have those feelings wane enough that they’re reachable.” “In 2016, you and other female Fox employees accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. And again, this is a pretty well-documented time in your life. There was a movie about it. And ultimately, you were instrumental in getting him fired. Did you feel, at Fox, that people were angry at you because of what you’d done? Certain people?” “Very much so. Yes. They weren’t really angry about the Trump stuff. They were angry about me not supporting Roger. And they never got past it. And in a way, I feel like my career there ended when I called Lachlan Murdoch to tell him the truth about how my relationship with Roger was when I was a first-year reporter at Fox. You have to understand, it’s almost cultlike over there. At least it was back then. And he was the cult leader. And you don’t turn on the cult leader. And so much more so than with the Trump thing, which I think everybody understood, Trump, what he was doing — and there were some who took it personally. Hannity and I fought publicly over what he perceived as my nonsupport of Trump. So that’s not a surprise to anybody. But for the most part no one cared about that. It was the Roger thing that turned my relationships at Fox and just made it an impossible place for me to stay. And so I knew I couldn’t stay. And I left.” “What was that call with Lachlan like, though? When you called him up and told him?” “When you asked me that question, I got a chill through my body. That’s how big that moment was for me. It’s one of the hardest, most complicated things I’ve ever done because I really cared about Roger. And we had gotten past his harassment of me, which, for the record, never led anywhere. I did not submit to any of his advances. And I had forgiven him. And he had done so much for me. And I did not want to hurt him. And I didn’t like Gretchen Carlson, who was looking for help, in a way. The whole question was, could he be this thing that she has alleged he is? And I was really not inclined to help her and stick a knife in him. So I did wrestle. There was a long period where I wasn’t saying anything about it, and people were saying, ’What’s she going to do?’ And I was under a lot of pressure from Roger’s team, and Roger and his wife, to come out and say, he’s not this thing and he’s incapable of being this thing, which is what everyone was saying. And I knew I did not have it in me to lie. The real question was whether I should just stay silent and keep it to myself. And I wrote about this in my book. I was on the porch swing at the place we go to at the Jersey Shore. And I was looking at a picture of my daughter, who had fallen off the jungle gym. And she had had something like 11 stitches in her head. But she got back up to the same jungle gym she had fallen off of. And I saw that picture, and I said, I have got to call Lachlan Murdoch. I have to call him. It still makes me emotional because it was something that I think changed lives in a lot of ways — I believe that — but including my own in a way that was not positive, mostly. In some ways positive, but mostly negative.” “I’m curious to know, in hindsight, what do you think changed?” “Well, I think it blew up almost every friendship I had at Fox, which those friendships were important to me. I loved most of those people and didn’t quite realize how strong the backlash would be. I mean, virtually everyone. Maybe a couple of close friends stood by me and were 100 percent with me. But it just was a before and after moment there. Anyway, the whole thing on the heels of that year of the Trump stuff, it was just a lot. And I’m not generally a stressed-out person. I probably couldn’t be in news if I were anxiety-ridden. But I was stressed out. And I left for NBC as an escape. I just thought it was going to be a kinder, gentler — my god, I sound like an idiot; it’s like I did no homework about anything. — place to be. It wasn’t. It ended disastrously. It was an even more stressful year. So, look, all those relationships at Fox have since repaired. And I’m in a good place with my old Fox colleagues. But it took a while.” “I don’t want to spend too much time here because I do want to get to today.” “Sure.” “But you mentioned this. In 2017, you went to NBC to host a daytime show at that time at NBC, which was, as you say, so stressful and ended so disastrously because of your comments about blackface and Halloween. Ostensibly, there was a lot of other things going on at that moment. But ostensibly, that was the reason that you were harassed?” “Correct. Bravo, which is owned by NBC, had a real housewife in blackface Halloween costume. She dressed up like Diana Ross and tinted her skin. And there was a push to not cancel her, but get her in trouble. And so we had a discussion on my show where I asked, when did that become unacceptable? Because when I grew up in the ‘70s and the ‘80s, people used to do it. And it was considered OK. And at the time, I knew that. I knew that had been my experience. I just didn’t know that NBC had been airing shows with people doing it, like ‘Scrubs.’ There were so many examples. But I didn’t have it at the ready because I wasn’t expecting a huge controversy over it.” “Really?” “Yeah. Yeah. At the time, I just thought —” “Everyone understands that blackface is racist.” “Now they do. But when did it go from something that people used to do with impunity — hello, Justin Trudeau — to something that will get you canceled? And for me, we talked about the two joint traumas during the Fox years, the late Fox years. For me, personally, that NBC, it dwarfed those. So by the time that ended, I was like, this industry is a disgusting, toxic stew of hatred and darkness. And why would I want to go back into it? Now I have some money. Now I’m with my kids. I can raise my family. Maybe this is the time I ride into the sunset and find a third version of me, professionally.” “Did you feel, during that period, that people were turning their back on you? That because there had been this big flameout at NBC, that all that world that you had inhabited had sort of rejected you?” “Oh, well, I mean, I had been rendered entirely toxic. So I guess I never really tested it. I wasn’t out seeking jobs at that time. For me, it wasn’t like, gee, will anyone still have me? But I understood that I had been rendered toxic.” “This was the moment when — you’ve talked about this on your new show — when you decided, the mainstream media is not for me.” “I don’t do well with bosses, as it turns out. I’m not that easy to control as an employee. I’m just kind of past the bullshit. And also, the landscape had changed. Back in 20 — I was on my couch, figuratively, all of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. And the country was losing its mind. That was peak wokeism, where when it came to race, when it came to gender, when it came to any L.G.B.T.Q., it was like, we were going nuts. And I am not a woke person. It’s one of my core missions in life to defeat wokeism. Anyway, there was no way I could go work for another broadcast news outlet that was going to be like NBC was. I definitely couldn’t go back to Fox. That bridge had already been burned on my way out. And I wasn’t in a great place with the executives or the owners. So it was like, what could I possibly do? What’s an avenue available to me? And that’s when Ben Shapiro called me, who I think he would tell you, I helped him make his name. I put him on ‘The Kelly File’ regularly and helped make him a star. And he saw me down and out, and he said, ‘M.K., this is a real lane for you.’ And he was just saying it as a friend. And I wasn’t quite ready at first. But then he called me again and said, ’You got to get back out there.’ And he said, ’Why don’t you come out here, to “The Daily Wire,” and just see what we’re doing.’ And I, I don’t know, kicked the tires on this new lane and thought, this is what I want to do.” “Why?” “Because I was my own boss. I could be in charge of all my own editorial. No one could tell me what to do, what to say, what not to say. I could have long-form conversations about really tough issues that were bubbling up in the country at the time. I didn’t have to do it in a seven-minute segment or a three-minute segment like I used to have to do on linear television. It was just a whole new world to me. It was the Wild West to me. And I loved that feeling.” “You’ve talked about finding a third version of Megyn Kelly with your new show, which is on YouTube. Looking at the early days of your show, that was very much like you were an anchor on television, and now you look a lot looser.” “Yes. And I feel looser in the anchor sense. But if you really want to make it as an individual in this lane, without a platform supporting you, where they’re tuning in because it’s Fox News, and you just follow the person before you, who they really liked, there has to be a connection between your audience and you. Otherwise, what’s the point? And so I did start to share more of my own opinions. And frankly, I started to form more of my own opinions.” “Tell me about that, form your own opinions.” “Well, because I was never really that political, as I said, growing up, one of the reasons I think I did well at Fox, in the news division was, I didn’t really feel the need to choose a side. I just felt the need to learn everything I could about both of the sides and then mediate a good debate. Then, it wasn’t until, really, I got on this show that it was a different job. It was more like, they wanted to know what I thought. That was clear. The audience wanted to know my opinion. And so on a lot of subjects, I had to really start thinking about them. Even today, we’re having a debate about tariffs. I don’t know how I feel about tariffs. I’ve never really given it a lot of thought. So I’m working on my opinion on tariffs. But there have been a million subjects like that over the past four or five years that I’ve really just had to question where I stand.” “One of the things that you just did, which is a red line for most journalists, is that you showed up at one of Donald Trump’s rallies right before the election, and you formally endorsed him. Once you endorse a politician on stage at a rally, I don’t think you can reasonably be called independent anymore. Or do you see it differently?” “I think I can. I don’t agree with that, because I can still hit Trump and do. There’s no question that I owned my bias on Trump and crossed a line that I had never crossed before, and never would have crossed when I was still straight news, ever. It’s just this weird, new, hybrid lane I’m in that even made it a possibility in my mind, that I even allowed myself to consider saying yes to the invitation. And it was another before-and-after moment because for sure, you’re crossing a line. But I had crossed it prior to then. I had crossed it the day Biden handed down his Title IX revisions, and I was so angry about what he did, that I went on my show that day and said, ‘I’m voting for Donald Trump.’ And I had never done that.” “But then, going and actively campaigning, standing on stage, and giving him a hug and a kiss, it is different. And I think a lot of people saw you endorsing Trump as caving, as essentially going to where the power is.” “I don’t think it was me caving. It was me rising. It was me answering something I truly felt called to do. I’m thrilled Trump won. I shudder to think of what the country would be right now if Kamala Harris had won. And in the end, I had no qualms about going there, out there for him, whatsoever. And I accept and agree with you that there are different gradations. It is a different level.” “Yeah, the symbolism of it, of course, which is someone who so famously had been at odds with him, that he had done so much to, to publicly stand up and embrace him was significant to a lot of people.” “I hope so. I mean, that was my goal in helping him, especially with women. And I wanted to look them in the eyes, figuratively, and say, trust me. You know I’m pro-woman. And you know I’ve expressed doubts about him in the past, about some of the choices he’s made when it came to dealing with women. But there is no other choice for women in this election. And I stand by that wholeheartedly, for all the reasons I listed that night. I knew that I could be help to him. I knew, given the relationship with him, that I would be a different kind of endorser that actually might, potentially make a difference for him with a certain set of people, who were looking for permission to vote for him because they’d been told universally that he was bad, that he was Hitler, that he was a rapist, all these things that people have been saying. And I felt the obligation to go tell them how I really feel about him and why I feel that way.” “I understand the fervor within which you embrace some of his policies. But what you were talking about there was the person himself, the things that he has been accused of, credibly accused of, and what you yourself experienced.” “I’ll give you the perspective on it. So I don’t agree with you on the credibly accused. I actually don’t believe that. But with respect to my own situation, you have to zoom out and look what was happening at the time, which was not easy for me when I was going through it. But Trump was trying to win a presidential election. And so, as I pointed out earlier, it was useful to him to have me as a foil. Look, you have to separate, when you’re in this business, you the person and you the professional, Megyn Kelly the woman and Megyn Kelly the brand. And they were attacking Megyn Kelly the brand, which is fair game. I had thrown a very tough ball right at Trump’s face.” “Do you really think it’s fair game that you, as a journalist, asked a fair question based on things that he’d said, and he put you through that for a whole year? You think that’s fair?” “Look, I’ve been very public about thinking he went too far. That’s how I felt at the time. And if I could go back and undo it, I would. But I have a better perspective on why it happened now. It was actually an important piece of his rise within the Republican Party and the primary. And it just showed people what a fighter he was. The same guy who got up bloodied in Butler, Pa., was the guy who was like a dog with a bone with me, who wouldn’t let it go. He’s got this fighter instinct. And if you cross him or if you do something he finds unjust, he will stay on you until he’s satisfied the thing’s been resolved to his satisfaction.” “I just want to understand something clearly. Donald Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil court. He’s been accused by many women. You don’t believe any of that?” “I think the most serious thing I’ve heard about him has been the E. Jean Carroll allegation, that he sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf dressing room, and I don’t believe one word of that, not one word.” “There are other women who have said —” “I know. I’ve interviewed some of them. But, look, the things I heard included things like he got handsy on an airplane. Now, I don’t know whether that happened or it didn’t, but do I find that a deal breaker for a possible politician? Not really. At least I reported on their stories and did them the courtesy of bringing them to air in front of millions of people, and let the audience make up its mind. My problem is more with these Democrats, who will bury these allegations against their candidates or their candidate’s spouses, and then play holier than thou when they’re looking at Donald Trump.” “Do you see yourself as a journalist still? Or would you not describe yourself —” “No, I’m still a journalist. I mean, I break news all the time. And when I sit with Trump or anybody else in the administration, I ask tough questions. As recently as September of ‘23, I interviewed Trump, and he got so mad at me, he didn’t talk to me for six or seven months. So it’s not — look, it’s a tough job to do. You have to be able to hit the people you admire. And I do. I’ve hit them all. Right before the election, I ripped on Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally as too brotastic, and got specific about why. You have to understand, if you haven’t sold your soul, you have to be willing to criticize the people, even that you admire, on your, quote, ‘side.’ And my owning my bias, by going out there on stage with Donald Trump and saying, ‘I’m voting for him and you should, too,’ is a bonus when it comes to my credibility. Now everybody has zero doubt about where I stand. And they can filter everything I say through the appropriate lens. What typically happens in journalism is, they say they have no bias, and then they just work it out in the printed word or on their shows without owning it. But the audience knows it. And it creates a distrust and a divide. When it comes to Trump and me, no, my own personal opinion is, most of the allegations against him are much more complicated than the mainstream media would have you believe. And I don’t think Donald Trump is a rapist or a sexual assaulter. I do think he’s taken inappropriate liberties with women and gotten handsy with them in a way he’s owned himself. OK, years ago, when he was a celebrity. And it is what it is. That’s the past. But it’s just about so much more than that. We are talking about how many people dying at the Southern border because of the invasion that we’ve suffered under Joe Biden. We’re talking about Laken Riley, whose killer was let in under Biden. We put him on a taxpayer flight, down to Georgia, where he murdered her. I don’t give a shit about Trump getting handsy with somebody 20 years ago. I want someone who will close the border, which he has. I want someone who will keep boys out of my daughter’s sports, which he has. I want someone who will stand up to the insane D.E.I. policies so that white kids will stop hearing in school that they’re born with some original sin from which they cannot recover, which he has.” “Do you think you could be at Fox now in the way that you were before? Can I rein back in the opinion me and do what I used to do without sharing it as much, and just sort of be straight down the middle if sometimes opinionated? I could, but I don’t have any interest in that. And I actually don’t think that’s the model for the future, either.” “Tell me what you mean by that.” “I just think that mode of journalism is dying, if not dead. I think the future involves direct relationships between individual journalists and their audience or personalities — they don’t all have to consider themselves journalists — and their audience.” “What’s left if that happens? The way that the algorithms work now is that — I agree with you. They elevate individuals, that you have a personal relationship with them. But you’re given more of the same thing that you want. So if I like Megyn Kelly, I might get Megyn Kelly-adjacent materials. So however great Megyn Kelly may or may not be, that is a very narrow slice of what’s out there.” “The reality right now, or the way it’s been for the past three decades, prior to the last couple of years, is everyone is siloed. And they’re all getting only leftist information. There’s the people who watch Fox and then everybody else. There is a monopoly on opinion and political bias, mostly by the left in media. And a couple have popped up, that have done all right. Fox, they do very well. The Wall Street Journal is doing OK. And that’s it. You’ve had talk radio, which was the only place conservatives could go to hear their ideas debated in a way that wasn’t disdainful. And now that lane has been broadened out to more radio and digital, where you have more conservative personalities dominating.” “It’s so dominating.” “Because necessity is the mother of all invention, because there are more conservatives in the country now than there are liberals. The country’s more right-leaning than it is left. Why wouldn’t they be the dominant forces in media? In mainstream so-called media? Because there’s a monopoly. There’s control. There’s control over sports. There’s control over corporate America. There’s control over media. And Republicans have had this one strain. And Fox News has been very important, but they needed to invent a new area of thought because even Fox wasn’t enough, and actually didn’t represent all Republican voices. So I do think now that this other thing has been invented, the old thing is a dinosaur. It’s dying a slow and painful death. Part of it is tragic because we do need reporters. We need news gatherers. And I am not somebody who says The Times should go out of business. I still subscribe to The Times. I also subscribe to The Journal, and I subscribe to The New York Post. I think it’s important to have news gatherers out there, getting news. And people like me cannot exist without that. I need content. I need news to talk about and report on. But the model for how that news is presented is deeply, deeply flawed. And it led to me. And it’s going to lead to a much different future for those organizations.” “After the break, I call Megyn back.” “Thank you so much for being with us again today. When we spoke yesterday — I was thinking a lot about our conversation. And you were talking about how you still consider yourself a journalist, even though the way you do the work has sort of changed over time. And so I did want to ask you, as someone who supports the president, what you make of the various ways that he attacks the press, from calling reporters the enemy of the people, to sort of popularizing the term ‘fake news,’ sometimes calling out individual reporters. What do you make of that dynamic?” “I’m in favor of it.” “I share his feelings. Like most people on the right, I have a healthy amount of loathing for a large portion of the media. And they are fake news. And Trump did a very effective job of pointing that out. And he had to because they were all against him. So what was his choice, other than to try to demonize them as a group? And rather than proving him wrong, they leaned in and tried extra hard to really convince people of what he was saying. That’s what happened, especially over Trump 1.0. He played a role, but it was really their decision. But they needed a little bit of help. And he provided it. President Trump has chosen a lot of people who are in the media, especially on Fox, for his administration, the most high-profile, of course, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, whom you worked with, Deputy Director of the F.B.I. Dan Bongino. But there are many others. As someone who spent so much time in that world, I’m curious what you make of that.” “I’m excited about it. Pete Hegseth is an interesting one. And I would just say, he’s a good example of what I was saying to you yesterday, about how we have an approach that irrespective of who I voted for, we try to make it relentlessly factual. When the allegations against him, that he allegedly raped somebody, came out, we sat on this show and went line by line through the police report. And it was brutal. We did not care that he was a Trump appointee. We did not care that he was a former friend and colleague of mine at Fox. We read every single allegation against him and went through it with the audience with an open mind. Good luck finding somebody else who did that. It didn’t happen.” “Well, you interviewed him. And it was a fair interview, a tough interview. But you opened it by saying that he was a friend. You said, ‘I’ve been really dismayed by the amount of pile-on that he’s been suffering, and I’ve been outraged by the unfairness of the media’s coverage of the allegations.’ And that’s a direct quote. And so I’m curious what you’re doing in that interview because you’re setting up the interview in a particular kind of way that perhaps it wouldn’t be set up in the mainstream media.” “Yeah, well, I’m glad you asked that because I feel like part of our discussion, before and today, is getting at something that — our wires are crossing. Your wires and my wires are crossing in a way. You’re kind of looking at me and saying, ‘It’s not behaving like a typical journalist.’ And it is still calling itself a journalist. And I’m trying to say to you, yes, I’m still a journalist.” “I understand it, but —” “Yeah, no, I know. I’m not saying you’re judging me. But I’m trying to say to you, yes, I’m still a journalist, but I’m in this new ecosystem, where the old rules don’t apply. I’m in this world with, yes, Charlie Kirk and Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro, but my world is also Joe Rogan, with these in-depth interviews, and also Theo Von. And it’s a very large world. And how the consumer receives it is by going on YouTube.com, on their television screen or going to the vertical integrations on Instagram or TikTok, and just taking in content. What’s the content that you want to receive? I’m on the list of content creators. And so the fact that I’m also a journalist who breaks news and reports on news is an extra. But what’s most important in my business now is authenticity, that you are honest with the audience.” “What do you make of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California starting his podcast? He had, I think, Charlie Kirk as his first guest. He’s basically saying, if you can’t beat them, join them, in not too many words, like, we need to figure out a strategy. What do you see about that strategy?” “I think he’s very smart to do it. It’s the right move. And he’ll probably be pretty good at it because he’s been a public speaker for a living. And he could really benefit, as I think most people on the left could, from having his ideas tested. The right is very good at having these debates because they have to have them everywhere. And they have for all of their lives. And the left is less good because they’ve just had their worldview reinforced over and over, and in this arena, times 10 because that’s all we do, is debate all day, have people on, test our ideas, kick them around, get embarrassed, try to correct it, do better the next time, learn, grow, throw out yesterday’s wrongness so you can be more right tomorrow, all that. So he’s late to the party, but he’s right to join it.” “I think you’re right that there is some way that we are seeing things or discussing something different. I guess what I’m trying to understand is, what are the rules of this new world that you are inhabiting? Are you making them up as you go along, and you’re seeing what it is? Or do you adhere to some of those old values that you used to embrace? The only way one succeeds in this medium is by violating all those rules that we used to have in journalism, where you don’t really talk about yourself at all. You don’t talk about your opinions. You might have a bias. Your only goal is to hide it, not to own it, and then get past it with the audience. It’s just a whole new world. And it’s OK. We used to be much more partisan, and openly partisan in our journalism and our media, a hundred plus years ago. And we survived that just fine. And we will survive this just fine, too. What the audience wants from me is my authentic self and no filter. What they can smell from a mile away is a phony. So they have no problem with me endorsing Trump, even if they don’t like Trump. What they would have a problem with is me pretending I don’t have a horse in the race, and going out and trying to deliver the news as though I’m completely objective, and I’m just as open-minded to Kamala as I am to Donald Trump.” “Were you ever approached to get into the Trump administration?” “No comment.” “Oh.” “Well, let’s just say, I’m happy doing what I’m doing.” “What did they approach you for?” “Assumes facts not in evidence. But look, if I thought I could be really helpful to the president, it’s not that I would never consider it. But Lulu, I finally have my life exactly as I want it. And I have no desire to upend it in any way right now.” That’s Megyn Kelly. She recently announced that her media operation is expanding. She’s launching a Podcast Network called MK Media. “Today, we are announcing the launch of MK Media.” Also, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been in the news this week for sharing military information over Signal with a group of White House advisers and, inadvertently, a journalist. We recorded this interview before that story broke.","summary":"The former Fox News and current YouTube host on her professional evolution, conservative media and why she endorsed Trump.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/magazine/megyn-kelly-interview.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/06/magazine/06mag-interview-kelly-04/06mag-interview-kelly-04-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 09:15:06","author":"Lulu Garcia-Navarro","authors":["Lulu Garcia-Navarro"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.2},{"id":305454588,"title":"Thank you for courting a midterm correction, Mr. President","text":"Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nWas that so hard?

Seven decades on, as Zelenskyy confronted the Three Stooges of President Donald Trump and his mini-mes, might the words of Marc Antony have rung in his ears: “Cry ‘Havoc!’ and let slip the dogs of war.”\n\nSurely if Ukraine’s unlikely leader can shed his TV cloth and assume the mantle, anyone can magically insert themself into an unaired episode of “The Apprentice” and give the master blaster what he wants.

Much ink I poured into warning this ship of fools that way lay a titanic iceberg. Did they listen? We are living the answer. They thought the bubble would hold. Pop goes the weasel.\n\nWhen the once-and-future king assumed the position, a rude awakening dawned. With one hand on avarice and the other on resentment, the return of the Visigoths was made manifest. Who should emerge from the scrum of egomania but the world’s richest human Elon Musk posing for a poster from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Federal departments fell like dominoes. The challenge has been thrown down; a court fight looms at Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts’ OK Corral.\n\nI say again, with a spark in the eye: Thank you, Mr. President. For a few long weeks, it seemed all hope was lost. Legal scholars, military heroes and historians from funding-stripped institutions of higher learning claimed to see the Reich rise again. They scented the sickly air of a banana republic, quoted Orwell, put the “k” as in Kafka back in “Amerika,” felt the undertow of the death of the republic.\n\nThen he self-destructed. It didn’t take long. Some madness is so fierce and fulminating that it disregards all reason, damns the consequence and must burn itself out, a warning flare flaming white-hot into ash on the road to ruin. The Dems stood hopelessly aghast, dithering while Rome burns, with the same self-blame that years ago made them imbibe the moonshine of “Hillbilly Elegy.” Meanwhile, the bloodsuckers of the party in power lay down before the executive and allowed their victory to immolate on TikTok.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. (It gets easier each time.) Who knew that our friendly neighbors to the north were an enemy at the gates, that we had to test their mettle? In what failed class at Wharton did they teach that tariffs were the answer? What’s a little recession between friends? We’ve lived through pandemic. To make an omelet, you need to break some $2 eggs. Just when I thought we’d hung the high costs of retail around Joe Biden’s neck, the confederacy of dunces’ cavalry arrives to pin it on their rebel and his muskrats. You would have thought this bobblehead bunch would realize that a third of federal workers are veterans, a class with long memories and longer knives. You might not be faulted for head-scratching over abandoning Africa to the Chinese yuan, running away from USAID’s critical work within a continent on whose minerals Teslas run and from where tomorrow’s pandemics may arise. Closer to home, where 10 percent of children already go unvaccinated for measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. preaches pablum while kids die. His fingers, which once held a milky syringe, now drip blood.\n\nWitness the hand-wringing of the Dems and the farce of a craven GOP that has embraced an unbalance of powers in a way that no amount of genuflection can exaggerate. History will relegate to the sludge pond Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sen. Lindsay Graham and their ilk. We are right to fear martial law enforcing a tyrannical third term. But grace to Trump’s overreach, we might see a midterm correction. With a flick of the wrist on the ballot lever could come a flip of the House.\n\nIndeed, irrevocable damage will have been done. Courts have a hard time catching up when the legislative branch abdicates responsibility. Americans aren’t dumb. They voted for correction, not wholesale destruction.

A sedate street in suburban Boston, with the city’s blanched spring light. A woman walking alone wearing a backpack, quickly surrounded by a converging group whose faces are obscured by scarves or hats. A brief shriek, and then wrist restraints, followed by a calm, almost relaxed, escort to awaiting cars.\n\nIt took about 40 seconds to lift Rumeysa Ozturk off the streets. The recording captures the anonymous videographer, from the vantage point of a first floor window or balcony, calling for her detainers to identify themselves.\n\n“Bit of a kidnapping going on here?”\n\n“We gonna see some faces?”\n\nIt later emerged that the woman, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts, had been arrested by plain-clothes US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials for, her lawyers argue, doing nothing more than writing an oped piece in the college paper last year that was critical of the college’s handling of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nBy the time a Massachusetts federal judge ruled that she must be detained within the state, she had already been transferred to a holding facility in Louisiana. The following day, a big crowd gathered at Powder Square Park, in Somerville, to support Ozturk and demand explanation. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, provided it during a media appearance.\n\n“Oh, we revoked her visa. It’s an F-1 visa, I believe. We revoked it and here’s why: If you go apply for a visa anywhere in the world to be a student and you tell us the reason you want to come to the United States is not just because you want to write opeds but because you want to participate in movements that involve doing things like vandalising universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus ... we are not going to give you a visa.\n\n“If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States and, with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we are going to take away your visa. And once you have lost your visa, you are no longer legal in the United States and we have a right – like every country – to remove you from our country. So, it is just that simple.”\n\n[ US vice-president Vance to visit Greenland as Trump ramps up takeover threatsOpens in new window ]\n\nRubio, a one-time presidential aspirant, is a very precise communicator. His accent contains the story of elsewhere, which his Cuban parents brought with them to the US. It can be heard most clearly in his pronunciation of the word “visa”, which he splits into two hard syllables.\n\nRubio’s rise to prominence is a dazzling example of the possibilities for newly arrived families in the United States. That of Kamala Harris, although never told properly during the election, is another. Tens of millions of Americans, including first-generation families, will agree with Rubio. Come here, work hard, respect the opportunity.\n\nOzturk is one of at least 300 students whose visas were revoked. Her case became nationally known because a guy happened to be looking out his window and hit record on his phone. What is terrifying to many other millions of Americans is that Ozturk has not been charged with any of the specifics laid out by Rubio - taking over buildings or harassing students.\n\nHer arrest, they claim, is a first amendment violation of the right to free speech. Others have pointed to the sinister methodology- that the Ice officials wore plain clothes. (Though, their badges were on display.) They might have been anyone. The official explanation is that they wish to avoid their units being targeted.\n\nBut being targeted by whom? The campuses across the US have fallen silent now. It appears likely they will remain that way.\n\nJason Stanley, the Yale philosophy professor, announced this week that he is leaving the US to live and work in Toronto because he fears a fascist dictatorship here. Renowned history professors Timothy Snyder and Marci Shore, who are married, are also leaving Yale for Toronto.\n\nSceptics will dismiss Stanley as alarmist – he was warning about fascism in the US as far back as 2018, midway through the first term of Donald Trump. Then, he laid out the pattern for the dictator, which, he said, is always a man: “A mythic past supposedly destroyed by liberals, feminists and immigrants; positioning as a patriarchal strongman, repeated warnings that without him, catastrophe would prevail, followed by division and propaganda.”\n\nHe wrote in the New York Times in 2018: “I want you to be scared because if you are not worried about encroaching fascism in America, it will start to feel normal and if that happens we are all in trouble.”\n\nThe pandemic arrived and Joe Biden was elected president two years later and all of that discourse vanished. This time, Stanley is not hanging around to see if he is proven right.\n\nTime will tell. For on the late night talkshows, the joking about Pete Hegseth and Signal has been incessant, gleeful, pointedly cruel. Aren’t the satirists free to say whatever they like?\n\nBaseball season has begun and in Washington, the famous blossoms are beginning to light up the parks.

Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. “The Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,” Kendi argued, and “also one of the heartbeats” of the nation at large.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.\n\n“We do not run from or erase our history simply because we don’t like it,” she said in a statement. “We embrace the history of our country – the good, the bad, and the ugly.”\n\nTrump once praised the ‘Black Smithsonian’\n\nThe African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation’s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.\n\nFormer NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups — enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans — are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.\n\n“Attempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much ... and the place that we’ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,” he said.\n\nAnd, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.\n\n“I’m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,” Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.\n\n“I know President Obama was here for the museum’s opening last fall,” Trump continued. “I’m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.”\n\nTrump’s war on ‘woke’ targets history\n\nTrump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.\n\nHe ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled “woke” culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of “hating our country.”\n\nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government.

It was taxpayers who were on the hook","text":"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — As then-Gov. Kristi Noem crisscrossed the country — stumping for President Donald Trump and boosting her political profile beyond her home state — she refused to reveal what her extensive travel was costing taxpayers.\n\nIn the weeks since Noem became Trump’s Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved: South Dakota repeatedly picked up the tab for expenses related to her jet-setting campaigning.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem’s political and personal activity and not South Dakota business. That included numerous trips to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump resided before retaking office.\n\nMost of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, AP’s analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor’s office.\n\nThe expenditures include $7,555 in airfare for a six-day trip to Paris, where she gave a speech at a right-wing gathering, costs associated with a bear hunt in Canada with her niece and a book tour that included a stop in New York. An additional $2,200 stemmed from a controversial trip last year to Houston for dental work she showcased on Instagram.\n\nExpenses spark uproar\n\nThe expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.\n\nThe uproar comes as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government and as Noem has taken over DHS, the third-largest federal agency, with a budget and workforce many times the size of South Dakota’s.\n\nThe spending “offends a lot of people,” said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem’s ambition for higher office could’ve been paid with campaign funds.\n\nTaffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. “It seems like an incredible amount of money,” Howard told AP.\n\nA spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There’s no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses — even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.\n\n“Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,” Murtaugh said. “When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.”\n\nJosie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem’s gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were “a matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.”\n\n“The scope of that security is not up to the governor,” Harms added.\n\nDuring her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing the travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.\n\nLax disclosure requirements\n\nSouth Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for such travel expenses. Governors from both parties have used state funds to finance the travel expenses of their security details and staffers.\n\nCritics called on Washington’s Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to reimburse the state for similar costs resulting from his unsuccessful 2019 presidential run. And Ron DeSantis, Florida’s GOP governor, also came under fire for racking up hefty travel tabs for his security detail during his bid for higher office.\n\nMurtaugh, a spokesman for Noem in her personal capacity, questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris, their party’s 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n“They maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?” Murtaugh wrote in an email.\n\nThe more than 3,000 pages of records released to the Scout by Noem’s successor included hotel receipts, restaurant bills and credit card statements.\n\nSome expenses have no link to state business\n\nThe AP obtained the same records, as well as dozens of additional documents that show state officials acknowledged that “campaigning for Trump is not an official duty” of the governor in denying one of several requests to release her travel expenses.\n\nThe receipts are heavily redacted, so it’s not always clear who incurred the expense. Only 30 items totaling $2,056.72 were charged on the governor’s state-issued Mastercard, according to her attorney.\n\nSome expenses seemingly had no link to state business, such as $21 hotel-room movie purchases. It’s also unclear who attended meals that included unnamed “federal officials.”\n\nThe state auditor questioned some of the charges, including the governor’s office’s use of a luxury airline travel agency for a flight to Paris and a $2,000 change fee.\n\nThe state also ran up more than $3,300 in late fees and interest. The record doesn’t indicate how much was paid in overtime for staff and security accompanying Noem on her political excursions.\n\n“Spending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor,” Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor’s office, wrote to AP in an email.\n\nMost of the expenses were incurred as Noem became a rising star in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” universe and a contender to be his 2024 running mate. Her fortunes appeared to have suffered a blow after she revealed in a memoir that she shot and killed her farm dog, Cricket, after it scared away some game during a pheasant hunt.\n\nThis is not the first time Noem’s travel has come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.\n\nState known for frugality\n\nThe records raise questions about the necessity of the travel and the secrecy surrounding the expenses.\n\nNoem’s office refused to release records related to a 2020 speaking engagement at AmpFest, a gathering of Trump supporters near Miami, telling a public-records requester the trip was “not for the purpose of the governor’s official duties” and no receipts existed.\n\nBut the newly released records include several transactions in South Florida on those days, including a rental car and a stay at the posh Trump National Doral Miami. Days later, South Dakota picked up the tab for gasoline and hotel rooms for Noem’s security so she could speak at a Republican fundraiser in New Hampshire.\n\n“Noem’s travel doesn’t pass the smell test,” said Viki Harrison, program director for Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that seeks to limit big money in politics. “There should be a huge firewall between campaigning and official business.”\n\nNoem’s predecessors traveled less frequently in a low-tax state that values frugality, both on the farm and from elected officials. Daugaard, whose official statue features him pinching a penny, said he reimbursed staff for purchases like ice cream.\n\nFormer Gov. Mike Rounds, now South Dakota’s junior U.S. senator, said he tried to keep partisan activity at “arm’s length” from state resources and was careful about what he put on the government’s dime.\n\nSuch thriftiness was required, he said, because his state is “so tight on everything to begin with, just in terms of having enough money to pay the bills.”\n\n__ Goodman reported from Miami and Mustian from New York.

Gavin Newsom of California has flummoxed Democrats who fear that the politician they considered a liberal prizefighter is turning MAGA-friendly. The rap against “This Is Gavin Newsom,” in which the governor spoke out against trans athletes competing in women's sports and disavowed the gender-inclusive term \"Latinx,\" is that he doesn't sound like the Newsom they know at all. “What in God’s name is going on with Gavin Newsom?” asked CNN anchor Erin Burnett, quoting a headline criticizing the podcast, during a recent segment ripping the governor’s apparent shift. “The country is trying to figure out how he went from progressive hero and governor of the most liberal state in the country to interviewing and spending time with MAGA favorites like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk.” The Democratic governor was also surprised, but by the response. \"I did what I said I was going to do. I mean, when I launched this, I said I was going to have, not debates with people I disagree with, I said we're gonna have people on we disagree and agree with to have civil conversations to try to understand each other at this time of such polarization,\" Newsom said in an interview with The Times on Friday. \"And I said I was going to specifically meet with members of the MAGA movement. And then we did it and people were shocked.\" A common takeaway from the podcast is that Newsom is attempting to shape-shift into a moderate as he gears up to run for president in the aftermath of the Democratic Party's disastrous 2024 election. Newsom disputed that \"exhausting\" assumption, which he said others have attributed to actions for more than two decades. The governor offered his own blistering critique of his party to explain why he's sitting down with controversial GOP figures now. \"Because our party's getting our ass kicked,\" Newsom said. \"Because the Democratic Party brand is toxic. Because people don't think we make any damn sense. They think we make noise. They don't think we support them. You fill in the generic them. They don't think we have their values. They think we're elite. We talk down to people. We talk past people. They think we just think we're smarter than other people, that we're so judgmental and full of ourselves.\" The governor paused to say he loves his party, but \"we've lost our way\" and he wants people to know he hears it. \"I think you do that by having people you disagree with [on the podcast] without being disagreeable.\" It's not the first time the governor has disagreed with his fellow Democrats. As speculation mounted about whether then-President Biden was fit to run for president last summer, Newsom called the chatter from his own party \"unhelpful\" and \"unnecessary\" as he encouraged Democrats to back the president. A year earlier, he scolded the Democratic Party for its passive response to Republicans and for its lack of an offensive political playbook. Newsom created headlines across the country in the premiere episode of his podcast when he told Kirk, a conservative activist and Trump loyalist, that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports is “deeply unfair.\" Newsom's comments represented a clear break from progressives. The backlash from the left was swift. Newsom was accused of deserting his core LGBTQ+ constituency and flip-flopping after old social media posts surfaced with him expressing support for the California law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown that gave trans students more rights in public schools, including the ability to compete in sports and use bathrooms based on their gender preference. Newsom’s position aligned with 66% of American adults, who in a Pew Research survey in February said trans athletes should be required to compete on teams that match their sex assigned at birth. The governor also was criticized for suggesting, in his podcast with Kirk, that no one in his office used the term “Latinx,” a gender neutral term, to describe Latinos, despite direct quotes of the governor that prove otherwise. A Pew poll from 2024 found that only 4% of Latinos describe themselves as “Latinx.” Eric Jaye, the chief consultant for Newsom’s 2003 mayoral campaign, said the governor is an astute politician, though he disagreed with his decision to speak out against transgender athletes. “San Francisco has produced many extraordinary politicians — Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, Willie Brown, Kamala Harris — but in terms of the ability to adapt to changing political times and climes, Gavin Newsom’s head and shoulders above all of them,” Jaye said. “He's deeply, deeply attuned to which way the political wind is blowing and he has so far shown an extraordinary ability to navigate changing political weather.” “Now the challenge is, the question will be, at what point does that stop seeming like someone adapted to changing times and start seeming inauthentic, if not outright fake?” On Friday, Newsom said he understood why people might view his podcast as a departure from his liberal image, shaped largely by his groundbreaking support for gay marriage as mayor of San Francisco and as an advocate for universal healthcare. But the governor said his politics has never fit into an \"ideological prism.\" Anyone who knows him, he said, remembers when he was the \"small business supervisor\" in San Francisco, raging against the board for raising fees on business owners and championing \"Care Not Cash,\" a policy to take welfare checks from homeless people and use the savings to pay for treatment options. \"I'm open to argument,\" Newsom said. \"I'm interested in evidence. I have very strong values. I'm a progressive but I'm a pragmatic one, and that's something that anyone who has followed me knows, and people that don't, they're learning a little bit about that now.\" Still, Newsom always has been the main architect of his public image. A wine entrepreneur allied with the business community, he ran as a moderate to win the mayor’s office in 2003 against a Green Party candidate. “Care Not Cash” was widely panned by progressives but helped seal his victory. When Newsom set his sights on the biggest political prize in California in the 2018 governor’s race, he ran as a progressive advocate for single-payer healthcare and pledged to build more affordable housing. Yet even as he effused his liberal platform, Newsom couldn’t shake criticism from his opponents that his positions were a mirage. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a moderate Democrat, accused Newsom of selling “snake oil” with his support for single-payer healthcare in order to win over the nurses union and progressives. Newsom delivered some of his campaign pledges in his first term as governor. He successfully advocated for universal preschool and state-sponsored healthcare coverage to all income-eligible Californians regardless of immigration status. He also paused death row executions. The governor, who has a close relationship with the tech industry and counts Google founder Sergey Brin and Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff as his friends, has shown more of his moderate side in his second term. He drew criticism from truck drivers for rejecting their push to require more regulation of autonomous big rigs. He vetoed a marquee bill last year that would have required artificial intelligence developers to put safeguards on the technology. Newsom rebuffed Hollywood unions when he rejected a bill that would have allowed workers to receive unemployment benefits when on strike. He made a show this year of saying he would veto a bill for a second time that sought to restrict the state prison system’s ability to coordinate with federal immigration authorities attempting to deport felons. He’s also rejected proposals to allow immigrants who are in the country illegally to participate in a subsidized home loan program and to allow undocumented students to work at public universities. Lorena Gonzalez, president of the California Federation of Labor Unions, said she wasn’t shocked to see Newsom appear more moderate on the podcast. “He has always been more or less a tech bro from Northern California with the same kind of politics as we thought,” Gonzalez said. Perhaps, she said, “He’s done playing liberal and now he's just going to be himself.” Steve Kawa, Newsom’s chief of staff as mayor, scoffed at the idea that Newsom has changed. He said the governor has always been interested in speaking to people on all sides of a policy idea. Politicians, like regular people, aren't one-dimensional. “Maybe he's moderate on this issue,\" Kawa said. \"Maybe he's progressive on this issue. I don't think he looks at it in terms of under what column is this solution to make life better for the public and I can only be in this column.\" To criticism that he appears too comfortable talking to Bannon, a Trump campaign architect, and Kirk one day and Democrats such as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and commentator Ezra Klein the next, Newsom said he meets with people he disagrees with all the time. He mentioned his 90-minute sit-down with Trump in the Oval Office. \"That's called life,\" Newsom said. \"I don't decide who my friends are on the basis of their politics. I'd never met Charlie Kirk. I'd never met Bannon, but I know people that think like them and they're good parents and they're good people, and I vehemently disagree with their politics and they're Trumpers.\" The amicability he displayed in the podcast toward Republican figures whom Democrats perceive as villains doesn’t come as a surprise to people who have closely followed his career. “He sounds evenhanded about the views of people that you would think he would find an anathema to his being. That’s because of how he is on a path of existence beyond politics and I think that’s reflected in the podcast,” said David McCuan, a professor of political science at Sonoma State University. “He's always lived a charmed life in terms of politics, but there's also been more to him.”","summary":"Democrats find themselves flummoxed by the contrast between the MAGA-friendly host Gov.

Of course, not.” \n\nThe Trump administration official and tech tycoon then turned his attention to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who mocked Tesla’s falling stock price during an event in Wisconsin last week. \n\n“I mean, you have Tim Walz, who’s a huge jerk, you know, running around on stage with the Tesla stock price, where the stock price had gone in half, and he was overjoyed,” Musk said. “What an evil thing to do. What a creep. What a jerk.”\n\n“Like, who derives joy from that?”\n\nWalz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate, claimed that he was joking when he said that watching Tesla’s stock price plummet gives him “a little boost during the day.”\n\n“Does that sound like a good person to you? I don’t think so,” Musk said of the governor. \n\nWhen asked about what keeps him up at night, the father of 13 said it was the world’s declining birth rates, among other issues. \n\n“The birth rate is very low in almost every country, and unless that changes, civilization will disappear,” Musk said. “America had the lowest birth rate, I believe, ever — that was last year … and nothing seems to be turning that around.”\n\n“Humanity is dying, and people — it’s just not something we’ve evolved to react to.” \n\nMusk also expressed concern about “the strength of America.”\n\n“America is the central column that holds up all of Western civilization,” he said. “If that column fails, it’s all over.” \n\nThe DOGE chief also revealed what “basic level” changes President Trump’s cost-cutting initiative has made to the federal government that will survive beyond the commander in chief’s term in office. \n\n“We certainly would like a lot of what we’re doing to be permanently enshrined” via congressional action, Musk explained, adding, “but a lot of the changes we’re making are very basic things that I think are likely to remain in place, such as the improvements to the Treasury financial system.” \n\nMusk’s team at the Treasury Department has helped implement a mandatory code system for government payments that allows congressional appropriations to be tracked and requires agencies to explain what they’re spending taxpayer money on. \n\n“So we made those changes to the system. They weren’t there before. I think those changes will remain,” Musk mused.","summary":"“My companies are suffering because I'm in the government.

A Democrat win could lead to redistricting that might secure a majority for them in the House by 2026.\n\nSeizing the opportunity to attack Trump, Walz accused the administration of “restricting the vote” with its recent executive order aimed at ensuring only American citizens cast ballots. The order, signed Tuesday, mandates that the Election Assistance Commission update voter registration forms to require proof of citizenship.\n\n“We see one of the first things they do is try and restrict the vote,” Walz ranted. “I don’t know what the answer is on this, but I’m kind of—I’ve been saying this: I think we need a shadow government, so when all these things come up every single day, we’ve got an alternate press conference telling the truth about what things are happening, tell them what’s going on.”\n\nUnhinged loser @GovTimWalz wants to form a “shadow government” in protest of requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and banning foreign nationals from interfering in elections: pic.twitter.com/fgcvDwYmVC\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) March 28, 2025\n\nWhat Walz is proposing isn’t just political theater—it’s a direct assault on democracy. After losing the 2024 election in a landslide to Trump and Vice President JD Vance—who secured 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris and Walz’s measly 226—the Democrats are scrambling to claw back power by any means necessary.\n\nUnable to accept the voters’ rejection of their radical agenda, Walz now wants an unelected cabal to run a parallel government, complete with its own propaganda arm to drown out the duly elected administration.

How are we the public to trust you or CBS to report on Bezos’ gutting WaPo knowing he gave you a ride to space?”\n\n“Your very own Gayle King is supporting a man shutting down free speech and a free press,” said another person, while another yet another pointed out: “You know what he stands for. That you are willingly participating is mind boggling and deeply disappointing.”\n\nCritics say that Bezos is not some neutral, nonpartisan business leader offering cool rides into space. The billionaire owner of Amazon, the Washington Post and Blue Origin has very much inserted himself into the current political discourse and become a polarizing national public figure. He also needs to promote his Blue Origin space technology business.\n\nBezos first tried to influence public opinion by killing the Post’s ready-to-publish endorsement of Kamala Harris before the Nov. 5 election. Since then, he has initiated a rightward tilt of the newspaper’s once vaunted opinion section, in what departing Post columnist Ruth Marcus said is a bid “to cozy up to” and appease the new president by suppressing writers’ viewpoints.\n\nCritics also note that Bezos has been labeled by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and many others on the left as one of America’s new ruling class of oligarchs. In a speech on the Senate floor, Sanders talked about how Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and tech moguls view themselves as “modern-day kings” who have embraced Trump’s election and even his move toward “authoritarianism” because it benefits their ability to make more money and wield cultural influence. Sanders and others also excoriated Bezos and Sanchez’s participation in Trump’s inauguration, creating what Marcus called “a spectacle” of tycoons “arrayed like so many trophies behind the triumphant new president.”\n\nAmid all these concerns about Bezos, the “oligarchy” and his “gutting” of the Post, King has appeared in multiple segments on “CBS Mornings” to promote Bezos’s Blue Origin, most recently on Thursday, when she laughed and chit-chatted with 94-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner about his 2021 ride on a Bezos rocket, People reported. \n\nKing also has posted multiple social media messages, including Friday, to promote her flight into space, which is scheduled to take place April 14. She’ll be riding with Sanchez, as well as with Sanchez’s good friend, singer Katy Perry, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe and several other women.\n\nIt’s not known whether Bezos is hosting King’s ride, with NBC reporting that tickets for the 11-minute Blue Origin journeys typically cost in the six figures. If CBS paid for King’s ticket, one still has to wonder about the news value of an event that is being criticized as a publicity stunt for a controversial public figure.\n\nIf Bezos is hosting King, former CNN media analyst Oliver Darcy wrote on his Status Substack that this “freebie” ride would appear to be “a conflict of interest.” Darcy noted that CBS News has strict policies against anchors accepting “bribes, gifts and freebies,” so as to avoid a potential or perceived conflict of interest.\n\nThe Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics also says that journalists should strive to act independently by “avoiding conflicts of interest, real or perceived,” and by refusing “gifts, favors, fees, free travel and special treatment.” They also should avoid “political and other outside activities that may compromise integrity or impartiality or may damage credibility.”\n\nDarcy asked who at CBS News gave a green light to King’s trip. Representatives at CBS News and CBS Mornings did not respond to an email request from this news organization seeking comment on King’s space voyage or the decision-making behind it.\n\nBut viewers of “CBS Mornings” and self-described King fans had plenty to say on Instagram in late February. They accused King of showing self-interest, lack of concern about press freedom and seeming complicity in Bezos and Sanchez’s efforts to garner positive publicity.\n\n“I always stuck with ‘CBS Mornings’ but ‘GMA’ here I come,” a now-former King fan said. “That you and the other participants can help this Trump supporter billionaire fulfill his dreams while he’s destroying the dreams of the working class is outrageous!”\n\n“This is beyond disappointing,” another person said. “As a journalist, you would think Gayle would be concerned with the decisions Bezos has made with the Washington Post.”\n\nThis commenter also said that King is in a position to make a difference and stand on principle but instead is “showing what matters most and it has nothing to do with those of us that have been supportive of her throughout her career. Another one bites the dust…bye Felicia.”\n\n“How tone-deaf are you?” asked another person. “Thanks for empowering billionaires and MAGA bull —- yet again. And no matter how you spin it, shame on you.”\n\nSomeone else said they were disappointed but not surprised by King’s actions: “This is who Gayle King is Just another celebrity journalist that can be bought. Nothing new to see here.”","summary":"King's journalistic ethics are under fire over her participation in a 'PR stunt' on behalf of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, in the wake of his 'gutting' of the Washington Post and their friendliness with Trump.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/28/cbs-gayle-king-slammed-oligarch-jeff-bezos-rocket/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GayleKing1.jpeg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 22:41:56","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.184},{"id":305503192,"title":"Is the auto union leader’s surprising shift a game changer for labor politics?","text":"President Trump’s approach to auto import tariffs is reshaping the landscape of organized labor and working-class politics in the United States. His administration is actively highlighting supportive remarks from United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain, who previously expressed his preference for Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump for the 2024 election. While some Democrats from auto-centric states have backed Trump’s tariffs, viewing them as beneficial for domestic auto manufacturing jobs, others have voiced concerns about potential inflation and increased consumer costs stemming from a trade war. The long-term repercussions of Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles remain uncertain, as do the impacts of additional tariffs targeting imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. This political turmoil underscores Trump’s efforts to redefine party affiliations as he heads into the 2024 elections, with potential implications for the upcoming 2026 midterms.\n\nShifting Alliances Among Labor Leaders\n\nIn his recent comments, Fain emphasized the UAW’s autonomy, stating that the union’s concerns transcend party politics. He lauded the current administration for addressing what he called the “free-trade disaster” that has adversely affected working-class communities over the years. Despite having criticized Trump during his presidency for inaction on labor issues, Fain’s recent shift signals a potential re-evaluation of support as he acknowledges the administration’s stance on tariffs.\n\nMixed Reactions from Democratic Lawmakers\n\nWhile some Democrats, such as Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, have cautiously celebrated the tariffs as a necessary first step, there remains a divided sentiment among party members. Many lawmakers are advocating for a clearer understanding of the tariff implications, as the auto industry relies heavily on international parts. The historical alignment of labor with Democrats has been challenged, particularly since the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement reshaped industry norms. Trump’s advocacy for union support and his appeal to non-union workers present a significant shift in the political dialogue surrounding trade and labor.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of Trade Relationships\n\nLawmakers and economists express skepticism regarding the ability of businesses to adapt to Trump’s unpredictable tariff strategy. Questions about the stability of U.S. trading relationships linger as companies navigate the complexities of potential price hikes and supply chain disruptions. Some advocates, like Sen. John Fetterman, point to the need for consistent and fair trade policies to foster job growth in manufacturing sectors. As Democrats prepare to challenge the emergency tariffs posed on Canada, there are underlying tensions within the party regarding effective trade strategies.\n\nThe Fight for Workers’ Rights\n\nFain’s support for tariffs is seen as part of a broader call for enhanced rights and protections for workers, including strong support for the National Labor Relations Board and improved healthcare access. However, this outlook may lead to conflicts with Trump’s policies, especially with the president facing ongoing legal challenges regarding labor leadership appointments. The dialogue surrounding labor and trade is increasingly fraught with complexities, as Fain criticizes Democrats for their fundraising reliance on wealthy donors while questioning their commitment to working-class interests.","summary":"President Trump&#8217;s approach to auto import tariffs is reshaping the landscape of organized labor and working-class politics in the United States.

The election, which will be held Tuesday, will sway the makeup of the court, which will soon be responsible for redistricting the states. \n\nWhatever party wins the state’s supreme court race will almost certainly get a more favorable congressional map in the midterms, so Musk is dishing out millions to Wisconsinites in hopes to keep the state red. \n\n‘I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,’ the Tesla CEO wrote. \n\nEarlier in the day, just after midnight on Friday, the X owner published a similar post saying the weekend event will be ‘limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election.’\n\nHowever, his late night post quickly garnered backlash as Democrats and legal analysts slammed the bid as buying votes. \n\nThe Wisconsin Democratic party Chair Ben Wikler released a statement calling Musk’s original post ‘a blatant felony by offering money for votes.’ \n\n‘Elon Musk should be brought to justice of his illegal attempt to buy votes,’ Wikler’s statement continued. \n\nMusk has already spent over $20 million to support Republican Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel, the Wisconsin Democratic party claimed. A liberal judge on the bench is retiring. \n\n‘Musk: The Democrats are stealing the election! Also Musk: I’ll pay you a million bucks to vote for my candidate! The hypocrisy is wild,’ Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Kamala Harris advisor wrote on X. \n\nEven with Musk’s change of phrasing the billionaire’s offer for millions may still be illegal, some legal minds argue. \n\n‘Conditioning entry to this event and eligibility for the $1 million payout on whether someone has voted may violate Wisconsin law,’ Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer wrote of the giveaway on X.\n\n‘The law prohibits offering or giving anything of value to induce a person to vote,’ he continued. ‘Extending this offer now might unlawfully induce Wisconsinites who have not already voted to cast a ballot.’\n\nBut the Tesla CEO has already announced a winner in Wisconsin. \n\nEarlier this week, Musk announced a Green Bay man won $1 million for participating in America PAC’s efforts, though it was not clear who determined the winner. \n\nMusk’s multi-million dollar giveaway will not be his first. \n\nBefore the 2024 election, America PAC giveaway checks to individuals who signed a petition in support of the First Amendment. \n\nSince launching his PAC in spring 2024, Musk has poured hundreds of millions of his own cash into the group. \n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is the most expensive judicial race in history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. \n\nOver $81 million has been spent so far, the previous record was $51 million, which was the amount spent in the last Wisconsin Supreme Court election two years ago.","summary":"The world&#8217;s richest man, and Donald Trump&#8217;s best friend, Elon Musk is&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/heres-how-you-can-participate-in-elon-musks-2-million-giveaway/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 22:33:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":305324116,"title":"FCC Will Investigate Disney And ABC Over DEI Practices","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nThe chair of the Federal Communications Commission said on social media Friday he asked the enforcement bureau of the FCC to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over concerns that the company may have been “violating FCC equal employment opportunity” with its diversity equity and inclusion programs.\n\nFILE - Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, addresses the audience during the Walt ...

For decades, Disney focused on churning out box office and programming successes,” Carr wrote to Iger. “But then something changed. Disney now has been embroiled in rounds of controversy surrounding its DEI policies.”\n\nHas Trump Targeted Disney In The Past?\n\nTrump sued ABC News, which is owned by Disney, and George Stephanopoulos last year, arguing the network broadcast statements from Stephanopoulos that were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.” In the suit, Trump took issue with Stephanopoulos saying Trump was found “liable for rape” at least 10 times, when he was actually found liable for sexual assault. In December, Disney settled the suit and agreed to pay $15 million as a contribution to a “presidential foundation and museum” to be established by or for Trump in the future, along with $1 million for Trump’s attorneys’ fees. The settlement led to accusations that Disney had caved to Trump and that it could “embolden” Trump to file similar suits, The New York Times reported.\n\nWhat Is The Fcc?\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is a government agency designed to be an independent regulator of “interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.” It currently has three commissioners, two Democrats and one Republican though one of the Democratic commissioners just announced his resignation. Carr—a Trump appointee who previously served as a commissioner—is the chair.While the agency is supposed to be independent, it recently broke precedent by calling for an investigation into CBS’s “60 Minutes” for its interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, the same story Trump himself filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS over. When talking about the complaint, Carr said Trump was “ahead of the curve” and “has been right on these media bias issues,” Variety reported.\n\nHas Carr Launched Similar Investigations?\n\nYes. In February, Carr ordered a similar investigation into DEI programs at Comcast, the parent company of NBC and Universal Studios. Though not DEI based, Carr also launched investigations into NPR and PBS for corporate sponsorships of programming.\n\nKey Background\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office for his second term, Trump zeroed in on ending all DEI initiatives in both the public and private sectors. DEI policies rose in the U.S. in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd, but have come under fire in recent years from Republicans for being “woke.” On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that called for the elimination of all DEI programs in the federal government and the end of agencies considering diversity in hiring, and it threatened to punish some private entities that use them. The order said the government had been infiltrated with DEI programs and referenced an executive order from former President Joe Biden that called on federal agencies to address racial inequities. To respond to Trump’s calls to banish DEI from hiring practices and workplaces, dozens of companies and organizations—including Paramount, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and more—have been reframing or removing their policies in recent months. Most recently, the Major League Baseball association told the Associated Press it removed references to diversity from its website to comply with federal law, though it said the organization’s “values on diversity remain unchanged.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDisney Shifts Away From DEI To Return To Its Entertainment Business Mission (Forbes)\n\nMLB Removes References To Diversity From Careers Website: Here Are All The Companies Rolling Back DEI Programs (Forbes)\n\nABC News Pays $15 Million To Settle Donald Trump’s Defamation Suit (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

She was welcomed warmly, and attendees quickly leaked to the media that she \"looked great, very relaxed, almost like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\" Her party appearance was meant to be a prelude to her scheduled appearance at the Oscars, which would have been her most significant TV exposure since leaving Washington on January 20. After four years as vice president and an unprecedented 100-day presidential campaign that cost over a billion dollars and ended in a crushing defeat, Harris was set for a high-profile comeback. However, security concerns at the event led to the cancellation of her appearance. Instead, her husband, Doug Emhoff, posted a photo of her in a sweatshirt, preparing a bowl of Doritos to watch the ceremony from home. The Oscar weekend wasn’t a total loss. At the pre-Oscar party, Harris hinted at her next move, telling several people she would \"make a decision by the end of summer.\" What exactly that decision is remains unclear — even to her. \"She’s very slow to make decisions, sometimes excessively so,\" said a senior Democratic official. \"But if she wants to stay in politics, she’ll need to decide quickly because there’s a huge vacuum.\" On January 6, in her role as vice president, Harris officially certified Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. No mobs stormed the Capitol, no gallows were erected outside and no congressional offices were ransacked. Harris confirmed her defeat with the same composure she’s known for, never revealing what was happening beneath the surface. \"For president? I’m afraid she won’t be able to get there,\" said one Democratic strategist. \"But she got 75 million votes in a short, high-pressure campaign and earned a lot of goodwill by breathing life into Joe Biden’s dead race. We live in unprecedented times, so who knows?\" Afterward, she traveled to Hawaii to unwind with family and friends before returning to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. In the same Capitol where she certified Trump’s victory, she watched the new president deliver a speech devoid of magnanimity and filled with threats — threats he has since acted on. Between the time Harris and Emhoff left the vice president’s residence for the last time and the end of the inauguration, government workers efficiently scrubbed all traces of the previous tenants. Harris, sources said, left without sentimentality. She had always planned to leave that day, just under different circumstances — moving four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Naval Observatory to the White House. Instead, she found herself living out the real-life version of the famous meme of John Travolta looking lost in an empty room. \"There was no Plan B,\" said a Democratic activist. \"Her campaign team genuinely believed she was winning — a close victory, but a victory.\" Can Harris bounce back from a defeat like that? \"For president? I doubt it. But she got 75 million votes in a tough race and built goodwill by energizing Biden’s campaign. She may think she has one more run left in her. One thing is clear: when Harris said she wouldn’t go quietly into the night, she meant it.\" Immediately after Trump’s inauguration, as he signed executive orders undoing much of the administration Harris was part of, she boarded her final taxpayer-funded flight. Nearly six hours from Washington to Los Angeles is a long time to sit with your thoughts. If Harris broke down after the November loss, only her husband saw it. Two months later, on that flight back to California, there was an odd sense of relief. \"I’m staying in the fight,\" she assured her disheartened allies. \"No one in American political history can truly understand what Harris went through,\" Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told Politico. \"And I don’t envy her. She deserves time to process it.\" Donna Brazile, a close ally who ran Al Gore’s campaign — the last vice president to run for president and lose — agreed. \"She needs time to process what happened because it’s deeply personal. Despite the loss, she gained significant political capital. You don’t waste that by making rash decisions.\" Harris and Emhoff returned to their $4.8 million home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. It will remain their primary residence but sources say they’re looking for a second home in New York. While many neighbors were happy to see them, not everyone welcomed them back. \"I’m ashamed she lives in my neighborhood,\" a Trump voter told the New York Post. \"She should be in the White House, not here,\" said a Harris supporter. Of the two, Emhoff seemed more relieved to be back in L.A. The first-ever \"Second Gentleman\" had struggled with being a political spouse. He spoke candidly about his search for purpose in Washington, which he found in fighting antisemitism and teaching at Georgetown Law. Shortly after returning home, he resumed his entertainment law career, a job he reluctantly left when Harris became Biden’s running mate. In the early months of Trump’s presidency, Harris was rarely seen in public, except for occasional grocery runs with Emhoff. In late February, she made her first televised appearance since leaving the White House, accepting an honorary award from the NAACP. The audience gave her a long ovation, with some in tears. \"This organization was born when our nation struggled against greed, bitterness and hate,\" Harris told Black community leaders. \"Now, we again feel the weight of history. People see flames on the horizon, shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, ‘What do we do now?’ But we know exactly what to do — because we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again.\" That speech marked the beginning of her reemergence. Even before the NAACP event, she had attended two Broadway shows in one weekend, receiving applause similar to what Hillary Clinton experienced after losing to Trump in 2016. Broadway remains a safe haven for liberal politicians. For the first time in decades, Harris holds no public office, meaning she must build her own infrastructure for a comeback. To that end, she launched a company called Pioneer 49 to support her post-vice presidency career and potentially fuel her next political move. Pioneer was her Secret Service codename, and 49 reflects her status as the 49th vice president. She also signed with the top talent agency CAA for representation across various fields. Now, she just needs to decide what’s next. Harris has three main options: run for California governor in 2026, launch another presidential bid in 2028, or stay on the sidelines while leading the Democratic Party from the outside, making money in the private sector and writing cookbooks. The third option seems unlikely. \"She won’t stay quiet for long,\" said a former campaign aide. \"People will want to hear from her and she’ll be ready.\" Not by chance did Harris say she'd decide by summer what her next step would be. Summer is the time to enter the race for California governor, a race she's expected to win easily. “Can she run for governor? Yes,” Brian Brokaw, a former aide to Harris who remains close to her, told Politico. “Do I think she wants to run for governor? Probably not. Can she win? Absolutely. Does she want the job? I don’t know. Can she run for president again? Yes.” In conversations with associates, Harris has acknowledged how difficult it would be for her to win the presidential primaries in 2028 and has recalled that even as a young prosecutor, she expressed interest in becoming California’s governor. Now, she might find the idea especially tempting — leading the largest and most influential state in the U.S., she'd find herself clashing with Trump on nearly every issue. “Harris is disgusted by him,” said a Democratic activist. “Beyond the fact that he's a racist, she thinks — rightfully so — that his presence in the White House is a disgrace to the U.S. I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that she won’t be able to resist the temptation to battle him every day.” If this does happen, Harris will break another glass ceiling, becoming the first woman to serve as governor of California. As governor, she'd have plenty of opportunities to confront Trump. The main implication of entering the California race is that Harris would be giving up her presidential ambitions, at least for 2028. It’s impossible to both govern the world’s fifth-largest economy and run for president. The decision is harder than it seems. Those close to Harris believe that despite her election loss, she emerged from the experience stronger and won’t carry the toxic label that stuck to Hillary Clinton after her 2016 defeat. Just how toxic is that label? The only time Harris’s campaign used Clinton during the election was at a fundraiser in Florida — a state that wasn’t even competitive. Preliminary and largely irrelevant polls conducted in recent months have shown Harris with a significant lead over a long list of potential Democratic candidates, but there’s no reason to take them seriously just yet. “I don’t think she can win a presidential primary,” the Democratic activist said. “The party is so scared and weak right now that there's a better chance of the late Jimmy Carter becoming the nominee in 2028 than a Black woman. It’s unfair and depressing because no one in modern history has inherited a presidential candidacy just 100 days before an election and I don’t think any other candidate would have done better — but that’s where we are now. If she wants to stay in politics, the California governorship makes much more sense.” One thing Harris will definitely do is write a book, which has already generated enormous interest — even before she’s typed a single word. “Kamala is about to land the biggest book deal of any vice president in history,” Keith Urbahn, president and co-founder of the top literary agency Javelin, told NBC. “But the real question isn’t how much she’ll get upfront, but whether the book can redefine her ahead of the 2028 election. There’s one version of the book that’s full of clichés and plays it safe and there’s another that reinvents Harris to lead a party in need of rebuilding. She’ll get the same money either way but only the second version gives her another shot at the White House.” Biden may have publicly said that Harris had to do whatever it took to defeat Trump, but in private, he told her to ensure that “not even daylight could come between them” — in other words, not to distance herself from him. The desire among Harris’s supporters for her book to “burn it all down” also stems from post-election revelations about how Biden boxed her in. Harris is 60, still young enough, and Democrats are placing most of the blame for her loss on Biden, who entered the 2020 race as the party’s beloved savior and left office in January as a tragic figure. “It’s all on him,” the Democratic activist said angrily. “We could analyze Harris’s campaign mistakes until next year but she was thrown into an impossible situation created by Biden’s enormous ego. He should never have run again in the first place. We’re here because of Joe Biden and the small, insular circle around him. In fact, they’re even more to blame — they knew he shouldn’t run.” The question of how candid Harris can be in her upcoming book is tied to her decision about staying in politics and in what role. But her associates believe that at the very least, she must use the book to do what she didn’t in her campaign — sever all ties to Biden. “That was the biggest mistake of her life,” said the Democratic activist. “Every time I think about the chances she had to break away from him and present a completely new vision and she chose not to — my veins start popping.” Biden, it turns out, forbade Harris from creating any policy distance between them during the campaign. A new book by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” provides several examples of how Harris knew she needed to appear as a change agent compared to her deeply unpopular boss. But Biden had appointed her as his VP, quickly endorsed her candidacy, and in doing so, shut down any chance of a rapid primary — at the cost of her continued loyalty. While Biden publicly said that Harris had to do everything to defeat Trump, in private, he reminded her once again: “Not even daylight, kid.” That was a message Biden’s aides reinforced with Harris at nearly every stop, according to the book’s authors. For example, when Harris was preparing for her first joint television interview with her running mate, Tim Walz, veteran Democratic communications strategist Stephanie Cutter gave her a list of achievements she could say she was proud to have shared with Biden. Harris’s loyal adviser, Sean Clegg, pushed back: “Let’s not turn this into a memoir.” He was absent from the next round of media prep sessions. During the interview with CNN, Harris found herself reciting a laundry list of Biden’s policies. Even worse, she sat in a lower chair than Walz. That may sound petty, but the visual only reinforced the perception that she was afraid to answer tough questions about the White House’s policies over the past four years and that she wasn’t built for leadership. On the day of the infamous debate against Trump, Biden called Harris to wish her luck and once again stress the loyalty he expected. It took him just a few words to make it clear how important it was to him: “Not even daylight, kid.” Later, in one of the campaign’s pivotal moments, Harris said on The View that “I can’t think of anything I would have done differently from Biden.” In hindsight, of all the many reasons for Harris’s defeat, that may have been the most critical. At least six million people who voted for Biden in 2020 did not vote for Harris in 2024. Polls conducted since then repeatedly show that the main reason was Harris’s refusal to distance herself from Biden’s policies, both at home and abroad. “We played it too safe,” Tim Walz said last week in a media blitz aimed at 2028. “We should have gone to places that don’t like us, met voters and heard them yell at us. But we were always on the defensive. We played not to lose, even though I don’t think we were ever really ahead.” Walz revealed that since the election, he and Harris have spoken only twice. “I’m doing my job, and she’s doing hers. We had a professional relationship, I think we ended things well, and my family misses her. “She inspired me. When I found out that as a kid she was in a band and knew so much about music, I asked, ‘Why aren’t we running this in the campaign ads?’ I really regret that there’s so much America never knew about her — and we lost a great president.” Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram","summary":"Kamala Harris navigates a fraught path to political relevance, torn between leveraging her 75 million-vote base for a comeback and escaping the shadow of a presidency that left her campaign — and party — in disarray","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjwvvyz61g","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/18/HkxNcNCLhkl/HkxNcNCLhkl_0_0_1920_1080_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 21:04:34","author":"Tzippy Shmilovitz, New York","authors":["Tzippy Shmilovitz, New York"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":305304940,"title":"Ingenious reason behind Karoline Leavitt's 'frumpy' fashion... and subtle ways she's weaponized her wardrobe to send a secret message to critics","text":"Messaging for many of the men in Trump 2.0 has, at least in recent days, gone rather embarrassingly off the rails.\n\nFloundering explanations from the principals involved as to how Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added into a confidential Signal chat group have exposed the frailties of experienced men who should have known better.\n\nEnter Karoline Leavitt to pick up the pieces of this PR nightmare.\n\nArticulate, confident and fiery, this 27-year-old mother-of-one is not only the youngest White House Press Secretary to grace the iconic podium, she is surely the steeliest.\n\nJust two months into the role she has already demonstrated an unflinching capacity to go head-to-head with reporters that has left many a seasoned Washington veteran aghast.\n\nBut like most of the women who populate Trumpworld (and let's be honest – any world), this rising superstar in the MAGA ecosystem isn't just judged on her performance - she's judged on her clothes.\n\nToo conservative, too boring, too expensive, too matronly, too flashy – all are accusations that have been leveled in recent weeks at Leavitt who is, by any measure, atypical of Generation Z.\n\nBoxy blazers, boucle skirt suits and jersey minidresses, this is a wardrobe that is a world away from the couture creations worn by the Trump family itself.\n\nOn a salary of $180,000 a year Leavitt could hardly hope to compete with the financial demands of First Lady Melania's Dior-filled wardrobe, but she could certainly afford more aspirational, youthful choices.\n\nInstead, the sixth woman to hold the position since 2017 seems to have willfully ignored the examples of her predecessors (both on the Right and Left).\n\nEschewing the model-like propensities of Kayleigh McEnany, Leavitt has maintained a cautious and controlled formality – even frumpiness.\n\nHer look is as far removed from her former boss (Leavitt worked as McEnany's assistant in the first Trump administration) as it is from the kaleidoscope of colors and striking silhouettes that were a constant in the reigns of her Democratic forbearers Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nAnd it's all because Leavitt is a woman who has quickly recognized that the most powerful backdrop for a forceful message is an outfit that seems to say nothing at all.\n\nFinding her niche in styles which have ensured her words, rather than her wardrobe, do the talking point, Leavitt has – like Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, and current White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles – come to appreciate the value of a non-descript pantsuit.\n\nStepping up to the lectern for her very first press briefing, she chose a $109 purple blazer from Zara and coordinating $49.90 trousers that felt more schoolteacher than political powerhouse.\n\nHer black patent and rhinestone-studded Jimmy Choo pumps might have added a touch of youthful pizzaz to the conservative ensemble had it not been for the unusually large diamond cross that hung around her neck.\n\nIt was an unmissable and rather ostentatious reminder that Leavitt's star rose as a conservative firebrand at the Benedictine liberal arts college, Saint Anselm, in Goffstown, New Hampshire which she attended on a softball scholarship.\n\nHer passionate op-eds in the college newspaper defending the 2017 Trump travel ban paved the way for her political future and marked her out as curiously regressive amongst an overwhelmingly progressive majority.\n\nLeavitt has chosen to extend this winning formula through dress and has fully (and, I think, strategically) embraced a persona that is seemingly out of step with her generation and position.\n\nMarried to a man thirty-two years her senior and mother to an eight-month baby son, Leavitt is a full-on 'trad wife', except for the fact that she occupies one of the most powerful roles in American political life.\n\nResisting the urge to use the podium as a catwalk, Leavitt has astutely understood that her success lies in silhouettes that seem more appropriate to a woman approaching middle age than one on the verge of thirty.\n\nWhile opting in for full 'Republic glam' – glossy blond hair and skin smoother than her baby's bottom – and save for the occasional Louis Vuitton handbag or black leather dress (Super Bowl 2025), she has resisted the informality or unrestrained theatrics in which so many celebrities of her age indulge.\n\nIndeed, what might pass as her most fashion forward moments have been a series of shimmery boucle dresses from the British brand Self-Portrait.\n\nAt first glance depressingly bland, it's tempting see this choice of a brand once favored by the Princess of Wales as a courtly nod to the monarchical aspirations voiced by her presidential boss.\n\nBut however conservative Leavitt's dress sense she is, I believe, an enthusiastic innovator who has learned the lessons of her generation's social media moment.\n\nUnapologetic in her treatment of the traditional media outlets she dislikes, Leavitt has welcomed reporters from 'new media.'\n\nA catchall description for influencers and podcasters, this group have now been allocated front-row briefing room seats that were previously reserved for White House staff.\n\nLeavitt has used their presence just as powerfully as her microphone to champion a thus far winning political narrative - and largely because she has defied her critics to become one of the most effective exponents of the new administration.\n\nLeavitt has disguised her ingenuity in an unremarkable wardrobe, making her Trump's not-so-secret weapon who hides her power in plain sight.","summary":"Messaging for many of the men in Trump 2.0 has, at least in recent days, gone rather embarrassingly off the rails.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14547717/Karoline-Leavitts-frumpy-fashion-critics.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/15/96677357-0-image-m-49_1743175594005.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/19/8362160088159961604/1024x576_MP4_8362160088159961604.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-28 20:39:12","author":"Editor,Jane Marguerite Tippett","authors":["Editor","Jane Marguerite Tippett"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.07},{"id":305379498,"title":"Guest Opinion: Is the US entering a post-constitutional order?","text":"In feudal times, it was expected that vassals would kiss the ring of the lord of the manor to show loyalty and subservience to his power, to make it clear that they understood they belonged to him. I had thought those times were long gone, but apparently, they are with us again.\n\nAcross America, politicians, businesspeople and media tycoons are lining up to do a modern version of the same thing, but now it is with a president. This is not good for what is supposed to be a democratic republic.\n\nRepublicans led the way by showing up at various Trump trials to support their leader. They knew he was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused, but they showed up anyway. They said all of the right things — “the courts are biased against him” or “the deep state is after him.” However, the point of showing up was to curry favor with someone they expected to have power over them in the future.\n\nIt was a smart move. Trump has been ruthless in destroying the political futures of those Republicans who have shown him less than total personal loyalty, which involves embracing the big lie that Trump won the 2020 election. Those who have proven their loyalty are now being rewarded with positions in the new administration.\n\nLeading businesses are also jumping on the bandwagon, dismantling their companies’ diversity programs. They don’t actually believe these programs are wrong; they just know they will be targets if they don’t take action to please the new president. Trump and his supporters assert that DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) undermines merit, but Trump’s focus on loyalty is, as Jonathan Chait has pointed out, the true enemy of merit.\n\nThe most disturbing trend has been watching the media buckle out of fear. It began with Jeff Bezos overturning the decision of the Washington Post to endorse Kamala Harris for the presidency. He understood that the newspaper would pay dearly if it were to offend Trump by failing to endorse him.\n\nNow, Facebook has decided to end its independent fact-checking system. While that system was flawed, it was absolutely essential. As an article in the Wall Street Journal points out, last year Trump published a book about his first term in office with a picture of him with Mark Zuckerberg. The caption threatened, “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.” And by “illegal,” Trump meant “disloyal.”\n\nFact-checking by a private organization is not illegal. What Trump actually meant was that he would not tolerate Facebook calling him or his supporters out when they lied or made false claims on Facebook.\n\nZuckerberg understood that the threat was real and that it would not be enough to improve Facebook and eliminate some of its mistakes. He needed to demonstrate obsequiousness. He needed to be servile, to show that, like a vassal, he belongs to Trump. He needed to do the modern version of kissing his ring.\n\nTrump is pushing ahead feverishly to make personal loyalty to him the standard for our government, as is apparent when one reviews the poorly qualified appointments to Trump’s Cabinet who have been confirmed by the Senate and the mass firings by DOGE within the administration. They have nothing to do with eliminating waste, fraud or inefficiency and everything to do with replacing expertise in the bureaucracy with loyalty. As Anne Applebaum points out, this is central to autocracy.\n\nIf he succeeds, America will be fundamentally changed. People are nonetheless caving out of fear, doing whatever they can to show they support the president, who has made it clear he will ruthlessly pursue anyone who crosses him. They understand that Trump will not be bound by the Constitution by taking action against those who oppose him.\n\nThe Constitution is our democratic republic’s foundational law and the defining statement of our political principles. As our Pledge of Allegiance makes clear, our loyalty should be to the republic and not to a politician, no matter how powerful.\n\nJohn Adams, a leader of the American Revolution, our first vice president and our second president, famously said that we are a “government of laws, not men.”\n\nToday, we are seeing how quickly that can change. Have we reached what some have called a “post-constitutional order,” when personal loyalty to a politician replaces respect for and loyalty to the law?\n\nWe are left with a question: Will people rediscover their courage and the Constitution in time to prevent regime change in the United States?","summary":"In feudal times, it was expected that vassals would kiss the ring of the lord of the manor to show loyalty and subservience to his power, to make it clear that they understood they belonged to him.

District Court James Boasberg temporarily blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, a 18th-century wartime law, to arrest and deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nNow the president is accusing Boasberg of having a “conflict of interest” because of his past relationship with Harris’s husband, entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff.\n\nIn 2022, Boasberg participated in a mock trial with Emhoff. Trump posted a photo of Emhoff with Boasberg at the Shakespeare Theater Company’s (STC) 2022 Mock Trial on Truth Social.\n\n“SUCH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe mock trial was moderated by Abbe David Lowell, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s lawyer during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He was also Hunter Biden’s attorney amid legal battles related to a failure to pay his taxes and illegal possession of a firearm. In 1998, The Washington Post deemed Lowell the “Defender of Democrats in Trouble.”\n\nBoasberg was recently assigned to a lawsuit filed against some of the officials in the leaked Signal chat, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nThe editor-in-chief of The Atlantic was inadvertently added to a group chat about Houthi strikes on the messaging app Signal by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, according to a piece published Monday. (RELATED: Gregg Jarrett Says Defiant Lower Court Judges Better Learn That ‘An Alien Can Be Removed Without A Hearing’)\n\nBoasberg was appointed by former President Obama, and he has an extensive history of ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nBoasberg was the sentencing judge for FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who altered an email about former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in order to support a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application to spy on Page during the 2016 presidential campaign. Clinesmith was one of the key players in the FBI’s Operation Crossfire Hurricane, which investigated potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nProsecutors sought between three and six months in prison for Clinesmith, but Boasberg sentenced him to mere probation.\n\nBoasberg also approved the FBI’s use of a warrantless surveillance tool, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, when he presided over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in 2021.\n\nThis decision came after the court discovered the bureau had violated privacy rules regarding Section 702, according to The Washington Post.

In one instance in 2018, he sided with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and ruled against Trump’s efforts to detain migrants claiming asylum.\n\nHe was also involved in the eventual public disclosure of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Just before the 2016 election, Boasberg ruled that most of Hillary Clinton’s emails would not become public until after Election Day, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nHe ordered the State Department to complete the processing of 1,050 pages out of potentially 10,000 pages of evidence by November 4, according to the outlet.\n\nTrump blasted Judge Boasberg on Truth Social Thursday and called for an investigation.\n\n“There is no way for a Republican, especially a TRUMP REPUBLICAN, to win before him,” Trump said.\n\n“He is Highly Conflicted, not only in his hatred of me — Massive Trump Derangement Syndrome! — but also, because of disqualifying family conflicts.”\n\nBoasberg’s wife, Elizabeth “Liddy” Manson, has ties to Democratic causes. She donated to Democrats, including Elissa Slotkin for Congress in 2021, and the left-wing donation site ActBlue, FEC filings show.\n\nShe also founded an abortion clinic in Virginia called Meadow Reproductive Health and Wellness, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nWhile much of the attention has centered around Boasberg, he is not the only judge with a potential conflict of interest.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson was also at the mock trial with Doug Emhoff, and she donated to Democratic candidates.\n\nJackson donated $1000 to Bill Clinton in 1992 and $500 to Alex Sanders in 2002, according to Open Secrets. Both of the donations occurred before she was a U.S. district judge.\n\nJackson sentenced former Trump advisor Roger Stone to more than 3 years in prison in 2020 after he was charged with obstructing a congressional investigation and witness tampering.\n\nShe harshly criticized Trump and claimed he “propagat[ed] the lie that inspired [January 6],” CNN reported.\n\nJackson also temporarily reinstalled the head of the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC), Biden appointee Hampton Dellinger, after he was fired by Trump this year, according to The Hill.","summary":"Judges Blocking Trump's Immigration Order Have History Of Siding With Democrats","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/03/28/judge-james-boasberg-donald-trump-doug-emhoff-injunctions-tren-de-aragua/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2193527776-scaled-e1743101034473.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 20:29:05","author":"Eireann van Natta","authors":["Eireann van Natta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":305447416,"title":"FCC chair opens investigation into Disney and ABC for DEI practices","text":"The Federal Communications Commission has launched an investigation into Walt Disney Co. and its broadcast subsidiary ABC over the company's diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Chairman Brendan Carr said Friday. The investigation will \"ensure that Disney and ABC have not been violating FCC equal employment opportunity regulations by promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\" Carr wrote in a letter posted on X and addressed to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger. Though Carr noted that the company had recently softened some of its DEI efforts, including changing a performance standard titled \"diversity and inclusion\" that was used to calculate executive pay, he said \"significant concerns remain.\" \"I want to ensure that Disney ends any and all discriminatory initiatives in substance, not just name,\" he wrote. A Disney spokesperson said in a statement that the company was \"reviewing the Federal Communications Commission’s letter, and we look forward to engaging with the commission to answer its questions.” The Disney investigation comes about a month after Carr opened an inquiry into Comcast Corp.’s employee programs, stepping up the agency's efforts to “root out” diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that it said may violate equal employment laws. Comcast was the first media company to face such an inquiry. Disney appears to be the second. The Philadelphia-based Comcast previously said in a statement that it would be “cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions.” Under Carr, the FCC also reopened a news bias complaint against ABC News for its handling of the September debate between then-Vice President Kamala Harris and President Trump. Trump and other conservatives cried foul because debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis pushed back against Trump's inaccurate statements, including that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating people's pets. Conservatives complained that the network only fact-checked Trump, thus giving preferential treatment to the Democrat nominee, Harris. ABC News has defended its handling of the debate, which was the sole matchup between the two presidential candidates. Carr's predecessor, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel, had dismissed four open news bias complaints in the waning days of her term. Carr promptly reopened three of the complaints — against CBS News for its controversial \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, NBC for allowing Harris to appear on \"Saturday Night Live\" just days before the November election, and the complaint against ABC. Carr did not reopen a complaint against Fox that Rosenworcel had also dismissed. This is not Carr's first admonition of Disney. In December, Carr sent a letter to Iger, accusing ABC of contributing to an “erosion in public trust.” Conservatives, including Carr, say that liberal bias among the major news organizations, including ABC News, has caused viewers to lose faith in journalists. In December, Disney settled a defamation suit that Trump had filed against ABC and its news anchor George Stephanopoulos. Trump had filed the lawsuit last spring against ABC News and Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly said on air that Trump had been found liable for rape in an encounter with author E. Jean Carroll. The civil court jury determined Trump was liable for sexual abuse. Disney agreed to pay $15 million to settle the lawsuit, money that will go to build a future presidential library for Trump. Disney also agreed to pick up $1 million of Trump's legal fees.","summary":"Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has opened an inquiry into Disney and ABC's DEI programs, marking the second investigation of a major media company.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-03-28/fcc-chair-opens-investigation-into-disney-and-abc-for-dei-practices","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84f0170/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2048+0+440/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F4a%2F3118978e40188090d474a794f978%2Fla-photos-1staff-776","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 20:03:09","author":"Meg James,Samantha Masunaga","authors":["Meg James","Samantha Masunaga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":305296300,"title":"Law firm Skadden cuts $100 million pro bono deal with Trump to avoid executive order","text":"Washington — President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month.While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.","summary":"President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/law-firm-skadden-cuts-100-million-pro-bono-deal-trump-avoid-executive-order/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/03/28/132615dd-4ee9-4f3a-9630-f904e7e42e1d/thumbnail/1200x630/fa6ddae7dded7cb720d558d14f1f3a26/gettyimages-2207076290.jpg?v=95354023eeb6141c58c08d9a5716f291","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3640247_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-03-28 19:22:54","author":"Melissa Quinn","authors":["Melissa Quinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141}]}
