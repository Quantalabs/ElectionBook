The US presidential candidate’s Indian roots run deep, with her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, hailing from this very village: Thulasendrapuram. Harris has spoken fondly of her mother’s influence, immersing her in Indian culture and instilling values of social justice from a young age. “My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, travelling from India to California with an unshakeable dream,” Harris, 56, shared at the Democratic National Convention in August. “She taught us never to complain about injustice but to do something about it.” Gopalan was a breast cancer researcher who emigrated to the US in 1958. She died in 2009, aged 70. As Harris takes to the campaign trail, she has been cautious about highlighting her Indian identity, aware that it may not resonate with all voters – while her rival, Donald Trump, readily deploys racist dog whistles. Yet analysts predict that if she wins in November, Harris will likely emphasise her South Asian heritage to strengthen ties with India, a crucial US partner. “I think Harris is only likely to play up her South Asian identity if and after she wins, and not before,” said Vivek Mishra, a researcher of US-India relations and a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. Harris has already shown her commitment to democratic values, gently pressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi on India’s human rights record during their 2021 meeting in Washington. “I know from personal experience and from my family the commitment of the Indian people to democracy,” she said at the time, hinting at the work needed to uphold democratic values. Modi told Harris the people of India are “waiting to welcome you”, an invitation that will doubtless be renewed if she succeeds Joe Biden as US president. Despite criticisms from some Democrats about Modi’s human rights track record, Mishra said that many have embraced India as a crucial ally in the Indo-Pacific region. Echoes of Obama Experts say Harris’ Indian roots are likely to spark emotional connections in parts of India, much like Barack Obama’s Kenyan ties did in Africa. Obama also spent part of his childhood living in Indonesia and received warm receptions whenever he visited the Southeast Asian nation, with domestic news offering live coverage of him visiting his childhood home in Jakarta in 2017. A Harris victory might evoke similar sentiments in India. Residents of Thulasendrapuram celebrated her winning the vice-presidency four years ago, and the community now displays banners in support of her presidential bid. Harris “likes to highlight her Indian origins and especially her family and upbringing, but as with Obama and Kenya, that is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on policy outcomes,” said Dhruva Jaishankar, a foreign-policy specialist and executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America. Earlier this month, Harris shared a photo of her grandparents on social media to mark National Grandparents’ Day, recalling childhood visits to India that helped shape her political consciousness. Although her family ties may not significantly influence her broader policies towards Asia, they reinforce the narrative of the “American dream” and resonate with the Indian community in the United States, said Atul Mishra, an international-relations professor at Shiv Nadar University in India. “They may hold some sentimental value for her at the personal level and act as leverage in appealing to the Indian community at home, but I’m not sure if they will inform her approach to India and Asia at all,” he said. With Indian-Americans among the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the US – numbering 4.8 million as of the 2022 census – analysts say there’s a keen interest in seeing one of their own attain the highest office in the land. Her Indian roots could help strike a chord with Southeast Asia. It could certainly bear dividends Priyajit Debsarkar, geopolitical analyst “Harris’ connections with India are personal ties and run deep,” said Rafiq Dossani, an economist and analyst at the US-based RAND Centre for Asia-Pacific Policy. “Will that increase support for her in India? I think it definitely will.” However, Dossani remains sceptical about her appeal extending across Southeast Asia, despite the region’s historical connections to Indian culture. “I am less confident about Asia-wide support,” he said. Others argue that her Asian heritage could foster comfort among regional leaders in dealing with a potential Harris White House. “Her Indian roots could help strike a chord with Southeast Asia,” said Priyajit Debsarkar, a London-based geopolitical analyst and author. “It could certainly bear dividends if she works hard to cement ties that she has arduously tried to build through [regional] trips during her tenure as vice-president.”","summary":"Harris’ embrace of her South Asian identity not only mirrors Obama’s Southeast Asian ties, it could enhance US-India relations if she wins.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3279374/kamala-harris-indian-roots-echo-obamas-global-appeal-race-against-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/20/4e1efe31-da24-4cbc-8264-08b38a257574_51bb557a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 00:00:17","author":"Amy Sood,Biman Mukherji,Maria Siow","authors":["Amy Sood","Biman Mukherji","Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.235},{"id":257032718,"title":"Headline goes here","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Streaming Reality Daytime Film Soaps My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Sep 23rd 2024 1AM 13°C 4AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Antiques Roadshow guest STUNNED to discover the HUGE value of Louis Vuitton trunk which her father would stand on while painting the ceiling Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:21:52 BST, 22 September 2024 |Updated:00:59 BST, 23 September 2024 e-mail 21 shares 25 View comments An Antiques Roadshow guest was left stunned to discover the huge value of a Louis Vuitton trunk which had spent decades in her parent's attic. Sunday's show saw members of the public bring their treasured items to Thirlestane Castle in Scotland, with one lady keen to learn more about the designer accessory. Expert Raj Bisram recognised the luxury brand immediately as the guest told him: ' I think [my father] used it to stand on while decorating and painting the ceiling'. 'Nobody thought it was of any value, then someone opened the chest and looked inside [at the label] and thought \"that sounds really familiar\"'. After admitting she knew little about handbag manufacturer Louis Vuitton Raj explained: 'They actually started off making trunks, they started in 1884 in Paris'. An Antiques Roadshow guest was left stunned to discover the huge value of a Louis Vuitton trunk which had spent decades in her parent's attic Sunday's show saw members of the public bring their treasured items to Thirlestane Castle in Scotland, with one lady keen to learn more about the designer accessory Expert Raj Bisram recognised the luxury brand immediately as the guest told him: ' I think [my father] used it to stand on while decorating and painting the ceiling' He revealed how the lock system that was invented at the time is still used by the company today and even outsmarted famed magician Harry Houdini. Read More BBC Antiques Roadshow expert is shocked by guest's historical artefact before telling them they 'won't be pleased' by what he has to say Raj went on to explain how the trunk was one of the brand's first as it was missing it's now infamous LV logo, which was created in 1896. 'In this condition, a chest like this, is definitely worth somewhere between £1,500 and £2,000'. Shocked the woman was lost for words and giggled before admitting: 'It has a lot of sentimental value and despite the valuation it means a lot'. It comes after another show guest was lost for words when Expert Mark Smith met one man whose father was an SAS soldier as he showcased his paperwork, medals and badges - which are often 'faked all across the world'. The man showed a black and white photograph of his father, called David Cargill, before being sent to France with the BEF. Impressed by the collection on the table, Mark said: 'You said to me this morning 'my dad was a soldier' then you started to get this stuff out and I got so excited because this man was in the SAS, this is fantastic.' 'We have a Territorial medal here. He went to France and he starts off his war by coming off a beach, somewhere called Dunkirk because he has the Dunkirk medal as well. What did he join then?' He said: 'In this condition, a chest like this, is definitely worth somewhere between £1,500 and £2,000' Shocked the woman was lost for words and giggled before admitting: 'It has a lot of sentimental value and despite the valuation it means a lot' Raj went on to explain how the trunk was one of the brand's first as it was missing it's now infamous LV logo, which was created in 1896 The brand is now beloved by celebs (Sabrina Carpenter pictured at Louis Vuitton's show in Paris) The guest replied: 'He joined the Parachute Regiment, did his training and once he'd got his wings, he immediately volunteered for SAS and was accepted.' Mark continued: 'Now, when you see these badges and things that you have here and you see SAS wings, usually they are fake. You have a Kings Crown Parachute Regiment badge. 'Even they today are hard to find and usually they are copied as well. You then have two of the shoulder titles for the 1st SAS. Now, I'm not certain that I've ever seen those before, in the flesh to actually touch them but there they are.' Mark was particularly impressed at the beret that belonged to the guests father as it obtained genuine details, including the little badge that he said was often 'faked all across the world'. It comes after another Antiques Roadshow guest was lost for word when the show visited Dundee Expert Mark Smith met one man whose father was an SAS soldier as he showcased his paperwork, medals and badges Mark added: 'These things just don't come on the market, so to actually be able to stand here and touch the real thing, it's fantastic!' Putting a value on the items, the BBC star said the medals alone were worth around £200, with the full collection worth close to £8,000. The guest was stunned by the valuation and said to Mark: 'My father would be very surprised.'

Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:21:52 BST, 22 September 2024 |Updated:00:59 BST, 23 September 2024 e-mail 21 shares 25 View comments An Antiques Roadshow guest was left stunned to discover the huge value of a Louis Vuitton trunk which had spent decades in her parent's attic. Sunday's show saw members of the public bring their treasured items to Thirlestane Castle in Scotland, with one lady keen to learn more about the designer accessory. Expert Raj Bisram recognised the luxury brand immediately as the guest told him: ' I think [my father] used it to stand on while decorating and painting the ceiling'. 'Nobody thought it was of any value, then someone opened the chest and looked inside [at the label] and thought \"that sounds really familiar\"'. After admitting she knew little about handbag manufacturer Louis Vuitton Raj explained: 'They actually started off making trunks, they started in 1884 in Paris'. An Antiques Roadshow guest was left stunned to discover the huge value of a Louis Vuitton trunk which had spent decades in her parent's attic Sunday's show saw members of the public bring their treasured items to Thirlestane Castle in Scotland, with one lady keen to learn more about the designer accessory Expert Raj Bisram recognised the luxury brand immediately as the guest told him: ' I think [my father] used it to stand on while decorating and painting the ceiling' He revealed how the lock system that was invented at the time is still used by the company today and even outsmarted famed magician Harry Houdini. Read More BBC Antiques Roadshow expert is shocked by guest's historical artefact before telling them they 'won't be pleased' by what he has to say Raj went on to explain how the trunk was one of the brand's first as it was missing it's now infamous LV logo, which was created in 1896. 'In this condition, a chest like this, is definitely worth somewhere between £1,500 and £2,000'. Shocked the woman was lost for words and giggled before admitting: 'It has a lot of sentimental value and despite the valuation it means a lot'. It comes after another show guest was lost for words when Expert Mark Smith met one man whose father was an SAS soldier as he showcased his paperwork, medals and badges - which are often 'faked all across the world'. The man showed a black and white photograph of his father, called David Cargill, before being sent to France with the BEF. Impressed by the collection on the table, Mark said: 'You said to me this morning 'my dad was a soldier' then you started to get this stuff out and I got so excited because this man was in the SAS, this is fantastic.' 'We have a Territorial medal here. He went to France and he starts off his war by coming off a beach, somewhere called Dunkirk because he has the Dunkirk medal as well. What did he join then?' He said: 'In this condition, a chest like this, is definitely worth somewhere between £1,500 and £2,000' Shocked the woman was lost for words and giggled before admitting: 'It has a lot of sentimental value and despite the valuation it means a lot' Raj went on to explain how the trunk was one of the brand's first as it was missing it's now infamous LV logo, which was created in 1896 The brand is now beloved by celebs (Sabrina Carpenter pictured at Louis Vuitton's show in Paris) The guest replied: 'He joined the Parachute Regiment, did his training and once he'd got his wings, he immediately volunteered for SAS and was accepted.' Mark continued: 'Now, when you see these badges and things that you have here and you see SAS wings, usually they are fake. You have a Kings Crown Parachute Regiment badge. 'Even they today are hard to find and usually they are copied as well. You then have two of the shoulder titles for the 1st SAS. Now, I'm not certain that I've ever seen those before, in the flesh to actually touch them but there they are.' Mark was particularly impressed at the beret that belonged to the guests father as it obtained genuine details, including the little badge that he said was often 'faked all across the world'. It comes after another Antiques Roadshow guest was lost for word when the show visited Dundee Expert Mark Smith met one man whose father was an SAS soldier as he showcased his paperwork, medals and badges Mark added: 'These things just don't come on the market, so to actually be able to stand here and touch the real thing, it's fantastic!' Putting a value on the items, the BBC star said the medals alone were worth around £200, with the full collection worth close to £8,000. The guest was stunned by the valuation and said to Mark: 'My father would be very surprised.'

While Harris is considered a severe underdog in Montana, Democrats are still hoping they can voters to turn out to save incumbent Senator Jon Tester against Donald Trump-endorsed Tim Sheehy. Max Himsl, a voter living in the United Kingdom, wanted to make his choice once the ballots were online on Friday at 8am. The ballot listed both Trump and the now out of the race independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but not the vice president. Himsl said: ‘I’m upset my democratic process was interrupted’. The Montana Secretary of State claims that the errors were only found in their online system. ‘Our team and the vendor quickly investigated and found that only a few voters may have been impacted,’ the Secretary of State’s Office told the Daily Inter Lake. ‘As a precaution, the Electronic Absentee System has been taken offline until troubleshooting is completed.’ They promised that the system would be back online shortly after they’d taken it down. The voters impacted will be allowed to complete their ballots once it returns to functioning. ‘This does not affect any other ballots, including those that will be sent by mail,’ the Secretary of State’s Office said. Himsl, a first-time absentee voter, is worried about what this experience might mean for others. ‘This is very concerning to me,’ said Himsl. Citizens living overseas, including members of the armed forces, are allowed by law to vote absentee in elections. In Montana, a functioning absentee system allows them to vote starting 45 days until Election Day. While Democrats aren’t expected to come close in the presidential race, they’re still hoping to keep Tester in the Senate. Cook Political Report rates Tester’s race a ‘toss up,’ and former President Donald Trump won Montana by more than 16 points in 2020. Tester has held the Montana seat since 2007, in a state that heavily backed Trump during the 2020 election. Republicans see the battle as crucial to their hopes of taking control of the Senate. They expect to pick up a seat in West Virginia, where Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin is retiring, and need just one more to secure a majority in the upper chamber. The result is that millions of dollars is pouring into the battle between Tester and Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Latest campaign finance report show Tester has raised more than $43.7, a record amount, and three times more than he had collected by this stage in his 2018 race. Sheehy has raised $13.7 million since entering the contest a year ago. The importance of the race will be on full display on Friday, when former President Donald Trump holds a rally in support of Sheehy. He won the state by more than 16 points in 2020 and by more than 20 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe state of Montana took its electronic absentee voting system offline shortly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: State forced to shut down electronic polling system due to voting chaos caused by omission of major candidate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/state-forced-to-shut-down-electronic-polling-system-due-to-voting-chaos-caused-by-omission-of-major-candidate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Voting-chaos-as-state-is-forced-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:50:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.454},{"id":257031972,"title":"Letters to the Editor, Sept. 23, 2024","text":"Gabriel Vandermaarel Brantford, Ont.

After all, the vicious, unrelenting vitriol continues to be unleashed on Trump by high-ranking Democrats, including Kamala Harris, and mainstream media outlets like CNN, MSNBC and ABC. According to these underhanded zealots, Trump is another Hitler, a threat to democracy, a racist, a misogynist, and a dictator. This repugnant character assassination rolls on unabated. Is it any wonder that some nutcase feels justified in killing Trump? One must legitimately wonder if the Democrats and their media outlets are deliberately disseminating this acrimonious attack on Trump in the hopes that he is assassinated. After all, do the majority of Americans have any faith in the policies of the cackling Harris and the left-wing lunatic Walz? If Trump is somehow eliminated, that would plunge the Republicans into a state of disarray, paving the way for a Democrat victory in November. Harley Whitlock Brantford, Ont.

The rally, held at Federal Plaza in the Loop, was organized by the Coalition of Haitian American Organizations in the Chicagoland Area. About 25 people attended and several community members, faith leaders and alderpersons spoke despite the afternoon’s persistent rain. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate against Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated the false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing and eating people’s cats and dogs. Many of Sunday’s speakers denounced the comments as racist and xenophobic. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has amplified debunked internet rumors about Haitian migrants as the Republican ticket criticizes the immigration policies of President Joe Biden’s administration that are supported by Harris. City officials acknowledge growing pains from the influx of some 15,000 Haitian immigrants, but say there’s no evidence to support the claim they are consuming anyone’s pets. More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since last week, forcing evacuations and closures. At Sunday’s rally in Chicago, Daniel Jean, president of the Haitian American Professional Network of Chicago, said: “I stand with all my Haitian brothers and sisters across the country and all the way to Haiti to denounce the hateful remarks that are being levied against our people. “We deserve so much better,” Jean said. “One way to combat Haitian hate is to educate ourselves and to continue to educate other people about Haitian history, our culture and all of our contributions that we have continually made to this country.” Jean listed several key Haitian Americans. Chicago’s founder, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, was Haitian, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is the child of Haitian immigrants, Jean said. “You know who we are,” he said to cheers from the crowd. Darryl Auguste attended the rally to show support for the strong Haitian community that raised him. His parents emigrated from Haiti to Chicago before he was born. “The importance of this rally is not simply the fact that we are fighting against words that were harmful, but we’re supporting those that are helping to build us,” Auguste told the Sun-Times. “I know without my community, that I would not be where I’m at.” Auguste said that although Sunday’s rally was organized to call out hate and ignorance, it was also a chance to honor the contributions Haitians make to Chicago and the rest of the country. “As a Haitian American, I’m celebrating everything about me, both the Haitian side and the American side,” Auguste said. “I want everybody to see that we come here, and we help build this beautiful fabric that is the United States.” Contributing: Associated Press","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2024/09/22/haiti-immigrants-trump-vance-ohio-campaign-chicago-immigrants","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7cdfe89/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe8%2F43%2Fd5da9ef596d4e0bbb0c822502a2e%2F40d8","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:46:14","author":"Kaitlin Washburn","authors":["Kaitlin Washburn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":257032078,"title":"Mark Robinson sees NC campaign staff quit in droves after damning CNN report","text":"Embattled North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson is reportedly down to just a single-digit number of paid campaign staffers after the bulk of his team abandoned his bid for the governor’s office in the wake of a damaging CNN investigation. Robinson was the focus of an investigation by the network’s KFile unit on Thursday. A report published by CNN revealed an extensive history of comments made on a porn site called “Nude Africa” under an email address and username both known to be linked to him. The comments, which touched on a wide range of topics, were outrageous and shocking — in one, he apparently referred to himself as a “Black Nazi.” Though Robinson posted a video message on Thursday denying making the comments, he has faced calls from his fellow Republicans to prove that CNN defamed him with false information or drop out of the race. And over the weekend, his problems multiplied. A statement from the Robinson campaign Sunday afternoon indicated that his entire senior staff had resigned. WUNC further reported that the resignations were much deeper than the statement admitted. According to the news outlet, just three paid staffers remain employed by the Robinson campaign as of Sunday evening. Robinson has denied that he would drop out of the race and accused Democrats of manufacturing the allegations. But conservative operatives tuned into the race reacted to the news not with surprise but with resignation this past week as many seemed to indicate that the lion’s share of the accusations had been circulating in private for months. He “has long been toast,” Doug Heye, a longtime Republican operative from North Carolina, told The Independent on Thursday via text message. He noted how the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign, was “very nervous about how [the story] impacts him.” The extent of Robinson’s reported comments was shocking by itself. Aside from his comments about racial demographics, which are reportedly quite extensive in their own right, the North Carolina Republican opined about loving porn involving transgender Americans, despite publicly being an opponent of transgender rights and same-sex marriage. There were also comments made by the Robinson-linked account describing the poster’s own sexual tendencies and even claiming a sexual relationship with his wife’s sister. Beyond that, the poster alleged to have spied on women and girls changing in a locker room without their knowledge or consent. Publication of CNN’s investigation was a nightmare scenario for Robinson, who was already trailing his opponent Josh Stein in the North Carolina gubernatorial race by the high single digits, according to most polling. Now, Trump’s campaign (which had endorsed him) is publicly backing away from him at the worst possible time; Trump himself did not invite Robinson to a rally in the state on Saturday, with reports indicating that his campaign knew the story was coming. North Carolina is a key battleground state in the presidential race as well that Trump won by less than two percentage points in 2020. Kamala Harris, who took over the top of the Democratic ticket in July, has shrunk her opponent’s lead to a similar margin in available polling since entering the race.","summary":"Robinson ‘down to just 3 staffers’ after mass resignations in wake of CNN report","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-robinson-campaign-staff-quit-nc-b2617186.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/19/21/Mark-Robinson-appears-on-stage-at-the-Republican-National-Convention.00_00_46_12.Still002.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:42:46","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":257032752,"title":"“Donald Trump Won’t Run in 2028 if He Loses the 2024 Election”","text":"Donald Trump said that he won’t run for president if he loses to Kamala Harris this cycle. “No I don’t,” Trump told Full Measure host Sharyl Attkisson, who asked him whether he would wage another White House bid if he is not successful. “That will be it.

He now faces Vice President Kamala Harris for a second, four-year term in office. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump campaign for clarification on the former president's comments. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Trump's statements. With over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a number of public opinion polls agree that the race in key battleground states that will decide the 2024 Presidential election is within the margin-of-error. WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN The polls also show Harris has a healthy advantage among voters when it comes to the issue of abortion, while Trump has an equally large margin in dealing with the border and immigration. When it comes to the economy, the polls show the issue remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in November. A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits. HEAD HERE FOR ALL THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION Trump spoke with Attkisson about several issues, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said he did \"an amazing job\" handling. \"I never got the credit for it. Remember that more people died under Biden-Harris than died under Trump,\" he said. \"And they had a much easier time because when it came in here, nobody knew what it was. It came from the Wuhan labs, which I always said. But nobody really knew what it was, where it came from…nothing. They knew nothing, and we got hit.\" Trump also said he got credit with the military and knocking out ISIS, saying, \"we rebuilt the military.\" TRUMP VOWS TOUGH APPROACH TO SANCTUARY POLICIES After speaking about his accomplishments, Attkisson asked him what he does to stay healthy. \"I used to play golf a little bit…but it seems to be quite a dangerous sport, in retrospect,\" Trump said, referring to a recent incident in which a man hid in the bushes with a gun before being shot at by Secret Service and fleeing. The man was later arrested, and the matter is being handled as an assassination attempt on Trump. \"I try and eat properly,\" Trump told Attkisson, getting back to her question.

(AP) — Several top staffers in North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson’s campaign for governor have quit their posts, marking more fallout from a CNN report outlining evidence that he made disturbing posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. The campaign said in a news release Sunday that senior adviser Conrad Pogorzelski III, campaign manager Chris Rodriguez, the campaign’s finance director and a deputy campaign manager “have stepped down from their roles with the campaign.” Information on new campaign staffers would be forthcoming soon, the release said. “I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors,” Robinson said in the release. Pogorzelski, who helped Robinson get elected lieutenant governor in 2020 in his first bid for public office and later became his chief of staff, said separately on Sunday that additional staffers also left the campaign, including the deputy finance director, two political directors and the director of operations. Pogorzelski, in a text, said that he “along with others from the campaign have left of our own accord.” The CNN report on Thursday unearthed past posts it said Robinson left on a porn site’s message boards in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI;” said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as “worse than a maggot.” Robinson denied writing the posts and said Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” He avoided directly discussing the controversy during a gubernatorial campaign event on Saturday evening at a race track in Fayetteville. The event happened after earlier in the day former President Donald Trump didn’t mention Robinson at a rally about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Wilmington. Before Saturday, Robinson had been a frequent presence at Trump’s North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican presidential nominee has long praised Robinson — who would be North Carolina’s first Black governor if elected — calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids” for his speaking style. On Sunday, Robinson still expressed optimism that he could win in November over Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the sitting attorney general. Polls have shown Robinson trailing Stein. But Robinson said polls have “underestimated Republican support in North Carolina for several cycles,” and with a large portion of the electorate undecided “I am confident our campaign remains in a strong position to make our case to the voters and win on November 5.” Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down” and comparing abortion to slavery. Stein said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Robinson is “utterly unqualified, unfit to be the governor of North Carolina, and we’re going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening.” Polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race in North Carolina and nationally. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together and a new ad from Harris’ campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties, as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. On Sunday, Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Robinson deserves a chance to defend himself against the allegations, which Graham described as “unnerving.” He said Robinson is “a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that’s credible,” while arguing the issue wouldn’t hurt Trump. “If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” Graham said of Robinson and the claims in the CNN report. “If they’re not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That’s why I am committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all,” Harris said during a September 2019 appearance on the “Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon. Harris, who at the time was a California senator and running for the Democrat nomination for president, had touted her support for such a ban at other points in the campaign, including a CNN town hall earlier in the same month when she said there is “no question” that she was “in favor of banning fracking.” During her appearance on the “Tonight Show,” which was unearthed by conservative commentators over the weekend, Harris also expressed support for a Green New Deal, a controversial proposal popularized by progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. But the issue of a fracking ban has been the most sticky for Harris during her presidential campaign, with the vice president reversing her stance and vowing not to pursue a ban on fracking during an interview with CNN last month. “What I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,” Harris said. The issue of a fracking ban is of even more importance in the vital swing state of Pennsylvania, a state where the method of natural gas extraction is a source of employment and enjoys broad support. Harris currently holds a narrow lead of less than one point in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, coming in at 48.3% support to former President Trump’s 47.6%. Trump has seized on Harris’ previous push for a fracking ban in recent weeks, arguing during the debate last week that “fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one” if she is elected president.","summary":"\"Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our world today.

Lindsey Graham on Sunday said he is shocked by the “beyond unnerving” accusations against neighboring North Carolina gubernatorial hopeful and fellow GOPer Mark Robinson. “If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” the South Carolina pol bluntly told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they’re not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel.” Last week, Robinson, North Carolina’s first black lieutenant governor in the swing presidential state, denied a story from CNN claiming he made incendiary sexual and racially charged posts in the message board of the porn site Nude Africa between 2008 and 2012. Among the litany of claims were accusations that Robinson fashioned himself as a “Black Nazi,” said, “Slavery is not bad…I wish they would bring it back” and recalled “peeping” in on women the shower of a gym when he was a teenager. Robinson blasted the report as “salacious tabloid trash” in a firm denial. “Let me reassure you, the things that you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,” he said, vowing to stay in the race. Many top Republicans have echoed Graham’s sentiment that these are merely accusations against Robinson. But Graham also added, “He needs to do more, in my view. “He has a right to defend himself. He has an obligation to defend himself. This is hanging over his campaign. He’s a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that’s credible.” Republican vice presidential hopeful JD Vance, asked by an NBC reporter about the scandal, said of Robinson, “I don’t believe him, I don’t not believe him. “I just think that you have to sometimes let these things play out in the court of public opinion,” Vance said. The bombshell story rocked Republicans in North Carolina, where Robinson has long been trailing in the contest for governor. North Carolina is widely seen as one of the top seven battleground states in the presidential contest. The state last backed a Democrat in 2008. Former President Donald Trump has a threadbare lead of about 0.1 percentage points in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of a two-way race between him and Veep and Democratic foe Kamala Harris. Robinson is trailing Noth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein by 9.4 points, according to the latest RCP average. Stein has publicly doubted Robinson’s denial. “If you look at what he said on the posts, it was in keeping on what he has said publicly on Facebook that are still on his Facebook page,” Stein told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Mark Robinson is absolutely unfit to be the governor of North Carolina,” he continued. “Mark Robinson could not exist without the support of Donald Trump.” Incumbent North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), is term-limited, which had raised Republican hopes ahead of the election that they could flip the governor’s office red. Democrats have rejoiced over the scandal engulfing Robinson. “It’s great news for Democrats,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “I mean, Robinson is actually, he’s the new dream candidate to run against.”","summary":"\"He's a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that's credible,'' Graham said of Robinson.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/lindsey-graham-gives-take-on-allegations-against-mark-robinson/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/sen-lindsey-graham-says-embattled-90225516.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/l0Ig0r8V-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:04:48","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":257030502,"title":"Several Mark Robinson campaign staffers quit as fallout over online posts continues","text":"Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down” and comparing abortion to slavery.

Her pursuit of big business represents a policy shift after a decades-long FTC hands-off approach allowing most mergers and acquisitions. Under President Biden, however, the FTC and Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown and sued scores of big companies, including TicketMaster, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. Some worry going after tech giants could have a domino effect, destabilizing the economy.\"But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist,\" Khan said in a recent 60 Minutes interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl. \"And that creates a destabilization, too.\"The shift in antitrust policyThe Federal Trade Commission was established to protect consumers and promote competition between businesses.Since President Ronald Regan's time in the White House, antitrust regulators have done little to interfere in many mergers and acquisitions. It was a policy adopted by all presidents since then, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Then President Biden put an end to it. FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressives - and even some MAGA Republicans\"We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses,\" Mr. Biden said in 2021 — the same year he appointed Khan to the FTC. It's a revolution and Khan is its face. While still a law student, she wrote a paper for the Yale Law Journal called \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" contending that even though its prices are low, Amazon is still a monopoly. Less than five years later, President Biden made Khan, 32 at the time, head of the agency that polices Amazon. Taking on the Big Five tech companiesLast year, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust case against Amazon, alleging the retailing giant illegally wields monopoly power to maintain higher prices, hurting customers and weakening competition.\"Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off,\" Khan told 60 Minutes. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up.Khan and the FTC have blocked, or tried to block, a number of Silicon Valley's big companies from buying smaller companies. \"In the technology markets, we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm,\" Khan said. Khan said the FTC has identified a string of mergers that were not blocked or challenged by previous FTC administrations, even though the current FTC under her leadership — and operating under Biden's mandate — believe they are illegal.Confronting pushback from companies The courts don't always side with the FTC, and Khan lost a couple of big cases, including one against Microsoft and another against Meta.While Khan is feared and loathed in many corporate boardrooms, and even viewed by some as a zealot and a bully, she says the FTC is doing its job by enforcing the law, adding that of the thousands of deals proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate \"maybe 2% or 3%.\"That might not sound like a lot, but startup founders complain that she's spooking investors so much that she's stifling innovation. Others fear Khan chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, the stock market plunged after it was reported that Khan's counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed chip maker Nvidia.Khan is also facing lawsuits from corporations who want the FTC to be reined in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the agency.\"I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them,\" Khan said.Khan's fans — both liberals and conservativesEven while dealing with pushback, Khan has fervent admirers. She attends events around the country that she calls her \"listening tours.\" She's often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, progressive politicians and union members. She's also surprisingly popular with some MAGA Republicans. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, has expressed some admiration for Khan. \"I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue, to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies,\" he previously said.There's even a nickname for conservatives who support Khan: Khan-servatives. Still, Khan is unlikely to keep her job if former President Donald Trump wins the election. It's also unclear if Khan would keep her job if Vice President Kamala Harris wins. Some of Harris' biggest donors are people who want Khan out of the FTC. \"My focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV,\" Khan said. \"It's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise.\"","summary":"Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan has gone after some of the biggest companies in the U.S. Under President Biden, the FTC has cracked down on big companies they say are hurting consumers.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-trade-commission-lina-khan-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/22/95c757d8-8cee-4844-9656-43a591702e2b/thumbnail/1200x630/03607233944f28ec876a25167d048397/lina-khan-article1.jpg?v=159d4576ec63c034c87559bf5085176a","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/22/2374307395936/3212896_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-22 23:00:31","author":"Aliza Chasan,Lesley Stahl","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Lesley Stahl"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":257030356,"title":"RFK Jr. supporters in swing state could care less about sext scandal — and that’s good news for Trump","text":"LAS VEGAS — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s supporters in the swing state of Nevada are nonplussed about his reported sexting scandal — and that’s good news for the presidential hopeful he’s backing, Donald Trump. Kennedy, 70, got top billing at a Trump-sponsored “Restore America” rally in Vegas on Saturday night, drawing a standing-room-only crowd who either didn’t care — or didn’t even know — about the bombshell allegation. “I’m not familiar with that particular issue. I am with a lot of issues, but that one’s new to me,” said local Ken Czech, who was wearing a “Kennedy 24” t-shirt, a nod to the Kennedy scion’s failed attempt to run for president in November on the independent ticket. Kennedy, 70, who is married to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, 59, was allegedly involved in a newly revealed, seamy sexting relationship with New York magazine’s star political scribe Olivia Nuzzi, 31. Czech said he is more interested in Kennedy’s efforts to help Trump form a “unity party.’’ Retired Las Vegas court reporter Christine Johnson said reports of the scandal meant little to her, too. “I support RFK, and whatever his headlines are, they are,” she said of the politician, who threw his support behind Trump after backing out of the race. “People are going to put their own spin on it.” Charles Atwood Hightower, a retired US army sergeant first class and a contractor, said those criticizing Kennedy’s private life should “drop dead. “Your personal life is your personal life,” Hightower said. “God gave you that right.’’ Retired Judge Charles Weinberg slammed the sexting story as a joke. “I mean, there’s so much propaganda and false information out now. I think this guy’s a legit guy,’’ he said of Kennedy. Lawyer Gregory Brittain of Redlands, Cali., said that if the married Kennedy was “coming on to someone else, that would be inappropriate.” But “no one is perfect, and least of all the Democrats on the other side who do this, who, I was saying, the real racists and the real sexists are the Democrats who, who so strongly profess right, maybe for women and for the minorities,’’ Brittain said. The event, moderated by race-car driving personality Danica Patrick at a Las Vegas rec center, was Kennedy’s first public appearance since the scandal broke last week. He did not address it at the event. But he did wear his wedding ring, while Hines reportedly ditched hers for at least part of her Italian vacation at the same time. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an ex-Democrat from Hawaii, appeared with Kennedy at the rally for Trump, who faces an expected bruising battle against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Gabbard told The Post it was the kind of “distraction” she expects will increase as Election Day draws near. “The elitist, permanent Washington establishment, the military-industrial complex, the national security state, this whole cabal of the power elite are so terrified of President Trump winning this election that they will continue to do what they have been doing for years and throw everything they possibly can at it,” she said. “I know that Bobby Kennedy is focused, as I am, on saving our country,’’ Gabbard said. “President Trump is focused on his mission of saving our country, and none of us are going to allow any of these distractions to get in the way.”","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Robert F.

The luxury jewelry executive, 34, wore a low-cut, cropped camisole and paired that white top with tight-fitting, taupe-colored pants to match Pitt's look. The couple — who were first romantically linked in late 2022 — were also both spotted holding matching outerwear in their hands. Pitt had a taupe linen blazer in his hand. Additionally, he sported a flashy watch and a pair of aviator sunglasses with a gold frame.

The 60-year-old actor looked dapper in a cream button-down with the sleeves rolled up and a pair of khaki trousers with a bold, yellow plaid pattern and silver zipper details. The Wolfs star was pictured wrapping his arm around his girlfriend of nearly two years. At the event, he also posed for a snap alongside Courteney Cox, his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston's Friends costar. Their attendance at the benefit comes shortly after DailyMail.com exclusively learned that de Ramon has 'banned' her friends, family and even work contacts from talking about her and Pitt's relationship and even made then sign nondisclosure agreements to 'build trust.' Brad Pitt put on a cozy display with his girlfriend Ines de Ramon at Rock4EB benefit in Malibu, California on Saturday Read More EXCLUSIVE Brad Pitt's girlfriend Ines de Ramon 'BANS friends from talking about her' While their relationship has gotten more 'serious,' their ensembles have also been getting increasingly and concomitantly more complementary as they frequently wear coordinating looks. The luxury jewelry executive, 34, wore a low-cut, cropped camisole and paired that white top with tight-fitting, taupe-colored pants to match Pitt's look. The couple — who were first romantically linked in late 2022 — were also both spotted holding matching outerwear in their hands. Pitt had a taupe linen blazer in his hand. Additionally, he sported a flashy watch and a pair of aviator sunglasses with a gold frame. Meanwhile, de Ramon was carrying a chunky knit sweater in the same taupe color and a matching, leather purse.

On Sunday, Harris urged Trump to accept a proposal to debate on CNN on Oct. 23, as a follow-up to their Sept. 10 debate on ABC. “He should accept because I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people and to the voters to meet once more before Election Day,” Harris told supporters at a fundraiser in New York City. “We should have another debate,” she added. “My opponent is looking for a reason to avoid.” A representative for Trump’s campaign referred to the presidential candidate’s comments at a rally on Saturday when asked about Harris’ remarks. Speaking to supporters at a North Carolina rally on Saturday, Trump said: “The problem with another debate is that it’s just too late. Voting has already started.” Harris on Sunday acknowledged that early voting had started in some U.S. states but noted that it is a close contest with more than a month to go. “This race is as close as it could be. This is a margin of error race,” she said.","summary":"Speaking to supporters at a North Carolina rally on Saturday, Trump said: \"The problem with another debate is that it's just too late.

(AP) — Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat who was among those who met with Zelenskyy at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, said the president had a simple message: “Thank you. And we need more.” The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S. Zelenskyy’s visit kicked off a busy week in the United States as he works tirelessly to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since Sunday morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback. As Zelenskyy’s large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant in the afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit. “It’s unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it’s here, and it’s here to protect the world,” said Vera Kowal Krewson, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy’s motorcade. “And I strongly feel that way.” She said many of her friends’ parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy’s visit “a wonderful thing.” Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine’s defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead. “But they don’t understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine,” Salak said. ”It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don’t understand that.” The 155 mm shells made in the Scranton plant are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15 miles to 20 miles (24 kilometers to 32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be “at war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also joined the Ukrainian president. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict. —- Copp reported from Washington.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSCRANTON, Pa.

You sit at the piano, you get better at it with practice, and eventually you can just kinda do it in your sleep.” Let’s just hope he didn’t get too lost in the character, especially starring alongside Emmy, Golden Globe winner and noted method actor, Jeremy Strong. Written by Gabe Sherman, The Apprentice charts a young Donald Trump’s ascent to power through a Faustian deal with the influential right-wing lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn (Strong). The movie also stars Martin Donovan as Fred Trump Sr., and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump. After the film had its world premiere at Cannes Film Festival in May, where it received an 11-minute ovation, Trump’s campaign issued a cease-and-desist attempting to stop the film from screening in the US. But the letter appears to have been fruitless as the title went on to screen at Telluride Film Festival last month. The first trailer for the film dropped earlier this month, coinciding with Trump’s ABC News debate against his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs Sebastian Stan promotes his most controversial role yet, hopefully he’s getting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Sebastian Stan from &#8216;The Apprentice&#8217; reveals lack of sleep while portraying Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/sebastian-stan-from-the-apprentice-reveals-lack-of-sleep-while-portraying-donald-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-‘The-Apprentices-Sebastian-Stan-Says-He-Didnt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:41:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":257029894,"title":"Strictly Come Dancing 'suffers yet another devastating blow as scandal-plagued show's first live episode sees ratings plummet to lowest EVER'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 22nd 2024 10PM 13°C 1AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Now Angela Rayner hires £68,000-a-year 'vanity photographer': Deputy PM is the first to have taxpayer-funded staffer to burnish her image - as sleaze controversy grows Israel 'is probing whether it has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza airstrike', say reports: IDF 'cannot confirm or deny' taking out October 7 attack mastermind Rachel Reeves comes out fighting following union revolt over her 'cruel' cuts to winter fuel payments for 10million pensioners DAN HODGES: Starmer imagined he could be the new Tony Blair.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:23:37 BST, 22 September 2024 |Updated:23:40 BST, 22 September 2024 e-mail View comments Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, The Sun reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020. The show has found itself embroiled in controversy over how the professional dancers teach the celebs, with multiple accusations emerging of bullying and abusive behaviour. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed. A source told the publication that after bosses were fretting after already being 'worried' following the pre-recorded show losing nearly a million viewers on the previous year. Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, its been reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020 Saying: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show. 'They now face an anxious wait to see whether the drop in on-the-night viewers is made up for by an increase in fans watching Strictly on iPlayer, but those figures take days and weeks to compile. 'These live figures really matter to the Beeb, because Strictly is still seen as one of the few shows that provide the shared TV experience where people come together to watch a programme at a set time.' MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. The Strictly scandal erupted in January when actress Amanda Abbington accused her Strictly partner Giovanni Pernice of abuse after she unexpectedly quit the show just five weeks in. Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, a has made a series of accusations about Giovanni's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. Then, in July, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked from Strictly for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed A source said: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show' The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration. Shirley explained that the style was 'all in the posture' as she asked Motsi to help her illustrate the point. Read More Strictly fans convinced bosses purposely cutaway from Zara McDermott as she made her return to the BBC show after her 'distressing' training sessions with sacked pro Graziano DiPrima Anton Du Beke encouraged them as she shouted 'go on girls' - just as Shirley moved her head a certain way and accidentally locked lips with Motsi. Breaking her silence on the moment on Instagram on Sunday morning after the show Shirley joked: 'Sorry @motsimabuse you moved your head too soon! @bbcstrictly what did you think of last night's show?' Strictly returned for its 20th series as it shrugged off the bullying scandal with fan favourites Amy Dowden and Aljaz Škorjanec making their return. The BBC dancing show has been through a tough year after numerous previous contestants alleged abuse by professional dancers. Fans were delighted as Amy returned to the dancefloor for a stunning Waltz with her partner, JLS star JB. Meanwhile Aljaz performed an equally incredible routine with his partner Tasha Ghouri, as they stunned the judges with an upbeat Cha Cha. Surprisingly, one star spotted in the audience was Zara - who was at the heart of the scandal - as she turned up for the show to support her pal Pete Wicks. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration Amy, 34, made a glorious comeback and told host Claudia 'I'm so happy I could burst' after scoring an impressive 31 points on the dancefloor. The fan favourite performed a moving Waltz to When I Need You by Leo Sayer, leaving both judges and fans emotional. Overnight ratings for last week's show revealed that 5.5 million viewers tuned in to see a string of celebrities paired up with professional dancers compared to 6.2 million in 2023. The BBC dodged any mention of the show's string of scandals during its launch episode. Hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly excitedly introduced this year's celebrities and announced which dancers they would be paired with - but the controversies of the last year went unmentioned.

A source told the publication that after bosses were fretting after already being 'worried' following the pre-recorded show losing nearly a million viewers on the previous year. Strictly has reportledy been hit with yet another blow after it's first live episode of the latest series saw ratings plummet to it's lowest in the show's 20-year history. Following last week's pre-recorded launch, its been reported that Saturday's episode saw a peak of 6.7M viewers, down from 7.3M for the same episode last year and 10.2M in 2020 Saying: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show. 'They now face an anxious wait to see whether the drop in on-the-night viewers is made up for by an increase in fans watching Strictly on iPlayer, but those figures take days and weeks to compile. 'These live figures really matter to the Beeb, because Strictly is still seen as one of the few shows that provide the shared TV experience where people come together to watch a programme at a set time.' MailOnline have contacted BBC for comment. The Strictly scandal erupted in January when actress Amanda Abbington accused her Strictly partner Giovanni Pernice of abuse after she unexpectedly quit the show just five weeks in. Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, a has made a series of accusations about Giovanni's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. Then, in July, it emerged that Graziano Di Prima had been sacked from Strictly for 'kicking' his partner, Love Island star Zara McDermott. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night. All fifteen celebrities and their pro partners took to the dancefloor for the first live show following last weekend's launch, where the pairings were first revealed A source said: 'The fact that the first live show saw a drop too will be of concern to them — particularly if the drop continues into next week, which is the first elimination show' The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration. Shirley explained that the style was 'all in the posture' as she asked Motsi to help her illustrate the point. Read More Strictly fans convinced bosses purposely cutaway from Zara McDermott as she made her return to the BBC show after her 'distressing' training sessions with sacked pro Graziano DiPrima Anton Du Beke encouraged them as she shouted 'go on girls' - just as Shirley moved her head a certain way and accidentally locked lips with Motsi. Breaking her silence on the moment on Instagram on Sunday morning after the show Shirley joked: 'Sorry @motsimabuse you moved your head too soon! @bbcstrictly what did you think of last night's show?' Strictly returned for its 20th series as it shrugged off the bullying scandal with fan favourites Amy Dowden and Aljaz Škorjanec making their return. The BBC dancing show has been through a tough year after numerous previous contestants alleged abuse by professional dancers. Fans were delighted as Amy returned to the dancefloor for a stunning Waltz with her partner, JLS star JB. Meanwhile Aljaz performed an equally incredible routine with his partner Tasha Ghouri, as they stunned the judges with an upbeat Cha Cha. Surprisingly, one star spotted in the audience was Zara - who was at the heart of the scandal - as she turned up for the show to support her pal Pete Wicks. On Saturday judge Shirley Ballas apologised after shocking audiences by kissing fellow judge Motsi Mabuse during the first live show on Saturday night The dancing expert, 64, was giving advice to Olympic swimmer Tom Dean and his dance partner Nadiya Bychkova about their tango performance when she gave an impromptu demonstration Amy, 34, made a glorious comeback and told host Claudia 'I'm so happy I could burst' after scoring an impressive 31 points on the dancefloor. The fan favourite performed a moving Waltz to When I Need You by Leo Sayer, leaving both judges and fans emotional. Overnight ratings for last week's show revealed that 5.5 million viewers tuned in to see a string of celebrities paired up with professional dancers compared to 6.2 million in 2023. The BBC dodged any mention of the show's string of scandals during its launch episode. Hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly excitedly introduced this year's celebrities and announced which dancers they would be paired with - but the controversies of the last year went unmentioned.

A charity event that raises millions for the city’s unfortunate, the dinner has hosted the major-party rivals every four years (with just two exceptions) since 1960, when Richard Nixon dared to join John Kennedy, the first Catholic presidential nominee since Al Smith himself, on Catholic “turf.” The candidates are supposed to deliver light jabs at each other in their dueling addresses, which plainly can be written in advance — but the program apparently has too many risks of being called upon for spontaneous reactions for Harris to agree. The Democratic nominee has done vastly fewer non-Teleprompter events than any past major-party candidate; one of her allies claims Harris is just too busy — though that’s never stopped a sitting president from attending. Kamala says she will do the Smith dinner in the future — if she wins in November. (Is that a carrot or a stick?) As for those exceptions: One came in 1996, when the then-cardinal opted to invite neither nominee, presumably because President Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill that banned “abortions” of babies already partly out of the mother. That could be Harris’ concern now, since she and running-mate Tim Walz support unlimited abortion rights all the way through the ninth month of pregnancy. (Walz even signed a bill ensuring that babies born despite an attempted abortion would have no protections.) But more likely, it’s just her fear of having to be spontaneous: After all, she just bungled a friendly conversation with Oprah Winfrey, who’s endorsed her. That phobia must be pretty crippling: Harris has to know that the other exception came when Walter Mondale declined the invite in 1984 — and went on to lose 49 states in November.","summary":"It seems Kamala Harris is so afraid of having to be spontaneous in public that’s she’s skipping this year’s Al Smith dinner on Oct 17.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/opinion/the-obvious-pathetic-reason-kamala-harris-will-skip-the-al-smith-dinner/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-w2o0e6ps0-1727043772089.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727029433&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:39:43","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":257030004,"title":"Kennedy supporters in swing state could care less about sext scandal — and that’s good news for his candidate","text":"LAS VEGAS — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s supporters in the swing state of Nevada are nonplussed about his reported sexting scandal — and that’s good news for the presidential hopeful he’s backing, Donald Trump. Kennedy, 70, got top billing at a Trump-sponsored “Restore America” rally in Vegas on Saturday night, drawing a standing-room-only crowd who either didn’t care — or didn’t even know — about the bombshell allegation. “I’m not familiar with that particular issue. I am with a lot of issues, but that one’s new to me,” said local Ken Czech, who was wearing a “Kennedy 24” t-shirt, a nod to the Kennedy scion’s failed attempt to run for president in November on the independent ticket. Kennedy, 70, who is married to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, 59, was allegedly involved in a newly revealed, seamy sexting relationship with New York magazine’s star political scribe Olivia Nuzzi, 31. Czech said he is more interested in Kennedy’s efforts to help Trump form a “unity party.’’ Retired Las Vegas court reporter Christine Johnson said reports of the scandal meant little to her, too. “I support RFK, and whatever his headlines are, they are,” she said of the politician, who threw his support behind Trump after backing out of the race. “People are going to put their own spin on it.” Charles Atwood Hightower, a retired US army sergeant first class and a contractor, said those criticizing Kennedy’s private life should “drop dead. “Your personal life is your personal life,” Hightower said. “God gave you that right.’’ Retired Judge Charles Weinberg slammed the sexting story as a joke. “I mean, there’s so much propaganda and false information out now. I think this guy’s a legit guy,’’ he said of Kennedy. Lawyer Gregory Brittain of Redlands, Cali., said that if the married Kennedy was “coming on to someone else, that would be inappropriate.” But “no one is perfect, and least of all the Democrats on the other side who do this, who, I was saying, the real racists and the real sexists are the Democrats who, who so strongly profess right, maybe for women and for the minorities,’’ Brittain said. The event, moderated by race-car driving personality Danica Patrick at a Las Vegas rec center, was Kennedy’s first public appearance since the scandal broke last week. He did not address it at the event. But he did wear his wedding ring, while Hines reportedly ditched hers for at least part of her Italian vacation at the same time. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an ex-Democrat from Hawaii, appeared with Kennedy at the rally for Trump, who faces an expected bruising battle against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Gabbard told The Post it was the kind of “distraction” she expects will increase as Election Day draws near. “The elitist, permanent Washington establishment, the military-industrial complex, the national security state, this whole cabal of the power elite are so terrified of President Trump winning this election that they will continue to do what they have been doing for years and throw everything they possibly can at it,” she said. “I know that Bobby Kennedy is focused, as I am, on saving our country,’’ Gabbard said. “President Trump is focused on his mission of saving our country, and none of us are going to allow any of these distractions to get in the way.”","summary":"Robert F.

Homicides have dropped 17% in the period, building on the largest-ever drop in homicides in 2023, the White House said. It said data from the Gun Violence Archive showed that mass shootings were also down 20% to date in 2024 compared to a year earlier and would reach their lowest level this year since 2019. The FBI has conducted more than 300,000 enhanced background checks of individuals under 21 required under Biden’s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, signed into law in June 2022. It denied more than 3,500 of those transactions, with the enhanced background checks alone responsible for nearly 900 blocked sales, the White House said. Background checks for those convicted of domestic violence crimes have blocked more than 4,600 sales so far this year. Stefanie Feldman, who heads the new office, said the progress reflected a wide range of efforts, including dozens of executive actions since Biden took office, increased collaboration among federal agencies, closer work with state and local governments, and increased funding for enforcement of existing laws and mental health programs. She told Reuters that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 5 presidential election, would announce additional executive action soon. Feldman declined to provide any details but said the action involved some “wholly new ideas” and would take hard work to complete before Biden leaves office in January. Gun safety has been a big focus for Biden and Harris – both of whom are gun owners – since they took office in 2021. The U.S. surgeon general declared gun violence a public health crisis in June, calling for more research funding, better mental health access and other steps such as secure storage. Democrats largely favor stricter gun laws as a way to reduce deaths from gun violence, while Republicans generally oppose stricter laws, citing the right to bear arms established in the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. Despite partisan divisions, Feldman said her office had worked well with Republican state and local elected officials, and 17 states had passed legislation to address gun violence. The office was also working with non-elected officials, including healthcare providers and executives, law enforcement and community leaders, some of whom might identify as Republican but shared a commitment to reduce gun violence. “The further away you get from Washington, the less political this issue actually is,” she said. “Everyone wants their kid to come home from school safely. Everyone wants their kid to be able to go play in the neighborhood and be safe.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Enhanced background checks have blocked thousands of gun sales to people under the age of 21 and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes in the past year, the White House said on Sunday, a year after President Joe Biden set up a new office to accelerate work on preventing gun violence.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/22/breaking-news/white-house-background-checks-blocked-gun-sales-to-youth-domestic-abusers/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-22T090800Z_1_LYNXMPEK8L031_RTROPTP_3_USA-BIDEN-GUNCONTROL.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:33:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":257031980,"title":"Janet Jackson Is Sorry!

While 58 percent of registered voters think the threat of political violence will be greater under Trump if he is elected, 21 percent say it will fall, a poll from CBS News released Sunday reveals. Another 21 percent say there will be no change. Just over 40 percent of registered voters say the threat of political violence will be greater if current Vice President Kamala Harris is elected, while 27 percent say it will decrease and 30 percent expect it to stay the same, according to the poll. Roughly 83 percent of Harris voters believe the threat of political violence will be greater under the former president, while 63 percent of Trump voters say it will rise under the vice president if she wins. The poll comes as GOP leaders blame Democratic rhetoric for the two assassination attempts against Trump this summer. Last week, Republican vice president nominee Senator JD Vance said that the lack of assassination attempts against Harris are evidence that Democratic rhetoric is fueling violence against Trump. “No one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months,” Vance said at a Faith and Freedom Coalition event. “I think that’s pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down the rhetoric or somebody is going to get hurt.” Trump has similarly blamed Harris for the attempts on his life. “The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate...has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust,” he wrote on Truth Social. Others, such Trump’s attorney Alina Habba, have blamed President Joe Biden as well. “No president in this country, and I mean, no president, Republican or Democrat should be in this situation, not once, but twice,” Habba told Fox News on Friday. “It’s an embarrassment to our country. It’s an embarrassment to President Trump,” she continued. “It’s an embarrassment frankly, to Harris and Biden, because they’re the ones in charge right now, and denying assets to a president and future, frankly, future president and the candidate that’s doing the best right now is a serious concern of mine.” Harris and Biden have both denounced political violence, with the president even noting the Secret Service needs additional resources as Trump faces threats to his life. “Thank God the president is okay,” Biden said last week. “But one thing I want to make clear: the Service needs more help.” The first attempt on Trump’s life came in July, when Thomas Crooks opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks, 20, shot Trump in the ear. He killed one attendee and injured two others. Then, last weekend, officers arrested Ryan Wesley Routh for allegedly aiming an SKS-style rifle through the bushes at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while the former president was playing a round.","summary":"Donald Trump and JD Vance have both blamed threats to the former president’s life on Democratic rhetoric","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-kamala-harris-political-violence-poll-b2617126.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/21/04/trump-harris.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jobnTLVd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:23:27","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":257029020,"title":"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine Shows Gratitude to Pennsylvania Ammunition Factory Employees with a Visita","text":"SCRANTON, Pa. – Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat who was among those who met with Zelenskyy at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, said the president had a simple message: “Thank you. And we need more.” The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S. Zelenskyy’s visit kicked off a busy week in the United States as he works tirelessly to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since Sunday morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback. As Zelenskyy’s large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant in the afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit. “It’s unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it’s here, and it’s here to protect the world,” said Vera Kowal Krewson, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy’s motorcade. “And I strongly feel that way.” She said many of her friends’ parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy’s visit “a wonderful thing.” Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine’s defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead. “But they don’t understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine,” Salak said. ”It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don’t understand that.” The 155 mm shells made in the Scranton plant are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15 miles to 20 miles (24 kilometers to 32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be “at war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict. —- Copp reported from Washington.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSCRANTON, Pa. – Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: President Zelenskyy of Ukraine Shows Gratitude to Pennsylvania Ammunition Factory Employees with a Visita first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-shows-gratitude-to-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-employees-with-a-visita/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Ukrainian-President-Zelenskyy-visits-Pennsylvania-ammunition-factory.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:18:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":257031498,"title":"Adam Scott to Appear in Michigan as Part of Kamala Harris Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour","text":"Adam Scott has a busy Monday planned in a battleground state.

Per intel, he will appear in Ann Arbor as part of the Fighting for Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour during an event with the state’s Lieutenant Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II to address supporters and volunteers on the University of Michigan campus. Scott will then segue to headlining a student organizing event off-campus. The bus tour, which kicked off in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 3, has been cruising through key states like Michigan, where stops include Madison Heights, Flint, Ann Arbor, Lansing, Grand Rapids and Marquette. According to the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign, each stop will “emphasize the stark contrast between Vice President Harris and Gov.Walz, who will restore the protections of Roe v. Wade when Congress passes a bill to do so, and Donald Trump and JD Vance, who will enact their dangerous Project 2025 agenda to ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control, force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions and jeopardize access to IVF.” The cast of Scandal — Kerry Washington, Tony Goldwyn, Guillermo Díaz, Bellamy Young, Katie Lowes, Dan Bucatinsky, Scott Foley, Portia de Rossi, George Newbern, Jeff Perry and Cornelius Smith Jr. — participated in a stop on the tour on Sunday at a canvass launch in Madison Heights. Scott has been an advocate for reproductive rights for some time. In June, he teamed with Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, for a conversation with male allies about “the vital importance of women’s reproductive rights.” In an Instagram post, the actor said, “We need to stand with women to restore and protect their access to fundamental health care.” He served on the host committee for the Center for Reproductive Rights’ Los Angeles benefit in March and previously participated in a video campaign for the organization in 2020.","summary":"Adam Scott has a busy Monday planned in a battleground state.

Chris Christie appeared as part of the political panel on ABC’s This Week on Sunday where the former New Jersey governor explained that Trump “needs” another go at debating Democratic rival Kamala Harris given her successful performance against him at the September presidential debate in Philadelphia. Harris has already accepted the October 23 debate proposal, while Trump has said it is “too late” for another match-up. Christie, who helped prep Trump for the debates in 2020, said the former president’s polling is why he will eventually agree, as it was trending “away” from the former president’s favor and risked showing him sliding into a firm second place if trends were not corrected in the weeks ahead. “[T]hese debate decisions, George, are tactical, they’re not philosophical. They’re tactical,” Christie told host George Stephanopoulos. “And if the polls continue to move a bit away from Trump, you know how much he focuses on that. And he’s going to need something to change it and in today’s media landscape, absent a big mistake by one or the other, this is the only way.” Christie added that Trump would “convince himself” of his ability to deliver a knockout performance against Harris in a debate, even after missing that chance already. “He will convince himself that if she gets in the ring with him again, that he’ll knock her out. That will be his mindset,” Christie said. “Now, whether he’ll do the work that’s gonna be necessary to be prepared which he clearly did not do the last time is a completely open question. But I’ll say this, he needs it.” Christie added: “I think he’ll eventually capitulate.” Trump has not put out a statement at any length addressing the CNN invitation, but at a rally in North Carolina on Saturday appeared to dismiss the proposed debate as “too late” in the election season. Polling and other metrics have shown Harris taking a clear grasp of the race’s momentum in the wake of her September 10 showdown with Trump in Pennsylvania as well as generally since the beginning of her campaign for president in July. On Friday, that trend was underscored once more by the posting of August’s fundraising numbers; Harris’s campaign blew past her opponent’s for the second straight month. On Sunday, the release of a new NBC News national poll outlined how the race has shifted dramatically since President Joe Biden stepped aside as the Democratic nominee. In the first survey from this pollster since Biden’s announcement, Harris has rebuilt her party’s standing and now leads her opponent by five percentage points, buoyed by her soaring favorability ratings. Harris’s campaign is still calling the race a dead heat and encouraging supporters view it the same way. Campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon attacked Trump for his apparent refusal to accept the CNN debate stage in a statement on Saturday. “It would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election debate. Debates offer a unique chance for voters to see the candidates side by side and take stock of their competing visions for America,” she said. “Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump, and she has accepted CNN’s invitation to a debate on October 23. Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings,” O’Malley Dillon continued. “We look forward to Vice President Harris again having the opportunity in the CNN debate to show her command of the issues and why it’s time to turn the page on Donald Trump and chart a new way forward for America.”","summary":"Harris campaign says having just one debate between final candidates would be ‘unprecedented’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-second-debate-chris-christie-b2617136.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/22/22/christie_abc_sept2024.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:12:02","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":257028908,"title":"National security chiefs on letter backing Kamala Harris include many who signed infamous Hunter Biden doc","text":"Nine high-ranking former national security and military officials who signed a letter Sunday endorsing Vice President Harris’ run for the Oval Office also signed a letter nearly four years ago dismissing Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop as Russian disinformation ahead of the 2020 election, Fox News Digital found. A group called the National Security Leaders for America, which bills itself as a bipartisan group of former senior military and national security leaders, published a letter Sunday endorsing Harris for the White House. A total of 741 former high-ranking national security officials signed the letter. Fox News Digital pored through the list of signatories and found nine of the former national security chiefs who endorsed Harris also signed a letter in 2020 discounting Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation – before media outlets authenticated the laptop after the 2020 election and the FBI ultimately cited the laptop as legitimate in Hunter Biden’s criminal trial earlier this year. The signatories who signed both the 2020 letter and the endorsement of Harris include: former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper; former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden; former CIA Director Leon E. Panetta; former CIA Director John Brennan; former Acting CIA Director John E. McLaughlin; former CIA chief of staff Laurence M. Pfeiffer; former Department of Defense chief of staff Jeremy Bash; CIA chief of station John Sipher; and former National Intelligence Council Chair Gregory Frye Treverton. TRUMP CIA CHIEF KNEW ABOUT INFAMOUS LETTER DISMISSING BIDEN LAPTOP AS PROPAGANDA BEFORE PUBLICATION: REPORT Ahead of the 2020 election, the New York Post published a bombshell report on the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop. HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP RE-EMERGES AS MEDIA EMBARRASSMENT AS IT BECOMES KEY EVIDENCE AT GUN TRIAL Fifty-one former intelligence officials, however, soon after released a statement on Oct. 19, 2020, discounting the laptop as having \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\" in a bid to discredit the New York Post’s report at the time. The laptop came into public view after the first son left it at a Delaware repair shop ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The former military chiefs' 2020 letter played a key role in many media outlets turning their backs on reporting on the laptop as legitimate, as well as providing President Biden with political ammunition to downplay the laptop during his debate against former President Trump during the last election cycle. Liberal media outlets, however, changed their tune in 2022 after newspapers such as the Washington Post and New York Times authenticated thousands of his emails on the laptop. The laptop also re-emerged this year when the first son faced a criminal trial in Delaware over his purchase of a firearm in 2018 while he was reeling from a crack cocaine addiction. The trial, which found Hunter guilty on all counts, formally entered the laptop into evidence and was confirmed by the FBI as legitimate. FLASHBACK: MSNBC, CNN, CBS TOLD VIEWERS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION VIDEO GOES VIRAL OF DEMOCRATS, MEDIA MEMBERS DOUBTING HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP The former chiefs' 2020 letter made headlines again this year when a joint report released by three House panels alleged that active CIA contractors \"coordinated\" with the 2020 Biden campaign just weeks ahead of that year’s election \"to discredit serious allegations about Biden family influence peddling\" connected to Hunter’s laptop when the 51 former intelligence officials released a statement dismissing the laptop. Fast-forward to Sunday and the 2024 election, the letter endorsing Harris and signed by hundreds of former national security leaders, including nine from the 2020 letter, lauded her as \"prepared and strategic\" while slamming Trump as \"impulsive and ill-informed.\" 5 TAKES ON THE HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP THAT HAVE AGED POORLY \"We are former public servants who swore an oath to the Constitution. Many of us risked our lives for it. We are retired generals, admirals, senior noncommissioned officers, ambassadors, and senior civilian national security leaders. We are Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. We are loyal to the ideals of our nation—like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law—not to any one individual or party,\" the letter published Sunday endorsing Harris reads. \"We do not agree on everything, but we all adhere to two fundamental principles. First, we believe America’s national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-Chief. Second, we believe American democracy is invaluable.

Trump, 78, made the comments during an interview with former CBS News journalist Sharyl Attkisson published on Sunday. “If you’re not successful this time, do you see yourself running again in four years?” she asked the Republican nominee. Trump stated, “No, I don’t. I think that that will be—that will be it. I don’t see that at all.” “I think that hopefully we’re going to be successful,” he said of the 2024 General Election, about a month and a half away. In the wide-ranging interview with Attkisson, Trump was also asked about a number of issues, including the economy, inflation, illegal immigration, and the two recent assassination attempts against him. When asked about his plan to deal with inflation, Trump said, “They come down with energy and they come down with interest rates. We’re going to get, as I told you, we’re going to get energy down by 50 percent in 12 months.” “I’m not just talking about cars. I’m talking about air conditioning, heating, your basic energy, operating a bakery, operating any kind of a business—it’s all having to do with energy,” he added. Trump also spoke separately to Fox News’s Brian Kilmeade Saturday about whether he’s concerned with his family’s security in light of the two assassination attempts. “I do. I do. I don’t talk about it, but I do. I have to worry about family. I have to worry about everybody. I worry about you,” he responded. Trump then pivoted to illegal immigration, suggesting that millions of people, including convicted criminals, who have come into the United States in recent years have made the country a more dangerous place to live. He made similar, immigration-related comments in his interview with Attkisson. The former president in the two interviews provided few details about the two assassination attempts, the most recent of which occurred on Sept. 15 while he was golfing at his Florida golf course. In July, Trump narrowly escaped death and was shot in the ear when a 20-year-old shooter fired at a rally while the former president was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI is investigating both incidents as assassination attempts against the former president. There have not been any reports indicating that members of Trump’s family have been targeted in similar incidents. Ryan Routh, the suspect who allegedly tried to assassinate Trump in Florida, is scheduled to make his second court appearance at a federal court on Sept. 23. Prosecutors charged him with firearms-related charges, but he’s likely to face more in connection with the apparent assassination attempt. While Trump was golfing at his West Palm Beach course a week ago, a Secret Service agent spotted a gun barrel sticking through a perimeter fence before shots were fired at Routh, who allegedly fled the scene and was captured on Interstate 95 in one county away. The FBI and prosecutors say an SKS-style rifle with a scope, backpacks, food, and a camera were recovered at the site. Routh, 58, is believed to have been camped at the golf course perimeter for 12 hours, according to prosecutors, citing his cellphone data. Authorities have not publicly commented on a motive. Numerous social media posts indicate that Routh was an ardent backer of Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and had made critical comments about Trump. In the Pennsylvania shooting, Thomas Matthew Crooks was identified as the shooter. He was shot and killed soon after opening fire at the former president.","summary":"'I don't see that at all,' he said.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-says-he-wont-run-again-in-2028-if-hes-not-successful-in-2024-post-5728225","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/16/id5725006-Donald-Trump-13_JF_09132024-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:08:50","author":"Jack Phillips","authors":["Jack Phillips"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":257028566,"title":"Elon Musk will take ‘anyone’ to Mars – but not if Kamala Harris becomes US president, he says","text":"Elon Musk has vowed to get “anyone who wants to be a space traveller” to Mars – but not if Kamala Harris becomes US president.

Earlier in the day, Harris’ campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23. It would have been the candidates’ second debate, after a September 10 encounter that most pundits said she had won. “The American people deserve another opportunity to see United States (US) Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots,” her campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. “I hope (Trump) will join me,” Harris posted on X. Trump claimed during a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina that he would like to debate – calling it “good entertainment value” – but the start of early voting in some states had taken the air out of the idea. “It’s just too late, voting has already started,” he said. He added, to a large and enthusiastic crowd of supporters, that while CNN had been “very fair” when he debated President Joe Biden in June, “they won’t be fair again.” Harris replaced her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket after the 81-year-old Biden’s disastrous performance against Trump. His exit from the race left Trump, 78, now the oldest ever presidential nominee, against a much younger Harris, 59. Saturday’s announcement came as some states have already begun early voting in what is an agonisingly close race. The result is expected to hinge on seven battleground states, including North Carolina. Trump addressed the crowd in the port city of Wilmington from behind bulletproof glass, following an apparent second assassination attempt against him. A gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida last Sunday, with security agents foiling any plan to harm the former president.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-refuses-harris-call-for-october-debate-2/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/page-28-a_23092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 22:04:50","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":257029048,"title":"Melania Trump's social media campaign is in full swing.

When the pop star was asked about her thoughts on Americans voting for the first Black female presidential nominee, Jackson said of Harris, “She’s not black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian. “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.” Harris’ parents were both immigrants, with her father being born in Jamaica and her mother in India. Jackson was then asked if the US was ready to have Harris, 59, in the Oval Office over Republican opponent and former president Donald Trump. “I don’t know,” the five-time Grammy winner responded. “Honestly, I don’t want to answer that because I really, truthfully, don’t know. I think either way it goes is going to be mayhem.” The “Nasty” singer was swiftly criticized on social media for her comments. “This is why she’s irrelevant and leeching off of her brothers’ success,” one person wrote on X, referring to Janet’s late brother Michael Jackson. “I have always been a fan of Janet Jackson but this just no. Stop,” another chimed in. Several others pointed out how Michael’s skin tone became lighter in the early 1990s, which he claimed was due to vitiligo. Per Mayo Clinic, vitiligo is a condition that leads to color loss in the skin. “Janet, you know better than to believe that nonsense … especially after all the race controversies Michael went through,” another critic added. Others compared the music icon’s controversial comments to Trump’s false claims that Harris changed her race. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the “Apprentice” alum, 78, said in July while speaking at the National Association for Black Journalists. “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.”","summary":"\"Janet remains committed to fostering unity, inclusion, and understanding and is grateful for the opportunity to clarify her stance,\" the singer's statement read in part.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/22/celebrity-news/janet-jackson-apologizes-for-questioning-kamala-harris-race/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/90222001.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 21:47:03","author":"Vanessa Serna","authors":["Vanessa Serna"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":257027370,"title":"Janet Jackson issues unexpected statement following her statement about Kamala Harris not being black.","text":"Janet Jackson admitted her claims that Kamala Harris is not black and has a white father were ‘based on misinformation.’ Jackson, 58, sent shockwaves through social media when she confessed her controversial views about the Democratic 2024 presidential nominee to The Guardian.

Mo Elmasri, Jackson’s manager, tried to clear the air by saying Jackson was misinformed on the matter. She told Buzzfeed: ‘She deeply respects Vice President Kamala Harris and her accomplishments as a Black and Indian woman. ‘Janet apologizes for any confusion caused and acknowledges the importance of accurate representation in public discourse.’ She ended off the statement by saying that her and Jackson are ‘committed to promoting unity.’ But this attempt to save her image did not go over well with everyone. One X user posted: ‘Janet Jackson sounded an absolute fool in that interview and I am very disappointed.’ ‘We are less than 50 days away from the election. We gotta talk smarter!’ Another user posted on X: ‘Janet Jackson is one of the most influential people in music history. It was simply irresponsible of her to repeat something she “heard” regarding the very thing that they use against Kamala! Her own race. Harris, 59, was born in 1964 to Dr Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian-born cancer researcher, and Donald J. Harris, a black Jamaican economics professor. The couple wed in 1963 and separated in 1971, after welcoming Kamala and her younger sister Maya, 57. Gopalan died of cancer in 2009 aged 70, while Donald Harris, 86, is now a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University after retiring in 1998. Jackson’s late brother Michael faced controversy about his skin after it changed color from black to white over the course of his career. He blamed a medical condition called vitiligo and denied bleaching his skin. Trump claimed Harris ‘happened to turn black’ while addressing a the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention in Chicago in July. He said: ‘She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. ‘I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. ‘So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black? ‘I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a black person. I think somebody should look into that too.’ Harris shrugged off the remarks days later accusing Trump of ‘the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect.’ She added: ‘The American people deserve better.’ The vice president has yet to comment on Jackson’s remarks about her race. Trump’s comments on Harris race outraged many conservatives, with even his own supporters said to be annoyed at the former president for not focusing on attacks on Harris’ policies. Earlier this month, Trump appeared to double down on his comments about Harris’ race. ‘I don’t care what she is. I don’t care. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.’ Polls show that the race between Trump and Harris remains on a knife edge ahead of election day on Tuesday November 5.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJanet Jackson admitted her claims that Kamala Harris is not black and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson issues unexpected statement following her statement about Kamala Harris not being black. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/janet-jackson-issues-unexpected-statement-following-her-statement-about-kamala-harris-not-being-black/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Janet-Jackson-releases-surprise-new-statement-after.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 21:41:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":257027016,"title":"Republicans in swing states worry that they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for Trump: ‘I haven’t seen anybody’","text":"Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party’s presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations. Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk. It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group’s canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week. “I haven’t seen anybody,” said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. “Nobody’s given me a heads-up that they’re around in Oakland County areas.” Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation’s value. Trump’s campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them. The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the GOP began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader. Michigan’s Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states. Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with “America,” they were working an area that Reckling’s own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said. “They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,” Reckling said. “From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations.” But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare. “I don’t know what the PACs are doing,” said Mark Forton, the GOP chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. “I don’t know if they are going door to door.” Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing. Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group. Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of “the resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.” “We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it’s what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups’ efforts have helped reach them,” Blair said. America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ failed presidential campaign. Trump’s team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed. Part of the reason for the campaign’s move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate’s campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations. Harris’ outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign. The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump’s campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris’ campaign has outspent Trump’s on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024. America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group’s dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions. A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move. Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it. Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa. In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.","summary":"Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party’s presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations.

What’s next?","text":"Last week, Maine launched a big home energy rebate program with funds from the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the first of two long-awaited projects funded by the huge 2022 climate law, coming as the Biden administration works to speed this kind of money out the door ahead of the election. Maine’s new $36 million home energy rebate program will fund efficient electric heat pumps and other electrification projects to help reduce emissions and cut fuel costs for low-income households, with an initial focus on manufactured homes and multifamily buildings. The program is slated to expand to moderate-income families next year. It adds to Efficiency Maine’s existing electrification rebates, available in different amounts to Mainers at all income levels, along with existing federal tax credits for certain retrofits. Phase two of Maine’s IRA implementation will come with another $36 million and focus on home efficiency upgrades. Those rebates are slated to launch sometime next year. This reporter wrote late last year, for Energy News Network, about Maine’s nascent plans for its shares of IRA funding. As part of the federal Justice40 initiative, the law required 40% of funds to benefit disadvantaged communities – hence Maine’s focus on low-income families, especially those in multifamily housing. Kristin Eberhard, the senior director of state and local policy with the electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, said at the time that this money would be “transformative (for) those harder-to-reach households,” especially where it can cover 100% of the costs. This new rebate program will expand what MaineHousing and community action agencies already offer in that vein, particularly to households that receive other forms of government assistance. We saw examples of this in our series Hooked on Heating Oil – and examined gaps in getting aid out the door. The new IRA funding could fill some of those gaps, but bandwidth for actually using the money at the local level may remain a challenge. Local advocates are trying all kinds of ways to more quickly connect people with the right resources and funds for decarbonizing their homes and cutting costs in the process. The pace of that spending, and the complexity of determining when IRA funds are technically spent, also raises some big political challenges. On the Democratic side of the ticket, recall that Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in Congress to pass the IRA just over two years ago. She’s touted it on the campaign trail, particularly as it relates to job creation. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to claw back any “unspent” funds from the IRA, which he has called a “scam,” if he’s reelected in November – though the law is heavily benefitting red states and has been popular with conservative business groups. To repeal the IRA, Trump would need to go through Congress, where even some Republicans have called for parts of the law to stay on the books. Writing in The Hill last month, Trump’s former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Neil Chatterjee called a full repeal unlikely. But as Alex Brown wrote for Stateline this week, it’s not the only way a new Trump administration could snarl the rollout of further IRA funding, potentially creating market uncertainty with ripple effects for the pace of an energy transition that experts agree is badly needed to slow the effects of climate change. So the Biden administration is feeling the pressure this fall to roll out billions in federal climate and infrastructure funds – including through state rebate programs like the one Maine launched this week.

Nebraska and Maine are the only states that split their electoral votes by congressional district, and both have done so in recent presidential elections. In Nebraska, which is solidly Republican, that means one of the state’s five votes is competitive for Democrats. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., met recently with GOP lawmakers in the state to encourage them to make a change supported by the state’s all-Republican congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Jim Pillen. The change was discussed earlier this year but lacked the votes to pass. Now, with Trump in an extremely close race against Democrat Kamala Harris where every electoral vote matters, his allies are making another push. “To my friends in Nebraska, that one electoral vote could be the difference between Harris being president and not, and she’s a disaster for Nebraska and the world,” Graham said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Trump’s allies have been calling on Nebraska Republicans for months to make a switch despite a lack of necessary support in the state legislature. But there’s new urgency to their push with fewer than 50 days until the election and Trump and Harris locked in a tight race across several battlegrounds. There is a plausible scenario where the election ends up being decided by the voters in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, a swing district in the Omaha area. This year, if Harris wins the three so-called blue wall battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania while Trump wins the four Sun Belt battlegrounds of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, the result would be a 269-268 split in the Electoral College in favor of Harris. Nebraska’s 2nd District, which went for President Joe Biden four years ago, could give Harris the decisive 270th electoral vote. Or, if Trump were to win, the election would end in a 269-269 tie. In that scenario, the president would be chosen by the House of Representatives, with each state’s delegation getting a single vote — a scenario that favors the former president. The five Republicans who represent Nebraska in Congress urged their colleagues in the state to change the law in a letter dated Wednesday, saying “the state should speak with a united voice in presidential elections.” Any legislative change would require Pillen, the governor, to call lawmakers into a special session. He said in a statement he would “enthusiastically” do so if he gets a “clear and public indication” that there are 33 votes in favor, the minimum necessary to pass in Nebraska’s single legislative chamber. Nebraska Democrats have started showing support for the state’s electoral vote split with yard signs showing a blue dot on a white background, symbolizing their potential role of the metro Omaha district as an island of blue surrounded by Republican red in the rest of Nebraska. Republicans currently control 33 seats in the Legislature but they are not united in support. One of those Republicans, state Sen. Mike McDonald, recently switched parties but still represents a district that includes Democrats who could punish him for backing an Electoral College switch. The system has long confounded Republicans, who have been unable to force the state into a winner-take-all system since Barack Obama became the first presidential contender to shave off one of the state’s five electoral votes in 2008. Biden in 2020 was the only other Democrat to capture Nebraska’s 2nd District electoral vote.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA top Donald Trump ally is pressuring Nebraska Republicans to award all&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supporters of Trump try again to alter Nebraska&#8217;s law about the Electoral College first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/supporters-of-trump-try-again-to-alter-nebraskas-law-about-the-electoral-college/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/U455LZKFOJAVVH47LHVZGNYLTU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 21:35:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":257026506,"title":"Republicans in swing states worry that they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for Trump: ‘I haven’t seen anybody’","text":"Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party’s presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations. Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk. It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group’s canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week. “I haven’t seen anybody,” said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. “Nobody’s given me a heads-up that they’re around in Oakland County areas.” Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation’s value. Trump’s campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them. The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the GOP began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader. Michigan’s Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states. Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with “America,” they were working an area that Reckling’s own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said. “They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,” Reckling said. “From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations.” But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare. “I don’t know what the PACs are doing,” said Mark Forton, the GOP chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. “I don’t know if they are going door to door.” Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing. Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group. Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of “the resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.” “We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it’s what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups’ efforts have helped reach them,” Blair said. America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ failed presidential campaign. Trump’s team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed. Part of the reason for the campaign’s move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate’s campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations. Harris’ outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign. The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump’s campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris’ campaign has outspent Trump’s on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024. America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group’s dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions. A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move. Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it. Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa. In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.","summary":"Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/republicans-in-swing-states-worry-that-they-see-scant-signs-of-groups-door-knocking-for-trump-i-havent-seen-anybody/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-7rtbxg0js-1727039069227.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727024692&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CjuXUUuj-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 21:34:43","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":257027644,"title":"Trump won’t run again if he loses, ‘that will be it’","text":"Republican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the US presidency if he loses the November 5 election, saying “that will be it”. Asked if he saw himself running again in four years if he is not successful in his third consecutive bid for the White House, the 78-year-old former president told Sharyl Attkisson’s Full Measure program on Sunday: “No I don’t. I think that will be — that will be it. I don’t see that at all. Hopefully, we will be successful.” Trump faces a tight race against Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris, with polls showing the two neck-and-neck in key battleground states that are likely to be decisive in determining the winner, even as Harris has begun to edge up in nationwide polls. Trump launched his first reelection bid for the 2020 election the same day he was inaugurated in 2017 and announced his latest White House bid two years ago in November 2022. Trump has continued to falsely blame his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden on widespread voter fraud and faces federal and state criminal charges over efforts to overturn the election results. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast his indictments as a political attack against him while embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric if he were to lose in 2024. He has also launched a number of businesses ventures amid his latest campaign, including Trump Media, NFTs, and Trump branded sneakers, coins and crypto. Harris, 59, meanwhile, has cast the race as a critical moment for US democracy even as she seeks to focus on kitchen-table issues such as costs for families and housing. Asked whether the four year break helped him regroup and figure out who he could trust as allies, Trump said: “It would have been easier if I did it … contiguous.” “But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were,” he added. Trump, who spoke with Attkisson at his Florida resort, also said it was “too early” to make deals with people for any position in his White House cabinet should he win in November.","summary":"Republican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the US presidency if he loses the November 5 election, saying &#8220;that will be it&#8221;.
